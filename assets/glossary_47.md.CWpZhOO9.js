It stars Branagh as playwright William Shakespeare. The film takes its title from an alternative name for Shakespeare's play Henry VIII. Plot After the Globe Theatre burns down in 1613 during a performance of Shakespeare's play Henry VIII, William Shakespeare, aged 49, returns home to Stratford to rejoin his wife, Anne Hathaway. Shakespeare and Anne have a distant relationship, as he has spent most of their marriage working in London, and she is a down-to-earth country woman who cannot write. Their marriage has never recovered from the death of their son Hamnet, aged 11, in a plague outbreak in Stratford while his father was in London. Although they also have two daughters, Shakespeare regarded Hamnet as his favorite child, especially because of the poems which the child wrote before his death. Shakespeare devotes his time to tending to the family garden, although in spite of his hard work he is not very successful. The Shakespeares' eldest daughter Susanna is married to a doctor named John Hall, who is a prominent Puritan in town. Susanna is forced to stifle her independence and her own personality to live by her husband's moral codes. Susanna is falsely accused of committing adultery, and faces a public trial. Shakespeare manages to terrify her accuser by claiming that he knows an African actor who was once in love with Susanna, and the actor would kill anyone who ruined her good name. As a result, the accuser recants his testimony and Susanna is found innocent. Anne is impressed by her husband's actions, especially as she knows that he was lying: the African actor was a gentle person who would never harm anyone. Shakespeare's youngest daughter, Judith (Hamnet's twin), is outspoken in her doubts about the role of women in Jacobean England. She has not been allowed to have an education or opportunities in life, because it is expected she will marry and provide children. As a result, Judith has refused to marry, and is bitter at her father for not loving her as much as her dead brother. One night during an argument, Judith confesses to Shakespeare that she actually wrote the poems, not her brother. They were written in Hamnet's handwriting because Judith is illiterate, and thus had to dictate them to her brother. Anne agrees that Hamnet was not especially intelligent, and that they have hidden this from Shakespeare so he would be able to keep his fond memories. The Shakespeares receive a visit from the Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare's former literary patron, to whom he wrote his 154 sonnets. This upsets Anne; she is aware of rumors that her husband and Southampton were lovers. While drinking with Southampton, Shakespeare recites his Sonnet 29, expressing his feelings for Southampton and hoping that Southampton felt the same way about him. Southampton cuts off the conversation, and seems uncomfortable, but as he leaves he also recites Sonnet 29, indicating to Shakespeare that he did have feelings for him. After some time at home, Shakespeare and Anne grow closer and develop a mature relationship. Anne ultimately allows her husband to sleep with her in the family's second-best bed (the best bed is reserved for guests). Having fallen back in love with Anne, Shakespeare amends his last will and testament to make sure that she will receive this bed. Now that the truth has been told about the poems, Judith also develops a warmer relationship with her father. She agrees to marry a local man, Thomas Quiney, who has been her suitor for some time. However Quiney's reputation is damaged when his former sweetheart gives birth to his illegitimate child, and the baby dies during labor. Judith becomes pregnant to Quiney, much to Shakespeare's delight. While researching, Shakespeare discovers that there was no notable plague outbreak in 1596, the year that Hamnet died. He becomes suspicious and questions his family. Anne tries to convince him that Hamnet died of plague, but Judith confesses the truth. One day as a child, Judith told her brother that she was going to reveal the truth to their father, that Hamnet did not write the poems. That night, Hamnet went missing. He was found in a nearby lake, having drowned, with the copies of the poems in the water with him. Hamnet never went in the lake, and so Anne and Judith suspect he committed suicide. The women covered it up, and told everyone that the boy had died of plague. Although it is an emotional revelation, the truth allows Shakespeare to finally come to terms with his son's death, and to accept a more honest memory of the boy. In April 1616, Shakespeare's fellow playwright Ben Jonson visits him and they reminisce about their lives. On the 23rd of April, Shakespeare's fifty-second birthday, he is feeling unwell. His wife and daughters gather to present him with a surprise. Susanna has been teaching Anne and Judith how to read and write. Susanna has found the Shakespeares' marriage certificate, and Anne finally signs her name, where previously she had only been able to sign with an \\"X\\". Shakespeare dies that day. At his funeral, the three women recite the song \\"Fear No More\\" from Shakespeare's play Cymbeline. They are now all able to read.

The , 31-story building was completed in 1899 to designs by R. H. Robertson, a pioneer in steel skyscraper design, and engineered by the firm of Nathaniel Roberts. The Park Row Building includes 26 full floors, a partial 27th floor, and a pair of four-story cupolas. The architectural detail on the facade includes large columns and pilasters; numerous ornamental overhanging balconies; and other ornamentation sculpted by J. Massey Rhind. The Park Row Building was developed by the Park Row Construction Company as an office building, utilizing a steel frame and elevators to make it one of the world's tallest buildings at the time. It was constructed over a period of two years and nine months. Upon completion, about 4,000 people worked at the Park Row Building, with tenants such as the Associated Press and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. Until the completion of the Singer Building in 1908, it was the city's tallest building overall and the world's tallest office building. The Park Row Building was used as an office structure until the early 2000s, when it was converted to residential use. Upon its completion, the Park Row Building received praise from the general public. However, because there were few comparable skyscrapers, architectural critics reviewed the building more harshly. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission gave city landmark status to the Park Row Building in 1999, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Site The Park Row Building is in the Financial District of Manhattan, just south of New York City Hall, City Hall Park, and the Civic Center. Its primary address is 15 Park Row, but its other addresses include 13‚Äì21 Park Row, 13 Ann Street, and 3 Theatre Alley. The Park Row Building is bounded on the west by Park Row, on the south by Ann Street, and on the east by Theatre Alley; the main facade on Park Row is situated midway between Ann Street to the south and Beekman Street to the north. The building is situated on an irregularly shaped land lot, with none of the three facades being connected to each other. This is attributed to the fact that the Park Row Building's original developers were unable to acquire the corner lots at Ann Street and Park Row and at Ann Street and Theatre Alley. The building has a frontage of on Park Row, on Ann Street, and on Theatre Alley. The base of the building covers a land area of approximately . It is immediately adjacent to 25 Park Row to the northeast. Other nearby buildings include 5 Beekman Street to the east, the Woolworth Building to the north, St. Paul's Chapel to the west, and the Bennett Building to the south. In addition, 41 Park Row, 150 Nassau Street, the Morse Building, and the Potter Building are across Beekman Street to the northeast. Design The building was designed by R. H. Robertson, a pioneer in steel skyscraper design, and engineered by the firm of Nathaniel Roberts. Roberts's chief draftsman, George Shea Dayton, was also highly involved in the design. John Downey was hired as the general contractor; T. P. Galligan was the foundation contractor; J,B. & J.M. Cornell were the iron contractors; and Dawson and Archer were the masonry contractors. The total cost to build the skyscraper was $2.4‚Äì2.75 million (equivalent to $‚Äì million in ). The building has 26 full floors, a partial 27th floor, and a pair of four-story towers on the 28th through 31st floors. It has a total height of . Counting the flagpoles that were formerly installed atop the towers, the total height upon the building's completion was , making it one of the world's tallest buildings at the time. There were also two basement levels. This gives the building a total of 33 habitable levels. = Form = The ground level of 15 Park Row occupies its entire lot. However, the center of the southwestern facade (facing the eastern corner of Park Row and Ann Street) contains a light court so that the upper floors resemble a backward, warped \\"E\\", with the \\"spine\\" running along the northeastern facade. Another light court to the east faces the corner of Theatre Alley and Ann Street. The two 3-story towers are capped with copper- clad domes. The design recalls the double-towered Baroque churches of Europe, and more explicitly echoes the architecture of the church of the Monastery of S√£o Vicente da Fora of Lisbon. The towers were easily distinguished in the city's 20th-century skyline. = Facade = There are decorative elements only on the elevations or sides facing Park Row and Ann Street. The main elevation on Park Row is divided into several horizontal groups, each containing up to five stories. The 3rd through 5th floors have granite cladding, while the 6th through 26th stories have terracotta, light-brick, and limestone cladding. The other elevations have plain red brick and window openings. The first and second floors on Park Row were initially clad with granite as well, but were replaced with bronze and glass in 1930. Because of the modification, the \\"base\\" of the Park Row facade is perceived as containing either two or five stories.  Park Row  Diagram of the building's Park Row elevation The Park Row facade is split into three vertical sections. The outer sections, or \\"end pavilions\\" each contain two window openings on the first through fourth stories, and three openings on the fifth story and above. The inner section is split into five bays with a single window on each bay, and above the fifth story, is slightly recessed behind the outer sections. The first and second stories are largely a commercial storefront with bronze-and-glass infill, though two granite Doric-style pilasters from the original design remain extant, at the extreme outer ends of this elevation. The rest of the first and second stories was originally articulated with Doric pilasters and columns. The main entrance is composed of three glass-and-bronze doors underneath a glass-and-bronze transom, within a black Belgian granite surround. The first- and second-story facade to either side of the main entrance is slightly asymmetrical, with two pilasters to the north and three to the south. Secondary entrances also exist on either side of the main entrance. Bronze, gilded spandrels separate the first and second stories. A granite Doric cornice runs above the second story. The third and fourth stories are clad with rusticated limestone. These floors both contain nine bays, and there is a belt course separating these stories. There are four large console brackets outside the third story, supporting large female figures on the fourth story; these brackets flank the third-outermost windows on either side. The brackets were designed by J. Massey Rhind and depict several facets of commerce. A small balustrade runs above the five center bays on the fourth story. The fifth story is clad with smooth limestone and has a large cornice with a frieze above it. There are recessed panels flanking the end pavilions on the fifth story, as well as between each of the five center bays on that story. Above the fifth story, the end pavilions are clad with brick that is patterned to look like rusticated stone. On the end pavilions, there are balconies on the 10th, 18th, and 27th floors, each supported by four brackets and highly ornamented. Keystones above the 10th story windows of the end pavilions are ornamented with lions' heads. In the center section, terracotta pedestals separate each bay of the 6th story, supporting pilasters that span the 7th through 9th stories. Pilasters also separate each of the center bays on the 11th‚Äì13th, 14th‚Äì16th, and 18th‚Äì21st floors, while rectangular panels separate the 17th-floor center windows; each set of pilasters is separated by friezes. Angled balconies extend from the center bay on the 11th and 23rd floors. A decorative band extends horizontally between the 22nd and 23rd floors. The windows on the 23rd floor contain thick pedestals that support terracotta Doric columns spanning the 24th through 26th stories. A cornice with lions'-heads ornamentation rises above the 26th story. There is a 27th story above the center section topped with sheet-copper balls. The 27th story contains no ornamentation other than engaged columns between brick walls, and contains a round addition above it. The ceiling of the 27th story is lower within the towers than in the space between the towers.  Towers  South Tower Above the end pavilions are a pair of circular four-story towers spanning the 28th through 30th stories. Both towers have three visible stories, as well as a fourth story in cupolas that surmount both towers. On each tower, there are cornices above the 29th story, as well as four octagonal piers, one at each corner, supporting the 30th-story dome. The piers separate the towers into four sides, each of which contains three bays. The bays are separated by Corinthian brick pilasters ornamented with terracotta capitals, while the floors are separated by terracotta spandrels. Both domes have oculus windows and a copper-domed cupola on the 31st story. There are eight sheet- copper caryatids and 16 figures on the towers that are attributed to Rhind. The tops of the towers both formerly supported one-story-tall finials.  Ann Street and other elevations  The Ann Street elevation is wide. At ground level is a service entrance with Doric pilasters on each side and a wave molding above it. There are two windows on the second floor with a Doric pilaster between them, and a cornice and frieze above the 2nd floor. There are rusticated limestone blocks on the 3rd through 5th floors, which have two windows each, and a molding above the fifth floors. On the 6th through 27th floors, there are three windows on each floor and balconies on the 10th, 18th, and 27th floors. The remaining elevations, which are made of brick and contain very little ornamentation, are visible from the street. The northern elevation contained many window openings nearer the Park Row side and fewer nearer the Theatre Alley side. The southern and eastern elevations, as well as the light court facing southwest, have single, double, or triple windows set within a bare brick facade. These elevations were originally painted in a cream color, the same color as the Park Row and Ann Street facades. Eight steel beams, each with a depth of , span the light court. = Foundation = The foundations are sunken to a depth of . Underneath the subbasement level are 3,900 Georgia spruce piles, each deep with a diameter, driven into wet sand. The piles descend to below the water table. The underlying sand layer was removed to a depth of above the top of the piles, and then concrete was poured into the space until it reached to the top of the piles. Afterward, granite blocks were placed above the poured concrete and a grillage of I-beams was laid atop the granite blocks. Each pile was capped by brick piers and a granite capstone, and the cellar floor was brought to the same depth as the granite capstones so that the grillage beams could be easily maintained. While foundation work was ongoing, a six-story structure on one side of the building was shored up because the party wall for that building was too weak. The depth of the piles was influenced by the construction of Robertson's previous project at 150 Nassau Street, which used a similar technique to build the foundation, and is located two blocks northeast of the Park Row Building. In the earlier project, pilings had been carried to a deeper level, but the sand was highly compacted below a depth of 20 feet, influencing the depth of the pilings at the Park Row Building. The excavations were almost the same level as the adjacent, now- demolished St. Paul Building. The centers of the piles were spaced apart beneath the vertical columns, and apart elsewhere. The foundation pilings were intended to support a maximum weight of , or in total. Horizontal distributing girders were placed between the tops of the foundations and the footings of the above-ground vertical supports, ranging in length from and in depth from . This distributed the building's weight more easily, meaning that the vertical supports only bore loads of up to . There are several columns whose footings were isolated from the grillage; these columns are located atop short girders on a set of I-beams, which in turn rest on the grillage. Each section of the foundation was designed with a different cross section because the irregular lot shape precluded uniform loads. = Features =  Structure  Typical floor plan in the Park Row Building The building contains about of steel and of other material, chiefly brick and architectural terracotta. The skeleton is made of steel manufactured by Carnegie Steel Company. Two uninvolved companies examined 890 steel-bar samples to determine if the steel was strong enough for use in the building, accepting 870 of these samples. The exterior wall columns are carried above the roof beams, connected by belt courses. All of the structural columns in the building, both interior and exterior, are covered with a layer of brick. Box and lattice girders, each of which are deep, connect the columns at the walls. Floor areas ranged widely from at the base to in each of the towers. The floors rest atop open-web floor girders and use both concrete arches and hollow-tile arches as well as a concrete-arch system. Most of the floor beams are made of pairs of I-beams, which range in thickness from . The concrete arches, fabricated by John A. Roebling's Sons Company, consist of metal sheets rolled into arches and covered with concrete. The hollow-tile floors are made of flat arches made of terracotta blocks set in cement mortar and covered with cinder concrete. The vertical partitions in the building were also made of hollow terracotta tiles, thick. When built, the Park Row Building also contained two steel water tanks of , one in the cellar and one on the roof. The 27th floor has a roof and walls made of vertical I-beams, with terracotta infill. The roof was waterproofed with five layers of hot asphalt alternating with four layers of paper. When the building was completed, thirteen elevators were provided in total. These consisted of one freight elevator for the subbasement through 26th floor; one elevator shared by passengers and freight between the 1st and 27th floors; four passenger elevators for the 1st through 27th floors; five passenger elevators for the 1st through 26th floors; and two passenger elevators connecting the 26th floor to each of the towers. The freight elevators were housed in a rectangular shaft near the Park Row entrance, while the passenger elevators were arranged in a semicircular layout. The tower elevators were smaller than the building's other elevators, and are longer extant. These elevators were manufactured by Sprague Electric, and were one of the company's last major installations in New York City, as they quickly became unpopular after the Park Row Building's opening. There were also two dumbwaiters provided for the restaurant at the top of the building. Upon the building's opening, the passenger elevators were described as being able to accommodate 20,000 passengers per day, or 100,000 per week. Interior spaces The outer lobby design dates from 1930 and has a terrazzo floor; a pink-marble wall with black-marble bases; a plaster cornice; and an octagonal ceiling lamp. The main lobby is connected to the outer lobby via a pair of bronze-and-glass doors. The main lobby is irregular in plan. It has walls and floors similar in design to the outer lobby. The ceiling is made of plaster with ornate decoration and deep coffers, contains a Greek cornice, and is supported by a row of square piers through the center of the lobby. On the north wall is a semicircular elevator lobby with access to the nine passenger elevators. The main lobby extends to a stair to the southeast, which has black marble risers, terrazzo treads, and a bronze handrail. There is another staircase in the lobby's northwest corner, with more simple detail, and gray marble walls. On the building's northern side, there are two staircases above the second floor, with cast-iron risers, marble treads, and wrought-iron railings with wooden handrails. As arranged, each floor contained numerous small offices, as well as a semicircular elevator lobby on the north side with mosaic floor tiles. From the elevator lobby, passageways led west and east to a stair and a north‚Äìsouth passageway. Another hallway connected to the northern end of the easterly passageway, leading southeast and then south to the offices overlooking Theatre Alley. The building contained 950 offices, each with a capacity of about four people. At the top of the building was a restaurant. Much of the original detail in the southern tower remains. A spiral stair made of cast-iron connects the 28th through 30th floors, surrounding a curved elevator shaft with cast- and wrought-iron doors. A staircase leads from the 30th to the 31st floor and contains alternating steps for one's left and right feet. 15parkrowElevators.JPGElevators 15parkrowLOBBY.JPGLobby 15parkrowStairwell.JPGStairwell 15parkrowTurret.JPGInterior of one of the towers History Starting in the early 19th century and continuing through the 1920s, the surrounding area grew into the city's \\"Newspaper Row\\"; several newspaper headquarters were built on Park Row, including the Potter Building, the New York Times Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the New York World Building. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street, less than one block north of the Park Row Building. By the late 19th century, technological advances in elevator technology and steel framework enabled the construction of taller office buildings, particularly in Lower Manhattan. Park Row was particularly favored because skyscrapers on the street could be readily seen from afar, due to the presence of City Hall Park west of Park Row. Prior to the Park Row Building's development, the site at 15 Park Row was occupied by the International Hotel. = Construction = alt=In 1896, seven lots at 15 Park Row were purchased by William Mills Ivins Sr., a prominent lawyer and former judge advocate general for New York State. He was acting on behalf of an investment syndicate that included wealthy businessman August Belmont Jr., for which he was employed as legal counsel. Ivins transferred the land to the syndicate, but due to his involvement, the building was sometimes known during development as the Ivins Syndicate Building. The group also purchased lots on either side, including at 3 Park Row near Ann Street, so that no other skyscraper could be developed to obstruct the view of the windows on the side facades. The syndicate was unable to buy the corner lots on Ann Street \\"at any reasonable price\\", resulting in the unusual shape of the building. The Park Row Building was envisioned as an entirely speculative development, and from the start, was intended as the world's tallest office building. R. H. Robertson was employed to devise designs for the building, the first plans for which were publicized in March 1896. The skyscraper was to be erected by the Park Row Construction Company, a company operated by Belmont. The building was mortgaged for $2.25 million to the Equitable Life Assurance Society in mid-1897. Work started on October 20, 1896, and Ivins was concurrently asked to \\"retire\\" from the company in 1896 or 1897. During construction, the Park Row Building's engineers attempted to install concrete floor slabs, which were $20,000 cheaper and lighter than the more established hollow-tile floor technology. The New York City Board of Examiners opposed the use of concrete floors, and the builders sued and won the right to install concrete floors in December 1897. Because construction had already begun, the Park Row Building used both types of floors. Subsequently, the existing tile arches were found to be defective, exposing some of the structural steelwork, and had to be reinstalled. At the time, defective tile arches were relatively common since they served a protective purpose. The Park Row Building was completed on July 20, 1899, after two years and nine months of construction. = Office use = At , the Park Row Building was the city's tallest building upon its completion, overtaking the previous record holder, the St. Paul Building, by . It was also significantly taller than other tall structures in the area, such as the Manhattan Life Insurance Building and the American Surety Building. The Park Row Building was actually the tallest office building in the world, but not the tallest structure. The Park Row Building continued to be New York City's tallest building and the world's tallest office building until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Singer Building. The Park Row Construction Company transferred the building's ownership in 1901 to the Park Row Realty Company, also operated by Belmont. When the Park Row Building was completed, a rough estimate of 25,000 people were thought to visit the building each workday, while approximately 4,000 people worked there. Many of the early tenants were small businesses, particularly law firms and those in the news-gathering industry. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), a company operated by Belmont which operated the city's then-new subway system, had its headquarters in the building, as was the first office of the newly minted Associated Press. The Park Row Building also had several tenants who engaged in suspicious activity, such as a bucket shop in 1901, a get-rich-quick scheme in 1903, and a gambling ring in 1904. Belmont built an eight-story edifice on 3 Park Row, the lot that he had purchased to preserve the views from the Park Row Building, in 1906. The next year, Belmont turned over the Park Row Building, 3 Park Row, and several other properties to British banker Nathan Rothschild for $7 million. The Park Row Building and 3 Park Row were sold to Frederick Brown in July 1923 for $5 million. Brown immediately resold the buildings to Kenneth W. McNeil of the McNeil Coal Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In October 1924, McNeil sold the buildings to Bernard Dorf in exchange for the Theodore Roosevelt Apartments on the Bronx's Grand Concourse, in a sale worth $12 million. Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the building went into receivership, and the Federal Securities Corporation bought the property. W. Irving Moss bought the building at auction in 1930 for $2.9 million, and it was resold the next year to Charles W. Crosby. Clinton and Russell were hired in August 1930 to renovate the lowest two floors for $300,000, with the project being completed by early 1931. In addition to replacing the facade, Clinton and Russell restored the interior spaces and added commercial space on the first floor. During the later 20th century, more tenants moved in, representing a variety of fields. These included Patterson Brothers, hardware dealers; Universal National Bank, New York City's second black-controlled bank; and The Legal Aid Society. The building received little modifications throughout the remainder of the century, except for the replacement of windows and refurbishment of the lobby's original ceiling. = Residential use = Joseph and Rachelle Friedman, owners of electronic and music retailer J&R;, bought 15 Park Row in the 1990s. At the time, J&R; occupied several neighboring low-rise buildings on Park Row, and the Friedmans had demolished and replaced the neighboring building at the corner of Park Row and Ann Street. By 2000, plans were developed for a thorough renovation of the entire structure. The 1st through 10th floors would remain as commercial space, while everything above the 10th floor would be converted into 210 residential units, ranging from studio apartments to two-bedroom suites. Fogarty Finger and H. Thomas O'Hara restored the interiors. The initial renovations and residential conversions were completed by 2001, and the first tenants moved in during that May. However, the building was shuttered after the September 11, 2001, attacks and the resulting collapse of the World Trade Center; when the building reopened in March 2002, nearly half of the 70 tenants did not return, while there were 62 units available. The pair of apartments in the cupolas at the 28th through 30th floors were not renovated, and were offered for sale as unfurnished units in 2013. In the 2000s and early 2010s, J&R; took up most of the storefronts along the block of Park Row that included 15 Park Row, with a sales space at the ground floor and mezzanine of the building. By 2013, J&R; was planning to expand to five floors and knock down the walls separating 15 Park Row from 1 Park Row. However, J&R; closed permanently the following year. The 3rd through 10th floors were subsequently converted for residential use as well. By 2018, the building had 332 apartments, with five more under construction, two of which were planned for the towers atop 15 Park Row. In February 2020, Fogarty Finger proposed renovating the ground-level retail units, with options for one storefront on the lobby's northern side as well as one, two, or three storefronts on the southern side. J&R; Music Lounge By City Winery was also supposed to open in 15 Park Row's basement in early 2020.  Notable incidents  alt= On May 26, 1918, Harry H. Gardiner climbed 15 Park Row to raise money for the American Red Cross. A crowd of 50,000 people watched until he touched the golden ball at the top of one of the flagpoles. Gardiner then climbed back down; the event took two hours in total. A similar climb took place on September 8, 1918, when Steve Peterson climbed the building to raise money for the Free Milk for France Fund. At 4:20 a.m. on May 3, 1920, anarchist Andrea Salsedo was defenestrated from the fourteenth floor of 15 Park Row. He was being held with Roberto Elia by the Justice Department in connection with a series of bombings that had occurred in New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Paterson, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. A leaflet entitled \\"Plain Words\\", signed by the \\"Anarchist Fighters\\", was found at the sites, and because of an aberrant \\"S\\" in the printing, the authorities tracked down the print shop where both Salsedo and Elia worked. They were held at 15 Park Row for eight weeks with limited external communication. When Salsedo fell, the anarchists claimed he was thrown, while the police claimed he jumped. Impact Criticism from the architectural community was harsh because of the lack of comparable structures at the time. A critic, writing in the Real Estate Record and Guide in 1898, stated that \\"New York is the only city in which such a monster would be allowed to rear itself\\", and called the blank side walls \\"absolutely inexpressive and vacuous\\", except for the steel girders across the light court that were \\"provided to give the inmates of the central part some allowance of light and air\\". The unnamed critic described the cupolas as \\"insignificant terminations which add nothing\\", in contrast to the top stories of the St. Paul Building, which they felt was well designed. However, the critic also praised Rhind's figures on the Park Row Building as compared with the \\"impossible 'realism'\\" of Karl Bitter's figures on the St. Paul Building's facade. In a 1908 article in The New York Times, a French architect, Augustin-Adolphe Rey, wrote that \\"one side of it is an entirely bare wall‚Äîwhat difference does it make how the other sides are treated?\\" Critic Jean Schopfer called the building \\"detestable\\", as compared with other skyscrapers like the \\"mediocre\\" St. Paul Building or the \\"interesting\\" American Surety Building. Negative criticism highlighted the composition of the facade as well. In 1898, the Engineering News said that the building was influenced by \\"no established style of architecture\\". Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler stated in 1897 that he believed skyscrapers should be divided into three horizontal layers but that \\"Mr. Robertson declines to recognize even this convention\\" in general. The Park Row Building also had admirers, including the photographers Charles Sheeler and Alvin Langdon Coburn, who took pictures of the undecorated side walls of the building and the shadows made by its unusual shape. Scientific American magazine, in 1898, praised Robertson's design as having a \\"very satisfactory effect\\", in that the facade was able to \\"clothe the 'skeleton; with a mantle of stone and glass that shall appear diversified, dignified and appropriate\\". Author H. G. Wells described the building as one of the \\"splendid fountains of habitation\\" present in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. The Park Row Building was also depicted in several media works. Sheeler included the building in the short documentary film he made with Paul Strand, Manhatta (1921). The extreme narrowness of the Ann Street facade made that section of the building appear to be an extremely slender tower, as depicted in the film The Fisher King. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Park Row Building as a New York City landmark on June 15, 1999. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 2005.

In many ways, Rocinante is not only Don Quixote's horse, but also his double: like Don Quixote, he is awkward, past his prime, and engaged in a task beyond his capacities.  Etymology  in Spanish means a work horse or low-quality horse, but can also mean an illiterate or rough man. There are similar words in English (rouncey), French (roussin or roncin; rosse), Portuguese (rocim), and Italian (ronzino). The etymology is uncertain. The name is a complex pun. In Spanish, ante has several meanings and can function as a standalone word as well as a suffix. One meaning is \\"before\\" or \\"previously\\". Another is \\"in front of\\". As a suffix, -ante in Spanish is adverbial; rocinante refers to functioning as, or being, a roc√≠n. \\"Rocinante\\", then, follows Cervantes' pattern using ambiguous, multivalent words, which is common throughout the novel. Rocinante's name, then, signifies his change in status from the \\"old nag\\" of before to the \\"foremost\\" steed. As Cervantes describes Don Quixote's choice of name: nombre a su parecer alto, sonoro y significativo de lo que hab√≠a sido cuando fue roc√≠n, antes de lo que ahora era, que era antes y primero de todos los rocines del mundo‚Äî\\"a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world\\". In chapter 1, Cervantes describes Don Quixote's careful naming of his steed: > Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said > to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, > and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive > name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before > belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was.\\"  In popular culture  *Rocinante is the name of the camper truck used by author John Steinbeck in his 1960 cross-country road trip, which is depicted in his 1962 travelogue Travels with Charley. * The progressive rock band Rush sing about the ship Rocinante in both \\"Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage\\" and \\"Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres\\" on the albums A Farewell to Kings and Hemispheres respectively. * Rocinante is the name of Monsignor Quixote's car in Graham Greenes's 1982 novel Monsignor Quixote * In the novel series The Expanse and its TV series adaptation, the Rocinante is the new name given to a Martian gunship that becomes the primary setting for much of the series. * In the television series Once Upon A Time, which is based upon retellings of literary classics, Rocinante is the name of the horse belonging to a young Regina/Evil Queen. * Finnish actor Jukka Leisti created a children's tv- program around his knight character Tuttiritari (The Pacifier Knight).

Considerable substitution occurs with cobalt and iron in the nickel site along with bismuth and arsenic in the antimony site. A solid solution series exists with the high cobalt willyamite. Physical properties Ullmannite is steel- gray to tin white in color with a metallic luster, has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of 6.65. Initially thought to be of two species, tetrahedral and cubic, it was later confirmed that both samples conformed to the 23 point group of the isometric crystal class and typically exhibits cubic, octahedral, or pyritohedral forms although euhedral crystals are rare. Variance in its chemical composition has been shown to be responsible for loss of symmetry and variations in striation patterns. Ullmannite crystals are usually less than 2 mm, however larger have been identified in especially antimony rich environments. Ullmannite commonly displays interpenetration twins as well as enantiomorphic twinning along [110]. Occurrence Ulmanite crystals from the Masaloni Mine, San Vito, Cagliari Province, Sardinia, Italy (size: 5.4 x 3.3 x 2.1 cm) It is a member of the cobaltite group and forms a series with willyamite ((Co,Ni)SbS). It occurs with nickeline, gersdorffite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, tetrahedrite and dyscrasite in hydrothermal deposits. Principal localities are in Germany, it is also found in Austria, Australia, France, England, and Wales. It was first described in 1843 for an occurrence in the Storch und Sch√∂neberg Mine, North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany. Specimens of ullmannite were found at Sarrabus, Sardinia, Italy in 1887. The crystals of the specimens from Sarrabus were described as hemihedral with parallel faces, whereas specimens from L√∂lling in present-day Austria were hemihedral with inclined faces. Origin of name Ullmannite was named for German chemist and mineralogist, Johann Christoph Ullmann (1771‚Äì1821), one of the fathers of systematic mineralogy. Ullmann established a mineral collection (now the basis for the internationally renowned Museum of Mineralogy in Marburg )and authored Ein Systematisch-Tabellarische √úbersicht der Mineralogisch einfachen Fossilien, one of the first attempts to provide a structured organization to the observed minerals of the day.

He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art for a number of aesthetic and broader social reasons. Firstly, his works are held to be among the best examples of the fusion of European techniques with a purely Indian sensibility. While continuing the tradition and aesthetics of Indian art, his paintings employed the latest European academic art techniques of the day. Secondly, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure. His lithographs increased the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among common people for several decades. In particular, his depictions of Hindu deities and episodes from the epics and Puranas have received profound acceptance from the public and are found, often as objects of worship, across the length and breadth of India. Raja Ravi Varma was closely related to the royal family of Travancore of present-day Kerala state in India. Later in his life, two of his granddaughters were adopted into that royal family, and their descendants comprise the totality of the present royal family of Travancore, including the latest three Maharajas (Balarama Varma III, Marthanda Varma III and Rama Varma VII).  Personal life  Raja Ravi Varma was born M. R. Ry. Ravi Varma, Koil Thampuran of Kilimanoor at Kilimanoor palace in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (present-Kerala) into an aristocratic family that for over 200 years produced consorts for the princesses of the matrilineal Travancore royal family. The title Raja was conferred as a personal title by the Viceroy and Governor-General of India. There comes Papa (1893), depicting Varma's daughter Mahaprabha with one of her sons. Varma's sister-in-law, Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, Senior Rani of Attingal (or Travancore), who adopted Varma's granddaughters in 1900 CE Ravi Varma was the son of Ezhumavil Neelakanthan Bhattatiripad and Umayamba Thampurratti. His mother Uma Ambabayi Thampuratty (or Umayamba Bayi Thampuratty) belonged to the baronial family which ruled the Kilimanoor feudal estate within the kingdom of Travancore. She was a poet and writer of some talent, and her work Parvati Swayamvaram was published by Varma after her death. Ravi Varma's father was a scholar of Sanskrit and Ayurveda and hailed from the Ernakulam district in Kerala. Ravi Varma had two siblings, a sister named Mangala Bayi and a brother named Raja Varma (born 1860). The last-named was also a painter and worked closely with Ravi Varma all his life. In 1866, at the age of 18, Varma was married to 12-year-old Bhageerthi Bayi (known formally as Pooruruttati Nal Bhageerathi Bayi Thampuratty) of the royal house of Mavelikkara, another major fief of Travancore kingdom. Notably, the house of Mavellikara was a branch of the Royal House of Travancore. Bhageerthi was the youngest of three sisters, and both of her elder sisters had been adopted into the royal family of Travancore in 1857 in order to carry on the lineage. They were known as the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and in their progeny was vested the succession to the throne of Travancore. Therefore, Ravi Varma's connection to the royal family became very close due to his marriage with Bhageerthi. His children (because they belonged to their mother's family) would be royal by birth. The marriage, which was arranged by the parents in the proper Indian manner, was harmonious and successful. The couple were blessed with five children, two sons, and three daughters. Their elder son, Kerala Varma (b.1876) was of an excessively spiritual temperament. He never married and eventually renounced the world, leaving home for good in 1912. The younger son, Rama Varma (born 1879), inherited his father's artistic talent and studied at the JJ School of Arts, Mumbai. He was married to Gowri Kunjamma, sister of Dewan PGN Unnithan, and became the father of seven children. It was however Ravi Varma's daughters who were singled out by destiny for greatness, although not in the field of art, nor personally, but through their daughters. The three daughters of Ravi Varma and Bhageerthi Bayi were Mahaprabha Amma (who features in two of Varma's most famous paintings), Uma Amma (named after Varma's mother) and Cheria Kochamma. In 1900 CE, the Royal House of Travancore once again faced a succession crisis. Bhageerthi's two elder sisters, who had been adopted in order to carry forward the lineage, had failed to produce the desired heirs. They had six children between them, but only two of those had survived, and both were boys (who also, incidentally, later died childless). According to the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system, the succession to the throne could only progress through females, and therefore it was necessary to make an adoption. Tradition dictated that two girls belonging to branches of the Royal Family be adopted together. They would be designated the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and the succession to the throne of Travancore would be vested in their progeny, in accordance with the unusual and unique Marumakkathayam system of succession. Two of Varma's grand-daughters were marked by destiny to receive this honour, the main reason being that they were the nearest matrilineal (cognatic) kin to the incumbent Rani of Attingal. In August 1900, Mahaprabha's eldest daughter Lakshmi Bayi (aged 5 years) and Uma's eldest daughter Parvati Bayi (aged 4 years) were adopted into the Royal family of Travancore. It was Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, their surviving grand-aunt, who formally adopted them. She died within one year of doing this, and the two girls were then installed as the Senior and Junior Ranis of Attingal respectively. They were married while yet in their early teens to two gentleman from suitable aristocratic families. It was the Junior Rani, Sethu Parvathi Bayi, who gave birth to the much-awaited heir in 1912, exactly a day after her sixteenth birthday. Incidentally, her husband was a grand-nephew of Raja Ravi Varma and belonged to Kilimanoor. The newborn child was the future Maharaja Chithira Thirunal, the last ruling Maharaja of Travancore. He was followed by a brother (the future Maharaja Marthanda Varma III) and a sister Lakshmi Bayi, the mother of Maharaja Rama Varma VII who is presently on the throne (since 2013). Meanwhile, the Senior Rani (Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, daughter of Mahaprabha Amma, and Regent in the period 1924-31) also gave birth to two daughters later in life (in 1923 and 1926). In this way, the entire present (existing) royal family of Travancore is descended from Raja Ravi Varma. Well-known among his royal descendants are the writers Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi and Shreekumar Varma, the artist Rukmini Varma and the classical musician Aswathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Art career Varma was patronised by Ayilyam Thirunal, the next Maharaja of Travancore and began formal training thereafter.\\"The Diary of C. Rajaraja Varma\\" He learned the basics of painting in Madurai. Later, he was trained in water painting by Rama Swami Naidu and in oil painting by Dutch portraitist Theodor Jenson. The studio used by Varma during his stay at the Laxmi Vilas Palace The British administrator Edgar Thurston was significant in promoting the careers of Varma and his brother. Varma received widespread acclaim after he won an award for an exhibition of his paintings at Vienna in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893 and he was awarded three gold medals.Kilimanoor Chandran, Ravi Varmayum Chitrakalayum(in Malayalam), Department of Culture, Kerala, 1998. He travelled throughout India in search of subjects. He often modelled Hindu Goddesses or Indian women, whom he considered beautiful. Ravi Varma is particularly noted for his paintings depicting episodes from the story of Dushyanta and Shakuntala, and Nala and Damayanti, from the Mahabharata. Ravi Varma's representation of mythological characters has become a part of the Indian imagination of the epics. He is often criticized for being too showy and sentimental in his style but his work remains very popular in India. Many of his fabulous paintings are housed at Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara. Raja Ravi Varma Press Mrs. Ramanadha Rao and son Apparently on the advice of the then Dewan (Prime Minister) of Travancore, T. Madhava Rao, Ravi Varma started a lithographic printing press in Ghatkopar, Mumbai in 1894 and later shifted it to Malavli near Lonavala, Maharashtra in 1899. The oleographs produced by the press were mostly of Hindu gods and goddesses in scenes adapted mainly from the Mahabharata, the Ramayana and the Puranas. These oleographs were very popular and continued to be printed in thousands for many years, even after the 1906 death of Ravi Varma. The Ravi Varma press was the largest and most innovative press in India at that time. The press was managed by Varma's brother, Raja Varma, but under their management, it was a commercial failure. By 1899 the press was deeply in debt and in 1901, the press was sold to his printing technician from Germany, Fritz Schleicher. Schleicher continued to print Ravi Varma's prints but later employed less talented artists to create new designs. Schleicher also broadened the product of press to include commercial and advertisement labels. Under the management of Schleicher and his successors, the press continued successfully until a devastating fire destroyed the whole factory in 1972. Many of Ravi Varma's original lithographic prints were also lost in the fire. Honours Raja Ravi Varma on a 1971 stamp of India In 1904, Viceroy Lord Curzon, on behalf of the British King Emperor, bestowed upon Varma the Kaisar- i-Hind Gold Medal. A college dedicated to fine arts was also constituted in his honour at Mavelikara, Kerala. Raja Ravi Varma High at Kilimanoor was named after him and there are many cultural organizations throughout India bearing his name. In 2013, the crater Varma on Mercury was named in his honor. Considering his vast contribution to Indian art, the Government of Kerala has instituted an award called Raja Ravi Varma Puraskaram, which is awarded every year to people who show excellence in the field of art and culture. * On his 65th death anniversary, India post issued a commemorative postal stamp depicting Ravi Varma and his famous painting 'Damayanti and Swan' Legacy Raja Ravi Varma is sometimes regarded as the first modern Indian artist due to his ability to reconcile Western aesthetics with Indian iconography. The Indian art historian and critic Geeta Kapur wrote, Similarly, Baroda School artist Gulam Mohammed Sheikh also wrote about Ravi Varma as a modern artist. In his essay \\"Ravi Varma in Baroda,\\" Sheikh asserted that Varma was a key figure in the establishment of Indian modern art, claiming that \\"the story of contemporary Indian art was never the same after Ravi Varma had entered it. He left his imprint on almost every aspect of it.\\" Like Kapur, Sheikh praised Ravi Varma's integration of Indian and Western aesthetics and techniques, comparing him favorably to Indian modernist Nandalal Bose. However, Ravi Varma's legacy is controversial. Fellow Baroda School artist and art historian Ratan Parimoo saw Ravi Varma in a less favorable light, derogatorily referring to him as kitsch and claiming Varma's work was less spiritually authentic than folk art and tribal art. He argued that Ravi Varma was responsible for the \\"vulgarity\\" of popular art, comparing Varma's work to the lurid colors and sexuality of popular images in calendar art and films. Despite his controversial legacy, Ravi Varma continues to be an important figure for modern and contemporary Indian artists. For example, celebrated modern artist Nalini Malani recreated Ravi Varma's Galaxy of Musicians in her video installation Unity in Diversity to interrogate Ravi Varma's idealistic nationalism and critique the 2002 riots in Gujarat. Similarly, contemporary artist Pushpamala N. recreated several Ravi Varma paintings with herself as the subject to deconstruct Ravi Varma's idealized depictions of goddesses and Indian women.

Poplar Creek enters the river below the Melton Hill Dam. History A peninsula located at the mouth of the Clinch River, called Southwest Point, was the site of an early frontier fort which has been recently reconstructed. This site was important to Native Americans. A treaty between the Cherokees and the white settlers was signed at Southwest Point, allowing the capital of Tennessee to be moved there. The Tennessee General Assembly fulfilled this requirement technically by meeting in Kingston for one day, and then voting to move the capital city elsewhere. Clinch was the name of an 18th-century explorer of the area. Former variations of the name included \\"Clinch's River\\", \\"Clench River\\", \\"Clinches River\\" and \\"Fiume Clinchs\\". Folk etymology, however, provides a more colorful account: the river received its name after a pioneer fell into it, and shouted \\"Clinch me! Clinch me!\\", supposedly meaning \\"clench me\\" or \\"grab me\\". An older name for the river, which appears on some early maps, was the \\"Pelisipi River\\", with such variant spellings as \\"Pelisippi\\" and \\"Pellissippi\\", and the variant form \\"Fiume Pelissipi\\". In fact, the Mitchell Map (1755‚Äì1757) labels a tributary of the \\"Pelisipi River\\" as \\"Clinch's River\\". The word \\"Pellissippi\\" was long said to have been the Cherokees' name for the river and was purported to mean \\"winding waters\\" in the Cherokee language. Note: The Cherokee origin of \\"Pellissippi\\" is questionable, as there is no \\"P\\" sound in the Cherokee syllabary (). However, research completed in 2017 instead concludes that the Miami-Illinois name (\\"river of the Mosopelea\\" tribe) was first applied to what is now called the Ohio River. Shortened in the Shawnee language to , or , the name evolved through other variant forms such as \\"Polesipi\\", \\"Peleson\\", \\"Pele Sipi\\" and \\"Pere Sipi\\", and eventually stabilized to the \\"Pelisipi/Pelisippi/Pellissippi\\" form; these names were variously applied back and forth between the Ohio and Clinch rivers. The name Pellissippi has been used in proper names throughout East Tennessee, for example in Pellissippi Parkway and Pellissippi State Community College. A power plant sits on the Clinch River at Carbo in Russell County, Virginia. It was completed in 1957, and it is owned by Appalachian Power, a part of American Electric Power (AEP). The plant was converted from burning coal to natural gas in 2016. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, another coal-fired power plant that began operations in 2012, is a few miles away outside St. Paul in Wise County, Virginia. It is owned by Dominion Virginia Power. Pollution from mining in the region has caused great concern among environmentalists because several rare species inhabit the river. Some mussels were reintroduced to the Cleveland, Virginia area from outside the state in the early 2000s after pollution in the 20th century wiped out much of the population. In 2008, a large release of fly ash from the TVA's Kingston Fossil Plant deposited 2.6 million pounds of fly ash in the lower section of the river below the confluence of the Emory River. Although at first the TVA began cleaning the ash out of the river, in 2009 the EPA took over and finished removing coal ash in 2010. The release of coal ash in rivers has been shown to result in increased sedimentation and the exposure of trace elements to aquatic organisms. A study done several months after the spill revealed that the river had increased amounts of trace metals such as mercury and arsenic. A study done a year after the spill showed that there was a possibility of food web accumulation of methylmercury but this had not yet been shown. Ecology The Clinch River above Clinton, Tennessee (tailwaters of Norris Dam) is stocked with rainbow trout and brown trout by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Before being dammed, the Clinch River was a major producer of freshwater mussels and pearls. The rivers of the southern Appalachians are still notable for their unusually rich mussel biodiversity. The mussels were an important food source for Native Americans and were later used by settlers as bait and hog feed. The freshwater pearl industry thrived throughout the southern Appalachians in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Clinch River and the Emory River were considered the economic heart of the pearl industry, and the state of Tennessee was one of the top six states in the United States for pearl production. The mussel-based industries began to decline in the early 20th century and were effectively eliminated by the dams built by the TVA. The first major Tennessee River dam was Wilson Dam, built at a site known as Muscle Shoals, which could refer to the freshwater mussels of the region (the shoals could also be named for the exertion necessary to move river traffic across them). Norris Dam and Norris Lake on the Clinch River flooded one of the other areas of mussel near Young's Island.Davis, Donald Edward. \\"Where There Are Mountains, An Environmental History of the Southern Appalachians\\".

Additionally, a number of semi-official and unofficial symbols of the city are also used. Image:Flag of Krakow.svgFlag of Krak√≥w Image:Banner of Krakow.svgBanner of Krak√≥w Image:POL Krak√≥w COA.svgCoat of Arms of Krak√≥w Image:Krakow-seal.PNGSeal of Krak√≥w Official symbols The current official symbols of Krak√≥w are described by the Ordinance of the Krak√≥w City Council no. CXXIII/1150/02 adopted on October 9, 2002. However, they are all based on symbols which have been in use since much earlier, some of them dating back to the 16th century. =Coat of Arms= An 1833 medal with the coat of arms of Krak√≥w The coat of arms displays a red brick wall with three towers in a blue field. Each tower, the middle one taller and wider than the other two, is topped with a battlement with three crenels and has a black vertical loophole and a black window. In the wall there is a gate with a pair of open golden doors with fleur-de-lis-shaped metalwork and a raised golden grate. Inside the gate there is the White Eagle with a golden crown , beak and talons. The escutcheon has a typically Renaissance shape and is topped with a golden Crown of Boles≈Çaw I the Brave with fleurs-de-lis, closed with a globus cruciger (an orb with a cross). The crowned White Eagle, which is also used in the coat of arms of Poland, and the crown above the escutcheon symbolize the fact that Krak√≥w was the Polish capital and seat of Polish kings from ca. 1040 until 1596. The coat of arms with the brick wall, the three towers, the open gate and the eagle dates back to the 16th century. The actual colors and shapes, however, changed with time. The current design, adopted in 2002, uses shapes of the escutcheon and the eagle based on those found on Renaissance seals, signets and other artifacts, but other shapes, including Gothic and Neo-Classical, were also used in past. The Free City of Krak√≥w, a city state which existed between 1815 and 1846 used the Krak√≥w coat of arms as its state symbol. The Grand Duchy of Krak√≥w created after the Free City's annexation by the Austrian Empire, used the White Eagle with the Krak√≥w coat as an inescutcheon but without the eagle inside the gate. =Seal= The seal is round and consists of the coat of arms surrounded by an inscription with the city's official name: Sto≈Çeczne Kr√≥lewskie Miasto Krak√≥w, or \\"Royal Capital City of Krak√≥w\\". =Colours and flag= The official colors of Krak√≥w are white and blue. The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the top one white and the bottom one blue. The flag proportions are 5:8. The white-and-blue bicolor was adopted as the flag of the Free City of Krak√≥w in 1815. It is almost identical with the civil flag of San Marino, the only difference being the shade of blue. =Banner= The banner consists of a white saltire in a blue field with the coat of arms superimposed in the center. The banner proportions are 5:8. It is attached to a pole topped with a miniature of the crown used for coronations of Polish kings. =Use of official symbols= The use of the city's official symbols is regulated by the Ordinance no. 167/2004 signed by the Mayor of Krak√≥w on February 6, 2004. Both the banner and the seal exist in only two official specimens. One set of the banner and seal is used by the Mayor (Prezydent Miasta Krakowa) and the other - by the President of the City Council (PrzewodniczƒÖcy Rady Miasta Krakowa). The banner is only used on special occasions. Similarly, the seal is only impressed upon particularly important documents. The coat of arms should be displayed outside and may be also displayed indoors by organs of the City of Krak√≥w, the city administration and the city's one-person joint-stock companies. The flag is the most \\"democratic\\" of the official symbols as it may be used virtually by anyone, especially on special occasions. Other symbols Krak√≥w logo The crowned letter K of Krak√≥w sanitation company Lajkonik Since the use of most of Krak√≥w's official symbols is legally restricted, many semiofficial and unofficial symbols are also used. The Krak√≥w logo, which includes the city's Latin name, Cracovia, is used by the city authorities for Krak√≥w's promotion. Another popular symbol of the city is a stylized crowned letter K based on that found on old city seals and, most famously, on the door to the Wawel Cathedral. Images of the city's patron saints, Saint Stanislaus and Saint Florian may be also used as its symbols, particularly in religious contexts. Hejna≈Ç mariacki, the famous trumpet call made every hour from the taller tower of St Mary's Church, may be considered an audible symbol of Krak√≥w. Other unofficial symbols of Krak√≥w include a variety of objects popularly associated with the city, such as: * the Wawel Dragon; * the Lajkonik; * certain landmark buildings, especially the Wawel, St Mary's Church, the Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) and the Barbican; * mascarons from the Sukiennice attic; * the krakowiak folk costume; * obwarzanek krakowski, a traditional ring-shaped bread; * Krak√≥w's ubiquitous pigeons.

The river is about long.  Hydrography  The river is dammed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in four locations, all in western North Carolina. Chatuge Dam, Mission Dam, Hiwassee Dam, and Apalachia Dam. Water is diverted from the stream bed at Apalachia Dam and sent through a pipeline which is tunneled through the mountains for eight miles (13 km), then flows through the Apalachia Powerhouse to generate electricity. The stretch of the river that flows between Apalachia Dam and Apalachia Powerhouse features reduced flow and is followed by the John Muir Trail in Tennessee's Cherokee National Forest. The stretch of river that flows from the North Carolina/Tennessee state line to U.S. Highway 411 near Delano is designated a State Scenic River (Class III Partially Developed River) and for recreational purposes is managed by the state Resource Management Division, in cooperation with TVA. The river features Class I through Class III rapids, depending on water levels. After exiting the mountains through a gorge, the Hiwassee flows under US-411 and broadens, meandering through rural Polk and Bradley counties. The river crosses under U.S. Route 11 at Calhoun and Charleston, Tennessee, where local industries such as Bowater Newsprint Mill and Arch/Olin Chemical use river water in their operations. At this point the river interfaces with the impoundment of Chickamauga Dam (located in Chattanooga, Tennessee), and many marshes and wetlands surround the main channel, providing areas for hunting and fishing. The Hiwassee passes under Interstate 75 on the border of McMinn and Bradley counties. The Hiwassee continues westward to pass under SR 58's bridge (this bridge replaced an old historic and narrow bridge) on its way to the confluence with the Tennessee River. This area of the river is enjoyed by boaters, fishermen, and water skiers. Major tributaries include Valley River, Nottely River, Coker Creek, Big Lost Creek, Spring Creek, Conasauga Creek, and Toccoa/Ocoee River. Etymology The Hiwassee River has been known by many variant spellings. The best-known of these is Hiawassee, which is also the name of the Georgia town through which the river flows. Other alternate spellings include Heia Wassea and Highwassee, and some less obvious related names include Eufasee, Eufassee, Euphasee and Quannessee. Some Cherokee say the name came from the Cherokee word Ayuhwasi, which means a meadow or savanna. The Muskogee (Creek) say the river's name is the Koasati and Hitchiti, Creek language words for the copperhead snake. The river is known for its many copperheads, even today.  History  Various Muskogean-speaking ethnic groups occupied the region for many centuries before the arrival of the Cherokee. Tribes related to them include the Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole (formed in the early 19th century). Some historians originally thought that because the Europeans had encountered the Cherokee in the Hiwassee Valley in the 18th century, the latter people had occupied the territory for a much longer period, but this is not the case. Their language is Iroquoian and they are believed to have migrated at an earlier time from south of the Great Lakes region, where several other Iroquoian tribes have been based, including the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy). =Early Spanish contact= Spanish explorers visited the region in the 16th century. Hernando de Soto probably crossed the Hiwassee River near its confluence with the Tennessee River at Hiwassee Island, in the spring of 1541 AD. Juan Pardo probably followed a trail that paralleled the river in 1567 AD. All town names and indigenous words that were recorded by de Soto's chroniclers in present-day Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, can be easily translated by contemporary Muskogean dictionaries. Most of the words are of the Koasati and Hitchiti languages, but a few are Muskogean and Alabama words. None of the words are Cherokee. The earliest European maps from the 17th century vaguely show the Hiwassee River Basin occupied by a mountain branch of the Apalachee and the Kusa. The Kusa (or Coosa in English) were one of the ancestral branches of the \\"Upper Creek\\" (or Muscogee). The Tama-tli of the Altamaha River Basin in southeastern Georgia are known to have had a colony in the valley between Andrews, North Carolina and the Hiwassee River at Murphy, North Carolina. =British colonial influences= The initial contacts by English explorers and traders in the 1690s found most of the river valley occupied by Muskogean and Yuchi towns. Cherokee villages were east and north of the river at this time. In 1714, two traders in South Carolina supplied the Cherokee with firearms and directed them to attack the Yuchi villages on the Hiwassee River. Most of the men in one Yuchi town were gone when the Cherokee attacked. Not having firearms, the remaining Yuchi were massacred. In 1715, the Cherokee invited the leaders of the many Muskogean provinces that would eventually comprise the Creek Confederacy to a diplomatic conference at Tugaloo at the headwaters of the Savannah River. They murdered the Muskogean leaders in their sleep. This precipitated a 40-year-long war between the Creek and the Cherokee. Due to disunity among the Creek, the Cherokee were able to occupy the northeastern tip of what is now Georgia, but then was part of South Carolina. They drove the Muskogee and Yuchi from most of North Carolina west and south of the Hiwassee. Most of the branches of the Creek lost interest in this war after a few years. =18th century Cherokee homeland= The Hiwassee River and its tributaries were part of Cherokee territory in the early 18th century. A town known as \\"Hiwassee\\" (Ayuhwasi) was located near the mouth of Peachtree Creek near Murphy, North Carolina. The Valley River contained many Cherokee towns, sometimes collectively called the \\"Valley Towns\\", from today's Andrews, North Carolina, near the headwaters of Valley River to its mouth at Murphy. The Cherokee town known as Great Hiwassee (Ayuhwasi Egwahi) was located in today's Polk County, Tennessee, where the Hiwassee River emerges from the mountains. The Indians had several \\"highways\\" which passed through the area. The Great Trading Path, the Overhill Trading Path, and the Unicoi Turnpike ran along much of the Hiwassee River. Another old path known as the Warrior Path ran from southern lands to Great Hiwassee and then up the Conasauga Creek to the Cherokee town known as Great Tellico. The Kowita Creek (Muscogee), whose homeland was in the North Carolina mountains (east of present-day Franklin and south of Asheville), continued to fight the Cherokee by themselves. By the 1750s, the Kowita had developed such a powerful military machine that they could consistently defeat any branch of the Cherokee that they encountered. By 1755, they had destroyed all of the Cherokee towns in Georgia and in the Hiwassee Valley. The Kowita Taskimikko, or general, bragged to some English traders that he sent women and children in the front line against the Cherokee town of Quanesee, and that its people ran from the village without fighting. The archives of colonial Georgia, where this boast is recorded, hold a 1755 map created by John Mitchell and commissioned by the Colony of North Carolina. Over the entire southern half of western North Carolina and all of northeastern Georgia are the words, \\"Deserted Cherokee Towns.\\" In 1763, the Cherokee lost all of their lands in present-day North Carolina east of the 80th longitude line, which runs through Murphy and crosses the Hiwassee River there. This was punishment by the British for the Cherokee support of the French during the French and Indian War (known worldwide as the Seven Years' War). The line runs roughly 45 miles west of Cherokee, North Carolina. The Creek agreed to give up their recently reconquered lands in North Carolina and Georgia in return for most of Alabama, which the French ceded to Great Britain after the war. The Cherokee were given lands in northwestern Georgia, which had been occupied by the Apalachicola, allies of the French. =American Revolutionary War effects= Some Cherokee families continued to live east of the Appalachians after 1763. But, at any time an Anglo-European settler could arrive on a Cherokee farmstead, and evict the Cherokee. In 1776 during the American Revolution, the Cherokee became allies of the British and massacred residents of frontier farmsteads across a broad swath of the Carolinas. The counterattack by the Euro-American patriot militia of 5,000 men left most of the remaining Cherokee towns in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia in ruins. The survivors initially fled into the Tennessee River valley in the vicinity of Chickamauga Creek in southeast Tennessee (present-day Chattanooga), and settled upriver of an old Muskogee/Kusa town, Citico on Chickamauga Creek, but within a decade had also settled in northwestern Georgia and northeastern Alabama. Some Chickamauga Cherokee returned to the Hiwassee Valley after the Revolution, but the center of the Cherokee culture by then had moved further south and west. Later the Cherokee were divided over the government's proposal for removal to Indian Territory, with most opposing it. Following passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, US soldiers forced the Cherokee west on the Trail of Tears. They built internment camps along the Hiwassee River as government forces rounded up the people. One of the largest such camps was Fort Cass near present-day Charleston, Tennessee, on the south bank of the Hiwassee River. Notability The Hiwassee River passes through downtown Murphy, North Carolina, where it flows past a site famous in Cherokee Indian mythology. The legend tells of a house-sized leech that could command the waters and use them to sweep hapless people to the bottom of the river and consume them. It was known as Tlanusi- yi, \\"The Leech Place.\\" The river then flows west from North Carolina into Tennessee, and along the way, the river is popular for whitewater rafting, whitewater canoeing, and whitewater kayaking. Recreational fishing is popular with several outfitters located near the river, and there is also industrial activity along the river, such as paper mills. The Hiwassee River flows under the large Interstate 75 bridge between McMinn and Bradley counties in Tennessee, which was the site of a fatal 99-vehicle accident in December 1990, during extremely foggy weather in the area of a paper mill in the valley.Note: Reduced visibility from naturally occurring fog contributed to the accident, which killed 12 people and injured 51. During the years since then, a huge system of warning signs and lights has been built on that stretch of Interstate 75 to warn automobiles and trucks against incidents of foul weather, with heavy rains and clouds. Many serious collisions had occurred in this area. See also *List of rivers of Tennessee  Notes  * Mooney, James. Myths of the Cherokee (1900, repr. 1995) * Duncan, Barbara R. and Riggs, Brett H.

BAX Global is an American international shipping company that is headquartered in Irvine, California, and has other major offices in Australia, Singapore, London, the Netherlands and Toledo, Ohio. The company which was founded in 1971 also operates an airline. After having been acquired by DB Logistics in January 2006, Bax Global is currently being integrated with Schenker, the land, sea, and air freight branch of DB Logistics. DB Logistics is the freight and logistics division of Deutsche Bahn, the State-owned German railway company. In July 2011 Schenker Inc. announced it would give up its airfreight activities and stop the use of the remaining 20 aircraft. History The company originally opened for business in ten cities in the United States on June 15, 1972, as Burlington Northern Air Freight, Inc. (BNAFI), a subsidiary of Burlington Northern Railroad. In 1982, BNAFI was acquired by the Pittston Company, which later became Brink's. In 1986, BNAFI changed its name to Burlington Air Express, repositioning itself as an overnight air express company. The company acquired WTC Air Freight in 1987. In 1997 the company changed its name to BAX Global, reflecting its expansion over all continents. On January 31, 2006, BAX Global was acquired from Brink's by DB Logistics, the Transportation and Logistics Division of Deutsche Bahn, for $1.1 billion. Burlington Air Express had a dedicated fleet of aircraft owned and operated by Air Transport International (ATI), a sister company also owned by Brinks. At the time of the sale of BAX Global to DB Logistics, ATI was sold to Cargo Holdings International. Cargo Holdings International is still under contract with BAX Global to provide dedicated lift. In July 2011 Schenker Inc. (DB Schenker Logistics) announced it would give up its domestic airfreight activities in the US, Canada and Mexico and therefore would stop using the remaining fleet of 20 aircraft in the coming week. The cargo began to be moved by trucks. This decision affected 700 employees and represented 10% of the Schenker Inc. business in this area. Performance BAX Global has 12,000 Employees, 500 offices in 133 countries, and makes a US$2.9 billion turnover; describes itself as specializing \\"in managing the movement of heavyweight packages and cargo of all shapes and sizes\\".

Brent was born into a prominent Catholic family, for which the Brent Society is named.Mike Flach, \\"Fr. Gould Receives Brent Award\\", Catholic Herald (Arlington, VA) 5/26/10, http://catholicherald.com/stories/Fr-Gould-receives-Brent-Award,13047 . Accessed August 16, 2013. The family lived in Woodstock, which was then in Stafford County, Virginia. His mother was Ann Carroll, whose brother John Carroll was the first Catholic Bishop appointed for the United States. Brent's father was a contractor and quarry owner. Early life Brent was born in 1764, on the Woodstock estate in Aquia, Virginia, to parents Robert Brent and Anne Carroll Brent. In 1789 or 1787, Brent married Mary Young--the daughter of Notley Young, a plantation owner in Prince George's County, Maryland. The couple resided on the Young family property after their marriage, and a few years later, Young's property was among those annexed by the Federal government for the new national capital, making Brent one of the first residents of the newly created Washington City. He soon took over his father's businesses, selling sandstone to the U.S. government for the White House, U.S. Capitol, and other early construction projects in the District of Columbia and thereby becoming one of the capital's most prominent merchants. Mayor of Washington, D.C. In 1802 Congress officially incorporated the city, including in its incorporation a directive for a mayor to be appointed annually by the President of the United States. On June 3, 1802 Thomas Jefferson wrote to Brent,Wyllie.lib.virginia.edu informing Brent of his intention to appoint Brent as mayor of the city. Brent replied accepting the appointment that same day: \\"Altho I feel great diffidence in the talents I possess for executing that duty, in a manner which may afford general satisfaction, yet feeling it a duty to contribute my feeble aid for the public service, I will venture upon its duties.\\"Wyllie.lib.virginia.edu Brent was reappointed to the position seven times by Jefferson and three times by James Madison, finally relinquishing the position in June 1812. During his tenure, he essentially created the city government from the ground up -- establishing markets, public schools, a police department, a fire department, and a system for taxation. In addition, since city planner Pierre L'Enfant had been dismissed before completion of his design, Brent was responsible for laying out many of the streets in the new city.Goode, James M. Capitol Losses: A Cultural History of Washington's Destroyed Buildings, Washington: Smithsonian Institution (2003) In ten terms as mayor, Brent took no salary. Other careers During his lifetime, Brent also served as Paymaster-General of the United States Army, Judge of the Orphan's Court for Washington County, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Public Schools. He was the first president of the Patriotic Bank and of the Columbia Manufacturing Co. Brentwood Mansion Brent's home was located on the southeast corner of the present 12th Street and Maryland Avenue SW in Washington, DC, but he owned land throughout the region, including parts of Montgomery County, Maryland, and Washington County. His landholdings were largely inherited through his father's family, his mother's family (the Carrolls of Maryland), and his father-in-law. In 1817 Brent had the Brentwood Mansion constructed in Washington County (the mansion site - Florida Ave and 6th Street NE is now part of the Gallaudet University campus in Northeast DC) as a present for his daughter Eleanor on her marriage to Congressman Joseph Pearson (Federalist - N.C.). Brentwood was designed by one of the Capitol's architects, Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The Prince George's County, Maryland, towns of Brentwood and North Brentwood and the DC neighborhood of Brentwood (which formed most of the original estate) take their names from his home. Brent died in Washington, DC, on 7 September 1819. Legacy Robert Brent Elementary School in Washington, D.C. is named in his honor.

The river traverses the Pisgah National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest, and drains much of the northeastern Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The river takes its name from the passenger pigeon, an extinct bird whose migration route once included the river valley in North Carolina. Course The Pigeon River arises in southeastern Haywood County, North Carolina, and flows basically northwest for most of its length. However, near Pressley Mountain it turns northeast for about four miles and in town of Canton, where it is utilized by the local paper mill, it turns north. After Canton it turns almost due west for about five miles, before resuming its northwest trend at about Clyde. From Canton, the Pigeon River flows roughly parallel to Interstate 40 for many miles. It is impounded by the Walters Dam of Progress Energy creating the long, narrow Waterville Lake. It enters Tennessee just after the village of Waterville, and continues with I-40 in the same valley northwestward through Hartford to Newport, where I-40 heads west, and the Pigeon River flows north into the French Broad River. History The Pigeon River dam was started in 1927 and was completed in 1930. The project was started by Carolina Power & Light and was completed by its affiliate Phoenix Electric Co. The concrete dam is high by 800 ft long. The brick power plant (visible from I-40) is actually from the dam. A tunnel long stretches from the dam to the power plant.http://sections.asce.org/n_carolina/CE%20Trails/web_pages/walters.htm, Retrieved on 2008/12/04. The floods following the series of storms spawned by Hurricanes Frances and Ivan in September 2004 have changed the character of the river. The rains lasted days and flooding was severe. Portions of the towns of Canton and Clyde were completely underwater, and there was significant damage to a large portion of both towns. Farther upstream the water levels reached unprecedented levels. Part of Interstate 40 collapsed into the river gorge because of the force of the floodwaters. This began when trees on the hill beside the highway fell in the river, followed by the soil the trees had held in place. The shoulder gave way, and a guardrail ended up just hanging. A large paper mill (once part of Champion International Paper and now the Blue Ridge Paper Company) in Canton was the primary source of considerable dioxin and particulate matter pollution discharged into the Pigeon River. The pollution situation in the river became a minor issue in the campaign for the 1988 Presidential election. As Al Gore started his first run for the Presidency, Newsweek magazine reported that Gore was pressured by North Carolina Senator Terry Sanford and Congressman Jamie Clarke to ease up on his campaign against Champion's wastewater discharges into the Pigeon River. According to Newsweek, Gore complied with their request, writing to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to oppose tighter water pollution control requirements. This issue came up again during the 2000 Presidential election. Recreation Recreational rafting is popular in two sections of the river, the Upper and the Lower. Both sections are found in Hartford, Tennessee. The Upper section begins at the powerhouse (located right on the North Carolina/Tennessee border) and features Class III-IV whitewater rapids.

The town derived its name from being near the mouth of the river Afan, which also gave its name to a medieval lordship. Today it is essentially a district of Port Talbot, covering the central and south western part of the town. Aberavon is also the name of the nearby Blue Flag beach and the parish covering the same area. History Little is known about Aberavon before Norman times. Bronze Age remains have been found in the hills behind the town. Roman artifacts have been found near the sea, including when the docks were being built in the 19th century.The History of Port Talbot Jones, S R 1988 About 1090 the invading Normans deposed Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the ruler of Glamorgan. His son, Caradog ab Iestyn, was the only Welsh lord to retain lands in Glamorgan - the area between the Afan and Neath rivers - and he became the first of the Lords of Afan. Caradoc built a castle in Aberafan near the present site of St Mary's Church. This wooden castle was burnt down in 1153 and Caradoc's son, Morgan ap Caradoc, rebuilt the castle in stone. In 1147 Cistercian monks founded the nearby Margam Abbey. In 1241 the Lordship passed to Morgan Fychan. His son Leisan D'Avene was the first known by a Norman-style surname. In 1304 Leisian D'Avene adopted the town's first charter. By 1373 the town passed into the hands of Edward le Despencer, Lord of Glamorgan, and the Lords of Afan had ceased to be.http://www.historicalporttalbot.com/timeline.html Port Talbot Historical Society timeline The English antiquarian John Leland made an extensive journey through Wales c.1536-39 of which he recorded an itinerary. He passed through Aberafan, which he describes as a \\"poor village\\" surrounded by barren ground, though he also describes the area as heavily wooded, not much of which remains today. He mentions the use of the river mouth as a port, a \\"haven for ships\\" as he puts it. His portrayal of Aberafan as a small, struggling village however suggests that the port was not in great use, especially as traffic to and from Margam Abbey would have ceased following its dissolution in 1536. Tradition has it that when the English Civil War broke out in 1648 Oliver Cromwell tried to seize the town charter as he passed through the town on his way to Pembroke, but it was hidden from him in a chopping block. Aberafan also endured the storm surge of 1607 and the Great Flood of 1768, when the river flowed into St Mary's Church. Aberavon was the birthplace of Dic Penderyn, a key figure in the Merthyr Rising of 1831. St Mary's Church is the site of his grave. The castle site was built over between 1876 and 1897 and its foundations now lie underneath the streets around the church. There have been reports of a ghost, a white lady seen floating above the castle ruins. The ghost is speculated to be Jane de Afan, the last occupant of Aberavon Castle. In the 18th century industry began to appear in the area. Industrialists worked with the Talbot family of Margam Castle to divert the bottom of the Afan river to its present bed, and in 1836 opened a new harbour east of the river Afan with the name of \\"Port Talbot\\". The following decades saw significant industrial and population growth for Aberafan and the surrounding areas with people coming from North and West Wales, South West England, and Ireland. A new borough of Aberavon came into being in 1861, though at the time it was still smaller than nearby Cwmafan or Taibach. Although there were small local collieries the area had become known for its metalworking industry. In the 1950s many of the sand dunes of Aberavon Beach disappeared as part of the development of the Sandfields estate, at this time a 1.25 mile sea wall was built primarily for sea defences. The estate was built to accommodate the growing population, especially the families of workers at the new Port Talbot Steelworks. From 1832 Aberavon had belonged to the Swansea parliamentary district of boroughs, uniting with Kenfig, Loughor, Neath and Swansea to return one member; since 1918 it has had its own UK parliament constituency. Its most famous MP was Ramsay MacDonald. Sir Geoffrey Howe, who although born locally never represented the town in the House of Commons, chose as his peerage title Lord Howe of Aberavon. Since 1999 it has had its own Welsh Assembly constituency. Aberavon hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1932 and 1966. Sport Aberavon RFC are a rugby union team, and play in the Welsh Premier Division.

Current occupants include Morrisons, Iceland Food Warehouse, Lidl, KFC, Dreams, Screwfix, Pound Stretcher, Pets at Home & Halfords superstores and a Warburtons bread factory in premises which were previously occupied by Panasonic. Government and politics The electoral ward of Aberavon is coterminous with district of Aberavon and is a part of the parliamentary constituency of Aberavon. Aberavon is bounded by the wards of Sandfields West and Sandfields East to the southwest; Baglan to the north; Port Talbot to the east and Margam to the south. The ward boundaries can be defined by the roads surrounding it which are the M4 Motorway to the north east; the A4241 to the north west; Afan Way to the southwest and the River Afan to the south east. The Aberavon ward can be roughly divided into two parts. There is the residential area to the southeastern part of the ward beside the River Afan. The north western area consists of areas of industrial estate land called the Baglan Industrial Park which includes a number of out of town retail premises as well as business and manufacturing premises.

La Araucana (also known in English as The Araucaniad) is a 16th-century epic poemAlonso de Ercilla y Z√∫√±iga: La Araucana (in Spanish). in Spanish about the Spanish Conquest of Chile by Alonso de Ercilla.Alonso de Ercilla y Z√∫√±iga, Spanish soldier and poet, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. It was considered the national epic of the Captaincy General of Chile and one of the most important works of the Spanish Golden Age (Siglo de Oro).Alonso de Ercilla y Z√∫√±iga, Spanish soldier and poet, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. The poem =Structure= La Araucana consists of 37 cantos that are distributed across the poem's three parts.Alonso de Ercilla y Z√∫√±iga: La Araucana (in Spanish). The first part was published in 1569; the second part appeared in 1578, and it was published along with the first part; the third part was published with the first and second parts in 1589. The poem shows Ercilla to be a master of the octava real (that is Italian ottava rima), the complicated stanza in which many other Renaissance epics in Castilian were written. A difficult eight-line unit of 11-syllable verses that are linked by a tight rhyme scheme abababcc, the octava real was a challenge few poets met. It had been adapted from Italian only in the 16th century, and it produces resonant, serious-sounding verse that is appropriate to epic themes. =Subject matter= The work describes the initial phase of the Arauco War which evolved from the Spanish conquest attempt of southern Chile. The war would come to shape the economics, politics and social life of Chile for centuries. Ercilla placed the lesser conquests of the Spanish in Chile at the core of his poem, because the author was a participant in the conquest and the story is based on his experiences there. =Development= On scraps of paper in the lulls of fighting, Ercilla jotted down versified octaves about the events of the war and his own part in it. These stanzas he later gathered together and augmented in number to form his epic. In the minds of the Chilean people La Araucana is a kind of Iliad that exalts the heroism, pride, and contempt of pain and death of the legendary Araucanian leaders and makes them national heroes today. Thus we see Ercilla appealing to the concept of the \\"noble savage,\\" which has its origins in classical authors and took on a new lease of life in the renaissance ‚Äì c.f. Montaigne's essay \\"Des Canibales\\", and was destined to have wide literary currency in European literature two centuries later. He had, in fact, created a historical poem of the war in Chile which immediately inspired many imitations. =Influences= La Araucana is deliberately literary and includes fantastical elements reminiscent of medieval stories of chivalry. The narrator is a participant in the story, at the time a new development for Spanish literature. Influences include Orlando furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Also features extended description of the natural landscape. La Araucana‚Äôs successes‚Äîand weaknesses‚Äîas a poem stem from the uneasy coexistence of characters and situations drawn from Classical sources (primarily Virgil and Lucan, both translated into Spanish in the 16th century) and Italian Renaissance poets (Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso) with material derived from the actions of contemporary Spaniards and Araucanians. The mixture of Classical and Araucanian motifs in La Araucana often strikes the modern reader as unusual, but Ercilla's turning native peoples into ancient Greeks, Romans, or Carthaginians was a common practice of his time. For Ercilla, the Araucanians were noble and brave‚Äîonly lacking, as their Classical counterparts did, the Christian faith. Caupolic√°n, the Indian warrior and chieftain who is the protagonist of Ercilla's poem, has a panoply of Classical heroes behind him. His valour and nobility give La Araucana grandeur, as does the poem's exaltation of the vanquished: the defeated Araucanians are the champions in this poem, which was written by one of the victors, a Spaniard. Ercilla's depiction of Caupolic√°n elevates La Araucana above the poem's structural defects and prosaic moments, which occur toward the end when Ercilla follows Tasso too closely and the narrative strays from the author's lived experience. Ercilla, the poet-soldier, eventually emerges as the true hero of his own poem, and he is the figure that gives the poem unity and strength. The story is considered to be the first or one of the first works of literature in the New World (cf. Cabeza de Vaca's Naufragios--\\"Shipwrecked\\" or \\"Castaways\\") for its fantastical/religious elements, it is arguable whether that is a \\"traveler's account\\" or actual literature; and Bernal D√≠az del Castillo's Historia verdadera de la conquista de Nueva Espa√±a (The Conquest of New Spain). La Araucana‚Äôs more dramatic moments also became a source of plays. But the Renaissance epic is not a genre that has, as a whole, endured well, and today Ercilla is little known and La Araucana is rarely read except by specialists and students of Spanish and Latin American literatures, and of course in Chile, where it is subject of special attention in the elementary schools education both in language and history. La Araucana makes Chile the only American country that was founded under the lights of an epic poem. The author Alonso de Ercilla was born into a noble family in Madrid, Spain.Alonso de Ercilla, Biograf√≠as y Vidas. He occupied several positions in the household of Prince Philip (later King Philip II of Spain), before requesting and receiving appointment to a military expedition to Chile to subdue the Araucanians of Chile, he joined the adventurers. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign; but, having quarrelled with a comrade, he was condemned to death in 1558 by his general, Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment, but Ercilla was speedily released and fought at the Battle of Quipeo (14 December 1558). He was then exiled to Peru and returned to Spain in 1562. Reception Ercilla embodied the Renaissance ideal of being at once a man of action and a man of letters as no other in his time was. He was adept at blending personal, lived experience with literary tradition. He was widely acclaimed in Spain. There is an episode in Miguel de Cervantes‚Äôs 17th-century novel Don Quixote, when a priest and barber inspect Don Quixote's personal library, to burn the books responsible for driving him to madness. La Araucana is one of the works which the men spare from the flames, as \\"one of the best examples of its genre\\", entirely Christian and honorable, and is proclaimed to be among the best poems in the heroic style ever written, good enough to compete with those of Ariosto and Tasso. Voltaire was much more critical, describing the poem as rambling and directionless and calling the author more barbarous than the Indians whom it is about. He does, however, express admiration for the speech in Canto II, which he compares favorably to Nestor's speech in the Iliad.Voltaire, en Essai Sur la Poesie Epique, prefacio de la edici√≥n virtual de La Araucana, Pehuen Editores. Events A revolt starts when the conqueror of Chile, Pedro de Valdivia is captured and killed by Mapuche (also known as Araucanian) Indians. Ercilla blames Valdivia for his own death, having mistreated the natives who had previously acquiesced to Spanish rule and provoking them into rebellion. However, having previously accepted the rule of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the Araucanians were now in revolt against their legitimate sovereign lord. This is the ethical position of Ercilla: sympathy for the Indians' suffering, admiration for the courage of their resistance, criticism of Spanish cruelty, but loyalty to and acceptance of the legitimacy of the Spanish cause (the legitimate rule of a duly-constituted prince and the extension of Christianity). Although Ercilla's purpose was to glorify Spanish arms, the figures of Araucanian chiefs, the strong Caupolic√°n, the brilliant Lautaro, the old and wise Colocolo and the proud Galvarino, have proved the most memorable. Key events include the capture and execution of Pedro de Valdivia; the death of the hero Lautaro in the Battle of Mataquito, and the execution of Caupolic√°n the Toqui for leading the revolt of the Araucanians (thanks to betrayal by one of their own); the encounter with a sorcerer who takes the narrator for a flight above the earth to see events happening in Europe and the Middle East; and the encounter with an Indian woman (Glaura) searching for her husband amongst the dead after a battlefield. This last is an indicator of the humanist side of Ercilla, and a human sympathy which he shows towards the indigenous people. The narrator claims that he attempted to have the life of the Indian chieftain spared. The historicity of some events and characters have been put into question. Historian Diego Barros Arana has argued that the female character Janequeo is an invention that passed down without scrutiny as historical in the chronicles of the Jesuits Alonso de Ovalle and Diego de Rosales.Diego Barros Arana, Historia general de Chile.

This approach to semantics is principally associated with Donald Davidson, and attempts to carry out for the semantics of natural language what Tarski's semantic theory of truth achieves for the semantics of logic. Truth-conditional theories of semantics attempt to define the meaning of a given proposition by explaining when the sentence is true. So, for example, because 'snow is white' is true iff (read 'if and only if') snow is white, the meaning of 'snow is white' is snow is white. History The first truth-conditional semantics was developed by Donald Davidson in Truth and Meaning (1967). It applied Tarski's semantic theory of truth to a problem it was not intended to solve, that of giving the meaning of a sentence. Criticism =Refutation from necessary truths= Scott Soames has harshly criticized truth-conditional semantics on the grounds that it is either wrong or uselessly circular. Under its traditional formulation, truth- conditional semantics gives every necessary truth precisely the same meaning, for all of them are true under precisely the same conditions (namely, all of them). And since the truth conditions of any unnecessarily true sentence are equivalent to the conjunction of those truth conditions and any necessary truth, any sentence means the same as its meaning plus a necessary truth. For example, if \\"snow is white\\" is true iff snow is white, then it is trivially the case that \\"snow is white\\" is true iff snow is white and 2+2=4, therefore under truth-conditional semantics \\"snow is white\\" means both that snow is white and that 2+2=4. Soames argues further that reformulations that attempt to account for this problem must beg the question. In specifying precisely which of the infinite number of truth-conditions for a sentence will count towards its meaning, one must take the meaning of the sentence as a guide. However, we wanted to specify meaning with truth-conditions, whereas now we are specifying truth-conditions with meaning, rendering the entire process fruitless.Soames, Scott. \\"Truth, Meaning and Understanding.\\" Philosophical Studies 65(1-2):17-35. =Refutation from deficiency= Michael Dummett (1975) has objected to Davidson's program on the grounds that such a theory of meaning will not explain what it is a speaker has to know in order for them to understand a sentence. Dummett believes a speaker must know three components of a sentence to understand its meaning: a theory of sense, indicating the part of the meaning that the speaker grasps; a theory of reference, which indicates what claims about the world are made by the sentence, and a theory of force, which indicates what kind of speech act the expression performs. Dummett further argues that a theory based on inference, such as Proof- theoretic semantics, provides a better foundation for this model than truth- conditional semantics does. =Pragmatic intrusion= Some authors working within the field of pragmatics have argued that linguistic meaning, understood as the output of a purely formal analysis of a sentence-type, underdetermines truth-conditions. These authors, sometimes labeled 'contextualists', argue that the role of pragmatic processes is not just pre-semantic (disambiguation or reference assignment) or post-semantic (drawing implicatures, determining speech acts), but is also key to determining the truth-conditions of an utterance. That is why some contextualists prefer to talk about 'truth- conditional pragmatics' instead of semantics.

He is one of baseball's best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area. Fredbird can also be seen on television once a week on the Cardinal's Kids TV show with former Cardinal Brad Thompson. In May 2015, a controversial photo of Fredbird posing with a \\"Police Lives Matter\\" sign was released to the public. The photo was posted to the St. Louis Police Department's Facebook page, but was removed at the team's request. The Cardinals then apologized for the photo, stating their mascot should not be involved in any political activity or social commentary. The team also said that Fredbird was not aware of the sign's content.

Co-authored by David Nussbaum and edited by Judith Jones, the book covers basic cooking principles and techniques and was designed to serve as a reference point for amateur cooks. Julia's Kitchen Wisdom was the 17th book written by Child and gained widespread popularity following the release of the 2009 film, 'Julie and Julia'.  Description  As the final book in Child‚Äôs oeuvre, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô is a compilation of her previous 16 cookbooks, forming a ‚Äúloose-leaf kitchen reference guide‚Äù. It is intended for use by home-cooks to answer cooking questions and solve common cooking problems, such as how long to cook a particular cut of meat, the most suitable accompaniments to serve with a certain dish, or different methods used to cook an ingredient. In the book‚Äôs introduction, Child suggests that the book is written for an audience relatively familiar with the language, techniques and equipment involved in home cooking. Child collaborated on the book with media executive and CEO of America‚Äôs Test Kitchen David Nussbaum, who helped Child gather and collate material from her extensive body of work, including previous cookbooks and television shows.‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô followed a television special by the same name, which aired in 2000.  Inspiration Behind ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô  Child‚Äôs education at Le Corden Bleu cooking school in France under the tutelage of chef Max Bugnard was influential in developing Child‚Äôs affinity with French cuisine. Her training and collaboration with friends Simone Beck and Louisette Betholle, whom she founded ‚ÄòL‚ÄôEcole Des Trois Gourmandes‚Äô (The School of the Three Hearty Eaters) with in 1951, can be credited with teaching Child many of the techniques and recipes she shares in ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô. Child‚Äôs first and only editor, Judith Jones, credits the increased interest of the American public in French culture and cuisine in the 1960s and 1970s to the success of Child‚Äôs books.An appreciation of French cooking and the widespread popularity of Julia Child may have inspired the publishing of ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô. As the final book authored by Child, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô collates the tips and instructions offered in her previous books in a succinct and simplistic manner. It was inspired by the ‚Äútrials, remedies, and errors‚Äù recorded in Child‚Äôs own notebook and is designed to serve as a useful reference for home-cooks. Child‚Äôs earlier books, ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking: Volume I and II‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Way to Cook‚Äô were devised as comprehensive guides that offered highly detailed instruction on techniques, cooking methods, and numerous recipes to educate readers on the fundamentals of French cuisine. According to Child, these books were geared towards ‚Äúan intelligent, reasonably sophisticated audience which likes good food and cooking‚Äù. ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô is Child‚Äôs most accessible book, distilling the information offered in her previous works into short explanations, methods of problem solving, and master recipes to guide readers. ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô was inspired by a two-hour television special of the same name which aired in 2000 on PBS.  Structure of 'Julia's Kitchen Wisdom'  Unlike her previous, more thorough cookbooks, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô is structured in a simplistic manner, designed as an easy-to-follow reference guide. It is one of Child‚Äôs shortest cookbooks. The book has a particular focus on basic cooking techniques and contains an array of master recipes to guide home-cooks. The book is divided into categories such as ‚ÄòSoups and Two Mother Sauces‚Äô, ‚ÄòSalads and Their Dressings‚Äô, ‚ÄòMeats, Poultry and Fish‚Äô, and so on. Within each main category, there is a master recipe, four to five variations of the master recipe, relevant techniques, and useful tips.The book also contains an extensive index, approximately 20 pages long, where ingredients and their corresponding recipes are alphabetised. The index allows readers to look up a specific ingredient or technique to find answers to common questions relatively quickly. The book is considered popular as it covers many facets of home- cooking in a straightforward manner, despite its relatively brief nature.  The Writing of ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô  For her final cookbook, Child collaborated on ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô with journalist, media executive and Chief Executive Officer of independent media company America‚Äôs Test Kitchen, David Nussbaum. Child and Nussbaum previously collaborated on Child‚Äôs second- to-last published cookbook, ‚ÄòJulia and Jacques Cooking at Home‚Äô, where Nussbaum worked as the book‚Äôs writer. He assisted by drafting recipes and recording commentary between Julia Child and chef, television personality and author, Jacques Pepin. Nussbaum contributed to the creation of ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô by compiling content from Child‚Äôs previous works. As the book consists of a number of simplified recipes from Child‚Äôs former, more comprehensive books, such as ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking‚Äô, and Child‚Äôs own notes, tips and findings from her culinary experience, Nussbaum was responsible for amassing and collating potential content for the book. According to Child, Nussbaum assisted her by offering ‚Äúoutlines and suggestions‚Äù for the cookbook. Child credits Nussbaum with ensuring ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô was published by its deadline. In the book‚Äôs ‚ÄòAcknowledgments‚Äô section, Child also makes mention of her editor, Judith Jones, who edited all of Child‚Äôs cookbooks. Jones has been credited with introducing American audiences to Julia Child with the publishing of Child‚Äôs first cookbook, ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking‚Äô in 1961.  'Julia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô ‚Äì the Television Special  Following the release of Child‚Äôs first cookbook ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking‚Äô in 1961, educational television station WGBH in the United States (now known as PBS) offered her a television series entitled ‚ÄòThe French Chef‚Äô, where she demonstrated how to cook French recipes in half-hour episodes. Child went on to host numerous other television shows inspired by her popular cookbooks. Some of these included ‚ÄòJulia Child and Company‚Äô (1978-79), ‚ÄòBaking with Julia‚Äô (1996-98), and the two-hour special ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô' which inspired the book. The television special, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô, aired in 2000 and was a two-hour compilation of videos from Child‚Äôs earlier television shows and specials. In between snippets of Child demonstrating recipes, there are brief clips of her peers discussing the impact Child‚Äôs work ‚Äì both her books and television shows ‚Äì have had on their own careers. The special is seen as more of a tribute to Child and her enduring legacy as opposed to an instructional cooking show. Like the book, the show is organised by categories, such as ‚ÄòVegetables‚Äô and ‚ÄòEggs‚Äô and incorporates information on techniques and tips from Child. The accompanying book is designed to be more instructional than the show itself.  Response to 'Julia's Kitchen Wisdom'  'Julia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô garnered positive responses globally and gained increased popularity following the release of the film ‚ÄòJulie and Julia‚Äô in 2009. It was well received in the food community given its simple and easy-to-follow structure. It was also popular as it differed from traditional cookbooks, like Child‚Äôs previous works, that only offer recipes consisting of an ingredient list and method. ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô instead offers recipes along with explanations of technique, advice on what utensils and equipment to use, recipe variations and tips to solve common cooking problems. The book‚Äôs accessible nature and characterisation as a ‚Äòbasic‚Äô cookbook suited for home-cooks contributed to the book‚Äôs success and endurance as a timeless kitchen reference guide. The popularity of Julia Child as a chef, home-cook and television personality also contributed to the book‚Äôs success. At the time of publishing, Child was renowned both within and beyond the food industry and was lauded for her ability to encourage amateur cooks to attempt complex meals and techniques. Her reputation of being a reliable source of cooking advice, understanding and know-how is likely to have been influential in eliciting the positive response ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô received. Julia Child, 1978  Enduring Impact of ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô  Julia Child is remembered for the enduring legacy she has left on the food world. Her cookbooks and television shows have been credited with introducing French cuisine to America and revolutionising home-cooking in both the United States and globally. Whilst her earlier works are revered for their thorough and accurate explanations of French cooking, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô remains popular due to its‚Äô accessibility for amateur cooks. According to Child, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô is not intended to take the place of her more comprehensive books, such as ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking‚Äô, but rather serves as an all-purpose guide for basic cooking techniques and recipes. The release of Nora Ephron‚Äôs 2009 film, ‚ÄòJulie and Julia‚Äô led to a resurgence in interest in Child‚Äôs works. The film tells the true stories of Julia Child and Julie Powell, a woman who attempts to cook all 524 recipes from ‚ÄòMastering the Art of French Cooking‚Äô in one year. Following the film‚Äôs release, ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô, was propelled to number one on New York Times paperback Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous list. The success of ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs Kitchen Wisdom‚Äô five years after her death highlights the enduring popularity of Child‚Äôs final book amongst home-cooks and speaks to the lasting impacts of Child‚Äôs own legacy. Julia Child is remembered as a teacher, role model and mentor within the food industry. Her first television series ‚ÄòThe French Chef‚Äô, which aired in 1963, has been credited with redefining discourse surrounding ‚Äògourmet dining‚Äô by introducing French cuisine to American home cooks.

She used this to fund a wide range of causes, notably a musical salon where her prot√©g√©s included Debussy and Ravel, and numerous public health projects in Paris, where she lived most of her life. Singer entered into two marriages that were unconsummated, and openly enjoyed many high-profile relationships with women. Early life and family Winnaretta Singer was the twentieth of the 24 children of Isaac Singer. Her mother was his Parisian-born second wife, Isabella Eug√©nie Boyer. Winnaretta was born in Yonkers, New York. After the American Civil War, the Singer family moved to Paris, where they remained until the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The family then settled in England, first in London, and then Paignton, Devon where they moved to Oldway Mansion a 115-room palace built by her father. =Relatives= Winnaretta's older brother, Adam Mortimer Singer, became one of England's landed gentry. Her younger sister, Isabelle-Blanche (1869-1896) married Jean, duc Decazes. Their daughter, Daisy Fellowes, was raised by Winnaretta after Isabelle-Blanche's death and became a noted socialite, magazine editor, and fashion trendsetter. Winnaretta's younger brother, Paris Singer, was one of the architects and financiers of the resort of Palm Beach, Florida; he had a son by Isadora Duncan. Another brother, Washington Singer, became a substantial donor to the University College of the southwest of England, which later became the University of Exeter; one of the university's buildings is named in his honor.  Marriages and relationships  John Singer Sargent (1856‚Äì1925). Princesse Louis de Scey-Montbeliard, 1889 After Isaac Singer's death in 1875, Isabelle and her children moved back to Paris. Although known within private social circles to be a lesbian, Winnaretta married at the age of 22 to Prince Louis de Scey-Montb√©liard fr. The marriage was annulled in 1892 by the Catholic church, five years after a wedding night that reportedly included the bride's climbing atop an armoire and threatening to kill the groom if he came near her. In 1893, at the age of 28, she stepped companionably into an equally chaste marriage with the 59-year-old Prince Edmond de Polignac (1834‚Äì1901), a gay amateur composer. Although it was a mariage blanc (unconsummated marriage), or indeed a lavender marriage (a union between a gay man and a lesbian), it was based on profound love, mutual respect, understanding, and artistic friendship, expressed especially through their love of music. The same year Singer exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. =Lesbian relationships= She had affairs with numerous women, never making attempts to conceal them, and never going for any great length of time without a female lover. She had these affairs during her own marriages and afterwards, and often with other married women. The affronted husband of one of her lovers once stood outside the princess's Venetian palazzo, declaring, \\"If you are half the man I think you are, you will come out here and fight me.\\" Polignac had a relationship with painter Romaine Brooks, which had begun in 1905, and which effectively ended her affair with Olga de Meyer, who was married at the time and whose godfather (and purported biological father) was Edward VII. Composer and conductor Ethel Smyth fell deeply in love with her during their affair. In the early 1920s Polignac became involved with pianist Renata Borgatti. From 1923 to 1933 her lover was the British socialite and novelist Violet Trefusis, with whom she had a loving but often turbulent relationship. Alvilde Chaplin, the future wife of the author James Lees-Milne, was involved with Singer from 1938 to 1943; the two women were living together in London at the time of Winnaretta's death. Patron of the arts In 1894 the Prince and Princesse de Polignac established a salon in Paris in the music room of their mansion on Avenue Henri-Martin (today, Avenue Georges-Mandel). The Polignac salon came to be known as a haven for avant-garde music. First performances of Chabrier, d'Indy, Debussy, Faur√©, and Ravel took place in the Polignac salon. The young Ravel dedicated his piano work, Pavane pour une infante d√©funte, to the Princesse de Polignac. Many of Marcel Proust's evocations of salon culture were born during his attendance at concerts in the Polignac drawing room. After her husband's death, Winnaretta Singer-Polignac used her fortune to benefit the arts, sciences, and letters. She decided to honor his memory by commissioning several works of the young composers of her time, amongst others Igor Stravinsky's Renard, Erik Satie's Socrate (by her intercession Satie was kept out of jail when he was composing this work), Darius Milhaud's Les Malheurs d'Orph√©e, Francis Poulenc's Concerto for Two Pianos and Organ Concerto, Jean Fran√ßaix's Le Diable bo√Æteux and S√©r√©nade pour douze instruments, Kurt Weill's Second Symphony, and Germaine Tailleferre's First Piano Concerto. Manuel de Falla's El retablo de maese Pedro was premiered there, with the harpsichord part performed by Wanda Landowska.(Kahan 2003) In addition to Proust and Antonio de La G√°ndara, the Princesse de Polignac's salon was frequented by Isadora Duncan, Jean Cocteau, Claude Monet, Sergei Diaghilev, and Colette. She was also patron to many others, including Nadia Boulanger, Clara Haskil, Dinu Lipatti, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Armande de Polignac, Ethel Smyth, Le Corbusier, Adela Maddison, the Ballets Russes, l'Op√©ra de Paris, and the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris. In addition to performing as pianist and organist in her own salon, she was an accomplished painter who exhibited in the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts. One canvas eventually appeared in the showcase of an art gallery, advertised as being a Manet. Public service Winnaretta Singer-Polignac was also an important leader in the development of public housing in Paris. Her 1911 building of a housing project for the working poor at Rue de la Colonie, in the 13th arrondissement, was considered to be a model for future projects. In the 1920s and 1930s, Singer commissioned the architect Le Corbusier to rebuild or construct several public shelters for Paris's Salvation Army. The plans of Le Corbusier's Salvation Army hostel in Paris show a private apartment at the top floor for \\"Miss Singer\\". With her friend Madeleine Zillhardt, she bought the barge 'Louise-Catherine' named in memory of Zillhardt's companion Louise Catherine Breslau. The boat was rehabilitated by Le Corbusier in 1929 in order to be a refuge of the Salvation Army for the homeless in winter and a summer camp for children, moored in Paris on the banks of the Seine, at the Pont des Arts and at the Pont d'Austerlitz. During World War I, working with Marie Curie, Singer-Polignac helped convert private limousines into mobile radiology units to help wounded soldiers at the front. During the inter-war period, Singer-Polignac worked with Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan and assisted in the construction of a 360-bed hospital destined to provide medical care to middle- class workers. The result of this effort is the Foch Hospital, located in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris, France. The hospital also includes a school of nursing and is one of the top-ranked hospitals in France, especially for renal transplants. It has remained true to its origins and stayed a private not-for- profit institution that still serves the Paris community. It is managed by the Fondation m√©dicale Franco-am√©ricaine du Mont-Val√©rien, commonly called Fondation Foch. Fondation Singer-Polignac After Singer-Polignac's death, her legacy of enlightened generosity was carried on through the work of the Fondation Singer-Polignac. Created in 1928, the goals of the foundation are the promotion, through gifts and bourses, of science, literature, the arts, culture, and French philanthropy. The Foundation continued to present concerts and recitals in the Polignac mansion's music room. The performances were first organized by Nadia Boulanger, who presented programs that juxtaposed early music and modern compositions. After Boulanger's death in 1979, the composer Jean Fran√ßaix took over the organization of the concert series. Notes Sources *Kahan, Sylvia.

The band's two main members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, first played together in Los Angeles as part of the group Giant Sand. They have recorded a number of albums on Quarterstick Records, while their 2005 EP In the Reins, recorded with Iron & Wine, reached the Billboard 200 album charts. Their musical style is influenced by traditional Latin sounds of mariachi, conjunto, cumbia, and tejano mixed with country, jazz, and post-rock. The band is named for the border town of Calexico, California, and has been described by some as \\"desert noir\\". History =Formation= Joey Burns Calexico had its origins in 1990 when Joey Burns, who was studying music at the University of California, Irvine, met up with John Convertino, who was playing drums with Howe Gelb in Giant Sand. Burns joined them, after first playing upright bass on a European tour. Giant Sand moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1994. Burns and Convertino formed the Friends of Dean Martin (later the Friends of Dean Martinez) which scored a record deal with Sub Pop. However, the pair split up with Bill Elm, the co-founder of The Friends of Dean Martinez in 1996. The band subsequently became a kind of indie rhythm section for hire, working with the likes of Victoria Williams, Bill Janovitz, Barbara Manning and Richard Buckner before forming Calexico. =Early years= Calexico first recorded Spoke in 1995 for German independent label Hausmusik with a limited edition of 2,000 copies. At that point the band was still called Spoke and the album was technically self-titled. After the band signed with Quarterstick Records (a subsidiary of Touch and Go Records) and changed their name to Calexico, Spoke was reissued by that label in 1997. Burns and Convertino also collaborated with Gelb and Lisa Germano on the album Slush released under the name OP8 that same year. Their second album The Black Light was released in 1998. This was a concept album about the desert of Arizona and northern Mexico and received excellent reviews, with the critic from the Wall Street Journal rating it as one of the best records of the year. The band built their profile by touring as support acts for bands such as Pavement, the Dirty Three and Lambchop. Calexico has regularly played festivals such as the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Hurricane Festival and All Tomorrow's Parties. The Road Map album was a limited recording released in 1999 for sale only at Calexico's live shows. Calexico released its third album Hot Rail in May 2000 featuring the addition of horns and violin to their sound. The duo was busy in 2000 as they also appeared on a Giant Sand record called Chore of Enchantment as well as a tour only record Travelall. At the end of 2000, Burns and Convertino joined with two French friends Na√Øm Amor and Thomas Belh√¥m to record \\"T√™te A T√™te\\" (Wabana Records, 2001) released under moniker ABBC (Amor/Belhom/Burns/Convertino). Calexico released two collections of rarities during 2001. Even My Sure Things Fall Through collected outtakes from previous albums, B-sides, remixes and material previously unreleased in the US. The album also featured Mariachi Luz de Luna who frequently played live with the duo. The Aerocalexico album was sold exclusively at their gigs in 2001. Their songs \\"Ballad Of Cable Hogue\\" and \\"Service And Repair\\" were featured in the 2001 German comedy movie Lammbock. = Recent years = Released in 2006, Garden Ruin is Calexico's fifth studio album and was produced by JD Foster. The sound strays slightly from earlier works, focusing less on the horn section and placing more emphasis on guitar and vocal tracks, giving the whole album a more mainstream sound. Their sixth studio LP is called Carried to Dust, featuring Sam Beam of Iron & Wine, Douglas McCombs of Tortoise and Pieta Brown. It was released in the US via Touch & Go Records on September 9, 2008. The album was positively reviewed. On October 16, 2008, a three-song live acoustic video performance premiered on LiveDaily Sessions, featuring Joey Burns performing the songs \\"Two Silver Trees\\", \\"Writer's Minor Holiday\\" and \\"Man Made Lake\\". In 2009, the song \\"Banderilla\\" was featured in an episode of AMC's Breaking Bad. In 2010, Calexico released the soundtrack of the documentary Circo. The band also spent part of 2010 touring with Arcade Fire along the US west coast. In May 2011, their song \\"Slowness\\" was dedicated by Gabrielle Giffords to her husband astronaut Mark Kelly as the wake up song aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour on its final flight. Algiers was released 11 September 2012 on Anti-Records and City Slang (Europe). Algiers is titled after the neighborhood of New Orleans where it was recorded, Algiers, New Orleans. This was Calexico‚Äôs seventh studio album. In April 2015, Calexico released the album Edge of the Sun. The album features guest appearances by Neko Case, Sam Beam (Iron & Wine), Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), Gaby Moreno, Carla Morrison and members of the Greek instrumental group Takim. This album was also released on Anti-Records. In 2016, the band performed on the main stage at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival.\\" 2016 Edmonton Folk Fest an understated, wonderful weekend\\". Edmonton Sun, By Fish Griwkowsky. August 07, 2016 In 2018, Calexico released The Thread That Keeps Us. The album was recorded in Northern California in a home-turned-studio called the Panoramic House. The band called this space ‚ÄúThe Phantom Ship‚Äù. The album was co- produced by their longtime engineer Craig Schumacher. Calexico and Schumacher recruited musicians from all across the globe to find an earthy yet expansive sound.Calexico 'The Thread That Keeps Us' Out Now, ANTI- Press Release of January 29, 2018 ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a little more chaos and noise in the mix than what we‚Äôve done in the past,‚Äù Burns points out. The rugged coastline of northern California impacted the making of The Thread That Keeps Us. This sound is heard throughout the album. The album was released by Anti-Records and City Slang on January 26, 2018. The Thread That Keeps Us was #2 on the Alternative Albums retail chart and #5 on the Americana / Folk Chart in the USA in its first week of sales (Billboard).

Their debut album Spoke received three stars from AllMusic, which called the album ‚Äúa Santa Fe rummage sale of sounds.‚Äù Their second album The Black Light, released in 1998, gained the band notoriety and attention. AllMusic praised this sophomore effort and gave the album 4.5 stars. The album was praised for being ‚Äúdeeper and richer than their debut.‚Äù This effort showed Calexico‚Äôs quick maturity into a band that poised for a long career. Hot Rail was released in 2000 and continued off the success of previous albums. Pitchfork gave the album a 7.9. The band then took a brief hiatus and released their next studio album in 2003, Feast of Wire. This album can be viewed as their breakthrough, receiving incredible reviews across the board. The album received an 8.9 from Pitchfork, which described it as ‚Äúthe album we always knew they had in them but feared they would never make.‚Äù Again after another hiatus, Calexico returned in 2006 with Garden Ruin.

The name is from Greek anoplo meaning \\"unarmed\\" and gaster meaning \\"stomach\\". With a circumglobal distribution in tropical and cold-temperate waters, the family contains only two very similar species in one genus, with no known close relatives. Species The currently recognized species in this genus are: * Anoplogaster brachycera Kotlyar, 1986 (shorthorn fangtooth) * Anoplogaster cornuta (Valenciennes, 1833) (common fangtooth) Description While understandably named for their disproportionately large, fang-like teeth and unapproachable visage, fangtooths are actually quite small and harmless to humans: the larger of the two species, the common fangtooth, reaches a maximum length of just ; the shorthorn fangtooth is less than half this size though currently known only from juvenile specimens. The head is small with a large jaw and appears haggard, riddled with mucous cavities delineated by serrated edges and covered by a thin skin. The eyes are relatively small, set high on the head; the entire head is a dark brown to black and is strongly compressed laterally, deep anteriorly and progressively more slender towards the tail. The fins are small, simple, and spineless; the scales are embedded in the skin and take the form of thin plates. As compensation for reduced eyes, the lateral line is well-developed and appears as an open groove along the flanks. In adults, the largest two fangs of the lower jaw are so long, the fangtooths have evolved a pair of opposing sockets on either side of the brain to accommodate the teeth when the mouth is closed. According to BBC's Blue Planet, episode \\"The Deep\\", the fangtooth has the largest teeth of any fish in the ocean, proportionate to body size, and are so large, they can never close their mouths. The juveniles are morphologically quite different - unlike the adults, they possess long spines on the head and preoperculum, larger eyes, a functional gas bladder, long and slender gill rakers, much smaller and depressible teeth, and are a light gray in colour. These differences once caused the two life stages to be classed as distinct species, with one in another genus; Caulolepis. A. cornuta Ecology The pelagic fangtooths are among the deepest-living fish, found as far as down. They are more commonly found between , however, and juveniles apparently stay within the upper reaches of this range. They may undergo diel migrations as is common with many deep-sea fish: by day these fish remain in the gloomy depths and towards evening they rise to the upper layers of the water column to feed by starlight, returning to deep water by daybreak. Fangtooths may form small schools or go alone. They are thought to use contact chemoreception to find prey, relying on luck to bump into something edible. The smaller teeth and longer gill rakers of juveniles suggest they feed primarily by filtering zooplankton from the water, while the deeper-living adults target other fish and squid. The fangtooths' oversized teeth and mouths are a common feature among the miniature beasts of the deep (cf. viperfishes, daggertooths, bristlemouths, barracudinas, anglerfishes), thought to be an advantage in these lean waters where anything encountered (even if it is larger than the fish) must be considered a possible meal. The fangtooths in turn are preyed upon by other large pelagic fish, such as tuna and marlin and some species of sharks. Fangtooths are known to be robust when compared to many other deep-sea fish; they have been kept alive for months in aquariums despite conditions which are significantly different from their usual deep-sea habitat. Reproduction Fangtooths have planktonic larvae and are assumed to not be egg guarders; spawning frequency and time are not certain, but some activity has been reported from June‚ÄìAugust. The juveniles of common fangtooths begin to assume adult form from about in length, at which time they begin to descend into deeper water. Onset of maturity is not known, but common fangtooths are known to be mature at . They are probably slow-growing, as are most deep-sea fish.

The greatest patron of Spanish art and culture during this period was King Philip II (1556-1598), whose royal palace, El Escorial, invited the attention of some of Europe's greatest architects and painters such as El Greco, who infused Spanish art with foreign styles and helped create a uniquely Spanish style of painting. Spanish literature blossomed as well, most famously demonstrated in the work of Miguel de Cervantes, the author of Don Quixote de la Mancha. Spain's most prolific playwright, Lope de Vega, wrote possibly one thousand plays during his lifetime, of which over four hundred survive to the present day. Diego Vel√°zquez, regarded as one of the most influential painters of European history and a greatly respected artist in his own time, was patronized by King Philip IV and his chief minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares. The legacy of Diego Vel√°zquez includes several portraits that demonstrate his style and skill. Some of Spain's greatest music is regarded as having been written in the period. Such composers as Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, Crist√≥bal de Morales, Francisco Guerrero, Luis de Mil√°n and Alonso Lobo helped to shape Renaissance music and the styles of counterpoint and polychoral music, and their influence lasted far into the Baroque period which resulted in a revolution of music. Background and periodization The origins of the Golden Age can be traced back to 1492, with the end of the Reconquista, the Spanish voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World, and the publication of Antonio de Nebrija's Grammar of the Castilian Language. It roughly ended with the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ended the Franco-Spanish War of 1635 to 1659. Some extend the Golden age up to 1681 with the death of the Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, the last great writer of the age. It is associated roughly with the reigns of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, Philip II of Spain, Philip III of Spain, and Philip IV of Spain when Spain was the most powerful power in the world. It can be divided into a Plateresque/Renaissance period and an early Baroque period. This period is marked by abuses, including genocide and inhumane unpaid labor, committed by Spain against the natives of areas it colonized.https://www.jstor.org/stable/20078712?seq=1Halili, M. C. N. (2004). Philippine History. Rex Bookstore. Painting Toledo by El Greco Spain, in the time of the Italian Renaissance, had seen few great artists come to its shores. The Italian holdings and relationships made by Queen Isabella's husband and later Spain's sole monarch, Ferdinand of Aragon, launched a steady traffic of intellectuals across the Mediterranean between Valencia, Seville, and Florence. Luis de Morales, one of the leading exponents of Spanish Mannerist painting, retained a distinctly Spanish style in his work, reminiscent of medieval art. Spanish art, particularly that of Morales, contained a strong mark of mysticism and religion that was encouraged by the counter-reformation and the patronage of Spain's strongly Catholic monarchs and aristocracy. Spanish rule of Naples was important for making connections between Italian and Spanish art, with many Spanish administrators bringing Italian works back to Spain. =El Greco= Known for his unique expressionistic style that met with both puzzlement and admiration, El Greco (which means \\"The Greek\\") was not Spanish, having been born Domenikos Theotokopoulos in Crete. He studied the great Italian masters of his time ‚Äì Titian, Tintoretto, and Michelangelo ‚Äì when he lived in Italy from 1568 to 1577. According to legend, he asserted that he would paint a mural that would be as good as one of Michelangelo's, if one of the Italian artist's murals was demolished first. El Greco quickly fell out of favor in Italy, but soon found a new home in the city of Toledo, in central Spain. He was influential in creating a style based on impressions and emotion, featuring elongated fingers and vibrant color and brushwork. Uniquely, his works featured faces that captured expressions of sombre attitudes and withdrawal while still having his subjects bear witness to the terrestrial world.J.H. Elliott. \\"Imperial Spain: 1469-1716\\". Penguin Books, 1963. p.385 His paintings of the city of Toledo became models for a new European tradition in landscapes, and influenced the work of later Dutch masters. Spain at this time was an ideal environment for the Venetian-trained painter. Art was flourishing in the empire and Toledo was a great place to get commissions. Las Meninas (1656, English: The Maids of Honour) by Diego Vel√°zquez =Diego Vel√°zquez= Diego Vel√°zquez was born on June 6, 1599, in Seville. Both parents were from minor nobility. He was the oldest of six children. Vel√°zquez is widely regarded as one of Spain's most important and influential artists. He was a court painter for King Philip IV and found an increasingly high demand for his portraits from statesmen, aristocrats, and clergymen across Europe. His portraits of the King, his chief minister, the Count-duke of Olivares, and the Pope himself demonstrated a belief in artistic realism and a style comparable to many of the Dutch masters. In the wake of the Thirty Years' War, Vel√°zquez met the Marqu√©s de Spinola and painted his famous Surrender of Breda celebrating Spinola's earlier victory. Spinola was struck by his ability to express emotion through realism in both his portraits and landscapes; his work in the latter, in which he launched one of European art's first experiments in outdoor lighting, became another lasting influence on Western painting. Vel√°zquez's friendship with Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo, a leading Spanish painter of the next generation, ensured the enduring influence of his artistic approach. Vel√°zquez's most famous painting is the celebrated Las Meninas, in which the artist includes himself as one of the subjects. The Birth of the Virgin by Francisco de Zurbar√°n =Francisco de Zurbar√°n= The religious element in Spanish art, in many circles, grew in importance with the counter-reformation. The austere, ascetic, and severe work of Francisco de Zurbar√°n exemplified this thread in Spanish art, along with the work of composer Tom√°s Luis de Victoria. Philip IV actively patronized artists who agreed with his views on the counter-reformation and religion. The mysticism of Zurbar√°n's work - influenced by Saint Theresa of Avila - became a hallmark of Spanish art in later generations. Influenced by Michelangelo da Caravaggio and the Italian masters, Zurbar√°n devoted himself to an artistic expression of religion and faith. His paintings of St. Francis of Assisi, the immaculate conception, and the crucifixion of Christ reflected a third facet of Spanish culture in the seventeenth century, against the backdrop of religious war across Europe. Zurbar√°n broke from Vel√°zquez's sharp realist interpretation of art and looked, to some extent, to the emotive content of El Greco and the earlier mannerist painters for inspiration and technique, though Zurbar√°n respected and maintained the lighting and physical nuance of Vel√°zquez. It is unknown whether Zurbar√°n had the opportunity to copy the paintings of Caravaggio; at any rate, he adopted Caravaggio's realistic use of chiaroscuro. The painter who may have had the greatest influence on his characteristically severe compositions was Juan S√°nchez Cot√°n.G√°llego and Gudiol 1987, p. 15. Polychrome sculpture‚Äîwhich by the time of Zurbar√°n's apprenticeship had reached a level of sophistication in Seville that surpassed that of the local painters‚Äîprovided another important stylistic model for the young artist; the work of Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s is especially close to Zurbar√°n's in spirit. He painted directly from nature, and he made great use of the lay-figure in the study of draperies, in which he was particularly proficient. He had a special gift for white draperies; as a consequence, the houses of the white-robed Carthusians are abundant in his paintings. To these rigid methods, Zurbar√°n is said to have adhered throughout his career, which was prosperous, wholly confined to Spain, and varied by few incidents beyond those of his daily labour. His subjects were mostly severe and ascetic religious vigils, the spirit chastising the flesh into subjection, the compositions often reduced to a single figure. The style is more reserved and chastened than Caravaggio's, the tone of color often quite bluish. Exceptional effects are attained by the precisely finished foregrounds, massed out largely in light and shade. =Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo= Murillo Bartolom√© Esteban Murillo began his art studies under Juan del Castillo in Seville. Murillo became familiar with Flemish painting; the great commercial importance of Seville at the time ensured that he was also subject to influences from other regions. His first works were influenced by Zurbar√°n, Jusepe de Ribera and Alonso Cano, and he shared their strongly realist approach. As his painting developed, his more important works evolved towards the polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, demonstrated especially in his Roman Catholic religious works. In 1642, at the age of 26 he moved to Madrid, where he most likely became familiar with the work of Vel√°zquez, and would have seen the work of Venetian and Flemish masters in the royal collections; the rich colors and softly modeled forms of his subsequent work suggest these influences.Bartolome Esteban Murillo, Britannica online Encyclopedia, retrieved 30 Sept. 2007. He returned to Seville in 1645. In that year, he painted thirteen canvases for the monastery of St. Francisco el Grande in Seville which gave his reputation a well-deserved boost. Following the completion of a pair of pictures for the Seville Cathedral, he began to specialise in the themes that brought him his greatest successes, the Virgin and Child, and the Immaculate Conception. After another period in Madrid, from 1658 to 1660, he returned to Seville, where he died. Here he was one of the founders of the Academia de Bellas Artes (Academy of Fine Arts), sharing its direction, in 1660, with the architect, Francisco Herrera the Younger. This was his period of greatest activity, and he received numerous important commissions, among them the altarpieces for the Augustinian monastery, the paintings for Santa Mar√≠a la Blanca (completed in 1665), and others. =Other significant painters= *Luis de Morales *Jos√© de Ribera *Juan S√°nchez Cot√°n *Juan van der Hamen *Francisco Ribalta *Juan de Vald√©s Leal *Juan Carre√±o de Miranda *Claudio Coello Sculpture Entombment by Juan de Juni =Sculptors of the Renaissance= *Alonso Berruguete *Felipe Bigarny *Dami√† Forment *Juan de Juni *Bartolom√© Ord√≥√±ez *Diego de Silo√© =Sculptors of the Early Baroque period= *Alonso Cano *Gregorio Fern√°ndez *Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s *Pedro de Mena *Juan de Mesa Architecture =Palace of Charles V= Panoramic view of the lower level patio of the Palace The Palace of Charles V is a Renacentist construction, located on the top of the hill of the Assabica, inside the Nasrid fortification of the Alhambra. It was commanded by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who wished to establish his residence close to the Alhambra palaces. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V intended to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. The project was given to Pedro Machuca, an architect whose biography and influences are poorly understood. Even if accounts that place Machuca in the atelier of Michelangelo are accepted, at the time of the construction of the palace in 1527 the latter had yet to design the majority of his architectural works. At the time, Spanish architecture was immersed in the Plateresque style, still with traces of Gothic origin. Machuca built a palace corresponding stylistically to Mannerism, a mode still in its infancy in Italy. =El Escorial= The library of El Escorial El Escorial is a historical residence of the king of Spain. It is one of the Spanish royal sites and functions as a monastery, royal palace, museum, and school. It is located about northwest of the Spanish capital, Madrid, in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. El Escorial comprises two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: El Real Monasterio de El Escorial itself and La Granjilla de La Fresneda, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about five kilometres away. These sites have a dual nature; that is to say, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they were places in which the temporal power of the Spanish monarchy and the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. El Escorial was, at once, a monastery and a Spanish royal palace. Originally a property of the Hieronymite monks, it is now a monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine. Philip II of Spain, reacting to the Protestant Reformation sweeping through Europe during the sixteenth century, devoted much of his lengthy reign (1556‚Äì1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World silver to stemming the Protestant tide sweeping through Europe, while simultaneously fighting the Islamic Ottoman Empire. His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful. However, the same counter-reformational impulse had a much more benign expression, thirty years earlier, in Philip's decision to build the complex at El Escorial. Philip engaged the Spanish architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Juan Bautista had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on the basilica of St. Peter's, and in Naples, where he had served the king's viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king's attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and together they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain's role as a center of the Christian world. =Plaza Mayor in Madrid= Plaza Mayor with the Casa de la Panader√≠a to the left The Plaza Mayor in Madrid was built during the Habsburg period is a central plaza in the city of Madrid, Spain. It is located only a few blocks away from another famous plaza, the Puerta del Sol. The Plaza Mayor is rectangular in shape, measuring 129 by 94 meters, and is surrounded by three-story residential buildings having 237 balconies facing the Plaza. It has a total of nine entranceways. The Casa de la Panader√≠a, serving municipal and cultural functions, dominates the Plaza Mayor. The origins of the Plaza go back to 1589 when Philip II of Spain asked Juan de Herrera, a renowned Renaissance architect, to discuss a plan to remodel the busy and chaotic area of the old Plaza del Arrabal. Juan de Herrera was the architect who designed the first project in 1581 to remodel the old Plaza del Arrabal but construction didn't start until 1617, during Philip III's reign. The king asked Juan G√≥mez de Mora to continue with the project, and he finished the porticoes in 1619. Nevertheless, the Plaza Mayor as we know it today is the work of the architect Juan de Villanueva who was entrusted with its reconstruction in 1790 after a spate of big fires. Giambologna's equestrian statue of Philip III dates to 1616, but it was not placed in the center of the square until 1848. =Granada Cathedral= Inner view of the cathedral Unlike most cathedrals in Spain, construction of this cathedral had to await the acquisition of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada from its Muslim rulers in 1492; while its very early plans had Gothic designs, such as are evident in the Royal Chapel of Granada by Enrique Egas, the construction of the church in the main occurred at a time when Renaissance designs were supplanting the Gothic regnant in Spanish architecture of prior centuries. Foundations for the church were laid by the architect Egas starting from 1518 to 1523 atop the site of the city's main mosque; by 1529, Egas was replaced by Diego de Silo√© who labored for nearly four decades on the structure from ground to cornice, planning the triforium and five naves instead of the usual three. Most unusually, he created a circular capilla mayor rather than a semicircular apse, perhaps inspired by Italian ideas for circular 'perfect buildings' (e.g. in Alberti's works). Within its structure the cathedral combines other orders of architecture. It took 181 years for the cathedral to be built. Subsequent architects included Juan de Maena (1563‚Äì1571), followed by Juan de Orea (1571‚Äì1590), and Ambrosio de Vico (1590-?). In 1667 Alonso Cano, working with Gaspar de la Pe√±a, altered the initial plan for the main fa√ßade, introducing Baroque elements. The magnificence of the building would be even greater, if the two large 81 meter towers foreseen in the plans had been built; however the project remained incomplete for various reasons, among them, financial. The Granada Cathedral had been intended to become the royal mausoleum for Charles I of Spain, but Philip II of Spain moved the site for his father and subsequent kings to El Escorial outside of Madrid. The main chapel contains two kneeling effigies of the Catholic King and Queen, Ferdinand and Isabel by Pedro de Mena y Medrano. The busts of Adam and Eve were made by Alonso Cano. The Chapel of the Trinity has a marvelous retablo with paintings by El Greco, Alonso Cano, and Jos√© de Ribera (The Spagnoletto). =Cathedral of Valladolid= Cathedral of Valladolid's fa√ßade The Cathedral of Valladolid, like all the buildings of the late Spanish Renaissance built by Herrera and his followers, is known for its purist and sober decoration, its style being the typical Spanish clasicismo, also called \\"Herrerian\\". Using classical and renaissance decorative motifs, Herrerian buildings are characterized by their extremely sober decorations, its formal austerity, and its like for monumentality. The Cathedral has its origins in a late gothic Collegiate which was started during the late 15th century, for before becoming capital of Spain Valladolid was not a bishopry see, and thus it lacked the right of building a cathedral. However, soon enough the Collegiate became obsolete due to the changes of taste of the day, and thanks to the newly established episcopal see in the city, the Town Council decided to build a cathedral that would shade similar constructions in neighbouring capitals. Had the building been finished, it would have been one of the biggest cathedrals in Spain. When the building was started, Valladolid was the de facto capital of Spain, housing king Philip II and his court. However, due to strategical and geopolitical reasons, by the 1560s the capital was moved to Madrid, thus Valladolid losing its political and economical relevance. By the late sixteenth century, Valladolid's importance had been severely resented, and many of the monumental projects such as the Cathedral, started during its former and glorious days, had to be modified due to the lack of proper finance. Thus, the building that nowadays stands could not be finished in all its splendour, and because of several additions built during the 17th and 18th centuries, it lacks the purported stylistical uniformity sought by Herrera. Indeed, although mainly faithful to the project of Juan de Herrera, the building would undergo many modifications, such as the addition to the top of the main fa√ßade, a work by Churriguera. =Significant architects= Renaissance and Plateresque period *Alonso de Covarrubias *Juan de Herrera *Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n *Pedro Machuca *Francisco de Mora *Diego de Ria√±o *Hern√°n Ruiz the Younger *Diego de Silo√© *Juan Bautista de Toledo *Andr√©s de Vandelvira Early Baroque period *Domingo Antonio de Andrade *Eufrasio L√≥pez de Rojas *Juan G√≥mez de Mora Music =Tom√°s Luis de Victoria= Contemporary printing of the sheet music for Tom√°s Luis de Victoria's Officium Defunctorum. Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, a Spanish composer of the sixteenth century, mainly of choral music, is widely regarded as one of the greatest Spanish classical composers. He joined the cause of Ignatius of Loyola in the fight against the Reformation and in 1575 became a priest. He lived for a short time in Italy, where he became acquainted with the polyphonic work of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Like Zurbar√°n, Victoria mixed the technical qualities of Italian art with the religion and culture of his native Spain. He invigorated his work with emotional appeal and experimental, mystical rhythm and choruses. He broke from the dominant tendency among his contemporaries by avoiding complex counterpoint, preferring longer, simpler, less technical and more mysterious melodies, employing dissonance in ways that the Italian members of the Roman School shunned. He demonstrated considerable invention in musical thought by connecting the tone and emotion of his music to those of his lyrics, particularly in his motets. Like Vel√°zquez, Victoria was employed by the monarch ‚Äì in Victoria's case, in the service of the queen. The Requiem he wrote upon her death in 1603 is regarded as one of his most enduring and mature works. =Francisco Guerrero= Francisco Guerrero, a Spanish composer of the 16th century. He was second only to Victoria as a major Spanish composer of church music in the second half of the 16th century. Of all the Spanish Renaissance composers, he was the one who lived and worked the most in Spain. Others‚Äîlike, for one, this example Morales and Victoria‚Äîspent large portions of their careers in Italy. Guerrero's music was both sacred and secular, unlike that of Victoria and Morales, the two other Spanish 16th- century composers of the first rank. He wrote numerous secular songs and instrumental pieces, in addition to masses, motets, and Passions. He was able to capture an astonishing variety of moods in his music, from elation to despair, longing, depression, and devotion; his music remained popular for hundreds of years, especially in cathedrals in Latin America. Stylistically he preferred homophonic textures, rather like his Spanish contemporaries, and he wrote memorable, singable lines. One interesting feature of his style is how he anticipated functional harmonic usage: there is a case of a Magnificat discovered in Lima, Peru, once thought to be an anonymous 18th century work, which turned out to be a work of his. =Alonso Lobo= Victoria's work was complemented by Alonso Lobo ‚Äì a man Victoria respected as his equal. Lobo's work ‚Äì also choral and religious in its content ‚Äì stressed the austere, minimalist nature of religious music. Lobo sought out a medium between the emotional intensity of Victoria and the technical ability of Palestrina; the solution he found became the foundation of the Baroque musical style in Spain. =Other significant musicians= *Crist√≥bal de Morales *Antonio de Cabez√≥n *Francisco Correa de Arauxo *Juan Cabanilles *Juan del Encina *Luis Mil√°n *Luis de Narv√°ez *Enr√≠quez de Valderr√°bano *Diego Pisador *Alonso Mudarra *Pablo Bruna Literature Cervantes' Don Quixote (1605), original title page The Spanish Golden Age was a time of great flourishing in poetry, prose and drama. =Cervantes and Don Quixote= Regarded by many as one of the finest works in any language, El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was the first novel published in Europe; it gave Cervantes a stature in the Spanish-speaking world comparable to his contemporary William Shakespeare in English. The novel, like Spain itself, was caught between the Middle Ages and the modern world. A veteran of the Battle of Lepanto (1571), Cervantes had fallen on hard times in the late 1590s and was imprisoned for debt in 1597, and some believe that during these years he began work on his best-remembered novel. The first part of the novel was published in 1605; the second in 1615, a year before the author's death. Don Quixote resembled both the medieval, chivalric romances of an earlier time and the novels of the early modern world. It parodied classical morality and chivalry, found comedy in knighthood, and criticized social structures and the perceived madness of Spain's rigid society. The work has endured to the present day as a landmark in world literary history, and it was an immediate international hit in its own time, interpreted variously as a satirical comedy, social commentary and forbearer of self-referential literature. =Lope de Vega and Spanish drama= Title page of a comedy by Spanish playwright Lope de Vega A contemporary of Cervantes, Lope de Vega consolidated the essential genres and structures which would characterize the Spanish commercial drama, also known as the \\"Comedia\\", throughout the 17th century. While Lope de Vega wrote prose and poetry as well, he is best remembered for his plays, particularly those grounded in Spanish history. Like Cervantes, Lope de Vega served with the Spanish army and was fascinated with the Spanish nobility. In the hundreds of plays he wrote, with settings ranging from the Biblical times to legendary Spanish history to classical mythology to his own time, Lope de Vega frequently took a comical approach just as Cervantes did, taking a conventional moral play and dressing it up in good humor and cynicism. His stated goal was to entertain the public, much as Cervantes's was. In bringing morality, comedy, drama, and popular wit together, Lope de Vega is often compared to his English contemporary Shakespeare. Some have argued that as a social critic, Lope de Vega attacked, like Cervantes, many of the ancient institutions of his country ‚Äì aristocracy, chivalry, and rigid morality, among others. Lope de Vega and Cervantes represented an alternative artistic perspective to the religious asceticism of Francisco Zurbar√°n. Lope de Vega's \\"cloak-and-sword\\" plays, which mingled intrigue, romance, and comedy together were carried on by his literary successor, Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca, in the later seventeenth century. =Poetry= This period also produced some of the most important Spanish works of poetry. The introduction and influence of Italian Renaissance verse is apparent perhaps most vividly in the works of Garcilaso de la Vega and illustrate a profound influence on later poets. Mystical literature in Spanish reached its summit with the works of San Juan de la Cruz and Teresa of √Åvila. Baroque poetry was dominated by the contrasting styles of Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de G√≥ngora; both had a lasting influence on subsequent writers, and even on the Spanish language itself.D√°maso Alonso, La lengua po√©tica de G√≥ngora (Madrid: Revista de Filolog√≠a Espa√±ola, 1950), 112. Lope de Vega was a gifted poet of his own, and there were a vast quantity of remarkable poets at that time, though less known: Francisco de Rioja, Bartolom√© Leonardo de Argensola, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, Bernardino de Rebolledo, Rodrigo Caro, and Andr√©s Rey de Artieda. Another poet was Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, from the Spanish colonies overseas, the New Spain ( modern day Mexico). =Other significant authors= The picaresque genre flourished in this era, describing the life of p√≠caros, living by their wits in a decadent society. Distinguished examples are El busc√≥n, by Francisco de Quevedo, Guzm√°n de Alfarache by Mateo Alem√°n, Estebanillo Gonz√°lez and the anonymously published Lazarillo de Tormes (1554), which created the genre. *Alonso de Ercilla wrote the epic poem, La Araucana, about the Spanish conquest of Chile. *Gil Vicente was Portuguese but his influence on Spanish playwriting was so wide that he is often considered part of the Spanish Golden Era. *Francisco de Avellaneda, a prolific writer of short comedies and dances. Other well-known playwrights of the period include: *Tirso de Molina *Agust√≠n Moreto *Juan P√©rez de Montalb√°n *Juan Ruiz de Alarc√≥n *Guill√©n de Castro *Antonio Mira de Amescua.

Otylia Jƒôdrzejczak (; born 13 December 1983) is a Polish swimmer. She was the Olympic champion from 2004 Athens in the 200 metre butterfly. She finished 4th in this event in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and also swam at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In Athens 2004 she also silvered in 400 m freestyle and 100 m butterfly. Three times she broke the world record in the women's 200 m butterfly (once in the 25-metre pool). Jƒôdrzejczak was born in Ruda ≈ölƒÖska, Silesian Voivodship, Poland. She started swimming at the age of six as a measure to correct a slight curvature of the spine. At first she hated the sport. Her attitude towards it changed after she had won her first prize in a competition in Germany at the age of eight. Jƒôdrzejczak took up swimming seriously in high school. Led by coach Maria Jak√≥bik, she won her first titles in the Junior European Championships in 1999. Medals in the Senior European Championships in 1999 and 2000 opened the way to her first Olympic appearance. Jƒôdrzejczak studied at the Academy of Physical Education in Warsaw (Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego w Warszawie). Her coach is Pawe≈Ç S≈Çomi≈Ñski. She stands 187 cm (6 ft 1¬Ω in) tall and wears a size 47 (EU)/14 (US) shoe. For her sport achievements, she received the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (5th Class) in 2004.  Career heights  * In 1999 she won the 100 m and 200 m butterfly titles during the Junior European Championships in Moscow and a bronze medal in the 200 m butterfly event in the Senior European Championships in Istanbul. * In 2000, she won gold in the 200 m butterfly and silver in the 100 m butterfly in the European Championships in Helsinki. * In the 2000 Summer Olympics she placed 5th in the 200 m butterfly. * In 2001, she placed second in the 100 m butterfly event in the World Championships in Fukuoka. * On 4 August 2002 she established a new world record in the 200 m butterfly with a time of 2:05.78 during the European Championships in Berlin. Except the 200 m title, she won a silver medal in the 100 m butterfly event. * During the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona she placed first in the 200 m butterfly and second in the 100 m butterfly. * In the 2004 European Championships in Madrid she defended her 200 m butterfly title and placed third in the 100 m butterfly event. * During the 2004 Summer Olympics she won three medals: silver in the 400 m freestyle and 100 m butterfly, and gold in the 200 m butterfly. This equals her in the number of medals earned during single Olympic games with the legendary Polish athlete Irena Szewi≈Ñska. * After winning bronze in the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, Jƒôdrzejczak managed to defend her title in the 200 m butterfly event on 29 July 2005. In the final she improved her own world record with a time of 2:05.61 to beat Australian Jessicah Schipper by only 0.04 seconds. After the race it was disputed that Jƒôdrzejczak touched the finishing wall with only one hand (with video replays confirming this), which according to International Swimming Federation rules would be grounds for an automatic disqualification. But since this was not noticed by the judges and no complaints were filed within 30 minutes of the race, her result has been approved. * In the summer of 2005 she won three gold medals at the Summer Universiade in ƒ∞zmir. * In the 2006 European Championships in Budapest she again defended her 200 m butterfly title and won 200 m freestyle. With her teammates, she took the silver medal in 4√ó200 m freestyle relay. * On 13 December 2007, on her 24th birthday, Jƒôdrzejczak broke the world record for the 200 metre women's butterfly with a time of 2:03.53. Olympic Games gold medal auction Jƒôdrzejczak owes her Olympic gold medal success to a brilliant finish in the last quarter of the 200 metre distance, which allowed her to overtake Australian Petria Thomas, who led the race for over 150 metres. After the race Jƒôdrzejczak revealed, that during the pre-Olympic trials in Athens in June she had declared that if she won a gold medal in the Olympics, she would auction it off and hand the proceeds to a charity helping children suffering from leukemia. The results of the internet auction were announced on 19 December 2004 with Victoria Cymes, a Polish food company, turning out to be the highest bidder with 257,550 zlotys (about 82,437 USD). The money was handed over to the Oncology and Haematology Clinic of Wroc≈Çaw's Children's Hospital. Later career On 1 October 2005, she was injured in a car accident, which killed her 19-year-old brother, Szymon. The 2005 Chrysler 300C HEMI which she was driving crashed head-on into a tree, after a botched attempt to overtake several long-haul trucks at excessive speed during bad weather conditions.http://motoryzacja.interia.pl/news-otylia- jechala-180-km-h,nId,1373518 She was tried for an accident resulting in passenger's death. The prosecutors initially proposed Jƒôdrzejczak an agreement which would lead to a sentence of 2 years imprisonment in suspension. Jƒôdrzejczak refused the agreement and strongly pressed for an acquittal, stating that she was already punished enough by her brother's death. Her trial began in February 2007 before the District Court in P≈Ço≈Ñsk, close to the place of the accident. She was convicted and sentenced to 9 months of probation during which she had to do 30 hours of community service a month. She also lost her driving licence for 1 year. Both the prosecution and Jƒôdrzejczak appealed to the Regional Court in P≈Çock, which upheld the ruling. The accident, the trial and their aftermath started taking their toll. Her attitude during the trial resulted in alienation of many of her fans and decline of her popularity. In 2006, she returned to competitive swimming and competed in European Championships in Budapest, finishing first in 200 m freestyle and 200 m butterfly as well as second in 4√ó200 m relay. In 2007, she managed to set new world record in 200 m butterfly in Debrecen, but later, in Melbourne, she finished third in her main competition, 200 m butterfly, and in Eindhoven in 2008, she failed to qualify for the final race in both 100 m and 200 m butterfly. Although both Jƒôdrzejczak and her trainer Pawe≈Ç S≈Çomi≈Ñski stated that Eindhoven results were \\"just an accident\\", 2008 Summer Olympics proved otherwise. Jƒôdrzejczak, who won three Olympic medals four years earlier, in Beijing managed only to reach 9th place in 200 m freestyle and a disastrous 17th place in 100 m butterfly. She hoped for a medal in her favourite 200 m butterfly, but she failed, finishing 4th. After returning from Beijing, Jƒôdrzejczak stated in an interview that she probably would quit the career as a professional swimmer. However, Jƒôdrzejczak qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 100m and 200m butterfly. She swam a time of 59.31 in her 100m heat, and did not qualify for the semifinals.

Although some modern artists and sculptors make use of large stones in their work, the term is more generally used to describe art carved onto megaliths in prehistoric Europe. Megalithic art is found in many places in Western Europe although the main concentrations are in England, Malta, Ireland, Brittany and Iberia. Megalithic art started in the Neolithic and continued into the Bronze Age. Although many monument types received this form of art the majority is carved on Neolithic passage graves. Megalithic art tends to be highly abstract and contains relatively few representations of recognisable real objects. Megalithic art is often similar to prehistoric rock art and contains many similar motifs such as the 'cup and ring mark', although the two forms of rock carving also have large stylistic differences. The meaning of megalithic art is the subject of much debate. Fig. 9: Map with statue-menhirs in Europe.

Weathering and vandalism have affected many examples of the art, and little of it remains today. Newgrange entrance stone with megalithic art. Boyne Valley, Ireland Ireland Ireland has the largest concentration of megalithic art in Europe, particularly in the Boyne Valley. This art form appears to be entirely abstract and is perhaps the most famous with its well-known multiple-spirals. It is believed that much of this artwork is entoptically derived from induced states of altered consciousness (Dronfield 1993). Stylistically the art of Ireland is similar to occasional finds in nearby Wales and the Scottish Isles. Approximately 70% of Ireland's ancient decorated rocks and stones are to be found in the Boyne Valley (o'Sullivan 1997;19) France The French region of Brittany has the second highest concentration of megalithic art. The earliest examples in this area are with anthropomorphic representations on menhirs which later continued in passage graves. Brittany shares some motifs with both Ireland and Iberia and the level of contact between them has always been debated. Among the most famous examples are the passage grave at Gavrinis and the Barnenez mound. Iberia Est√†tua-menhir del Pla de les Pruneres (Mollet del Vall√®s-Spain) Iberian megalithic art contains the most number of realistic representations of objects, although there is also a strong abstract element. Iberia is the only place to have painted decoration as well as carved. Other areas may also have originally been painted, but Iberia's arid climate lends itself to preservation of the paint. The paint (as it currently survives) is normally restricted to black and red, although occasionally features white as well. Germany Megalithic art is extremely rare in Central Europe. The gallery grave at Z√ºschen in Germany is an intriguing exception, as it appears to mix motifs known from the west European megalithic tradition with others more familiar from alpine Rock art. Non-abstract art As well as abstract or geometric art, some carvings are considered to represent tools, weapons, animals, human figures, deities or idols. The gallery graves of the Seine- Oise-Marne culture such as that at Courjeonnet have images of axes, breasts and necklaces carved on their walls.Joussaume, Roger Dolmens for the Dead Batsford Ltd (Jan 1988) p. 141‚Äì142 The meaning of some of these is disputed. For instance, some of the tombs in the valley of the Petit Morin in France and elsewhere contain engravings of breasts, noses, hair, and a collar or necklace. These have been described both as deities (occasionally as 'dolmen deities') and as representations of the deceased.

While in Chile (1556‚Äì63) he fought against the Araucanians (Mapuche), and there he began the epic poem La Araucana, considered one of the greatest Spanish historical poems. This heroic work in 37 cantos is divided into three parts, published in 1569, 1578, and 1589. It tells of the courageous insurrection of the Araucanians and also relates the history of Chile and of contemporary Spain. Biography Ercilla was born into a Basque noble family. His father was Fortu√±o Garc√≠a de Ercilla, and his mother Do√±a Leonor de Z√∫√±iga, both from Bermeo (Biscay). In 1548, after his father's death, his mother became lady-in-waiting to the Infanta Mar√≠a and made young Alonso a page to the heir-apparent, Prince Philip (afterwards King Philip II). Ercilla received a very thorough education, for, besides having the most learned teachers, he enjoyed the advantages of very extensive travelling and of living at court where he came in contact with high personages. When he was only fifteen he accompanied Philip through Italy and Germany; and their travels lasted three years. Later, Ercilla accompanied his mother to Bohemia where he left her and then visited Austria, Hungary, and other countries. Returning to Spain, he soon started out again with Philip. In this capacity Ercilla (sometimes spelled Arcilla) visited Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, and was present in 1554 at the marriage of his master to Queen Mary I of England. In London, he made the acquaintance of Jer√≥nimo de Alderete (1555), whose stories of his thrilling adventures in the New World so fired Ercilla's imagination that he determined to accompany Alderete to the New World. He therefore obtained leave from Philip, and they set sail for America, 15 October 1555. Soon after their arrival, however, Alderete died (near Panam√°, April 1556). In 1556 Ercilla continued on his way to Peru and accompanied Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza, recently named Governor and Commander- in-chief of Chile, where the Araucanians had revolted. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign. Apparently he remained in Chile seventeen months, between 1557 and 1559. He participated in the battles of Lagunillas, Quiapo and Millarapue, and witnessed the death of Caupolic√°n, protagonist of La Araucana. This is an epic poem of military exaltation in 37 \\"cantos\\" or verses, where the narrator relays the most significant facts of the Arauco War against the Araucanos (mapuches) and which he began to write during the campaign. Statue of Alonso de Ercilla in Blanco Encalada, Santiago de ChileIn March 1558, Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza founded the city of San Mateo de Osorno and while their neighbours were preoccupied with the celebrations in the new city, Garc√≠a left by a secret entrance, disguised by a helmet with closed visor, accompanied by Ercilla and Pedro of Eyrie. They were confronted by Juan de Pineda, an old enemy of Alonso de Ercilla, and there was a fight. Garc√≠a was warned of the situation. Alonso de Ercilla ran to a church and looked for asylum. The governor imprisoned both duelists and condemned them to be executed on the following day. However, many people considered the sentence unjust and tried to persuade Garc√≠a to reprieve them. The preparations for the execution continued and all hope of saving them was lost. Then two women, one Spanish and another Native American, approached the house of Garc√≠a, entering by the window, and managed to convince the governor to spare the lives of both. Ercilla was imprisoned for three months and soon afterwards was exiled to Peru. =Later life= After Ercilla's return to Spain in 1562, he made several diplomatic journeys to Austria, where his mother was a maid of honor at the imperial court, and also visited Italy, France, Germany and Bohemia. In 1570, he married Do√±a Mar√≠a de Baz√°n, a woman of illustrious family and of intellectual attainments and, after other diplomatic missions, settled permanently in Spain in 1577. In 1571 he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago, and in 1578 he was employed by Philip II on a mission to Zaragoza. He complained of living in poverty but left a modest fortune, and was obviously disappointed at not being offered the post of secretary of state. Ercilla's later years were saddened by the loss of his only son, and his own death occurred in Madrid in 1594.  Works  Alonso de Ercilla in the Retratos de Espa√±oles Ilustres (\\"Portraits of Illustrious Spaniards\\"), 1791. Ercilla's great work is La Araucana, an epic poem of thirty-seven cantos, describing the difficulties encountered by the Spaniards during the insurrection in Arauco, and the heroic deeds of the natives as well as his companions. The epic partakes of the character of history, and the author adheres with such strict fidelity to the truth, that subsequent historians characterize his work as thoroughly trustworthy. In it the difficult art of story-telling is carried to perfection. Places are admirably described, dates are given with accuracy, and the customs of the native faithfully set forth, giving to the narrative animation and colouring. The poem was published in three parts, of which the first, composed in Chile and first appearing in 1569, is a versified narrative adhering strictly to historic fact; the second, published in 1578, is encumbered with visions and other romantic machinery; and the third, which appeared in 1589-1590, contains, in addition to the subject proper, a variety of episodes mostly irrelevant. Nevertheless, many scholars consider it the most successful Renaissance epic in the Classical mode written in Spanish. The best editions are those published by the Spanish Academy in 1776 and 1828. In literature In his novel In Search of the Castaways (1867), Jules Verne wrote,In Search of the Castaways, Chapter XI, \\"Traversing Chile\\". \\"Araucania is populated by the Mapuche, the native Chilean race extolled in verse by the poet Ercilla\\".

Small-angle scattering is used to study the structure of a variety of objects such as solutions of biological macromolecules, nanocomposites, alloys, and synthetic polymers. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are the two complementary techniques known jointly as small- angle scattering (SAS). SAS is an analogous method to X-ray and neutron diffraction, wide angle X-ray scattering, as well as to static light scattering. In contrast to other X-ray and neutron scattering methods, SAS yields information on the sizes and shapes of both crystalline and non- crystalline particles. When used to study biological materials, which are very often in aqueous solution, the scattering pattern is orientation averaged. SAS patterns are collected at small angles of a few degrees. SAS is capable of delivering structural information in the resolution range between 1 and 25 nm, and of repeat distances in partially ordered systems of up to 150 nm in size. Ultra small-angle scattering (USAS) can resolve even larger dimensions. The grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS) is a powerful technique for studying of biological molecule layers on surfaces. In biological applications SAS is used to determine the structure of a particle in terms of average particle size and shape. One can also get information on the surface-to-volume ratio. Typically, the biological macromolecules are dispersed in a liquid. The method is accurate, mostly non-destructive and usually requires only a minimum of sample preparation. However, biological molecules are always susceptible to radiation damage. In comparison to other structure determination methods, such as solution NMR or X-ray crystallography, SAS allows one to overcome some restraints. For example, solution NMR is limited to protein size, whereas SAS can be used for small molecules as well as for large multi-molecular assemblies. Solid-State NMR is still an indispensable tool for determining atomic level information of macromolecules greater than 40 kDa or non- crystalline samples such as amyloid fibrils. Structure determination by X-ray crystallography may take several weeks or even years, whereas SAS measurements take days. SAS can also be coupled to other analytical techniques like size- exclusion chromatography to study heterogeneous samples. However, with SAS it is not possible to measure the positions of the atoms within the molecule.  Method  X-ray solution scattering curves computed from atomic models of twenty-five different proteins with molecular masses between 10 and 300 kDa. Conceptually, small-angle scattering experiments are simple: the sample is exposed to X-rays or neutrons and the scattered radiation is registered by a detector. As the SAS measurements are performed very close to the primary beam (\\"small angles\\"), the technique needs a highly collimated or focused X-ray or neutron beam. The biological small-angle X-ray scattering is often performed at synchrotron radiation sources, because biological molecules normally scatter weakly and the measured solutions are dilute. The biological SAXS method profits from the high intensity of X-ray photon beams provided by the synchrotron storage rings. The X-ray or neutron scattering curve (intensity versus scattering angle) is used to create a low-resolution model of a protein, shown here on the right picture. One can further use the X-ray or neutron scattering data and fit separate domains (X-ray or NMR structures) into the \\"SAXS envelope\\". In a scattering experiment, a solution of macromolecules is exposed to X-rays (with wavelength Œª typically around 0.15 nm) or thermal neutrons (Œª‚âà0.5 nm). The scattered intensity I(s) is recorded as a function of momentum transfer s (s=4œÄsinŒ∏/Œª, where 2Œ∏ is the angle between the incident and scattered radiation). From the intensity of the solution the scattering from only the solvent is subtracted. The random positions and orientations of particles result in an isotropic intensity distribution which, for monodisperse non-interacting particles, is proportional to the scattering from a single particle averaged over all orientations. The net particle scattering is proportional to the squared difference in scattering length density (electron density for X-rays and nuclear/spin density for neutrons) between particle and solvent ‚Äì the so- called contrast. The contrast can be varied in neutron scattering using H2O/D2O mixtures or selective deuteration to yield additional information. The information content of SAS data is illustrated here in the figure on the right, which shows X-ray scattering patterns from proteins with different folds and molecular masses. At low angles (2-3 nm resolution) the curves are rapidly decaying functions of s essentially determined by the particle shape, which clearly differ. At medium resolution (2 to 0.5 nm) the differences are already less pronounced and above 0.5 nm resolution all curves are very similar. SAS thus contains information about the gross structural features ‚Äì shape, quaternary and tertiary structure ‚Äì but is not suitable for the analysis of the atomic structure. History First applications date back to the late 1930s when the main principles of SAXS were developed in the fundamental work of Guinier following his studies of metallic alloys. In the first monograph on SAXS by Guinier and Fournet it was already demonstrated that the method yields not only information on the sizes and shapes of particles but also on the internal structure of disordered and partially ordered systems. In the 1960s, the method became increasingly important in the study of biological macromolecules in solution as it allowed one to get low- resolution structural information on the overall shape and internal structure in the absence of crystals. A breakthrough in SAXS and SANS experiments came in the 1970s, thanks to the availability of synchrotron radiation and neutron sources, the latter paving the way for contrast variation by solvent exchange of H2O for D2O and specific deuteration methods. It was realised that scattering studies on solution provide, at a minimal investment of time and effort, useful insights into the structure of non-crystalline biochemical systems. Moreover, SAXS/SANS also made possible real time investigations of intermolecular interactions, including assembly and large-scale conformational changes in macromolecular assemblies. The main challenge of SAS as a structural method is to extract information about the three-dimensional structure of the object from the one-dimensional experimental data. In the past, only overall particle parameters (e.g. volume, radius of gyration) of the macromolecules were directly determined from the experimental data, whereas the analysis in terms of three-dimensional models was limited to simple geometrical bodies (e.g. ellipsoids, cylinders, etc.) or was performed on an ad hoc trial-and-error basis. Electron microscopy was often used as a constraint in building consensus models. In the 1980s, progress in other structural methods led to a decline of the interest of biochemists in SAS studies, which drew structural conclusions from just a couple of overall parameters or were based on trial-and-error models. The 1990s brought a breakthrough in SAXS/SANS data analysis methods, which opened the way for reliable ab initio modelling of macromolecular complexes, including detailed determination of shape and domain structure and application of rigid body refinement techniques. This progress was accompanied by further advances in instrumentation, allowing sub-ms time resolutions to be achieved on third generation SR sources in the studies of protein and nucleic acid folding. In 2005, a four-year project was started. Small-Angle X-Ray scattering Initiative for EuRope (SAXIER) with the goal to combine SAXS methods with other analytical techniques and create automated software to rapidly analyse large quantities of data. The project created a unified European SAXS infrastructure, using the most advanced methods available.  Data analysis  In a good quality SAS experiment, several solutions with varying concentrations of the macromolecule under investigation are measured. By extrapolating the scattering curves measured at different concentrations to zero concentration, one is able to obtain a scattering curve that represents infinite dilution. Then concentration effects should not affect the scattering curve. Data analysis of the extrapolated scattering curve begins with the inspection of the start of the scattering curve in the region around s = 0. If the region follows the Guinier approximation (also known as Guinier law), the sample is not aggregated. Then the shape of the particle in question can be determined by various methods, of which some are described in the following reference. =Indirect Fourier transform= First step is usually to compute a Fourier transform of the scattering curve. Transformed curve can be interpreted as distance distribution function inside a particle. This transformation gives also a benefit of regularization of input data. =Low- resolution models= Lysozyme models built by different methods. Left - overall shape reconstructed by SASHA; middle - dummy residue model, built by DAMMIN; DAMMIF; right - chain compatible GASBOR model One problem in SAS data analysis is to get a three-dimensional structure from a one-dimensional scattering pattern. The SAS data does not imply a single solution. Many different proteins, for example, may have the same scattering curve. Reconstruction of 3D structure might result in large number of different models. To avoid this problem a number of simplifications need to be considered. An additional approach is to combine small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data and model with the program MONSA. Freely available SAS analysis computer programs have been intensively developed at EMBL. In the first general ab initio approach, an angular envelope function of the particle r=F(œâ), where (r,œâ) are spherical coordinates, is described by a series of spherical harmonics. The low resolution shape is thus defined by a few parameters ‚Äì the coefficients of this series ‚Äì which fit the scattering data. The approach was further developed and implemented in the computer program SASHA (Small Angle Scattering Shape Determination). It was demonstrated that under certain circumstances a unique envelope can be extracted from the scattering data. This method is only applicable to globular particles with relatively simple shapes and without significant internal cavities. To overcome these limitations, there was another approach developed, which uses different types of Monte-Carlo searches. DALAI_GA is an elegant program, which takes a sphere with diameter equal to the maximum particle size Dmax, which is determined from the scattering data, and fills it with beads. Each bead belongs either to the particle (index=1) or to the solvent (index=0). The shape is thus described by the binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, a genetic algorithm searches for a model that fits the data. Compactness and connectivity constrains are imposed in the search, implemented in the program DAMMIN. If the particle symmetry is known, SASHA and DAMMIN can utilise it as useful constraints. The 'give-n-take' procedure SAXS3D and the program SASMODEL, based on interconnected ellipsoids are ab initio Monte Carlo approaches without limitation in the search space. An approach that uses an ensemble of Dummy Residues (DRs) and simulated annealing to build a locally \\"chain-compatible\\" DR-model inside a sphere of diameter Dmax lets one extract more details from SAXS data. This method is implemented in the program GASBOR. Solution scattering patterns of multi-domain proteins and macromolecular complexes can also be fitted using models built from high resolution (NMR or X-ray) structures of individual domains or subunits assuming that their tertiary structure is preserved. Depending on the complexity of the object, different approaches are employed for the global search of the optimum configuration of subunits fitting the experimental data. =Consensus model= The Monte-Carlo based models contain hundreds or thousand parameters, and caution is required to avoid overinterpretation. A common approach is to align a set of models resulting from independent shape reconstruction runs to obtain an average model retaining the most persistent- and conceivably also most reliable-features (e.g. using the program SUPCOMB). =Adding missing loops= Disordered surface amino acids (\\"loops\\") are frequently unobserved in NMR and crystallographic studies, and may be left missing in the reported models. Such disordered element contribute to the scattering intensity and their probable locations can be found by fixing the known part of the structure and adding the missing parts to fit the SAS pattern from the entire particle. The Dummy Residue approach was extended and the algorithms for adding missing loops or domains were implemented in the program suite CREDO. =Hybrid methods= Recently a few methods proposed that use SAXS data as constraints. The authors aimed to improve results of fold recognition and de novo protein structure prediction methods. SAXS data provide the Fourier transform of the histogram of atomic pair distances (pair distribution function) for a given protein. This can serve as a structural constraint on methods used to determine the native conformational fold of the protein. Threading or fold recognition assumes that 3D structure is more conserved than sequence. Thus, very divergent sequences may have similar structure. Ab initio methods, on the other hand, challenge one of the biggest problems in molecular biology, namely, to predict the folding of a protein \\"from scratch\\", using no homologous sequences or structures. Using the \\"SAXS filter\\", the authors were able to purify the set of de novo protein models significantly. This was further proved by structure homology searches. It was also shown, that the combination of SAXS scores with scores, used in threading methods, significantly improves the performance of fold recognition. On one example it was demonstrated how approximate tertiary structure of modular proteins can be assembled from high resolution NMR structures of domains, using SAXS data, confining the translational degrees of freedom. Another example shows how the SAXS data can be combined together with NMR, X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to reconstruct the quaternary structure of multidomain protein. =Flexible systems= An elegant method to tackle the problem of intrinsically disordered or multi-domain proteins with flexible linkers was proposed recently. It allows coexistence of different conformations of a protein, which together contribute to the average experimental scattering pattern. Initially, EOM (ensemble optimization method) generates a pool of models covering the protein configuration space. The scattering curve is then calculated for each model. In the second step, the program selects subsets of protein models. Average experimental scattering is calculated for each subset and fitted to the experimental SAXS data. If the best fit is not found, models are reshuffled between different subsets and new average scattering calculation and fitting to the experimental data is performed. This method has been tested on two proteins‚Äì denatured lysozyme and Bruton's protein kinase. It gave some interesting and promising results. Biological molecule layers and GISAS Coatings of biomolecules can be studied with grazing-incidence X-ray and neutron scattering. IsGISAXS (grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering) is a software program dedicated to the simulation and analysis of GISAXS from nanostructures. IsGISAXS only encompasses the scattering by nanometric sized particles, which are buried in a matrix subsurface or supported on a substrate or buried in a thin layer on a substrate. The case of holes is also handled. The geometry is restricted to a plane of particles. The scattering cross section is decomposed in terms of interference function and particle form factor. The emphasis is put on the grazing incidence geometry which induces a \\"beam refraction effect\\". The particle form factor is calculated within the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), starting as an unperturbed state with sharp interfaces or with the actual perpendicular profile of refraction index. Various kinds of simple geometrical shapes are available with a full account of size and shape distributions in the Decoupling Approximation (DA), in the local monodisperse approximation (LMA) and also in the size-spacing correlation approximation (SSCA). Both, disordered systems of particles defined by their particle-particle pair correlation function and bi-dimensional crystal or para-crystal are considered.

History  Loomis Homestead (1640), one of the oldest houses in the state, still remains on campus (1910 postcard) The school was chartered in 1874 as The Loomis Institute by five Loomis siblings, who had outlived all their children. The school was intended as a memorial to their deceased children and as a gift to future children; the founders stated their hope that \\"some good may come to posterity, from the harvest, poor though it be, of our lives.\\" The original 1640 Loomis Homestead was chosen as the site for The Loomis Institute, which opened in 1914. The forty-year gap between chartering and the opening of the school was due to the estate of the Loomis siblings being reserved for the siblings' retirement. In 1910, John Mason Loomis's wife left over $ 1.1 million as an endowment to The Loomis Institute for charitable purposes.Together We Served.com, Essay This donation allowed the school to remain tuition-free for its first four decades. In addition to being tuition- free, The Loomis Institute was distinguished from other New England preparatory schools by its lack of religious affiliation, offering of vocational education alongside college preparatory courses, and admission of both boys and girls. The Loomis Institute ended coeducation in 1926, when The Chaffee School was incorporated to educate girls on an adjacent campus. In 1970, the boys and girls schools merged to form The Loomis Chaffee School. Since then, the school has expanded as its endowment, financial aid budget, faculty, and campus increased in size.

The most common type is the infantile form that usually begins during the first 2 years of life. Symptoms include mental and physical developmental delays, followed by the loss of developmental milestones, an abnormal increase in head size and seizures. The juvenile form of Alexander disease has an onset between the ages of 2 and 13 years. These children may have excessive vomiting, difficulty swallowing and speaking, poor coordination, and loss of motor control. Adult-onset forms of Alexander disease are less common. The symptoms sometimes mimic those of Parkinson‚Äôs disease or multiple sclerosis, or may present primarily as a psychiatric disorder. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the destruction of white matter is accompanied by the formation of Rosenthal fibers‚Äîabnormal clumps of protein that accumulate in astrocytes in the brain. The disease occurs in both males and females, and no ethnic, racial, geographic or cultural/economic differences are seen in its distribution. Alexander disease is a progressive and often fatal disease.  Presentation  Delays in development of some physical, psychological and behavioral skills; progressive enlargement of the head (macrocephaly), seizures, spasticity, and in some cases also hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and dementia.GeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Alexander disease Cause Alexander disease is a genetic disorder affecting the midbrain and cerebellum of the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise de novo as the result of sporadic mutations. Alexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers.\\"Cause of brain disease found\\" -BBC News Rosenthal fibers appear not to be present in healthy people, but occur in specific diseases, like some forms of cancer, Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, Huntington‚Äôs, and ALS. The Rosenthal fibers found in Alexander disease do not share the distribution or concentration of other diseases and disorders.  Pathology  Alexander disease causes the gradual loss of bodily functions and the ability to talk. It also causes an overload of long-chain fatty acids in the brain, which destroy the myelin sheath. The cause of Alexander disease is a mutation in the gene encoding GFAP. A CT scan shows: * Decreased density of white matter * Frontal lobe predominance * Dilated lateral ventricles may present  Diagnosis  Detecting the signs of Alexander disease is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease. It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MRI. Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for its known cause. A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms, including enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies. Treatment No cure or standard procedure for treatment is known, although a University of Wisconsin study shows promise with gene editing of the astrocytes. A bone marrow transplant has been attempted on a child, but it made no improvement. Hydrocephalus may be seen in younger patients and can be relieved with surgery or by implanting a shunt to relieve pressure. Prognosis The prognosis is generally poor. With early onset, death usually occurs within 10 years from the onset of symptoms. Individuals with the infantile form usually die before the age of seven. Usually, the later the disease occurs, the slower its course. Prevalence Its occurrence is very rare. The infantile form occurs from birth to 2 years of age. The average duration of the infantile form is usually about 3 years. Onset of the juvenile form presents between 2 and 12 years of age. Duration of this form is in most cases about 6 years. The adult form occurs after 12 years. In younger patients, seizures, megalencephaly, developmental delay, and spasticity are usually present. Neonatal onset is also reported. Onset in adults is least frequent. In older patients, bulbar or pseudobulbar symptoms and spasticity predominate. Symptoms of the adult form may also resemble multiple sclerosis. No more than 500 cases have been reported.

A jackhammer (pneumatic drill or demolition hammer in British English) is a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that combines a hammer directly with a chisel. It was invented by William Mcreavy, who then sold the patent to Charles Brady King.US patent 550324 Steam or Pneumatic Engine Hand-held jackhammers are generally powered by compressed air, but some are also powered by electric motors. Larger jackhammers, such as rig-mounted hammers used on construction machinery, are usually hydraulically powered. Jackhammers are typically used to break up rock, pavement, and concrete. A jackhammer operates by driving an internal hammer up and down. The hammer is first driven down to strike the back and then back up to return the hammer to the original position to repeat the cycle. The effectiveness of the jackhammer is dependent on how much force is applied to the tool. It is generally used like a hammer to break the hard surface or rock in construction works and it is not considered under earth moving equipment, along with its accessories (i.e., pusher leg, lubricator). In British English, electromechanical versions are colloquially known as \\"Kangos\\".  History  The first steam-powered drill was patented by Samuel Miller in 1806. This drill used steam only for raising the drill. Pneumatic drills were developed in response to the needs of mining, quarrying, excavating, and tunneling. A pneumatic drill was proposed by a C. Brunton in 1844.Brunton, C. (September 21, 1844) \\"Design of wind hammer for boring rocks,\\" The Mechanics' Magazine, 41 : 203‚Äì204.West, Graham, Innovation and the Rise of the Tunnelling Industry (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1988), p. 33. In 1846 a percussion drill that could be worked by steam or atmospheric pressure obtained from a vacuum was patented in Britain by Thomas Clarke, Mark Freeman, and John Varley. The first American \\"percussion drill\\" was made in 1848 and patented in 1849 by Jonathan J. Couch of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Henry S. Drinker,Tunneling, explosive compounds, and rock drills ‚Ä¶ (New York, New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1878), pages 153-157. In this drill, the drill bit passed through the piston of a steam engine. The piston snagged the drill bit and hurled it against the rock face. It was an experimental model. In 1849, Couch's assistant, Joseph W. Fowle, filed a patent caveat for a percussion drill of his own design. In Fowle's drill, the drill bit was connected directly to the piston in the steam cylinder; specifically, the drill bit was connected to the piston's crosshead. The drill also had a mechanism for turning the drill bit around its axis between strokes and for advancing the drill as the hole deepened.Drinker (1878), page 160. By 1850 or 1851, Fowle was using compressed air to drive his drill, making it the first true pneumatic drill.Drinker (1878), page 164. The demand for pneumatic drills was driven especially by miners and tunnelers, because steam engines needed fires to operate and the ventilation in mines and tunnels was inadequate to vent the fires' fumes; there was also no way to convey steam over long distances, e.g., from the surface to the bottom of a mine; and mines and tunnels occasionally contained flammable explosive gases such as methane. By contrast, compressed air could be conveyed over long distances without loss of its energy, and after the compressed air had been used to power equipment, it could ventilate a mine or tunnel. In Europe since the late 1840s, the king of Sardinia, Carlo Alberto, had been contemplating the excavation of a tunnel through Mount Fr√©jus to create a rail link between Italy and France, which would cross his realm.Drinker (1878), page 266.The project was called the \\"Mount Cenis tunnel\\" although the tunnel passed under Mount Fr√©jus. The need for a mechanical rock drill was obvious and this sparked research on pneumatic rock drills in Europe. A Frenchman, Cav√©, designed, and in 1851 patented, a rock drill that used compressed air; but the air had to be admitted manually to the cylinder during each stroke, so it was not successful.Drinker (1878), page 152. In 1854, in England, Thomas Bartlett made and then patented (1855) a rock drill whose drill bit was connected directly to the piston of a steam engine. In 1855 Bartlett demonstrated his drill, powered by compressed air, to officials of the Mount Fr√©jus tunnel project.Drinker (1878), pages 168 and 266. (In 1855, a German, Schumann, invented a similar pneumatic rock drill in Freiburg, Germany.Drinker (1878), pages 151-152.) Bartlett‚Äôs drill was refined by the Savoy-born engineer Germain Sommeiller (1815-1871) and his colleagues, Grandis and Grattoni, by 1861.Drinker (1878), pages 169 and 266. Thereafter, many inventors refined the pneumatic drill.See: Drinker (1878), page 168. See also: page 2 of Eustace M. Weston, Rock drills: design, construction and use (New York, New York: McGraw- Hill, 1910). Sommeiller took his drill to the lengthy Gotthard Pass Tunnel then being built to link railways between Switzerland and Italy under the Alps. Atlas Copco and Ingersoll Rand were two important drill companies in Europe and America respectively, each holding patents and dominating the industry. From this mining and railway tunnelling expanded. Terminology The word \\"jackhammer\\" is used in North American English and Australia, while \\"pneumatic drill\\" is used colloquially elsewhere in the English speaking world, although strictly speaking a \\"pneumatic drill\\" refers to a pneumatically driven jackhammer.How It Works - Horobin, Wendy; Marshall Cavendish Corporation, Third Edition, Page 1195 In Britain, electromechanical versions are colloquially known as \\"Kangos\\". The term comes from the former British brand name now owned by Milwaukee tools. Use A Wacker Neuson gasoline-powered breaker on a demolition site A full-sized portable jackhammer is impractical for use against walls and steep slopes, except by a very strong person, as the user would have to both support the weight of the tool, and push the tool back against the work after each blow. A technique developed by experienced workers is a two-man team to overcome this obstacle of gravity: one operates the hammer and the second assists by holding the hammer either on his shoulders or cradled in his arms. Both use their combined weight to push the bit into the workface. This method is commonly referred to as horizontal jackhammering. Another method is overhead jackhammering, requiring strength conditioning and endurance to hold a smaller jackhammer, called a rivet buster, over one's head. To make overhead work safer, a platform can be used. One such platform is a positioner‚Äìactuator‚Äìmanipulator (PAM). This unit takes all the weight and vibration from the user. Types =Pneumatic= A compressor for running a pneumatic jackhammer A pneumatic jackhammer, also known as a ' or ', is a jackhammer that uses compressed air as the power source. The air supply usually comes from a portable air compressor driven by a diesel engine. Reciprocating compressors were formerly used. The unit comprised a reciprocating compressor driven, through a centrifugal clutch, by a diesel engine. The engine's governor provided only two speeds: * idling, when the clutch was disengaged * maximum, when the clutch was engaged and the compressor was running Modern versions use rotary compressors and have more sophisticated variable governors. The unit is usually mounted on a trailer and sometimes includes an electrical generator to supply lights or electric power tools. Additionally, some users of pneumatic jackhammers may use a pneumatic lubricator which is placed in series with the air hose powering the air hammer. This increases the life and performance of the jackhammer. =Electro mechanical or electropneumatic= A single-phase demolition breaker An electropneumatic hammer is often called a rotary hammer, because it has an electric motor, which rotates a crank. The hammer has two pistons ‚Äì a drive piston and a free flight piston. The crank moves the drive piston back and forth in the same cylinder as the flight piston. The drive piston never touches the flight piston. Instead the drive piston compresses air in the cylinder, which then propels the flight piston against a striker, which contacts the drill bit. Electric powered tools come in a variety of sizes, about . They require an external power source, but do not require a compressor. Although in the past these tools did not have the power of an air or pneumatic hammer, this is changing with newer brushless-motor tools coming close to the power of a pneumatic tool and in some cases even matching it. Electric powered tools are useful for locations where access to a compressor is limited or impractical, such as inside a building, in a crowded construction site, or in a remote location and it is not uncommon under earth moving equipment or tool. Electropneumatic tools use a variety of chucks for attaching chisels, but the most common are SDS-max, 7/8 in hex, TE-S, and 1+1/8 in hex. The connection end size is also related to the breaking energy of the tool. For example, the Bosch and Hilti tools both use SDS-max, while the Bosch, Hilti, and Makita tools all use 1+1/8 in hex connection. See hammer drills for more on electropneumatic hammering. =Hydraulic= An excavator- mounted hydraulic jackhammer being used to break up concrete. A hydraulic jackhammer, generally much larger than portable ones, may be fitted to mechanical excavators or backhoes and is widely used for roadwork, quarrying and general demolition or construction groundwork. These larger machine mounted breakers are known as Rig Mounted, or Machine Mounted Breakers. Such tools can also be used against vertical walls (or ceilings for that matter), since the vehicles involved are massive enough and powerful enough to exert the forces involved without needing the help of gravity in operating the tool. Pneumatic or hydraulic tools are particularly likely to be used in mines where there is an explosion risk (such as underground coal mines), since they lack any high-power electrical circuitry that might cause a triggering spark. Hydraulic breakers usually use a hydraulic motor driving a sealed pneumatic hammer system, as a hydraulic hammer would develop a low strike speed and transfer unacceptable shock loads to the pump system. Advances in technology have allowed for portable hydraulic breakers. The jackhammer is connected with hydraulic hoses to a portable hydraulic powerpack: either a petrol or diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump; or a mini-excavator or skid-steer via a power take-off driveshaft to the machine's hydraulic system. Hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors, making the kit smaller, cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version.  Bits (chisels)  Bit types include * Spade ‚Äì provides flat finish for concrete or edging in asphalt or dirt. * Flat tip ‚Äì allows direction control or finer edge finish * Point ‚Äì general breaking * Stake driver ‚Äì drives concrete form stakes * Scabbler ‚Äì finishes surface smooth or for cleaning prior to bonding * Flex chisel ‚Äì flexible metal blade (attached to shank with bolts) for tile removal and scraping * Bushing tool ‚Äì multiple carbide points for cleaning up seams and knocking down rough spots in concrete ;Sharpening Chisels may be resharpened in a shop or with an angle grinder with grinding disc. After resharpening, they must then be heat treated to restore the integrity of the steel before use. Self-sharpening polygon and flat chisels are also available. Health effects A jackhammer with black silencer attached The sound of the hammer blows, combined with the explosive air exhaust, makes pneumatic jackhammers dangerously loud, emitting more than 120 dB SPL near the operator‚Äôs ears. Sound-blocking earmuffs and earplugs must be worn by the operator to prevent a form of hearing loss, of which tinnitus is the main symptom. Although some pneumatic jackhammers now have a silencer around the barrel of the tool, the primary noise source comes from the chisel striking the object being removed. Use has been linked to Raynaud syndrome; in particular, prolonged exposure to the pronounced vibration conducted by the tool can lead to a secondary form of the syndrome known as vibration white finger. Applying athletic tape is not very effective in preventing white finger but seems to help alleviate some of its discomfort. Pneumatic drill usage can also lead to a predisposition for development of carpal tunnel syndrome. Some manufacturers of electro-pneumatic tools now offer vibration reduction systems to reduce the vibration felt by the operator. For example, Hilti manufactures a jackhammer model that has approximately the same impact energy of a pneumatic hammer, but the vibration felt by the operator is significantly less (7 m/s2). Other manufacturers such as Makita, DeWalt and Bosch also offer electric tools with vibration dampening. Using a jackhammer to break up concrete pavement may expose the operator to hazardous dust containing respirable crystalline silica. Publication date is date of last page update. The operator and those in the vicinity of the jackhammer operations should wear personal protective equipment respirators, more precisely, an OSHA approved respirator.

The river is about long.Calculated in Google Maps and Google Earth Hydrography The Elk River rises in Grundy County, Tennessee, in Burroughs Cove near the community of Elkhead. It is bridged for the first time by State Route 50 near Pelham, Tennessee. At first it flows southwestward, and turns to flow more generally westward. It is then bridged by both U.S. Route 41 and Interstate 24. Shortly below this point, it forms the Coffee County - Franklin County line. It is first impounded by Elk River Dam, forming Woods Reservoir, the impoundment of which extends upstream to about the same point where the stream ceases to serve as the Coffee-Franklin County line and is entirely in Franklin County. This reservoir was built under the auspices of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, primarily to provide a large source of cooling water for the U.S. Air Force's Arnold Engineering Development Center, which has large wind tunnels and other military and scientific research equipment. This area is also used as a wildlife refuge. The reservoir is bridged by State Route 127. Only a few miles below Elk River Dam is the beginning of slack water (Tims Ford Lake) caused by the Tims Ford Dam of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The slack water extends upstream to the vicinity of Estill Springs. It is then bridged by U.S. Route 41A. Backwaters of the Tims Ford project also extend into the nearby town of Winchester, county seat of Franklin County, even though the main channel of the Elk runs to its west, bridged by State Route 130. A considerable amount of leakage from the reservoir is observed along State Route 50 in the form of what appear to be large springs along the north side of that road but are in fact leaking of the reservoir waters through the porous limestone rock of the area. This phenomenon has resulted in a locally-popular source of water for livestock and other uses for which filtration and treatment of the water to be used is unnecessary. State Route 50 again crosses the Elk just below Tims Ford Dam. Shortly below the dam, the stream becomes the boundary between Franklin County and Moore County, and then subsequently between Moore County and Lincoln County. The stream begins to meander severely. It is bridged near the small community of Kelso, site of a cave used as a saltpeter mine by Confederates during the Civil War, by U.S. Route 64. The Elk flows just south of Fayetteville, where it is bridged by U.S. Route 231/431. Until the late 1960s there was a \\"dry\\" stone masonry bridge (one in which the stones are held in place by the power of gravity forcing them against each other, not mortar) over the Elk; it was destroyed in a flood. Several miles west of Fayetteville, it is crossed by State Route 274, a highway built on an old railroad bed. It then crosses into Giles County, where it is bridged by CSX Transportation and Interstate 65 before flowing just south of Elkton, Tennessee, where it is bridged by U.S. Route 31. A few miles below this point it crosses into Limestone County, Alabama, where it meets the Tennessee River. There are actually two Elk Rivers in Tennessee, the smaller of which is located in northeast Tennessee. This Elk River flows from the back side of Beech Mountain, North Carolina through Carter County, Tennessee and empties into Watauga Lake.Watauga Lake Recreation In Limestone County, Alabama there is a Canoe and Kayak Trail. The trail begins at the Alabama-Tennessee state line and goes to Elk River Mills.

Biography  Fraser was born in Glasgow, Scotland, later moving with his family to Aberdeen. He attended the University of St. Andrews. During World War II he served in the British Army in Cairo and Eritrea. He was published as a poet in Salamander, a Cairo literary magazine. At the same time he was involved with the New Apocalyptics group, writing an introductory essay for the anthology The White Horseman, and formulating as well as anyone did the idea that they were successors to surrealism. After the war he became a prominent figure in London's literary circles, working as a journalist and critic. Together with his wife Paddy he made friends with a gamut of literary figures, from the intellectual leader William Empson to the eccentric John Gawsworth. He worked with Ian Fletcher to have Gawsworth's Collected Poems (1949) published. His direction was that of the traditional man of letters (soon to become extinct). In 1948, Fraser contributed an essay entitled \\"A Language by Itself\\" to a biblio-symposium honouring the sixtieth birthday of T. S. Eliot. Drawing comparisons with John Donne, he praised the poet's profound refreshment (particularly in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock) of the English poetic tongue, together with his subtle facility for transitional verse and his potent effect on the poetic youth; but, more importantly for present purposes, he also confessed, \\"I am not a very original writer myself; I am lost, on the whole, without a convention of some sort [...].\\"Fraser 1948, p. 172. In 1949 he accepted the job of replacing Edmund Blunden as Cultural Adviser to the UK Liaison Mission in Tokyo. This ended badly when he suffered a breakdown in 1951 while in Japan. Subsequently he was much less the poet than the all-purpose writer. He became a lecturer at the University of Leicester in 1959, where he was an inspiring teacher, remaining there until retirement in 1979. He married Eileen Lucy Andrew (but was known as Paddy from birth) in 1946. She wrote a brief memoir of her life with Fraser; G. S. Fraser: A Memoir. Together they had two daughters, including Helen Fraser, and a son. Paddy died in 2013.

Construction used the existing foundations of a cancelled skyscraper project, the Zaryadye Administrative Building, which would have been the eighth of what are now referred to as the \\"Seven Sisters\\". The architect was Dmitry Chechulin. Large portions of a historic district of Moscow, known as Zaryadye, were demolished in the 1940s for the original project. It was registered in The Guinness Book of Records as the largest hotel in the world until it was surpassed by the Excalibur in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1990. It remained the largest hotel in Europe until its 2006 closure. The 21-story Rossiya had 3,000 rooms, 245 half suites, a post office, a health club, a nightclub, a movie theater, the Zaryadye,http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3552520.stm and a barber shop, a police station with jail cells behind unmarked black doors near the barber shop, and the 2500-seat State Central Concert Hall. The building could accommodate over 4,000 guests. Most of the rooms were 11 square meters (over 1300 sq ft). The hotel was adjacent to Red Square, its 21-story tower looming over the Kremlin walls and the cupolas of Saint Basil's Cathedral. Fire On February 25, 1977, a major fire in the building killed 42 and injured 50. The high death and injury rate was exacerbated because the hotel had very few exits, a design intended to make it difficult for guests to enter or exit unseen by the hotel staff. Demolition Demolition of Rossiya, February 3, 2007 The Rossiya Hotel closed on January 1, 2006. Demolition of the building began in March 2006 for a planned entertainment complex which would have been loosely based on the design of the old Zaryadye district. The project was to be overseen by British architect Sir Norman Foster and would have included a new, two thousand room hotel with apartments and a parking garage.Sky's the limit for booming Moscow (Times Online) In October 2006, the Supreme Arbitration Court cancelled the results of a tender to reconstruct the Rossiya hotel near the Kremlin.

It was discovered in 1832 by Germain Henri Hess who named it after Count Sergei Semenovitch Uvarov (1765‚Äì1855), a Russian statesman and amateur mineral collector. It is classified in the ugrandite group alongside the other calcium-bearing garnets andradite and grossular. Uvarovite is the rarest of the common members of the garnet group, and is the only consistently green garnet species, with an emerald-green color. It occurs as well-formed fine-sized crystals. Occurrence Uvarovite most commonly occurs in solid solution with grossular or andradite, and is generally found associated with serpentinite, chromite, metamorphic limestones, and skarn ore-bodies. The most significant source of uvarovite historically has been a now-closed copper mine at Outokumpu, Finland, from where most museum specimens have been collected. The uvarovite crystals found in the Outokumpu district are among a wide range of chromium-rich silicate phases found in association with volcanogenic copper-cobalt-zinc sulfide ore deposits which are known to have an unusually high chromium content. Uvarovite occurrences in the United States are predominantly found in the western portion of the country, including localities in New Mexico, Arizona, and California. In the eastern United States, uvarovite has been confirmed in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The mineral has also been reported from eastern Cuba.. 9 grains of uvarovite occur in a heavy mineral fraction of bulk stream sediment HM-10 collected in Bunker Hill creek, below the historic Bunker Hill gold mine, south of Nelson in British Columbia Canada. Its source is likely near serpentinites and argillaceous limestones within about 450 m upstream of the silt site . Notable localities in Europe besides the Outokumpu site known to bear uvarovite include Roros, Norway; Pitkaranta, Finland; Val Malenco, Italy; Pico do Posets near Venasque, Spain; Kip Daglari, Turkey; and Biserk and Sarany, Russia. In Africa, uvarovite has been reported from the Bushveld Igneous Complex of Transvaal, South Africa and from the Vumba Schist Belt in Botswana. In Asia, uvarovite has been reported from Taiwan. and Japan In Australia, uvarovite has been reported from chromite deposits in southern New South Wales.

Clawfinger is known for aggressive but melodic music and tackling political and anti-racist themes in their songs. Band history The band's origin dates back to mid-1989, when Zak Tell and Jocke Skog met while working together at Rosenlund Hospital in Stockholm. In 1990, they were joined by the Norwegian guitarists B√•rd Torstensen and Erlend Ottem who were also working at the hospital. The four soon realized their similar interests in music. B√•rd and Erlend played previously in a band called Theo in their hometown Arendal in Norway. They invested their free time exploring the musical world, composing and writing songs while eventually evolving into a band. Their original demo comprising three tracks (\\"Waste of Time\\", \\"Nigger\\" and \\"Profit Preacher\\") quickly secured local radio airplay for them and consequently brought them to the attention of the music label MVG Records. \\"Nigger\\" is an anti-racism statement that caused quite a stir and was a massive success; it was also released as a single. By the beginning of the 1990s, Clawfinger self-released their debut Deaf Dumb Blind. This sold over 600,000 copies worldwide and was critically acclaimed by the Swedish press. With the addition of Andr√© Skaug and drummer Morten Skaug, Clawfinger went on tour and played at European festivals, including opening for Anthrax and Alice in Chains. The band received many awards, including two Grammies \\"at home\\" during the Swedish Grammy Awards in 1994 for best hard rock band and for best music video. After the subsequent touring, they went straight back in the studio to record their second album, Use Your Brain. The album was released 1995 and yet another touring campaign followed, most notably participating at Ozzy Osbourne's Monsters of Rock Festival in Argentina, Brazil and Chile in that year, rocking alongside American metal counterparts like Megadeth, Faith No More, and Alice Cooper. Back in Europe they continued the touring campaign by taking part at festivals and countless gigs. Their self-titled album Clawfinger was released in 1997. The first song on the album is \\"Two Sides\\", which expanded the band's reach by using female choir vocals and a Middle Eastern sound. The rest of the album continues with the band's typical aggressive voice and socio-political lyrics. Clawfinger contains 12 songs with an additional 3 bonus tracks on the limited edition. They released three singles and two videos (Biggest & the Best and Two Sides). A Whole Lot of Nothing was the fourth album released on 23 July 2001. The music showcases the same aggressive guitars, with more distortion effects and sounds, adding a new level of diversification. Synthesizers are much more present on this particular album than on any other of Clawfinger's works. A Whole Lot of Nothing contains 13 tracks and 2 bonus tracks on the limited edition. Clawfinger also released four singles, two of which are limited editions. Zeros & Heroes caused controversy upon its 2003 release in America due to open critique of former head of state George W. Bush and US military politics following the 11 September 2001 attacks, particularly in the song \\"Step Aside\\". It offers yet another change of style for the listener. The electronic sound and synthesizers from A Whole Lot of Nothing are gone and replaced by a more complex and melodic guitar riffing. Hate Yourself With Style was released in 2005. The album continued the path entered on Zeros & Heroes and is characterized by hard rock style melodic speedy guitar riffs. The keyboards which particularly characterized A Whole Lot of Nothing have completely disappeared. Unlike previous albums, where the limited edition featured two or more bonus-tracks, the limited edition of this album features a DVD with live footage from the Greenfield festival and video clips of all singles up to Clawfinger's third album. Life Will Kill You was released in 2007. It has spawned three singles: \\"Prisoners\\", \\"The Price We Pay\\", and \\"Little Baby\\". =Disbandment and reunions= Clawfinger had been working on a re-recording of their debut album Deaf Dumb Blind. The plan was to re-record all the album's songs, additionally featuring guest musicians. Zak Tell has stated, that talks were held with members of Rammstein and Peter T√§gtgren from the bands Pain and Hypocrisy. In 2008 and 2009, the band played at the biggest open-air festival in Europe (400,000‚Äì500,000 rock fans every year)‚ÄîPrzystanek Woodstock in Poland. On 24 August 2013, the band's Facebook page announced that the group is disbanding. On 5 October 2013, another announcement was made that Jocke Skog had joined the Swedish death metal band Feared as their new bassist. In May 2014, the Facebook page of the band announced a one-off show at the ZAKHID festival in Ukraine on 8 August 2014. The band has been occasional one-off reunion shows since then, performing two in 2015, two in 2016 for Denmark's CopenHell Festival and Bulgaria's Summer Chaos Festival, and most recently on the Irreversible Festival 2017 in Monthey, Switzerland. On 4 August 2017, the band released the new single \\"Save Our Souls\\" via iTunes and YouTube. Another single, \\"Tear You Down\\", was released in October 4, 2019.

He apprenticed in New York from 1865 to 1870 under Detlef Lienau, and, in 1870, opened his own practice there.Pierson, Majorie (ed.) et al. \\"Ladies' Mile Historic District Designation Report v.2\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (May 2, 1989) He obtained his first contracts for three buildings at Rutgers College in New Brunswick, New Jersey‚Äîthe expansion of Alexander Johnston Hall (1871), designing and building Geology Hall (1872) and the Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873)‚Äîthrough family connections. Hardenbergh's great-great grandfather, the Reverend Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh, had been the first president of Rutgers College from 1785 to 1790, when it was still called \\"Queen's College\\". He then got the contract to design the \\"Vancorlear\\" on West 55th Street, the first apartment hotel in New York City, in 1879. The following year he was commissioned by Edward S. Clark, then head of the Singer Sewing Machine Company, to build a housing development. As part of this work, he designed the pioneering Dakota Apartments in Central Park West, novel in its location, very far north of the center of the city. Subsequently, Hardenbergh received commissions to build the Waldorf (1893) and the adjoining Astoria (1897) hotels for William Waldorf Astor and Mrs. Astor, respectively. The two competing hotels were later joined together as the Waldorf-Astoria, which was demolished in 1929 for the construction of the Empire State Building.

It was originally proved by Gerhard Gentzen in his landmark 1934 paper \\"Investigations in Logical Deduction\\" for the systems LJ and LK formalising intuitionistic and classical logic respectively. The cut-elimination theorem states that any judgement that possesses a proof in the sequent calculus making use of the cut rule also possesses a cut-free proof, that is, a proof that does not make use of the cut rule., gives a 5-page proof of the elimination theorem. See also pages 188, 250., gives a very brief proof of the cut-elimination theorem. The cut rule A sequent is a logical expression relating multiple formulas, in the form , which is to be read as proves , and (as glossed by Gentzen) should be understood as equivalent to the truth-function \\"If (A_1 and A_2 and A_3 ‚Ä¶) then (B_1 or B_2 or B_3 ‚Ä¶).\\"Wilfried Buchholz, Beweistheorie (university lecture notes about cut-elimination, German, 2002-2003) Note that the left-hand side (LHS) is a conjunction (and) and the right-hand side (RHS) is a disjunction (or). The LHS may have arbitrarily many or few formulae; when the LHS is empty, the RHS is a tautology. In LK, the RHS may also have any number of formulae‚Äîif it has none, the LHS is a contradiction, whereas in LJ the RHS may only have one formula or none: here we see that allowing more than one formula in the RHS is equivalent, in the presence of the right contraction rule, to the admissibility of the law of the excluded middle. However, the sequent calculus is a fairly expressive framework, and there have been sequent calculi for intuitionistic logic proposed that allow many formulae in the RHS. From Jean-Yves Girard's logic LC it is easy to obtain a rather natural formalisation of classical logic where the RHS contains at most one formula; it is the interplay of the logical and structural rules that is the key here. \\"Cut\\" is a rule in the normal statement of the sequent calculus, and equivalent to a variety of rules in other proof theories, which, given 1. \\\\Gamma \\\\vdash A,\\\\Delta and 2. \\\\Pi, A \\\\vdash \\\\Lambda allows one to infer 3. \\\\Gamma, \\\\Pi \\\\vdash \\\\Delta,\\\\Lambda That is, it \\"cuts\\" the occurrences of the formula A out of the inferential relation. Cut elimination The cut-elimination theorem states that (for a given system) any sequent provable using the rule Cut can be proved without use of this rule. For sequent calculi that have only one formula in the RHS, the \\"Cut\\" rule reads, given 1. \\\\Gamma \\\\vdash A and 2. \\\\Pi, A \\\\vdash B allows one to infer 3. \\\\Gamma, \\\\Pi \\\\vdash B If we think of B as a theorem, then cut-elimination in this case simply says that a lemma A used to prove this theorem can be inlined. Whenever the theorem's proof mentions lemma A, we can substitute the occurrences for the proof of A. Consequently, the cut rule is admissible. Consequences of the theorem For systems formulated in the sequent calculus, analytic proofs are those proofs that do not use Cut. Typically such a proof will be longer, of course, and not necessarily trivially so. In his essay \\"Don't Eliminate Cut!\\" George Boolos demonstrated that there was a derivation that could be completed in a page using cut, but whose analytic proof could not be completed in the lifespan of the universe. The theorem has many, rich consequences: * A system is inconsistent if it admits a proof of the absurd. If the system has a cut elimination theorem, then if it has a proof of the absurd, or of the empty sequent, it should also have a proof of the absurd (or the empty sequent), without cuts. It is typically very easy to check that there are no such proofs. Thus, once a system is shown to have a cut elimination theorem, it is normally immediate that the system is consistent. * Normally also the system has, at least in first order logic, the subformula property, an important property in several approaches to proof-theoretic semantics. Cut elimination is one of the most powerful tools for proving interpolation theorems. The possibility of carrying out proof search based on resolution, the essential insight leading to the Prolog programming language, depends upon the admissibility of Cut in the appropriate system. For proof systems based on higher-order typed lambda calculus through a Curry-Howard isomorphism, cut elimination algorithms correspond to the strong normalization property (every proof term reduces in a finite number of steps into a normal form).

Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence. The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign statess for the rebelling nationality. From a different point of view, such wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence. Guerrilla warfare or asymmetric warfare is often utilized by groups labeled as national liberation movements, often with support from other states. The term \\"wars of national liberation\\" is most commonly used for those fought during the decolonization movement. Since these were primarily in the third world against Western powers and their economic influence and a major aspect of the Cold War, the phrase itself has often been viewed as biased or pejorative. Some of these wars were either vocally or materially supported by the Soviet Union, which stated itself to be an anti-imperialist power, supporting the replacement of western-backed governments with local communist or other non pro-western parties. However, this did not always guarantee Soviet influence in those countries. In addition to and increasingly in competition to the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China presented themselves as models of independent nationalist development outside of Western influence, particularly as such posturing and other longterm hostility meant they were regarded as a threat to Western power and regarded themselves as such, using their resources to politically, economically and militarily assist movements such as in Vietnam. In January 1961 Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev pledged support for \\"wars of national liberation\\" throughout the world. Legal issues International law generally holds that a people with a legal right to self- determination are entitled to wage wars of national liberation.Malanczuk, 1997, p. 336. While Western states tend to view these wars as civil wars, Third World and communist states tend to view them as international wars. This difference in classification leads to varying perceptions of which laws of war apply in such situations. However, there is general agreement among all states today in principle that the use of force to frustrate a people's legal right to self-determination is unlawful.  Strategies and tactics  Wars of national liberation are usually fought using guerrilla warfare. The main purpose of these tactics is to increase the cost of the anti-guerrilla forces past the point where such forces are willing to bear. Wars of national liberation generally depend on widespread public support, with ordinary civilians providing crucial support. Finally, wars of national liberation are often embedded in a larger context of great power politics and are often proxy wars. These strategies explain why they are quite successful against foreign regimes and quite unsuccessful against indigenous regimes. Foreign regimes usually have a threshold beyond which they would prefer to go home rather than to fight the war. By contrast, an indigenous regime has no place to which they can retreat, and will fight much harder because of the lack of alternatives. Moreover, foreign regimes usually have fewer active supporters in the theater, and those that exist can often be easily identified, making it possible for guerrilla armies to identify their targets. By contrast, indigenous regimes often have much more popular support, and their supporters are often not easily recognized as such, making it much harder to conduct operations against them without also causing harm to neutral parties.  Decolonization period  The first separatist rebellion within the former British Empire not to end in defeat since the American Revolutionary War was the Irish War of Independence of 1919-1922 which led in 1922 to the renewed independence of most of Ireland (26 counties out of 32). However the rebellion also led to the Irish Civil War (1922-1923). The Indonesian War of Independence (1945-1949) followed with the Liberation of Irian Jaya (1960-1962), the First Indochina War (1946‚Äì54), Vietnam War (1959‚Äì75), and the Algerian War (1954‚Äì62) were all considered national liberation wars by the rebelling sides of the conflicts. The African National Congress (ANC)'s struggle against the apartheid regime is also another example. Most of these rebellions were in part supported by the Soviet Union, which was an anti-imperialist power. Since the 1917 October Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War, the revolutionary objectives of communism were shared by many anticolonialist leaders, thus explaining the objective alliance between anticolonialist forces and Marxism. The concept of \\"imperialism\\" itself had been which had theorized in Lenin's 1916 book, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. For example, Ho Chi Minh -- who founded the Viet-Minh in 1941 and declared the independence of Vietnam on September 2, 1945, following the 1945 August Revolution -- was a founding member of the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1921. In January 1961, over three years before the Gulf of Tonkin incident which would mark the United States' increased involvement in the Vietnam War, Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev would pledge support for \\"wars of national liberation\\" throughout the world. In the same decade, Cuba, led by Fidel Castro, would support national liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique. The Portuguese colonial wars finally led to the recognition of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea- Bissau as independent states in 1975, following the April Carnation Revolution. Ongoing wars defined as national liberation conflicts The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a national liberation movement, meaning that it holds official recognition of its legal status as such. Other national liberation movements in the OAU at that time included the African National Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress of Azania (PAC). It is the only non-African national liberation movement to hold observer status in the OAU, and was one of the first national liberation movements granted permanent observer status by the United Nations General Assembly pursuant to a 1974 resolution.Shultz, 1988, p. 100.Wilson, 1990, p. 119. The PLO also participates in UN Security Council debates; since 1988, it has represented the Palestinian people at the UN under the name \\"Palestine\\".Boczek, 2005, p86. The following current conflicts have sometimes also been characterized as wars or struggles of national liberation (such a designation is often subject to controversy): * Many Chechens and foreign observers consider the First and Second Chechen Wars to be wars of national liberation against Russia.Sakwa, Richard (2005), Chechnya: From Past to Future, p. 208. Anthem Press, , 9781843311645Evangelista, Matthew (2002), The Chechen wars: will Russia go the way of the Soviet Union?, p. 142. Brookings Institution Press, , Dunlop, John B. (1998), Russia Confronts Chechnya, p. 93. Cambridge University Press, , * Some Iraqi insurgent groups, and certain political groups believe that the Iraq War was a war of national liberation against the US-led coalition. * Many Kurds believe the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict to be a war of national liberation of Kurdish people in Turkey. * The Polisario Front has sought the independence of Western Sahara since 1975 and considered its guerilla war against Morocco as national liberation war (like many foreign observers, countries and the African Union), while Morocco considered it a secessionist movement. Polisario had been recognized by many countries, the African Union and the United Nations as the legitimate representative of the Sahrawi people. The hostilities are frozen since the 1991 cease-fire following the settlement plan agreement. * As a result of the politics of the former Yugoslavia, the government of Kosovo declared (on 2 July 1990) an independent \\"Republic of Kosovo\\" from the Republic of Serbia's Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. After the dissolution of socialist Yugoslavia, a referendum was held for independence in 1992 that passed and began a conflict between the Albanian separatists led by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Yugoslav military and paramilitary armed forces. This lasted until 1999 when a peace was brokered and the province came under UN administration under the terms of UNSCR 1244. International negotiations between Pristina and Belgrade are in progress on the future status of Kosovo.

Two studies published in 2019 found that the population which built Britain's Stonehenge descended predominantly from Fertile Crescent, South Slavic, Anatolian, and Aegean farmers (see also Neolithic Agricultural Revolution), and while female lineages were varied, male lineages belonged almost exclusively to Eastern European and Mediterranean males of I2a genetic lineage. Similar forms are also found throughout the world including Australia, Gabon, Greece, Hawaii, India (Daraki-Chattan), Israel, Mexico, Mozambique and the Americas. The oldest known forms are found from the Fertile Crescent to India. They consist of a concave depression, no more than a few centimetres across, pecked into a rock surface and often surrounded by concentric circles also etched into the stone. Sometimes a linear channel called a gutter leads out from the middle. The decoration occurs as a petroglyph on natural boulders and outcrops and also as an element of megalithic art on purposely worked megaliths such as the slab cists of the Food Vessel culture, some stone circles and passage graves such as the clava tombs and on the capstones at Newgrange. Canaan The site of Atlit Yam, abandoned circa 6300 BCE and now under Israel's Mediterranean Sea coast south of Haifa, features cup marks engraved into megalithic stones, some of which are set upright to form a semi-circle which has been referred to as resembling the UK's Stonehenge but smaller,Jerusalem Post: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ObSB- SsFQLEJ:www.jpost.com/Local-Israel/Around-Israel/Israels-AtlantisIsrael Antiquities Authority: http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=14&subj;_id=139 with ceremonially buried bodies at the site, and potential alignments to the solstice, and/or to other stars, still being hypothesized as the site was only discovered in 2009 and undersea sites are difficult and expensive to explore. Further inland, dating to at least 3000 BCE (exposed) and estimated up to 4000 BCE (unexcavated layer, under the layer which is exposed), is Rujm el-Hiri, a cairn (tumulus) type of megalith, consisting of concentric circles (as cup marks also are concentric circles, but much smaller than Rogem Hiri) estimated to contain 40,000,000 kg of stones moved by humans, with an opening in the outer circle which aligns to the summer solstice (just as sites throughout Eurasia also align to solstices) and which has a burial chamber in the center, with thousands of dolmens nearby, a \\"dolmen\\" being a 3rd and younger type of megalith found elsewhere in Eurasia, the oldest of which, thus far, are found in the UK, but date only to the 3rd millennium BCE in Israel.Oldest archaeological org in Israel: http://www.hadashot- esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1164&mag;_id=115 The cup marks are still present in other proto-Canaanite sites as recently as the Chalcolithic Age, for example at several sites in and around modern-day Modiin dated to the fourth millennium BCE and the third millennium BCE, and in the City of David, Old Jerusalem. Tel Gezer has more up-ended megaliths dating to only 1550 BCE which are aligned to Earth's north and south physical poles, but Tel Gezer's cupmarks have only recently been surveyed (2012) and do not appear to have been dated (as to whether they were made before, concurrent to or after the 1550 BCE megaliths) yet; however, excavations at Gezer are ongoing as of 2014. Greece *Prefecture of Larissa, Greece. *Island of Irakleia, Greece Italy Novalesa cup-and-rings stone Italy Numerous cup-marked stones have been found in quite all the alpine valleys, comprising Val Camonica (Italy), associated with rock drawings. Regarding western alps (Piedmont), the best known are distributed along the Chisone, Susa and Vi√π valleys; also the La Bessa site is to be cited. Strictly referring to cup-and-rings, it is possible to cite in the western Alps only the Novalesa stone,A rock record in the western Alps, TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin 12, 2000 in the Cenischia Valley, near the Italian-French border. Found in 1988, it shows 4 concentric circles, with a central cup-mark; all around a network of 20 cup-marks and channels. Sardinia mamoiada perda pinta Sardinia is rich in cup-and-rings stones: the best known is the Perda Pint√† (the \\"painted stone\\", which is carved, not painted) or Stele di Boeli,:it:Stele di Boeli at Mamoiada: an impressive stela or menhir 2,67 m high with various concentric circles patterns crossed by engraved channels and central cup-marks. Spain Similar patterns are known in Galicia, which has given them the name of 'Galician style'. These types, the cup-and-ring, cup-and-ring with gutter and the gapped concentric circles motifs are shared between this part of Iberia and the British Isles, manifesting, together with other cultural expressions like megaliths or Bronze Age culture, a cultural link along the coasts of Atlantic Europe. United Kingdom Dalgarven, North Ayrshire, Scotland. Precisely dating megalithic art is difficult: even if the megalithic monument can be dated, the art may be a later addition. The Hunterheugh Crags cup and ring marks near Alnwick in Northumberland have recently been demonstrated to date back into the Early Neolithic era through their stratigraphic relationship with other, datable features. Some cup marks have been found in Iron Age contexts but these may represent re-used stones. Where they are etched onto natural, flat stone it has been observed that they seem to incorporate the natural surface of the rock. Those at Hunterheugh are mostly connected to one another by gutters that can channel rainwater from one to the next, down the sloping top of the stone. It has been suggested by archaeologist Clive Waddington that the initial Early Neolithic impetus to create the marks was forgotten and that the practice fell into abeyance until a second phase of creation continued the basic tradition but with less precision and more variability in design. The markers of this second phase moved the art from natural stones to megaliths as its symbolism was reinterpreted by Later Neolithic and Early Bronze Age people. Their purpose is unknown although some may be connected with natural stone outcrops exploited by Neolithic peoples to make polished stone axes. A religious purpose has been suggested. Alexander Thom suggested in a BBC television documentary, Cracking the Stone Age Code, in 1970, \\"I have an idea, entirely nebulous at the moment, that the cup and ring markings were a method of recording, of writing, and that they may indicate, once we can read them, what a particular stone was for. We have seen the cup and ring markings on the stone at Temple Wood, and that's on the main stone but we can't interpret them ...yet.\\" He created diagrams and carried out analysis of over 50 of the cup and ring markings from which he determined a length he termed the Megalithic Inch (MI).Systematics: The Journal of the Institute for the comparative study of History, Philosophy and the Sciences, Vol. 6, Number 3, Coombe Spring Press., December 1968 This whole idea has been ignored almost completely apart from a critical analysis carried out by Alan Davis in the 1980s, who tested Thom's hypothesis on cup and ring sites in England by examining the separations of neighbouring cupmark centres. He found some weak evidence for the \\"Megalithic Inch\\" but it was not statistically significant, and he suggested \\"strongest indications...towards the use of a quantum close in value to 5 MI at certain sites\\" and that \\"the apparent quantum seems strongly associated with ringed cups.\\" Davis made an initial effort to build on Thom's start, and to answer the question he posed: \\"Why should a man spend hours ‚Äì or rather days ‚Äì cutting cups in a random fashion on a rock? It would indeed be a breakthrough if someone could crack the code of the cups.\\" Subsequently, Davis investigated the idea that the prehistoric carvers used an elementary method of diameter-construction in laying out the carvings. This investigation (incorporating both Scottish and English sites) suggested a possible explanation for many of the characteristic shapes of carved rings, and also produced evidence in the ring diameters for the use of a unit of measurement close to Thom's MI (and 5 MI) that was of high statistical significance. The evidence is consistent with the use of rough measures such as hand- and finger-widths (rather than the formal, accurate system proposed by Thom), but the important conclusion is that a similar design ritual, apparently involving a consistent measurement system of some kind, was in use over a wide geographical area. =Sites= Sites with cup and ring marks include: *Ecclesall Wood, Sheffield, South Yorkshire *Baildon Moor, Bradford, West Yorkshire *Chatton Sandyford cairn and Fowberry petroglyphs in Northumberland *Rombalds Moor including Ilkley Moor *Gardom's Edge in Derbyshire *Bachwen portal dolmen in North Wales *Anderton, Lancashire *Dalladies long barrow, Kincardineshire *Street House cairn in Cleveland *Dalgarven Mill, North Ayrshire *Ballochmyle cup and ring marks, Mauchline, East Ayrshire *Brodick, Isle of Arran *Blackshaw Hill, North Ayrshire *Kilmartin, Argyll *Tomnaverie stone circle, Aberdeenshire *Balblair, Beauly, nr.

It should be used as soon as the headache starts. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include chest pain, dizziness, dry mouth, and tingling. Other side effects may include myocardial infarction, stroke, high blood pressure, serotonin syndrome, and anaphylaxis. Excessive use may result in medication overuse headaches. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended within 24 hours after taking a dose. Rizatriptan is in the triptan class and is believed to work by activating the 5-HT1 receptor. Rizatriptan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1998. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 204th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than two million prescriptions. Medical uses Rizatriptan is used to treat acute migraine attacks with or without aura. It does not prevent future migraine attacks. A 2010 review found rizatriptan to be more efficacious and tolerable than sumatriptan. Contraindications Rizatriptan and other triptans can cause vasoconstriction, they are contraindicated in people with cardiovascular conditions. Adverse effects Frequent adverse effects (incidence less than 10%) are dizziness, drowsiness, asthenia/fatigue, and nausea. Clinical adverse experiences were typically mild and short-lasting (2‚Äì3 hours).  Interactions * Propranolol Mechanism of action Rizatriptan acts as an agonist at serotonin 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Like the other triptans sumatriptan and zolmitriptan, rizatriptan induces vasoconstriction‚Äîpossibly by inhibiting the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide from sensory neurons in the trigeminal nerve.

The long handle combined with a heavy head allows the sledgehammer to gather momentum during a swing and apply a large force compared to hammers designed to drive nails. Along with the mallet, it shares the ability to distribute force over a wide area. This is in contrast to other types of hammers, which concentrate force in a relatively small area. Etymology A straight peen sledge hammer from an 1899 American book on blacksmithing The word sledgehammer is derived from the Anglo Saxon \\"sl√¶gan\\", which, in its first sense, means \\"to strike violently\\". The English words \\"slag\\", \\"slay\\", and \\"slog\\" are cognates.An Anglo Saxon Dictionary, Joseph Bosworth, The Clarendon press, 1882 Uses Sledgehammer used for driving railroad spikes into wooden sleepers during rail construction. The handle can range from to a full long, depending on the mass of the head. The head mass is usually . Modern heavy duty sledgehammers come with heads. Sledgehammers usually require two hands and a swinging motion involving the entire torso, in contrast to smaller hammers used for driving in nails. The combination of a long swinging range, and heavy head, increases the force of the resulting impact. Sledgehammers are often used in destruction work, for breaking through drywall or masonry walls. Sledgehammers are seldom used in modern mining operations, particularly hand steel. Sledgehammers are also used when substantial force is necessary to dislodge a trapped object (often in farm or oil field work), or for fracturing concrete. Another common use is for driving fence posts into the ground. Sledgehammers are used by police forces in raids on property to gain entry by force, commonly through doors. They were and still are commonly used by blacksmiths to shape heavy sections of iron. The British SAS counter terrorist team used sledgehammers to gain access to rooms during the 1980 Iranian Embassy Siege. However, today they use a tool called a \\"dynamic hammer\\". Another iconic use of sledgehammers is for driving railroad spikes into wooden sleepers during rail construction. When the two ends of the Union Pacific railroad were joined at Promontory, Utah, Leland Stanford hammered a golden spike into a sleeper with a silver hammer.Ambrose, Stephen E. Nothing Like It In The World. (2001) p. 365-367. Sledges used to drive spikes for rails had curved heads that came down to a \\"beak\\" that was only about one inch across. The shape meant that drivers needed to be accurate, and spot where the spike hit was often not much larger than a small coin, as anything larger would hit the plate or the sleeper. The curved head kept the handle away from the rail, as the spikes were driven with the rail between the spike and the driver. These are often called spike mauls. Drilling hammer A man cutting a paving stone using a drilling hammer to drive a chisel Drilling hammer A drilling hammer', club hammer, ', crack hammer, mini-sledge or thor hammer is a small sledgehammer whose relatively light weight and short handle allow single-handed use. It is useful for light demolition work, driving masonry nails, and for use with a steel chisel when cutting stone or metal. In this last application, its weight drives the chisel more deeply into the material being cut than lighter hammers. Club hammers are common on the British inland waterways for driving mooring pins into the towpath or canal bank. Scouts BSA has adopted the shorter Sledge Hammer, commonly referred to as an Engineer's Hammer, as an unofficial tool referred to as the Scout Hammer, as a complement to the Pocket Knife and Hand Axe. The handle is 12-18 inches long with a head weighing 2 to 6 lbs. The hammer is used for a variety of purposes such as driving tent stakes, establishing temporary fencing using wood or metal re-bar, splitting wood in conjunction with a wedge, or straightening all that is bent. Post maul Post maul Post mauls are similar to sledgehammers in shape, but are meant to drive wooden fence posts or tree stakes into the earth. Newer mauls have broad, flat circular faces that are significantly larger in diameter than the body of the head (where the handle attaches). Older post mauls are significantly larger than sledgehammers like their newer counterparts except the outside diameter (body) of older post maul designs remained the same large diameter as that of the faces of the hammer from one side to the other side. Sledgehammers usually have octagonal faces that are the same diameter or slightly smaller than the body of the head, and they are not nearly as large in overall diameter as a post maul.

The college provides education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, offering degrees in more than 54 majors, special course offerings and certificates, affiliated and pre-professional programs.  History  St. Joseph's College 1922 students yearbook Originally named St. Joseph's College for Women, the college was founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, in response to the need for a day college for young women. It is the only historical women's college in the borough of Brooklyn, NY. SJC received its provisional charter from the Regents of the University of the State of New York on February 24, 1916. After the college outgrew its original Brooklyn facilities at 286 Washington Avenue, it moved to its present site at 245 Clinton Avenue in 1918. The college's first baccalaureate degrees were conferred on fourteen graduates on June 17, 1920, and the first valedictorian was Beverly Stubbenhouser. The College was accredited in 1928 by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The Regents granted St. Joseph's College an Absolute Charter in 1929. Reverend William T. Dillon, J.D., professor of Philosophy, served as dean of the college and later its President, during the years that followed. St. Joseph's opened a laboratory preschool, the Dillon Child Study Center, in 1934 following several years of research in the field of Child Development. S. Vincent Th√©r√®se Tuohy assumed the presidency in 1956. McEntegart Hall, a multi-functional building housing the library and classrooms, opened in 1965. Sister George Aquin O'Connor was elected President and assumed responsibility on July 1, 1969. In 1970, a Charter amendment changed the name to St. Joseph's College and enabled the college to admit the first male students to full matriculation. On February 2, 1971, St. Joseph's inaugurated an extension program in the collegiate center formerly known as Brentwood College, and moved to develop a degree program in Brentwood, oriented to the third and fourth years of college. This Upper Division baccalaureate program opened in September 1972, and the Board of Regents of the State of New York authorized St. Joseph's College to join Long Island University C.W. Post Campus, in a Coordinate Campus program, the first such pattern adopted in the State. In 1976, this Suffolk County operation was authorized by the Regents to operate as a branch campus. In 1978, St. Joseph's College expanded its operation at the Suffolk Branch Campus to a full four- year program, and in 1979 moved to a 25-acre campus in Patchogue which includes a baseball field, two multi-story buildings that house classrooms, a multi-story research library, and a modern athletic facility that includes a convertible indoor sport floor, an indoor swimming pool, fully equipped weight rooms and several other offerings. Since then, the Long Island Campus has expanded to include the Clare Rose Playhouse, the Callahan Library, the John A. Danzi Athletic Center, the 33,000-square-foot Business Technology Center, and most recently, the 24.8 acre, outdoor athletic facility. The Brooklyn Campus has expanded as well with the purchase of a five-story brownstone for staff and faculty office space, the purchase of St. Angela Hall Academy for additional classrooms, and plans for further expansion over the next 10 years, including a new athletic facility. Student life = Athletics =  St. Joseph's-Long Island Golden Eagles  The Long Island Campus of St. Joseph's College has a 24.8 acre, outdoor sports facility, now home to baseball, softball, lacrosse, soccer and tennis. The Long Island Campus, known athletically as the Golden Eagles, is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III (NCAA D-III), and competes in the Skyline Conference. St. Joseph's-Long Island sponsors the following teams: baseball, men's basketball, cross country, golf, tennis, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, women's basketball, cross country, equestrian, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field, swimming and volleyball.

Only the ten largest circles are shown. In mathematics, the Hawaiian earring \\\\mathbb{H} is the topological space defined by the union of circles in the Euclidean plane \\\\R^2 with center \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{n},0\\\\right) and radius \\\\tfrac{1}{n} for n = 1, 2, 3, \\\\ldots endowed with the subspace topology: :\\\\mathbb{H}=\\\\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{(x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^2\\\\mid\\\\left(x-\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)^2+y^2=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\right)^2\\\\right\\\\\\\\} The space \\\\mathbb{H} is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of the union of a countable family of disjoint open intervals. The Hawaiian earring is a one-dimensional, compact, locally path-connected metrizable space. Although \\\\mathbb{H} is locally homeomorphic to \\\\R at all non-origin points, \\\\mathbb{H} is not semi-locally simply connected at (0,0). Therefore, \\\\mathbb{H} does not have a simply connected covering space and is usually given as the simplest example of a space with this complication. The Hawaiian earring looks very similar to the wedge sum of countably infinitely many circles; that is, the rose with infinitely many petals, but these two spaces are not homeomorphic. The difference between their topologies is seen in the fact that, in the Hawaiian earring, every open neighborhood of the point of intersection of the circles contains all but finitely many of the circles (an -ball around contains every circle whose radius is less than ); in the rose, a neighborhood of the intersection point might not fully contain any of the circles. Additionally, the rose is not compact: the complement of the distinguished point is an infinite union of open intervals; to those add a small open neighborhood of the distinguished point to get an open cover with no finite subcover.  Fundamental group  The Hawaiian earring is neither simply connected nor semilocally simply connected since, for all n\\\\geq 1, the loop \\\\ell_n parameterizing the th circle is not homotopic to a trivial loop. Thus, \\\\mathbb{H} has a nontrivial fundamental group G=\\\\pi_1(\\\\mathbb{H},(0,0)), sometimes referred to as the Hawaiian earring group. The Hawaiian earring group G is uncountable, and it is not a free group. However, G is locally free in the sense that every finitely generated subgroup of G is free. The homotopy classes of the individual loops \\\\ell_n generate the free group \\\\langle [\\\\ell_n]\\\\mid n\\\\geq 1\\\\rangle on a countably infinite number of generators, which forms a proper subgroup of G. The uncountably many other elements of G arise from loops whose image is not contained in finitely many of the Hawaiian earring's circles; in fact, some of them are surjective. For example, the path that on the interval [ 2^{-n}, 2^{-n+1} ] circumnavigates the th circle. More generally, one may form infinite products of the loops \\\\ell_n indexed over any countable linear order provided that for each n\\\\geq 1, the loop \\\\ell_n and its inverse appear within the product only finitely many times. It is a result of John Morgan and Ian Morrison that G embeds into the inverse limit \\\\varprojlim F_n of the free groups with generators, F_n, where the bonding map from F_n to F_{n-1} simply kills the last generator of F_n. However, G is a proper subgroup of the inverse limit since each loop in \\\\mathbb{H} may traverse each circle of \\\\mathbb{H} only finitely many times. An example of an element of the inverse limit that does not correspond an element of G is an infinite product of commutators \\\\prod_{n=2}^{\\\\infty}[\\\\ell_1\\\\ell_n\\\\ell_{1}^{-1}\\\\ell_{n}^{-1}], which appears formally as the sequence \\\\left(1,[\\\\ell_1][\\\\ell_2][\\\\ell_{1}]^{-1}[\\\\ell_{2}]^{-1},[\\\\ell_1][\\\\ell_2][\\\\ell_{1}]^{-1}[\\\\ell_{2}]^{-1}[\\\\ell_1][\\\\ell_3][\\\\ell_{1}]^{-1}[\\\\ell_{3}]^{-1},\\\\dots\\\\right) in the inverse limit \\\\varprojlim F_n.  First Singular Homology  Katsuya Eda and Kazuhiro Kawamura proved that the abelianisation of G, and therefore the first singular homology group H_1(\\\\mathbb{H}) is isomorphic to the group \\\\left(\\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z\\\\right)\\\\oplus\\\\left(\\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z\\\\Big/ \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\Z\\\\right). The first summand \\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z, is the direct product of infinitely many copies of the infinite cyclic group (the Baer‚ÄìSpecker group). This factor represents the singular homology classes of loops that do not have winding number 0 around every circle of \\\\mathbb{H} and is precisely the first Cech Singular homology group \\\\check{H}_1(\\\\mathbb{H}). Additionally, \\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z, may be considered as the infinite abelianization of G, since every element in the kernel of the natural homomorphism G\\\\to\\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z is represented by an infinite product of commutators. The second summand of H_1(\\\\mathbb{H}) consists of homology classes represented by loops whose winding number around every circle of \\\\mathbb{H} is zero, i.e. the kernel of the natural homomorphism H_1(\\\\mathbb{H})\\\\to\\\\prod_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathbb{Z}. The existence of the isomorphism with \\\\prod_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Z\\\\Big/ \\\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\Z is proven abstractly using infinite abelian group theory and does not have a geometric interpretation.  Higher dimensions  It is known that \\\\mathbb{H} is an aspherical space, i.e. all higher homotopy and homology groups of \\\\mathbb{H} are trivial. The Hawaiian earring can be generalized to higher dimensions. Such a generalization was used by Michael Barratt and John Milnor to provide examples of compact, finite-dimensional spaces with nontrivial singular homology groups in dimensions larger than that of the space. The k-dimensional Hawaiian earring is defined as : \\\\mathbb{H}_k=\\\\bigcup_{n\\\\in \\\\N}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{(x_0,x_1,\\\\ldots,x_k)\\\\in\\\\R^{k+1} : \\\\left(x_0-\\\\frac 1 n \\\\right)^2 + x_1^2 + \\\\cdots+x_k^2=\\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Hence, \\\\mathbb{H}_k is a countable union of -spheres which have one single point in common, and the topology is given by a metric in which the sphere's diameters converge towards zero for n\\\\to\\\\infty. Alternatively, \\\\mathbb{H}_k may be constructed as the Alexandrov compactification of a countable union of disjoint \\\\R^ks. Recursively, one has that \\\\mathbb{H}_0 consists of a convergent sequence, \\\\mathbb{H}_1 is the original Hawaiian earring, and \\\\mathbb{H}_{k+1} is homeomorphic to the reduced suspension \\\\Sigma\\\\mathbb{H}_{k}. For k\\\\geq 1, the k-dimensional Hawaiian earring is a compact, (k-1)-connected and locally (k-1)-connected. For k\\\\geq 2, it is known that \\\\pi_k(\\\\mathbb{H}_k) is isomorphic to the Baer-Specker group \\\\prod_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\mathbb{Z}. For q\\\\equiv 1\\\\bmod(k-1) and q>1, Barratt and Milnor showed that the singular homology groups H_q(\\\\mathbb{H}_k;\\\\Q) are nontrivialin fact, uncountable.

As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied. History Unfrosted cupcakes The earliest extant description of what is now often called a cupcake was in 1796, when a recipe for \\"a light cake to bake in small cups\\" was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons. The earliest extant documentation of the term cupcake itself was in \\"Seventy- five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats\\" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.Leslie, Eliza, Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats (Boston, Massachusetts: Munroe and Francis, 1828), p. 61. In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term cup cake or cupcake. In previous centuries, before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of \\"cupcake\\" is now given to any small, round cake that is about the size of a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American cupcake, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate frosting. The other kind of \\"cup cake\\" referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup, instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups; however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs.Cupcakes - Food Timeline They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method to the baker; \\"cup cake\\" uses a volume measurement, and \\"pound cake\\" uses a weight measurement. Two Original Recipes File:New York Cup Cake.jpg Recipe for a \\"New York Cup Cake\\", Eliza Leslie, 1828, p. 60\\\\. File:Ginger Cup Cake.jpg Recipe for a \\"Ginger Cup Cake\\", Eliza Leslie, 1828, p. 63\\\\. Recipes mass-produced Hostess CupCake, a typical \\"snack cake\\" style of cupcake A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour, but with these proportions : one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour and four eggs. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips. Because their small size is more efficient for heat conduction, cupcakes bake much faster than a normal layered cake. During baking, the volume of the batter initially increases due to the production of carbon dioxide, then decreases upon cooling due to the release of leavening gases. Cupcakes made for a graduation party Cupcakes may be topped with frosting or other cake decorations. They may be filled with frosting, fruit, or pastry cream. For bakers making a small number of filled cupcakes, this is usually accomplished by using a spoon or knife to scoop a small hole in the top of the cupcake. Another method is to just insert the pastry bag in the middle of the cupcake. In commercial bakeries, the filling may be injected using a syringe. Elaborately decorated cupcakes may be made for special occasions. =Variants= A mug cake A butterfly cake * A cake in a mug (more commonly known as a mug cake) is a variant that gained popularity on many Internet cooking forums and mailing lists. The technique uses a mug as its cooking vessel and can be done in a microwave oven. The recipe often takes fewer than five minutes to prepare. The cake rises by mixing vegetable oil (usually olive oil or sunflower oil) into a mixture of flour and other ingredients - as the oil in the mixture heats up, it creates air pockets in the mixture which allows the cake to quickly rise. *A cake in a jar is another way of making cupcakes. The baker uses a glass jar instead of muffin tins or cupcake liners. *A butterfly cake is a variant of cupcake, also called fairy cake for its fairy-like \\"wings\\". They can be made from any flavor of cake. The top of the fairy cake is cut off or carved out with a spoon, and cut in half. Then, butter cream, whipped cream or other sweet filling (e.g. jam) is spread into the hole. Finally, the two cut halves are stuck into the butter cream to resemble butterfly wings. The wings of the cake are often decorated using frosting to form various patterns. * Elaborately frosted cupcakes may be made for special occasions such as baby showers, graduations, or holidays.Cupcakes  How To and Instructions  Martha Stewart * A cake ball is an individual portion of cake, round like a chocolate truffle, that is coated in chocolate.\\"Cool Cakes for 2010\\" by Simone Sant-Ghuran (7 Feb 2010) at The Guardian Trinidad and Tobago These are typically formed from crumbled cake mixed with frosting, rather than being baked as a sphere. * A gourmet cupcake is a somewhat recent variant of cupcake. Gourmet cupcakes are large and filled cupcakes, based around a variety of flavor themes, such as Tiramisu or Cappuccino. In recent years there has been an upcropping of stores that sell only gourmet cupcakes in metropolitan areas. * As an alternative to a plate of individual cakes, some bakers place standard cupcakes into a pattern and frost them to create a large design, such as a basket of flowers or a turtle.See, for example, this recipe for a turtle-shaped cake made from cupcakes, or these photos. Pans and liners A cupcake pan, made of tinned steel. Originally, cupcakes were baked in heavy pottery cups. Some bakers still use individual ramekins, small coffee mugs, large tea cups, or other small ovenproof pottery- type dishes for baking cupcakes. Cupcakes are usually baked in muffin tins. These pans are most often made from metal, with or without a non-stick surface, and generally have six or twelve depressions or \\"cups\\". They may also be made from stoneware, silicone rubber, or other materials. A standard size cup is in diameter and holds about , although pans for both miniature and jumbo size cupcakes exist. Scroll down the page to section labeled \\"PANS\\". Specialty pans may offer many different sizes and shapes. Cupcakes may be plain cakes without any frosting or other decoration. These were baked on a flat baking sheet in a double layer of paper cupcake liners. Individual patty cases, or cupcake liners, may be used in baking. These are typically round sheets of thin paper pressed into a round, fluted cup shape. Liners can facilitate the easy removal of the cupcake from the tin after baking, keep the cupcake more moist, and reduce the effort needed to clean the pan. The use of liners is also considered a more sanitary option when cupcakes are being passed from hand to hand. Like cupcake pans, several sizes of paper liners are available, from miniature to jumbo. In addition to paper, cupcake liners may be made from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on their own, foil and silicone liners can also be used on a flat baking sheet, which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently for baking without a cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate the strength of a single foil cup. Liners, which are also called paper cases, come in a variety of sizes. Slightly different sizes are considered \\"standard\\" in different countries. Miniature cases are commonly in diameter at the base and tall. Standard-size cases range from in diameter at the base and are tall. Australian and Swedish bakers are accustomed to taller paper cases with a larger diameter at the top than American and British bakers.Smith, Lindy. Bake me I'm Yours... Cupcake Celebration. David & Charles: Newton Abbot; 2010. . p. 7. Shops A cupcake shop in New Orleans, Louisiana In the early 21st century, a trend for cupcake shops, which are specialized bakeries that sell little or nothing except cupcakes, developed in the United States, playing off of the sense of nostalgia evoked by the cakes. In New York City, cupcake shops like Magnolia Bakery gained publicity in their appearances on popular television shows like HBO's Sex and the City. Crumbs Bake Shop, a publicly traded business running the largest cupcake shop chain in the U.S., reached its peak stock price in 2011. Declining sales, due to competition from locally owned mom-and-pop specialty stores as well as increased competition from grocery stores, caused a sharp decline in the company's prospects and stock price in 2013. Georgetown Cupcake was the first cupcakery to open in Washington, D.C. The cupcake shop gained widespread publicity after the 2010 premier of TLC's DC Cupcakes, a six-part reality show about the shop and its owners, sisters Sophie LaMontagne and Katherine Kallinis. Based in Beverly Hills, California, Sprinkles Cupcakes is owned by Candace Nelson, who is also a star judge on the Food Network's Cupcake Wars, and her husband, Charles Nelson. Sprinkles is the first cupcake shop to debut a cupcake ATM, which could hold up to 350 cupcakes at one time. Cupcake Kits Cupcake kits are kits which provide a set of parts needed to allow an amateur baker to produce a themed batch of cupcakes, often to tie in with themed parties. Examples of themes include princess, pirate, fairies and dinosaurs. Typically kits include appropriately decorated cupcake cases and cupcake toppers but some kits are available which also include the ingredients needed for baking. Cupcake kits were introduced in 2008 or 2009 and continue to be popular items in kitchenware stores. Themes Cupcakes are sometimes used to celebrate and illustrate specific events or themes. Christmas themed cupcakes Periodic Table of Cupcakes Easter cupcake Strawberry frosted cupcakes *A periodic table of cupcakes is a collection of decorated cupcakes arranged in order to represent the elements of the periodic table. Cupcakes are sometimes flavored and colored and usually frosted with the appropriate atomic number and chemical symbol. The first person to bake and ice a set of cupcakes organized and colored to represent the elements of the periodic table was Ida Freund in 1907. Ida Freund was the first woman to hold a post as a university chemistry lecturer in the UK. She used the cupcakes as a pedagogical tool to engage and amuse her female students at Cambridge University. Based on her original idea, periodic table cupcakes have become a popular way to celebrate chemistry at school bake sales and events aiming to promote public engagement with science.

It is a relatively rare phosphate mineral. It is sometimes confused with turquoise; however, variscite is usually greener in color. The green color results from the presence of small amounts of chromium. Geology Variscite is a secondary mineral formed by direct deposition from phosphate-bearing water that has reacted with aluminium-rich rocks in a near-surface environment. It occurs as fine-grained masses in nodules, cavity fillings, and crusts. Variscite often contains white veins of the calcium aluminium phosphate mineral crandallite. It was first described in 1837 and named for the locality of Variscia, the historical name of the Vogtland, in Germany. At one time, variscite was called Utahlite. At times, materials which may be turquoise or may be variscite have been marketed as \\"variquoise\\".

It closed in 2017 with approximately 1,100 students enrolled. History The Chapel is one of the oldest buildings on campus, and is where regular religious events are held. The College was founded in 1889 by Father Joseph A. Stephan, a missionary from Germany as a secondary school to educate Native Americans. In 1962, President Eisenhower dedicated the Halleck Center (named after Republican representative Charles Halleck). From 1944 to 1974, the Chicago Bears held their training camp at Saint Joseph's College. The 1971 film Brian's Song--about Brian Piccolo, a Chicago Bears running back who died from carcinoma in the 1970s-- was filmed on campus. A charity game for Joy Piccolo, with the Bears versus college all-stars, was played on July 23, 1971. During training camp one year, Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus was reportedly seen out on a tractor in the cornfield adjacent to the campus. The College football all-star game was played at the College's football stadium, Alumni Stadium, for many years. The main academic building burned to the ground on February 3, 1973. At the time, many thought the fire would close the school, but the school recovered. After much discussion, on February 3, 2017 the school announced its closure at the end of the 2016-2017 academic year, as the school needed $100 million to continue operating: $27 million in debt, $35 million in infrastructure improvements, and $38 million to \\"re-engineer\\" the college. Outgoing president Robert Pastoor noted hopes of reopening, although his resignation was to take effect in May 2017. In May 2017, the school also announced that it was resigning its accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission. In October 2018, it was announced that St. Joseph's would reopen as a junior college in July 2019 through a partnership with fellow Roman Catholic Marian University. The college would first begin operations in Indianapolis, where Marian University is located, under the name Saint Joseph's College of Marian University-Indianapolis and could later restart operations at its Rensselaer campus. In October 2019 the announcement of the resignations of a number of key members of the administrative team and board has raised a number of questions about the future viability of the closed Rensselaer Campus, further dimming the hopes of former alumni and the local community. However, in February 2020 the college announced a plan to resume some classes and academic operations in partnership with other colleges and universities beginning in the fall of 2021.  Campus  The campus has several distinctive features. The Romanesque-style Chapel and the reflecting pond in front of the Chapel are the most recognized features of campus. Drexel Hall was one of the first buildings on campus, and is distinctive for its unique atrium. Drexel has been renovated and restored to its historical appearance. The campus also includes a private recreational lake which is an old stone quarry.  Organization and administration  The school was accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), the National League for Nursing (NLN), the Board of Commissioners of the International Assembly of Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), and the State of Indiana Professional Standards Board for the Training of Elementary Teachers. The Core building, one of the academic buildings on campus.  Academics  Saint Joseph's College was known for its Core Program under which students learned the basics of history, political science, natural science, literature and philosophy in integrated \\"core classes\\". This departs from the cafeteria-style approach to general education used by most colleges and universities in which students take discrete lower division classes in these subjects. However, credits for ‚Äúcore classes‚Äù were non-transferable to other colleges and universities. Saint Joseph's College had a student-faculty ratio of 14:1. 69% of full-time faculty at Saint Joseph's had their doctorates or terminal degree. SJC offers 75 major, minor, and pre-professional programs, along with the nationally acclaimed Core Curriculum, which provides a solid liberal arts education and a distinct career advantage. Historically, 97% of graduating seniors were employed or in graduate school within a year of graduation.  Student life  Like most other Indiana colleges, SJC held an annual \\"Little 500\\" race. Unlike the bed or bicycle races held elsewhere, Saint Joseph's College staged a go-kart race in the same manner as Purdue University's Grand Prix, albeit on a much smaller scale. The event was popular and brought alumni back to the school every year. =Athletics= Saint Joseph's College competed in NCAA Division II athletics and was a member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC). The school mascot was the Puma. It is the only post-secondary institution in the United States with the Puma as its mascot, although several have mountain lions, which is a different name for the same species. In 1956, the Saint Joseph's football team won a share of the NAIA Football National Championship, playing Montana State to a 0‚Äì0 tie in the Aluminum Bowl at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock, Arkansas. The Pumas won six Indiana Collegiate Conference titles; 1955 co-champions, 1956, 1957, 1971, 1976 co-champions and 1977 co-champions. The football team had been dominant in their conference near its final years, winning the Great Lakes Football Conference championship in 2006, 2009 and 2010. The school's baseball team was runner-up to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship in 1996, lead by pitcher Rick O'Dette, who would later be drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 1997 MLB Draft (15th Round). The same year, the women's soccer team was the runner-up in the NCAA Division II Women's Soccer Championship. The school's women's tennis team jas captured six GLVC conference titles since 1985 and completed three undefeated seasons. In 2010, the men's basketball team led by head coach Richard Davis put together a string of three wins in the NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Tournament to reach the Elite Eight for the second time in school history.

However, unlike the triangular and square numbers, the patterns involved in the construction of nonagonal numbers are not rotationally symmetrical. Specifically, the nth nonagonal number counts the number of dots in a pattern of n nested nonagons, all sharing a common corner, where the ith nonagon in the pattern has sides made of i dots spaced one unit apart from each other. The nonagonal number for n is given by the formula: :\\\\frac {n(7n - 5)}{2}. The first few nonagonal numbers are: :1, 9, 24, 46, 75, 111, 154, 204, 261, 325, 396, 474, 559, 651, 750, 856, 969, 1089, 1216, 1350, 1491, 1639, 1794, 1956, 2125, 2301, 2484, 2674, 2871, 3075, 3286, 3504, 3729, 3961, 4200, 4446, 4699, 4959, 5226, 5500, 5781, 6069, 6364, 6666, 6975, 7291, 7614, 7944, 8281, 8625, 8976, 9334, 9699.

He served in the NDP government of Howard Pawley, and narrowly lost the party's leadership to Gary Doer in 1988. A school principal and part-time farmer, Harapiak first ran for the Manitoba NDP in 1977 in the north-western riding of Swan River. He was defeated by Progressive Conservative candidate Douglas Gourlay, but nonetheless impressed many in the party's leadership. Due to a physical resemblance, he was dubbed the \\"Ukrainian Bobby Kennedy\\", and was considered as a leadership candidate in 1979 when Edward Schreyer resigned. He declined this offer. Harapiak lost to Gourlay for a second time in 1981. He finally won the Swan River riding in 1986, defeating Gourlay by 65 votes. He joined Howard Pawley's cabinet immediately after the election, being sworn in as Minister of Natural Resources on April 17, 1986. On September 21, 1987, he was moved to the Ministry of Agriculture. After Pawley's government lost a vote of confidence in 1988, Harapiak ran for the Manitoba NDP leadership and did better than expected. He believed he had a chance of winning after placing a strong second on the first ballot, but was defeated by Gary Doer on the third by 21 votes. He was defeated by Tory Parker Burrell in the general election which followed. Harapiak subsequently left politics, and worked as a director at the Winnipeg Technical Centre. His sister, Rosann Wowchuk, was appointed as a cabinet minister in Gary Doer's government in 1999. He is also the brother of agronomist John Harapiak and Harry Harapiak.

This is in contrast to using the local memories as actual main memory, as in NUMA organizations. In NUMA, each address in the global address space is typically assigned a fixed home node. When processors access some data, a copy is made in their local cache, but space remains allocated in the home node. Instead, with COMA, there is no home. An access from a remote node may cause that data to migrate. Compared to NUMA, this reduces the number of redundant copies and may allow more efficient use of the memory resources. On the other hand, it raises problems of how to find a particular data (there is no longer a home node) and what to do if a local memory fills up (migrating some data into the local memory then needs to evict some other data, which doesn't have a home to go to). Hardware memory coherence mechanisms are typically used to implement the migration. A huge body of research has explored these issues. Various forms of directories, policies for maintaining free space in the local memories, migration policies, and policies for read-only copies have been developed. Hybrid NUMA-COMA organizations have also been proposed, such as Reactive NUMA, which allows pages to start in NUMA mode and switch to COMA mode if appropriate and is implemented in the Sun Microsystems's WildFire. A software-based Hybrid NUMA- COMA implementation was proposed and implemented by ScaleMP, allowing for the creation of a shared-memory multiprocessor system out of a cluster of commodity nodes.

NFM was founded in 1937 by Belarus-born Rose Blumkin, universally known as Mrs. B., in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Under the motto \\"sell cheap and tell the truth,\\" she worked in the business until age 103. In 1983, Mrs. B. sold a majority interest to Berkshire Hathaway in a handshake deal with Warren Buffett. History Nebraska Furniture Mart was founded in 1937 by Rose Blumkin in Omaha, Nebraska. Blumkin borrowed the initial $500 investment from her brother while her husband Isadore continued to run their second hand clothing store. At one point early on, the Blumkins had to sell their own home furnishings to pay off a debt. Mrs. B set the Mart apart by selling products cheaper than the other furniture store around. The bigger competitors were able to successfully get the furniture suppliers to stop selling to the Mart because of the prices. Rather than give up and raise prices, Mrs. B went to other suppliers around the country while still underselling her competitors. In 1983, at age 89, Mrs. B sold 80% of Nebraska Furniture Mart to Warren Buffett in a one-page handshake deal. Buffett bought the company without auditing her inventory or books, instead basing the deal on his own shopping experience at the Mart and his respect for the Blumkin family. Mrs. B sold the business due to her belief that if she sold before her death, her children wouldn't fight over the company. She continued to work at the store, putting in her normal 70 hour work week, using an electric scooter to get around. Soon after the sale, Buffett would say, ‚ÄúPut her up against the top graduates of the top business schools or chief executives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an even start with the same resources, she‚Äôd run rings around them.‚Äù In 1989, at age 95, Mrs. B's family forced her into retirement. Unhappy with this and realizing that Buffett had not made her sign a non-compete agreement, Mrs. B started \\"Mrs. B‚Äôs Clearance and Factory Outlet\\" across the street from Nebraska Furniture Mart three months later. Two years later, \\"Mrs. B‚Äôs Clearance and Factory Outlet\\" was profitable and the third largest carpet outlet in Omaha. The following year, Buffett purchased the new store and merged it with the Mart. In 1994, the Mart added an electronics and appliance store. In 1998, at age 104, Mrs. B died, leaving behind the nation's largest home furnishings store. In 2000, Nebraska Furniture Mart bought Homemakers Furniture and opened the Mart's second location in Clive, Iowa. In 2003, the Mart opened its third store in Kansas City, Kansas' Village West complex. The opening of the Kansas City store was initially plagued with problems for nearly two years. The store was overwhelmed by the number of customers, which also caused deliveries to lag by more than 30 days. The problems multiplied, because the initial rush of customers never let up. Because of the initial difficulty in getting the large store up and running, NFM president Ron Blumkin initially told Warren Buffett that he never had plans to open another store. By 2011, this attitude had changed, and Nebraska Furniture Mart announced their fourth and largest location, in The Colony, Texas, which is a far north suburb of Dallas. The problems with the Kansas City location opening would lead to much more long-term planning in the eventual development and opening of the Texas location. The store, called the \\"Nebraska Furniture Mart of Texas\\", opened in 2015. Locations As of 2020, Nebraska Furniture Mart has five store locations: two in Omaha (including a factory outlet store called \\"Mrs. B's Clearance Center & Factory Outlet); as well as locations in Iowa, Kansas, and Texas.National Furniture Market Store Locator; accessed June 2, 2020 =Omaha, Nebraska= The Omaha, Nebraska store is over of retail space and is on of land. The store is located on a single collective campus on South 72nd street in West Omaha, Nebraska. The location is handicapped accessible. In 1994, the store added a massive electronics and appliance store selling computers, software, music, movies and personal electronic items as well as TVs and appliances. The campus also includes Mrs. B's Clearance Center and Factory Outlet. Both the Omaha and Kansas City locations house over 85,000 furniture items, 185,000 appliance and electronics items and over of carpet. =Clive, Iowa= In 2001, a second store was opened in Clive, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines. The business occupied this location until March 2019 when they moved into a space, formerly occupied by the defunct Dahl's Foods. Because parent company Berkshire Hathaway also owns nearby Homemakers Furniture, the new location does not stock home furnishings. It instead focuses on electronics, appliances, as well as bathroom and lawn products. =Kansas City, Kansas= The Kansas City store opened in 2003 in the Village West development on the far western edge of Kansas City, Kansas, 12 miles (18 km) west of downtown Kansas City, Missouri. The store is located across from the Kansas Speedway and Children's Mercy Park. It encompasses a total of of retail and warehouse space and is on of land. It was the first location outside of Omaha to offer the full range of products. It draws visitors all over the United States and has become a popular tourist attraction. =The Colony, Texas= On November 9, 2011, Nebraska Furniture Mart announced a plan to expand its retail operation to North Texas. Construction of the new store started in September 2012 in The Colony, which is a far northern suburb of Dallas. The new location had an unadvertised soft opening on March 4, 2015 for friends and family. After training more than 2,000 employees during the two months that followed, the grand opening and ribbon-cutting festivities took place on May 7, 2015. The Colony location is the largest of the four locations, boasting of retail space and of warehouse/distribution space. See also * Rose Blumkin Performing Arts Center References * Lowenstein, Roger.

Located in Lee County, on the Gulf of Mexico coast of southwest Florida, it is also the 118th largest island in the United States. The Intracoastal Waterway passes through Pine Island Sound, to the west of the island. Matlacha Pass runs between Pine Island and the mainland. Pine Island lies west of Cape Coral. For many years Pine Island was a major commercial fishing community and many of its full-time residents still fish commercially today.Pine Island Info Geography Unlike the sandy barrier islands of Sanibel to the south, Captiva to the southwest, and North Captiva to the west, Pine Island has no large beach and is made from the same coral rock as the mainland. Pine island is surrounded by mangroves and includes three aquatic preserves. Residents and visitors are attracted to Pine Island's natural rural character, fishing, and boating. Pine Island is mostly zoned as agricultural land; some visitors travel more than a hundred miles to purchase tropical fruit such as lychee and mangos grown and sold on Pine Island. Communities Pine Island is home to four unincorporated towns: Pine Island Center, St. James City, Bokeelia, and Pineland. Matlacha also is considered one of the communities, but is on its own small island. Pine Island has a small town atmosphere, with no traffic lights and mostly agricultural zoning. The Greater Matlacha and Pine Island community has its own fire control district with an elected 5-person commission,http://www.pineislandfire.org/, marinas, shops, and fine casual restaurants. According to the 2000 census, the population of Pine Island is about 9000, however, the population varies seasonally, Pine Island being a winter home for many of its residents. Utilities are provided by LCEC for electricity and Pine Island Water Association (a private member coop). Cable TV is provided by Comcast and/or any of the various satellite providers. Pine Island Center is located at the intersection of Pine Island and Stringfellow Roads. Pine Island Road (County Road 78) is the only road that leads to the mainland. Pine Island Center is the location of the island's single large grocery store, elementary school, library, museum, swimming pool, and a large park. Sixteen-mile-long Stringfellow Road (County Road 767) is Pine Island's main road and connects St. James City on the south end of the island with Bokeelia and Pineland on the north side of the island. St. James City, Pine Island's most heavily populated area, offers a splendid view of Sanibel Island and the Sanibel Causeway. Bokeelia extends to the far northern tip of Pine Island, ending at tiny Bokeelia Island, which is accessed by a small bridge. Bokeelia is at the mouth of Charlotte Harbor. On clear days one can see across the water to Cape Haze and Boca Grande Pass where the gulf meets the harbor. Pineland is also on the northern portion of Pine Island, west off Stringfellow Road, about halfway between Pine Island Center and Bokeelia. Pineland features a golf course and country club as well as the Randell Research Center. The Randell Research Center is located near several shell mounds, which are the remains of a Calusa Indian village that was located at the site for more than 1500 years. The center is dedicated to learning and teaching the archaeology, history, and ecology of Southwest Florida and about the culture of the Calusa people. East of Pine Island Center, along a two-mile (3 km) stretch of Pine Island Road, is Little Pine Island. Little Pine Island is a development-free wildlife preserve and the former location of a sewer treatment plant. The island community of Matlacha (pronounced \\"mat-luh-SHAY\\") is east of Little Pine Island and west of the city of Cape Coral on the mainland. The Matlacha Bridge, a small drawbridge nicknamed \\"The fishingest bridge in the world\\", almost always is occupied by fishermen. Matlacha also has a large park and pier, as well as several shops, bars, and restaurants. Cabage Key is a small island near Pine Island.The key is about 3,500ft in length. History of Cabage Key includes its previous usage as a shell midden from the native American Calusa Indian tribe. Evidence of the shell settlements are still there today. In 1862, The U.S. Federal Government Homestead Act of 1862, affirmed Charles H. Gill's ownership of the land. Cabage Key's water tower holds about 6,000 gallons and is the last standing tower in the area. Tourists typically climb this water tower for a picturesque view of the property. There are a few residents on the island, one main restaurant, and over night accommodations for guests. Ecology Pine Island is also home to Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge. Little Pine Island is a state-owned wildlife refuge, currently being restored to its natural state by the elimination of the development features that had been built on the island. Ospreys, herons, egrets, ibises, and roseate spoonbills often are seen on the island, as well as owls, hawks, bald eagles, and many songbirds.

He served in the New Democratic Party government of Premier Howard Pawley, and made an unsuccessful bid for the party's leadership in 1988. Anstett was born in Groningen in the Netherlands, and moved to Kitchener, Ontario as an infant. He received an honours political science degree from the University of Waterloo and did post-graduate studies in Canadian parliamentary procedure and election administration. He moved to Manitoba in 1973 upon his appointment as deputy clerk of the Legislative Assembly and deputy chief electoral officer for the province. He held these positions until resigning in 1979. Anstett was elected to the provincial legislature in the 1981 provincial election, as a candidate of the New Democratic Party in the rural riding of Springfield. He was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs on November 4, 1983, and also served as Government House Leader. When Howard Pawley introduced a constitutional amendment to address a court decision respecting French language rights in the 1980s, Anstett was a leading supporter of the measure. As Government House Leader, he was the minister responsible for the constitutional amendment, which was the subject of rancorous debate throughout the province. Most observers cite Anstett's leadership role in the unpopular constitutional amendment as the reason for his defeat by 55 votes by Progressive Conservative Gilles Roch in the election of 1986. When the Pawley government lost a parliamentary vote of confidence in 1988, Anstett ran to succeed Pawley as leader. He placed third on the first ballot with 317 votes (out of 1,663 valid votes cast), and was eliminated on the second ballot despite the support of fourth-place candidate Maureen Hemphill. The NDP government was defeated in the election which followed, and was reduced to third party status. Anstett contested Springfield in this election, and finished third. After his career in provincial politics ended, Anstett became chair of the Manitoba Municipal Board, and later served as chair of the Ontario Assessment Review Board until 1998. From 1998 to 2005, he was Vice President of Corporate Affairs for AEC-International in Toronto and through the International Property Tax Institute, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Lincoln Institute on Land Policy, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme, he advised governments in the developing world and in countries in transition in Eastern Europe on property assessment and tax policy. He was a property tax advisor to the government of Kyrgyzstan in 2002, and to the government of Macedonia in 2003/04. In 2005, he became director of legislation and policy support services with the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation in Ontario and subsequently served as senior policy and issues advisor in their president's office.

It was published in 2004 in Timothy Greenfield-Sanders' book XXX: 30 Porn Star Photographs (). Rushdie argues that the Muslim society in the East is considered to be closed and very shy on the issue of sex, but is currently being bombarded by the influxes of globalization which many political and religious authorities are still trying to suppress. In this context, the consumption of pornography does not only serve the purpose of sexual stimulation, but becomes an act of political rebellion. Rushdie refers to various examples from India, Pakistan and Iran to demonstrate the authorities' unsuccessful fight against the invasion of pornography in everyday life. Rushdie does not consider pornography as political in itself, though. He defines its consumption as a symptom of a social or political discomfort.

He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of insects and was inordinately fond of beetles. Education and early life Howard Hinton grew up in Mexico and attended the University of California, Berkeley as an undergraduate. He received his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1939 for research on Mexican water beetles . During WWII he worked on the problem of storage of food products to counter the depredation of moths and beetles. Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press, July 2016 Career After his PhD, Hinton worked at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1949, he moved to the University of Bristol where he spent the rest of his life. Hinton published 309 scientific papers, many of which were concerned with insect morphology and taxonomy. He founded and edited the Journal of Insect Physiology. He introduced an extra stage in the metamorphosis of insects, the pharate stage, in which the insect has produced a new exoskeleton in preparation for ecdysis but is still enclosed in the remnants of the old one. He was an early proponent of continental drift, based on the close relationship between non-migratory water beetles of the family Elmidae in rivers in New Guinea and northern Australia. He worked extensively on insect eggs, particularly the way in which they respire. He worked for many years on cryptobiosis, experimenting with a species of African fly that could withstand long periods of dehydration, positing that this might also be the key to space voyaging. In an article in New Scientist, October 1965 he suggested that contrary to the idea that life had evolved from the sea, complex molecules from the earth's atmosphere might have survived long periods of desiccation before being washed down to the sea. Gerry Kennedy, The Booles and the Hintons, Atrium Press July 2016.His graduate students include Robin Baker and Geoff Parker. His papers are at the University of Bristol, where he worked. Most of his insect collection is housed at the Natural History Museum in London. Personal life Howard Hinton married Margaret Clark, a teacher and sister of Colin Clark, in 1938 and they had four children, Charlotte who became a head teacher, James who became a Professor of History at the University of Warwick, Geoffrey who is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Toronto and Teresa who is a social policy researcher in Tasmania. Howard's father, George Hinton, was a mining engineer and botanist who managed a silver mine in Mexico and collected many new botanical specimens, some of which are in Kew gardens. Howard Hinton's nephew, also called George Hinton, has a farm in Mexico and discovered a new genus of cacti, Geohintonia, that are named after him. Howard Hinton was a great grandson of George Boole, the founder of mathematical logic. His cousins include Joan Hinton, one of the few women scientists at Los Alamos who later moved to Beijing, and William Hinton who wrote Fanshen, a book about the Chinese revolution which he observed firsthand while working for the UN in China in 1949. His grandfather, Charles Howard Hinton was a mathematician who worked on the concept of four-dimensional space and had to leave Victorian England when he was found guilty of bigamy. Awards and honours He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1961.

The initial production version was the 200-mph, seven-seat Aero Commander 520. An improved version, the 500S, manufactured after 1967, is known as the Shrike Commander. Larger variants are known by numerous model names and designations, ranging up to the 330-mph, 11-seat Model 695B/Jetprop 1000B turboprop. Design and development Updated Aero Commander Panel The idea for the Commander light business twin was conceived by Ted Smith, a project engineer at the Douglas Aircraft Company. Working part-time after hours throughout 1944, a group of A-20 engineers formed the Aero Design and Engineering Company to design and build the proposed aircraft with a layout similar to their A-20 bomber. Originally, the new company was going to build three pre-production aircraft, but as the first aircraft was being built, they decided to build just one prototype. The final configuration was completed in July 1946 and was designated the Model L3805. Registered NX1946, the prototype first flew on 23 April 1948. The L3805 accommodated up to five people and was powered by two Lycoming O-435-A piston engines., it was an all-metal high-wing monoplane with retractable undercarriage using components from a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. The market segment planned for this aircraft to be sold to small feeder airliner firms and was originally designed to carry seven passengers, but instead found use in the private business aircraft and military market. Walter Beech test flew the aircraft in 1949 and expressed interest in buying the project, but passed on it, to instead develop the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza. Fairchild Aircraft also evaluated the prototype at its Hagerstown, Maryland, headquarters. The prototype flew successfully and the company leased, at no cost, a new 26,000 square-foot factory at Bethany near Oklahoma City to build a production version, certified on 30 June 1950. Nearly 10,000 hours of redesign work went into the model, including more powerful Lycoming GO-435-C2 engines, with a combined rating of 520 horsepower. The production model was named the Commander 520. The first Commander 520 was rolled out of the new factory in August 1951. Serial number 1 was used as a demonstrator, then sold in October 1952 to the Asahi Shimbun Press Company of Tokyo. Operational history In military service, it was initially designated the L-26, though in 1962 this was changed to U-4 for the United States Air Force and U-9 for the United States Army. Bob Hoover's Shrike Commander on display Under ownership of Rockwell in the 1960s, World War II pilot R. A. \\"Bob\\" Hoover demonstrated the Shrike Commander 500S for decades in a variety of \\"managed energy\\" routines, including single-engine and engine-out aerobatics. His Shrike Commander is displayed in the colors of his last sponsor, Evergreen International Aviation, at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. Bob Odegaard continued the tradition in 2012, flying a 1975 Shrike 500S in a Bob Hoover tribute routine. One U-4B became a presidential transport aircraft for Dwight D. Eisenhower between 1956 and 1960. This was the smallest \\"Air Force One,\\" and the first to wear the now-familiar blue-and-white livery. As of 2004, Shrike Commanders remained in service with the United States Coast Guard and United States Customs Service. A single 560F was operated by the Belgian Air Force as the personal transport of the late king Boudewijn from 1961 to 1973. The unpressurized, long-fuselage 680FL was operated as a small package freighter by Combs Freightair in the 1970s and 1980s, and by Suburban Air Freight in the 1980s and 1990s. The aircraft was popular with pilots, because it was extremely \\"pilot friendly\\" and with its 380 hp supercharged engines did well in icing meteorological conditions. A number are still operated on contracts for cargo and fire control applications, as their piston engines offer good fuel specifics at low altitudes and longer loiter times. =Safety concerns= Single-engine safety =Single-engine flight to Washington= In 1950, when the developers were working to satisfy Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) regulations for certification of the 500, they chose a novel method of demonstrating its single-engine safety and performance: they removed one of the two-bladed propellers, secured it in the aft cabin, and flew from Bethany to Washington, D.C. on one engine. There they met with CAA personnel, then replaced the propeller and returned to Oklahoma in the conventional manner. The flight received nationwide coverage in the press.Smith, T. M., \\"Multiengine Airplane Rating\\", 2nd Ed., Zweng / Pan American Navigation Service, North Hollywood, California, 1968. However, the stunt had been performed with the propeller stowed inside the aircraft, rather than dragging in the open on the front of the engine (as would happen in an actual engine failure). Consequently, the famous demonstration did not demonstrate an actual failed-engine scenario (in which the propeller normally creates substantial drag, and adds to single-engine control and performance problems).\\"Checkout in a Multiengine Airplane\\", excerpted from Flight Training Handbook, Advisory Circular 61-21A, Federal Aviation Administration, at website of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, retrieved 17 May 2017 =NTSB Single-engine safety study= In 1979, the National Transportation Safety Board reviewed light-twin engine-failure accidents, involving the 24 most popular model-groups of light twins between 1972 and 1976. They found that the piston-engined twin-Commanders had averaged slightly over 3.4 engine- failure accidents per hundred-thousand hours, the second worst number of all aircraft under review.Special Study: \\"Light Twin-Engine Aircraft Accidents Following Engine Failures, 1972‚Äì1976,\\" NTSB-AAS-79-2, 1979, National Transportation Safety Board, Washington, D.C., as retrieved from ERAU Library, 16 May 2017Ibold, Ken, ed., Aviation Consumer's Used Aircraft Guide, 9th Edition, vol. 2, 2001, Belvoir Publications, Greenwich, Connecticut The most engine failures were suffered by the small-engine versions of the Piper Apache, at 6.9 failures per hundred thousand hours; the third-worst, the Beechcraft Travel Air, averaged 2.9 failures; the average for all models was only 1.6. =Hoover single-engine airshow routine= Countering the statistical evidence, Rockwell demonstration pilot Bob Hoover's famous airshow stunt routine, with the Shrike Commander, included a full aerobatic routine performed first with both engines, then with one engine out (and the critical engine, at that), then both engines out, and gliding. Then in his final airshow performance, in a supreme demonstration of conservation of momentum, he did all that, then landed the Shrike Commander dead stick (engines off), coasted the airplane down the runway then from the runway down the taxiway and silently let the craft roll slowly to a full stop right in front of the crowd.Cochrane, Dorothy, \\"Robert A_ \\"Bob\\" Hoover, The Greatest Stick and Rudder Man, is Honored in Hollywood National Air and Space Museum.htm\\", 20 February 2014, Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C., retrieved 16 May 2017 =Turboprop Commanders' single-engine safety= The turboprop twin-Commanders‚Äîwith much more powerful engines (and most with longer bodies, allowing greater rudder leverage, critical for single-engine control) ‚Äì came out on the opposite end of the rankings, with one of the lowest rates of engine-failure accidents of all \\"light\\" twins examined, at only 0.4 per hundred-thousand hours. Wing spar fatigue Beginning in June 1991, senior engineers met with FAA officials to discuss concerns over the Aero Commander's main wing spar, which was believed to be susceptible to stress fatigue and subsequent cracking, and was believed to have resulted in a number of fatal crashes. From approximately 1961 to 1993, 24 aircraft crashed when spar failures caused the loss of the wing in flight. Thirty-five more spars were found cracked during inspections. =Notable accidents= * On 19 June 1964, Senator Ted Kennedy was a passenger in an Aero Commander 680 airplane flying in bad weather from Washington, D.C., to Massachusetts. It crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport near Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss, one of Kennedy's aides, were killed. Kennedy suffered a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. * World War II hero and actor Audie Murphy died in an Aero Commander 680 crash while flying as a passenger on 28 May 1971.

It features two agents involved in stereotypical and comical espionage activities. One is dressed in white, and the other in black, but they are otherwise identical, and are particularly known for their long, beaklike heads and their white pupils and black sclera. The pair are always at war with each other, using a variety of booby-traps to inflict harm on the other. The spies usually alternate between victory and defeat with each new strip. A parody of the political ideologies of the Cold War, the strip was created by Cuban expatriate cartoonist Antonio Proh√≠as, and debuted in Mad #60, dated January 1961. Spy vs. Spy is currently written and drawn by Peter Kuper. The Spy vs. Spy characters have been featured in such media as video games and an animated television series, and in such merchandise as action figures and trading cards. Publication history Proh√≠as was a prolific cartoonist in Cuba known for political satire. He fled to the United States on May 1, 1960, three days before Fidel Castro's government nationalized the last of the Cuban free press. Proh√≠as sought work in his profession and travelled to the offices of Mad magazine in New York City on July 12, 1960. After a successful showing of his work and a prototype cartoon for Spy vs. Spy, Proh√≠as was hired.\\"Spy vs. Spy: The Complete Casebook\\", Proh√≠as, A. (Watson-Guptill, 2001). Proh√≠as cryptically signed each strip on its first panel with a sequence of Morse code characters that spell \\"BY PROHIAS\\". In a 1983 interview with the Miami Herald, Proh√≠as reflected on the success of Spy vs. Spy, stating, \\"The sweetest revenge has been to turn Fidel's accusation of me as a spy into a moneymaking venture.\\" Proh√≠as, however, was censored by Mad magazine publisher William Gaines on at least one occasion: the strip that eventually appeared in Mad magazine #84 (Jan. 1964) was altered to remove scenes where the spies drink and smoke (Gaines had a strong anti-smoking stance). Proh√≠as completed a total of 241 Spy vs. Spy strips for Mad magazine, the last one appearing in #269 (March 1987). After that he drew gag strips for the titles (such as one involving radioactive waste in #287) and wrote several stories for Clarke or Manak to draw, with his last such contribution in #337 (July 1995).Mad Magazine Contributors-Antonio Prohias The strips continued, with writer Duck Edwing and artist Bob Clarke creating the majority. Their strips are identifiable by Clarke's drawing style, but signed \\" 'C/e\\", or \\" 'C/p\\" in the Proh√≠as-written cases. Some were largely uncredited, simply being signed \\"M&S;\\" (MAD 335) or \\"M&e;\\" (MAD 352). Peter Kuper took over as writer and artist for the strip with Mad magazine #356 (April 1997). It was later drawn in full color when the magazine changed from a black and white to full color format. Characters Cosplay, Comikaze Expo 2011 Black Spy and White Spy (or \\"Man in Black\\" and \\"Man in White\\") ‚Äî Wearing wide-brimmed hats and dressed in overcoats, both Spies have long pointed faces. They are identical except for one being entirely in white and one entirely in black. The Spies were modeled after El Hombre Siniestro (\\"The Sinister Man\\"), a character Proh√≠as created in the Cuban magazine Bohemia in 1956. Like the Spies, he wore a wide- brimmed hat and overcoat and had a long pointed nose. Proh√≠as described the character as someone who \\"thought nothing of chopping the tails off of dogs, or even the legs off of little girls\\" and stated he was \\"born out of the national psychosis of the Cuban people.\\" 'El Hombre Siniestro bears strong resemblance to the Spies‚Äîalthough, instead of fighting against a set rival, he simply does horrible things to anyone he can find. The cover copy of The All New Mad Secret File on Spy vs. Spy provides early insight to the characters and Proh√≠as' views on the Castro regime and the CIA: Grey Spy (or \\"Woman in Grey\\") ‚Äî She debuted in Mad magazine #73 (Sept. 1962) (the strip was temporarily renamed Spy vs. Spy vs. Spy). Grey Spy's appearances were sporadic, but she always triumphed by using the infatuations of Black Spy and White Spy to her advantage. Proh√≠as explained, \\"the lady Spy represented neutrality. She would decide for White Spy or Black Spy, and she also added some balance and variety to the basic 'Spy vs. Spy' formula.\\" Grey Spy's last appearance under Proh√≠as was Mad Magazine #99 (Dec. 1965); she did not appear again until Bob Clarke and Duck Edwing took over the strip. Leaders ‚Äî They are the barrel-chested, medal-decorated bosses of Black Spy and White Spy, who give them tasks and punish them for their failures. The Leaders were phased out when Peter Kuper took over writing and illustrating the strip. Spin- offs * A Sunday strip series (39 in total) was released weekly from April 7 to Dec 29, 2002; 2014 in the MAD news, syndicated by Tribune Media Services and featuring Duck Edwing and Dave Manak returning as writer and artist respectively. * A series of thirteen strips titled Spy vs. Spy Jr. was published in Mad Kids magazine from 2006‚Äì2009.

In the series' final episodes, the two characters and background of the skit were drawn in three dimensions instead of the classic comic book style. It served as their two previous decade cartoons. Both spies claimed victory 51 times, and one of their feuds resulted in a draw.

History The \`du\` utility first appeared in version 1 of AT&T; UNIX. The version of \`du\` bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund, David MacKenzie, Paul Eggert, and Jim Meyering. Specification By default, the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) specifies that \`du\` is to display the file space allocated to each file and directory contained in the current directory. Links will be displayed as the size of the link file, not what is being linked to; the size of the content of directories is displayed, as expected. As \`du\` reports allocation space and not absolute file space, the amount of space on a file system shown by \`du\` may vary from that shown by \`df\` if files have been deleted but their blocks not yet freed. Also the minfree setting that allocates datablocks for the filesystem and the super user processes creates a discrepancy between total blocks and the sum of used and available blocks. The minfree setting is usually set to about 5% of the total filesystem size. For more info see core utils faq. Usage \`du\` takes a single argument, specifying a pathname for to work; if it is not specified, the current directory is used. The SUS mandates for the following options: : , In addition to the default output, include information for each non-directory entry : , display a grand total of the disk usage found by the other arguments : , the depth at which summing should occur. -d 0 sums at the current level, -d 1 sums at the subdirectory, -d 2 at sub-subdirectories, etc. : , calculate disk usage for link references specified on the command line : , show sizes as multiples of 1024 bytes, not 512-byte : , calculate disk usage for link references anywhere : , report only the sum of the usage in the current directory, not for each directory therein contained : , only traverse files and directories on the device on which the pathname argument is specified. Other Unix and Unix-like operating systems may add extra options. For example, BSD and GNU \`du\` specify a option, displaying disk usage in a format easier to read by the user, adding units with the appropriate SI prefix (e.g. 10 MB). Examples Sum of directories (-s) in kilobytes (-k): $ du -sk * 152304 directoryOne 1856548 directoryTwo Sum of directories (-s) in human-readable format (-h : Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte): $ du -sh * 149M directoryOne 1.8G directoryTwo disk usage of all subdirectories and files including hidden files within the current directory (sorted by filesize) : $ du -sk .[!.]* * sort -n disk usage of all subdirectories and files including hidden files within the current directory (sorted by reverse filesize) : $ du -sk .[!.]* * sort -nr The weight (size) of each subdirectory under the current directory (-d 1) with a sum total at the end (-c) all displayed in human-readable format (-h): $ du -d 1 -c -h or with du from GNU: $ du --max-depth=1 -c -h The weight (size) of subdirectories under the root directory (-d 1, trailing /) with a sum total at the end (-c), all displayed in human-readable format (-h) without traversing into other filesystems (-x).

It is called \\"phakic\\" (meaning \\"having a lens\\") because the eye's natural lens is left untouched. Intraocular lenses that are implanted into eyes after the eye's natural lens has been removed during cataract surgery are known as pseudophakic. Phakic intraocular lenses are indicated for patients with high refractive errors when the usual laser options for surgical correction (LASIK and PRK) are contraindicated. Phakic IOLs are designed to correct high myopia ranging from ‚àí5 to ‚àí20 D if the patient has enough anterior chamber depth (ACD) of at least 3 mm. Three types of phakic IOLs are available: * Angle- supported * Iris-fixated * Sulcus-supported intraocular lens Medical uses An installed PIOL, with flash photography An installed PIOL, without flash photography LASIK can correct myopia up to -12 to -14 D. The higher the intended correction the thinner and flatter the cornea will be post- operatively. For LASIK surgery, one has to preserve a safe residual stromal bed of at least 250 ¬µm, preferably 300 ¬µm. Beyond these limits there is an increased risk of developing corneal ectasia (i.e. corneal forward bulging) due to thin residual stromal bed which results in loss of visual quality. Due to the risk of higher order aberrations there is a current trend toward reducing the upper limits of LASIK and PRK to around -8 to -10 D. Phakic intraocular lenses are safer than excimer laser surgery for those with significant myopia. Phakic intraocular lenses are contraindicated in patients who do not have a stable refraction for at least 6 months or are 21 years of age or younger. Preexisting eye disorders such as uveitis are another contraindication. Although PIOLs for hyperopia are being investigated, there is less enthusiasm for these lenses because the anterior chamber tends to be shallower than in myopic patients. A hyperopic model ICL (posterior chamber PIOL) is available. Corneal endothelial cell count less than 2000-2500 cells/mm¬≤ is a relative contraindication for PIOL implantation. = Advantages = PIOLs have the advantage of treating a much larger range of myopic and hyperopic refractive errors than can be safely and effectively treated with corneal refractive surgery. The skills required for insertion are, with a few exceptions, similar to those used in cataract surgery. The equipment is significantly less expensive than an excimer laser and is similar to that used for cataract surgery. In addition, the PIOL is removable; therefore, the refractive effect should theoretically be reversible. However, any intervening damage caused by the PIOL would most likely be permanent. When compared with clear lens extraction, or refractive lens exchange the PIOL has the advantage of preserving natural accommodation and may have a lower risk of postoperative retinal detachment because of the preservation of the crystalline lens and minimal vitreous destabilization. =Disadvantages= PIOL insertion is an intraocular procedure. With all surgeries there are associated risks. In addition, each PIOL style has its own set of associated risks. In the case of PIOLs made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), surgical insertion requires a larger incision, which may result in postoperative astigmatism. By comparison, PIOLS made of collamer (a foldable gel-like substance) requires a very small incision due to the flexibility of the material and thus significantly reduces astigmatism risk. In the cases where refractive outcomes are not optimal, LASIK can be used for fine-tuning. If a patient eventually develops a visually significant cataract, the PIOL will have to be explanted at the time of cataract surgery, possibly through a larger-than-usual incision. Another concern is progressive shallowing of the anterior chamber which normally occurs with advancing age due to the growth of the eye's natural lens. Multiple studies have shown a 12-17 ¬µm/year decrease in the anterior chamber depth with aging. If a phakic IOL patient is assumed to have a 50-year lifespan, the overall decline in ACD may add up to 0.6-0.85 mm, long-term data about this effect are not available. This concern is more important in ICL because it is implanted in the narrowest part of the anterior segment. Complications * Glare and halos which may cause night time symptoms especially in patients with larger pupil diameters. * Cataract which is the most crucial concern for the Sulcus-Supported PIOLs. According to FDA approximately 6% to 7% of eyes develop anterior subcapsular opacities at 7+ years following Implantable Collamer Lens implantation and 1% to 2% progress to clinically significant cataract during the same period, especially very high myopes and older patients. * Endothelial cell loss especially for the anterior chamber PIOLs. A study observed a continual steady loss of endothelial cells of -1.8% per year. * Pigment dispersion may be seen in iris- fixated and sulcus-supported PIOLs due to iris abrasion during pupillary movement. * Other complications include glaucoma and PIOL dislocation or decentration. Preoperative evaluation Anterior chamber depth (ACD, i.e. the distance between the crystalline lens and cornea including the corneal thickness) is required before the surgery and measured with the use of ultrasound. Iris-fixated IOLs are fixated to iris therefore they have the advantage of being one size (8.5 mm). Sulcus-supported IOLs need to be implanted in the ciliary sulcus which may have various diameters among individuals, therefore anterior chamber diameter needs to be measured with a calliper or with the use of eye imaging instruments such as Orbscan and high frequency ultrasound. A calliper and Orbscan measure the external limbus-to- limbus diameter of anterior chamber (white-to-white diameter) which provides an approximate estimation of AC diameter but UBM and OCT offer a more adequate measurement of the sulcus diameter (sulcus-to-sulcus diameter) and should be used when available. Power calculation The power of phakic lens is independent of the axial length of the eye. Rather it depends on central corneal power, anterior chamber depth (ACD) and patient refraction (preoperative spherical equivalent). The most common formula for calculating the power of phakic IOL is the following: P= {1000 n \\\\over{1000 n \\\\over K+R}-d}-{1000 n \\\\over{1000 n \\\\over K}-d} P : Power of phakic IOL n : Refractive Index of Aqueous (1.336) K : Central corneal power in diopters R : Patient Refraction at the corneal vertex d : Effective lens position in mm The effective lens position is calculated as the difference between the anterior chamber depth and the distance between the PIOL and the crystalline lens. From ultrasonographic examinations of PIOLs, the lens-optic distance shows less variability compared with the cornea-optic distance. Therefore, it is preferable to use measured ACD and subtract it with an ‚Äòoptic-lens‚Äô constant to obtain the value of ELP. For the Artisan/Verisyse lens the optic-lens constant is 0.84 mm. The ICL power is calculated using the Olsen-Feingold formula by using a four variable formula modified by a regression analysis of past results. Surgical technique The Artisan (Verisyse) lens is implanted under pharmacological miosis. After creating proper incision the lens is grasped with curved holding forceps and inserted. Once in the anterior chamber and while firmly holding the lens with forceps, temporal and nasal iris tissue is enclavated with a special needle. The operation is completed with an iridectomy and the incision is sutured. The ICL is implanted under pharmacological mydriasis and implanted in the retropupillay position, between the eye's iris and the crystalline lens, using cartridge-injector or forceps. Both eyes can usually be done on the same day. Steroid antibiotic eye drops are usually prescribed for 2‚Äì4 weeks after surgery. Regular follow-ups are recommended.

It has a population of 18,083 (2004) and covers an area of 77.37 km¬≤, of which 51% are used for agricultural purposes and 35% are forest. It is located in the hills of the Sauerland; at its highest elevation it is 440 m above sea level. History Around 950 the Oberhof Halvara was first mentioned in the Werdener Probsteiregister. For more than 500 years Halver was the seat of a Fehmic court, the earliest definite evidence of which is in 1243; it ceased to exist in 1753. This court was most famous because of the trial of duke Henry XVI the Rich of Bavaria-Landshut and the knight of Toerring on May 2, 1430. With effect from October 1, 1912 the municipality Halver was split, Schalksm√ºhle becoming an independent municipality. Both were administered together in the Amt Halver. As part of the communal reforms of the district of Altena the Amt was dissolved on January 1, 1969, and Halver was granted city rights. Nicolai church Kerspetalsperre (Dam) Station Coat of arms The red and white checked base refers to the fess from the arms of the Counts of the Mark. The stone judgement table under a linden tree represents the Feme court. It was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on March 29, 1935. The Amt Halver had a separate coat of arms, which was also designed by Otto Hupp. It combined elements from the two member municipalities Halver and Schalksm√ºhle: in the upper part is a linden branch symbolizing Halver, in the bottom the upper half of a black mill wheel as the symbol of Schalksm√ºhle. Separating the two is the red and white checked fess, as above. The coat of arms was granted on June 8, 1936, and expired with the dissolving of the Amt in 1969. Districts Additionally to the core city, there are the following districts, many of them are very small.

First elements of the division saw action on D-Day, 6 June, on Utah Beach, Normandy, the remainder entering combat 10 June, cutting across the Merderet River to take Pont l'Abbe in heavy fighting. After defensive action along the river Douve, the division attacked to clear the Foret de Mont-Castre (Hill 122), clearing it by 11 July, in spite of fierce resistance. In this action the Division suffered 5000 killed, wounded, or captured, one of the highest casualty rates suffered in WW II. An attack on the island of Saint-Germain-sur-S√®ves on 23 July failed so the 90th bypassed it and took P√©riers on 27 July. On 12 August, the division drove across the Sarthe River, north and east of Le Mans, and took part in the closing of the Falaise Gap, by reaching 1st Polish Armored Division in Chambois, 19 August. It then raced across France, through Verdun, 6 September, to participate in the siege of Metz, 14 September-19 November, capturing Maizi√®res-l√®s-Metz, 30 October, and crossing the Moselle River at K≈ìnigsmacker, 9 November. Elements of the 90th Infantry assaulted and captured the German-held Fort de Koenigsmacker 9‚Äì12 November. On 6 December 1944, the division pushed across the Saar River and established a bridgehead north of Saarlautern (present-day Saarlouis), 6‚Äì18 December, but with the outbreak of Gerd von Rundstedt's (Army Group A) drive, the Battle of the Bulge, withdrew to the west bank on 19 December, and went on the defensive until 5 January 1945, when it shifted to the scene of the Ardennes struggle, having been relieved along the Saar River by the 94th Infantry Division. It drove across the Our River, near Oberhausen, 29 January, to establish and expand a bridgehead. On 19 February, the division smashed through Siegfried Line fortifications to the Pr√ºm River. After a short rest, the 90th continued across the Moselle River to take Mainz, 22 March, and crossed the rivers Rhine, the Main, and the Werra in rapid succession. Pursuit continued to the Czech border, 18 April 1945, and into the Sudetes mountain range. The division was en route to Prague when they came upon the remaining 1500 emaciated prisoners left behind by the SS at Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp. Today, a memorial wall at the former camp honors the 90th as the liberators of Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp.Memorial Plaque honoring the 90th Infantry Division's liberation of Flossenburg A week later, word came that the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945. On that same day, Erich Hartmann, the highest- scoring fighter ace in history, along with a squadron of the elite Jagdgeschwader 52 fighter wing (the highest-scoring fighter wing in history), surrendered to the 90th. =Casualties= 16 Tough 'Ombres killed in action during the Battle of the Bulge in Sonlez. *Total battle casualties: 19,200Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 3,342 *Wounded in action: 14,386 *Missing in action: 287 *Prisoner of war: 1,185 =Assignments in ETO= *5 March 1944: Third Army. *23 March 1944: Third Army, but attached to First Army. *27 March 1944: VII Corps. *19 June 1944: VIII Corps. *30 July 1944: Third Army, but attached to First Army. *1 August 1944: XV Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group. *17 August 1944: Third Army, 12th Army Group, but attached to V Corps, First Army. *25 August 1944: XV Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group. *26 August 1944: XX Corps *6 January 1945: III Corps. *26 January 1945: VIII Corps. *12 March 1945: XII Corps.

The degradation of fibrin is termed fibrinolysis. In humans, the plasmin protein is encoded by the PLG gene.  Function  Fibrinolysis (simplified). Blue arrows denote stimulation, and red arrows inhibition. Plasmin is a serine protease that acts to dissolve fibrin blood clots. Apart from fibrinolysis, plasmin proteolyses proteins in various other systems: It activates collagenases, some mediators of the complement system, and weakens the wall of the Graafian follicle, leading to ovulation. Plasmin is also integrally involved in inflammation. It cleaves fibrin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor. Plasmin, like trypsin, belongs to the family of serine proteases. Plasmin is released as a zymogen called plasminogen (PLG) from the liver into the systemic circulation. Two major glycoforms of plasminogen are present in humans - type I plasminogen contains two glycosylation moieties (N-linked to N289 and O-linked to T346), whereas type II plasminogen contains only a single O-linked sugar (O-linked to T346). Type II plasminogen is preferentially recruited to the cell surface over the type I glycoform. Conversely, type I plasminogen appears more readily recruited to blood clots. In circulation, plasminogen adopts a closed, activation-resistant conformation. Upon binding to clots, or to the cell surface, plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active plasmin by a variety of enzymes, including tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), kallikrein, and factor XII (Hageman factor). Fibrin is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by tissue plasminogen activator. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a cofactor for plasminogen activation by urokinase plasminogen activator. The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin involves the cleavage of the peptide bond between Arg-561 and Val-562. Plasmin cleavage produces angiostatin.  Mechanism of plasminogen activation  Full length plasminogen comprises seven domains. In addition to a C-terminal chymotrypsin-like serine protease domain, plasminogen contains an N-terminal Pan Apple domain (PAp) together with five Kringle domains (KR1-5). The Pan-Apple domain contains important determinants for maintaining plasminogen in the closed form, and the kringle domains are responsible for binding to lysine residues present in receptors and substrates. The X-ray crystal structure of closed plasminogen reveals that the PAp and SP domains maintain the closed conformation through interactions made throughout the kringle array . Chloride ions further bridge the PAp / KR4 and SP / KR2 interfaces, explaining the physiological role of serum chloride in stabilizing the closed conformer. The structural studies also reveal that differences in glycosylation alter the position of KR3. These data help explain the functional differences between the type I and type II plasminogen glycoforms. In closed plasminogen, access to the activation bond (R561/V562) targeted for cleavage by tPA and uPA is blocked through the position of the KR3/KR4 linker sequence and the O-linked sugar on T346. The position of KR3 may also hinder access to the activation loop. The Inter-domain interactions also block all kringle ligand-binding sites apart from that of KR-1, suggesting that the latter domain governs pro-enzyme recruitment to targets. Analysis of an intermediate plasminogen structure suggests that plasminogen conformational change to the open form is initiated through KR-5 transiently peeling away from the PAp domain. These movements expose the KR5 lysine- binding site to potential binding partners, and suggest a requirement for spatially distinct lysine residues in eliciting plasminogen recruitment and conformational change respectively.  Mechanism of plasmin inactivation  Plasmin is inactivated by proteins such as Œ±2-macroglobulin and Œ±2-antiplasmin. The mechanism of plasmin inactivation involves the cleavage of an Œ±2-macroglobulin at the bait region (a segment of the aM that is particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage) by plasmin. This initiates a conformational change such that the Œ±2-macroglobulin collapses about the plasmin. In the resulting Œ±2-macroglobulin-plasmin complex, the active site of plasmin is sterically shielded, thus substantially decreasing the plasmin's access to protein substrates. Two additional events occur as a consequence of bait region cleavage, namely (i) a h-cysteinyl-g-glutamyl thiol ester of the Œ±2-macroglobulin becomes highly reactive and (ii) a major conformational change exposes a conserved COOH-terminal receptor binding domain. The exposure of this receptor binding domain allows the Œ±2-macroglobulin protease complex to bind to clearance receptors and be removed from circulation.  Pathology  Plasmin deficiency may lead to thrombosis, as the clots are not adequately degraded. Plasminogen deficiency in mice leads to defective liver repair, defective wound healing, reproductive abnormalities. In humans, a rare disorder called plasminogen deficiency type I () is caused by mutations of the PLG gene and is often manifested by ligneous conjunctivitis.  Interactions  Plasmin has been shown to interact with Thrombospondin 1, Alpha 2-antiplasmin and IGFBP3. Moreover, plasmin induces the generation of bradykinin in mice and humans through high-molecular-weight kininogen cleavage.

In October 2007 he made headlines when he used a helicopter to escape from prison. Finally, on August 21, 2020, at night, he was arrested in Ceuta by the National Police of Spain after kidnapping a man along with other two known hitmen in an intervention in which the police were shot. Now he is in prison and is accused of the crimes of illegal detention, attack on an agent of authority, injuries and criminal organization. Escape attempts Allal has escaped four times, in October 2000, in December 2000, in August 2004 and in October 2007. =Third attempt 2004= His third escape from prison took place from 8 August to 13 August 2004. During his escape, he was spotted by two police officers from the Police Zone Midi (which covers Anderlecht, Saint-Gilles and Vorst). The policemen followed him into the neighbouring municipality of Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, where Ben Allal opened fire on them, injuring the two officers. He was the most wanted fugitive in Belgium during that week and was finally captured by special police teams while hiding in the trunk of a car. Ben Allal is considered to be one of the most dangerous criminals in Belgium. In November 2005 he was sentenced to an extra 12 years in prison for the shooting. =Fourth attempt 2007= His latest escape occurred on 28 October 2007 when he escaped again from the high security prison in Ittre, Belgium. A hijacked helicopter landed during the evening walk and several prisoners ran towards it to get a ride out of prison. The helicopter took off but crashed, and one prisoner was injured. During the distraction, Ben Allal and an accomplice were able to get away in guard uniforms and joined their awaiting helpers who had a car waiting for them, which was found abandoned a few hours later.

Tolomei founded the Congregation of the Blessed Virgin of Monte Oliveto (the Olivetans), giving it the Rule of St. Benedict. The purpose of the new religious institute was a special devotion to the Blessed Virgin. Bishop Guido Tarlati of Arezzo, within whose diocese the congregation was formed, confirmed its constitution in (1319), and many favours were granted by Popes John XXII, Clement VI (1344), and Gregory XI.

During the Plague of 1348 Bernardo left the solitude of Monte Oliveto for the monastery of San Benedetto a Porta Tufi in Siena. The disease was particularly virulent in the city. Bernardo and his monks devoted themselves to the care of the sick. On 20 August 1348, while helping his plague-stricken monks, he himself, fell victim of the Plague. Eighty-two monks likewise succumbed to the plague. His last days were depicted in a painting by the 18th-century Italian painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi.

The division was organized in October 1917, after the U.S. entry into World War I, at Camp Funston, Kansas, with African American soldiers from all states. In 1918, before leaving for France, the American buffalo was selected as the divisional insignia due to the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" nickname, given to African American cavalrymen in the 19th century. The \\"Buffalo Soldiers Division\\" divisional nickname was inherited from the 366th Infantry, one of the first units of the division organized. The 92nd Infantry Division was the only African American infantry division to see combat in Europe during World War II, as part of the U.S. Fifth Army, fighting in the Italian Campaign. The division served in the Italian Campaign from 1944 to the war's end. History The 92nd Division was first constituted on paper 24 October 1917 in the National Army, over six months after the U.S. entry into World War I.Wilson, p. 545. The division was commanded throughout most of its existence by Major General Charles C. Ballou and was composed of the 183rd Infantry Brigade with the 365th and 366th Infantry Regiments, and the 184th Infantry Brigade with the 367th and 368th Infantry Regiments, together with supporting artillery, engineer, medical and signal units attached.McGrath, p. 173 ‚Äì 174. The division was organized on 27 October 1917 at Camp Funston, Kansas, the men first being trained at the regimental level. For this division, 104 black captains, 397 first lieutenants, and 125 second lieutenants were trained at a \\"negro officers' camp\\" in Des Moines, Iowa.\\"To Camp Funston,\\" The Junction City (Kansas) Union, October 10, 1917, page 1 A special \\"negro zone\\" was to be built at the east end of Camp Funston, with \\"separate amusement places and exchanges.\\" A.D.

As was the case with the 93rd Division, parts of the 92nd served under and alongside the French Army after both the main American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) refused to have African- American soldiers serve in combat under them. The 92nd was a National Army unit formed from black draftees, with a cadre of 154 NCOs transferred from the four Regular Army regiments, mostly led by inexperienced black junior officers fresh out of training and commanded by white officers. They were a green and untried unit that was not allowed to maneuver as a division before they were committed to the line. After arrival on the Western Front, the 92nd, like all AEF units, trained for deployment in the trenches. They began to be fed into the French sector front lines by company in mid-August 1918. The 92nd Artillery Brigade came on line only in October 1918. The 92nd Division saw combat in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive during November 1918.

The soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division enter the city of Montignoso (MS), Italy after having freed it from German troops, 8 April 1945. The division was reactivated as an infantry division with the \\"colored\\" designation, under the command of Major General Edward Almond, on 15 October 1942, ten months after the American entry into World War II, at Fort Huachuca, Arizona and spent almost two years training in the United States. In late July 1944, the 370th Infantry Regiment was sent overseas to Italy and temporarily attached to the 1st Armored Division. The rest of the division would be sent overseas in September of that year, and the division as a whole would see heavy combat during the remainder of the Italian Campaign. During the 92nd Division's participation in the Italian Front, the Buffalo Soldiers made contact with units of many nationalities: beyond the attached 442nd Regimental Combat Team (442nd RCT), they also had contact with the segregated troops of the British and French colonial empires (Black Africans, Moroccans, Algerians, Indians, Gurkhas, Arab and Jewish Palestinians) as well as with exiled Poles, Greeks and Czechs, anti-fascist Italians and the nonsegregated troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB).Ready, J.Lee, Forgotten Allies: The Military Contribution of the Colonies, Exiled Governments and Lesser Powers to the Allied Victory in World War IIMotley, 1975.

Its art director, Ted Shearer, would go on to create the early African-American comic strip Quincy. Commanders Major General Edward Almond, Commanding General of the 92nd Infantry Division, inspects his troops during a decoration ceremony, March 1945. The division's commander, Major General Almond, was for a time highly regarded by General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, who was a fellow Virginia Military Institute (VMI) graduate. This was a major factor in Almond's promotion to major general and subsequent command of the division, a position he held from its formation in October 1942 until August 1945. He led the division in combat throughout the Italian Campaign of 1944‚Äì1945. Almond was chosen by General Marshall to command the division because he believed Almond would excel at what was seen as a difficult assignment. However, Almond performed poorly and went on to blame his poor performance on the fact that the division was made up of largely African American troops. He saw his troops as the source of his failure in combat, and went on to advise the army against ever again using African American soldiers as combat troops.Ricks, Thomaz E. \\"The Generals: American Military Command from World War II to Today\\" Penguin Press, 2012 pages 152-53 Combat chronicle Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division operate a mortar, Massa, Italy in November 1944. The 370th Regimental Combat Team, attached to the 1st Armored Division, arrived in Naples, Italy, 1 August 1944 and entered combat on 24th. It participated in the crossing of the Arno River, the occupation of Lucca and the penetration of the Gothic Line. Enemy resistance was negligible in its area. As Task Force 92, elements of the 92nd attacked on the Ligurian coastal flank toward Massa, 5 October. By the 12th, the slight gains achieved were lost to counterattacks. On 13 October, the remainder of the division concentrated for patrol activities. Elements of the 92nd moved to the Serchio sector, 3 November 1944, and advanced in the Serchio River Valley against light resistance, but the attempt to capture Castelnuovo di Garfagnana did not succeed. Patrol activities continued until 26 December when the enemy attacked, forcing units of the 92nd to withdraw. The attack ended on 28 December. The attacking forces were mainly from the Republic of Sal√≤'s Fascist Army, the 4th Italian \\"Monte Rosa\\" Alpine Division (four battalions), with the support of three German battalions. Aside from patrols and reconnaissance, units of the 92nd attacked enemy forces in the Serchio sector from 5‚Äì8 February 1945, advancing against the 1st \\"Italia\\" Bersaglieri Division, but enemy counterattacks nullified all 92nd Division advances. After continuing poor combat performance including many instances of unauthorized withdrawals upon meeting the enemy, low morale and malingering, the 92nd Infantry Division was considered of inferior quality both by German and U.S. commands and fit for only defensive roles. Things deteriorated to the point that the division was withdrawn from the lines and rebuilt in early 1945 with the removal of the 366th Infantry Regiment (formed into two engineer general service regiments) and the addition of the 473rd and 442nd Infantry Regiments. Many historians have begun to reevaluate the combat record of the 92nd Division as contemporaneous reports of its honorable performance have continued to surface. Numerous veterans of the division believed that the reports of poor performance were motivated by racist sentiments present within the senior officer ranks. Even as evidence mounts in support of the division's honorable conduct, some still seek to suppress these facts. The famous and highly decorated Nisei 442nd, made up of Japanese Americans, was withdrawn from the fighting in France to bolster the division's combat effectiveness. The 365th and 371st Infantry Regiments became training and security regiments, respectively, and were stationed in rear areas, although still nominally assigned to the division. Soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division with a captured German soldier. On 1 April, the 370th RCT and the attached 442nd Regimental Combat Team (Nisei) attacked the Ligurian coastal sector and drove rapidly north against light opposition from the German 148th Infantry Division, which was supported only by Italian coastal units. The 370th took over the Serchio sector and pursued the retreating enemy from 18 April until the collapse of all enemy forces on 29 April 1945. Elements of the 92nd Division entered La Spezia and Genoa on 27th and took over selected towns along the Ligurian coast until the enemy surrendered on 2 May 1945.

Photo by Paolo Monti, 1982 (Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC). Carlo Scarpa (2 June 1906 ‚Äì 28 November 1978) was an Italian architect, influenced by the materials, landscape, and the history of Venetian culture, and Japan.Carlo Scarpa and Japan. The influence of Japanese art and architecture in the work of Carlo Scarpa. lincoln.ac.uk Scarpa translated his interests in history, regionalism, invention, and the techniques of the artist and craftsman into ingenious glass and furniture design.  Biography  Scarpa was born in Venice. Much of his early childhood was spent in Vicenza, where his family relocated when he was 2 years old. After his mother's death when he was 13, he moved with his father and brother back to Venice. Carlo attended the Academy of Fine Arts where he focused on architectural studies. Graduated from the Accademia in Venice, with the title of Professor of Architecture, he apprenticed with the architect Francesco Rinaldo. Scarpa married Rinaldo's niece, Nini Lazzari (Onorina Lazzari). However, Scarpa refused to sit the pro forma professional exam administrated by the Italian Government after World War II. As a consequence, he was not permitted to practice architecture without associating with an architect. Hence, those who worked with him, his clients, associates, craftspersons, called him \\"Professor\\", rather than \\"architect\\". His architecture is deeply sensitive to the changes of time, from seasons to history, rooted in a sensuous material imagination. He was Mario Botta's thesis adviser along with Giuseppe Mazzariol; the latter was the Director of the Fondazione Querini Stampalia when Scarpa completed his renovation and garden for that institution. Scarpa taught drawing and Interior Decoration at the \\"Istituto universitario di architettura di Venezia\\" from the late 1940s until his death. While most of his built work is located in the Veneto, he made designs of landscapes, gardens, and buildings, for other regions of Italy as well as Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, France and Switzerland. His name has 11 letters and this is used repeatedly in his architecture. One of his last projects, the Villa Palazzetto in Monselice, left incomplete at the time of his death, was altered in October 2006 by his son Tobia. This work is one of Scarpa's most ambitious landscape and garden projects, the Brion Sanctuary notwithstanding. It was executed for Aldo Businaro, the representative for Cassina who is responsible for Scarpa's first trip to Japan. Aldo Businaro died in August 2006, a few months before the completion of the new stair at the Villa Palazzetto, built to commemorate Scarpa's centenary. In 1978, while in Sendai, Japan, Scarpa died after falling down a flight of concrete stairs. He survived for ten days in a hospital before succumbing to the injuries of his fall. He is buried standing up and wrapped in linen sheets in the style of a medieval knight, in an isolated exterior corner of his L-shaped Brion Cemetery at San Vito d'Altivole in the Veneto. In 1984, the Italian composer Luigi Nono dedicated to him the composition for orchestra in micro-intervals A Carlo Scarpa, Architetto, Ai suoi infiniti possibili.

It is currently monotypic in the genus Neophoca, with the extinct Pleistocene New Zealand sea lion Neophoca palatina the only known congener. With a population estimated at around 14,730 animals, the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia (1950) has listed them as ‚Äúin need of special protection‚Äù. Their Conservation status is listed as endangered. These pinnipeds are specifically known for their abnormal breeding cycles, which are varied between a 5-month breeding cycle and a 17-18 month aseasonal breeding cycle, compared to other pinnipeds which fit into a 12-month reproductive cycle. Females are either silver or fawn with a cream underbelly and males are dark chocolate brown with a yellow mane and are bigger than the females.  Distribution  Australian sea lions are sparsely distributed across their range which reaches from the Houtman Arbrolhos Islands (28¬∞S, 114¬∞E) in Western Australia along the southern Australian coast to The Pages Islands (35¬∞46‚ÄôS, 138¬∞18‚ÄôE) in South Australia. 66 breeding colonies have been identified: 28 in Western Australia and 38 in South Australia. Most breeding colonies exist on offshore islands, with the exception of Point Labatt in South Australia, Baxter Cliffs (west of Twilight Cove) in Western Australia, and the Bunda Cliffs, Great Australian Bight, which straddles the border between the two states. Forty-two percent of the total known population occurs at the three largest colonies east of Port Lincoln: Seal Bay (on Kangaroo Island's south coast), The Pages and Dangerous Reef (in Spencer Gulf). The species' breeding range has contracted as the population has fallen. Now extinct breeding colonies existed in Bass Strait, particularly on Clarke Island and adjacent islands in the Furneaux Group. The Abrolhos Island breeding colony is believed to be much smaller today than it was prior to European settlement. Kangaroo Island's north and east coasts and islands near Perth and Albany hosted now-extinct breeding colonies. Phylogeny Australian sea lions on the beach at the Seal Bay Conservation Park on Kangaroo Island, South Australia The Australian sea lion is a pinniped, most closely related to other species of sea lions and fur seals making up the family Otariidae. These mammals use their flippers to propel themselves in water and can walk on land with their flippers. Australian sea lions share distinct features with other sea lions. These include short fur, short flippers and a bulky body. Communication An Australian sea lion vocalising In pinnipeds, mothers and pups are frequently separated throughout nursing and are thus expected to have evolved an efficient individual recognition system. Consequentially, in Australian sea lions, as in many social mammals, mothers and their offspring can identify each other. Individual recognition produces mutual benefits by avoiding misdirected maternal care and therefore energy expenditure for mothers, and the risk of injury for young approaching unrelated, potentially dangerous, adult females. Individual recognition can be accomplished with a combination of several sensory modalities, including olfaction, vision, and audition. The use of olfactory cues as a close range recognition mechanism allows mothers to further confirm their pup's identity. In contrast to recent olfactory studies in pinnipeds which showed the presence but not a natural function of olfaction in pinnipeds, the present study shows that wild Australian sea lions use their olfactory abilities in a functional manner, by discrimination between the scents of their own offspring and a non- filial pup. However, in a dynamic, crowded colony, the acoustic channel seems to be the most reliable modality. For pinnipeds, neither visual nor olfactory cues are likely to be the primary modality for mother‚Äìpup recognition. Male Australian sea lions were observed producing three different call types: a barking call, a bleating call and a female-like call. The predominant call type produced by males of all ages was the barking call. The barking call of Australian sea lions was similar in structure to the barking calls described in some other species of otariid in that it was a short sound produced repetitively in a series. Mature Australian sea lion males were found to emit the barking call in almost all social interactions, despite the existence of at least three call types in their vocal repertoire, plus a guttural threat and growl. While Australian sealions have a reputation for curiosity and playfulness during interactions with humans, their bite (albeit rare) can require hospitalisation.  Diet  Australian sea lions have been described as opportunistic, benthic foragers. Limited stomach content and faecal analyses have identified a wide variety of prey in the diet of the Australian sea lion, including teleost fish, squid, cuttlefish, octopus, sharks (including Port Jackson sharks), Southern rock lobster, other small crustaceans and Little penguins. Regurgitate and stomach samples from Australian sea lions at Seal Bay contained hard parts consisting predominantly of benthic taxa. This supports previous evidence that this species forages primarily on neritic, benthic prey, many of which are non-migratory. For the cephalopod component of the Australian sea lion diet, octopus and giant Australian cuttlefish made up the greatest biomass of prey taxa. Although the Australian sea lion feeds off seasonally available prey such as semelparous cephalopods, it also exploits prey species that are available throughout the year, such as Southern rock lobster and many of the fish species. Observations from the 1930s in Western Australian noted that Australian sea lions seemed to be subsisting on little penguins during the summer, and that their regular diet didn't compete with commercial fisheries. Also in the 1930s, the animal was described informally as \\"rather fond of penguins\\". They were known to feed on little penguins in the 1960s.  Predators  Adult Australian sea lions are eaten by Great white sharks and are occasionally killed by other animals such as stingrays. Pups are vulnerable to attack by other smaller shark species. Breeding behaviour Sea lion mother and cub, Pearson Island, South Australia As of 2020, 66 breeding colonies have been identified: 28 in Western Australia and 38 in South Australia. The animals breed on at least 50 islands, 27 in Western Australia and 23 in Southern Australia. Prior to a study that took place from 1987 to 1992, thirty-one of the 50 islands were undiscovered, as well as 19 more islands considered additional breeding grounds. On the basis of surveys conducted primarily in 1990, about 70% of the population was in Southern Australia and 30% in Western-Australia. Pup production was estimated at 2,432 for these 50 islands in 1990. In 1994 and 1995 another 10 breeding colonies were recorded on the mainland in the Great Australian Bight region, only producing 161 pups. Thus, reproduction is yielding less and less pups per breeding season. The four largest colonies, on The Pages Islands, at Seal Bay on Kangaroo Island, and at Dangerous Reef, produced 42% of the total pup numbers; they are at the eastern end of the range, east of Port Lincoln. The breeding cycle of the Australian sea lion is unusual within the pinniped family. It is a 17.6- to 18-month cycle and is 'not' synchronised between colonies. However, census data collected since 1973 shows that breeding events shift forward in time to 13.8 days earlier every 18 months. The duration of the breeding season can range from five to seven months and has been recorded for up to nine months at Seal Bay on Kangaroo Island. Bulls do not have fixed territories during the breeding season. The males fight other males from a very young age to establish their individual positions in the male hierarchy and during the breeding season, dominant males will guard females for the right to breed with her when she comes into oestrus. A female comes into season for about 24 hours within 7 to 10 days after she has given birth to her new pup. She will only look after the new pup and generally fights off the previous season's pup if it attempts to continue to suckle from her. Male Australian sea lions are also known to kill young as an act of defence of territory. Australian sea lions also practice alloparental care, in which an adult may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them. This behaviour is common and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant and fathead minnow. Sea lions on Kangaroo Island beach Population In 2010, an estimated 14,730 Australian sea lions existed. By 2014, the population had dropped to an estimated 6,500 and continues to decrease. The population is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The Australian sea lion population is naturally disadvantaged when compared to other pinnipeds in Australia. Its long and complicated breeding cycle, the high site fidelity of females, and high mortality rates all make the species more vulnerable to extinction. Jones Island , west of Eyre Peninsula in South Australia is one of the few sites where the population is not decreasing. In 2019, it was declared a \\"prohibited area\\" to eliminate human disturbance to the colony while landed. In 2018 it was reported that aerial drones were being used to successfully discover and measure colonies of Australian sea lions along the Nullarbor Plain. Previously, surveying these areas was limited to the use of binoculars and peering down 60 metre high cliffs to view the rocks below.  Threats  Sea lions were heavily hunted following European settlement which greatly reduced their numbers. Large-scale hunting ceased in the 1920s, but some killing and trade in \\"hair seal\\" skins continued. No baseline population data exists, but the species population and range have both decreased. Major threatening processes in the 20th and 21st centuries were primarily interactions with commercial fishing gear and illegal shooting. Entangled animals can sometimes be found and treated successfully. Secondary threats include: marine fish aquaculture (including loss of habitat, entanglement and direct killing), disease, pollution, oil spills and noise, particularly from seismic surveys, construction, or marine operations. = Illegal shooting = Illegal shootings have been reported in both South Australia and Western Australia. Dead animals with gunshot wounds have been found at Cheynes Beach, Albany, near Port Wakefield in South Australia and at other locations. Some killings have lead citizens to start petitions demanding thorough investigation. The shooting of a male Australian sea lion which had hauled out at Port Macdonnell in 2013 by government employees without a prior veterinary assessment was criticised by animal rescue workers and the general public. = Shark fishery = Australian sealions are caught as bycatch by the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery. Following the closure of the Commonwealth gillnet fishery in southern Spencer Gulf in 2001, pup production increased at Dangerous Reef (within Spencer Gulf) and that population began to recover. Researchers estimated that while the fishery was operating, 374 Australian sea lions were killed by the fishery each breeding cycle. While most sealion bycatch occurred close to breeding colonies, some occurred as far as 130 kilometres away. In 2011, Humane Society International lobbied for the trigger figure for the closure of the fishery of 104 Australian sea lion deaths to be lowered. Some Australian sealions have drowned after becoming entangled or trapped in Southern rock lobster pots and gear. Commercial fishers have also illegally shot and killed Australian sealions which they believed were competing with their fishery. = Long lactation period = The transition for young mammals from dependence on milk to independent foraging can lead to increased risk of natural mortality. The Australian sea lion demonstrates one of the longest lactation periods in pinnipeds and pups begin diving before they are weaned. Australian sea lion adults work hard to forage at the seabed, demonstrating high field metabolic rates, and spending 58% of time at sea diving and 35% of time at sea on or near the bottom. Juveniles spend 67% of time at sea diving and 44% of time at sea on or near the bottom. Although many air-breathing vertebrates dive well within their estimated limit of oxygen stores, Australian sea lion adults and juveniles appear to operate close to their physiological maximum. The prolonged dependency period could provide extensive opportunities for foraging lessons, while the extreme diving behaviour required in the Australian sea lions' environment might necessitate it. Alternatively, it has hypothesised that female harbour seals accompanying pups demonstrate reduced foraging efficiency, and hence, the metabolic demands of foraging for Australian sea may preclude lactating females from performing suboptimal dives with their young. This becomes a preventative measure to maintain a population and avoid a complete extinction. However, as a result of small population size, small breeding colony size, low reproductive rate, exposure to human activities, and evidence of population declines in some areas, Australian sea lions have recently been listed as threatened and vulnerable.  Conservation status & management  In 1909, field naturalists lobbied for the protection of three critical breeding sites for the Australian sea lion: Dangerous Reef, The Pages and the Casuarina Islets off Kangaroo Island. In 1918, the South Australian parliament debated the Birds and Animals Protection Bill, and the Legislative Council agreed that it would protect Australian sea lions from harm covering waters of Spencer Gulf, St Vincent Gulf, the Investigator Strait, Backstairs Passage and to the mouth of the Murray River. The introduction of the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 prohibited the killing of Australian sea lions statewide. The Australian sea lion was listed as vulnerable under the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 in 2005 and is also listed as a threatened species in each state in its range (South Australia and Western Australia). On 11 June 2013, the Recovery Plan for the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) was adopted by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. The plan considers the conservation requirements of the species across its range and identifies the actions to be taken to ensure its long-term viability in nature and the parties that will undertake those actions. Some zoos and aquariums are participating in captive breeding programs. In 2006 it was reported that at least 41 pups had been born and raised in captivity since 1981. The species has been kept in aquaria since at least as early as 1965. In 2015, an Australian sea lion juvenile was captured at Bletchley near Strathalbyn in South Australia, and was going to be considered for holding in captivity. = Fisheries Management = The Australian Fisheries Management Authority Commission has also finalised the Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy which came into force on 30 June 2010 which includes closures of waters around colonies, seasonal closures, increased observation of sea lion activity and trials of modified fishing techniques and equipment. The strategy was designed to meet the commission's obligations under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The strategy will significantly reduce the impact of fishing in the SESSF on Australian sea lions and enable the recovery of the species, including all sub-populations. Southern rock lobster fisheries in both South Australia and Western Australia now use pots which feature special collars designed to prevent Australian sealions from entering the pots or spikes which act as a deterrent. Ecology Australia sea lion off Pearson Island Australian sea lions defecate nutrient-rich faeces which may provide an important nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the faeces of Australian sea lions found very high levels of nutrient cycling and transport genes which may break down the nutrients defecated by sea lions into a bioavailable form for incorporation into marine food webs. Diving behaviours indicate that the Australian Sea Lions worked extremely hard to exploit the benefits of their surrounding habitats. The Australian sea lion exceeds the limit (calculated aerobic dive limit) on 79% of dives. Australian sea lions spend 58% of time at sea diving and demonstrate high field metabolism, which allows the sea lions to maximise their time spent at or near the benthos, with 61% of each dive and 35% of their time at sea being spent at the deepest 20% of the dives. When diving, these animals are spending 57.9% of their time at sea spent at depths greater than or equal to 6 m, which can be considered as continuous diving. Seasonal variability in foraging energetics and dive behaviour is likely to be sensitive to regional oceanography, the maintenance costs of female sea lions and their offspring, and the distribution and behaviour of their prey. The Australian sea lion exhibits strong site fidelity, with a foraging range of at most 300 km from their colony. Australian sea lions sometimes travel inland during tumultuous weather, and have been known to travel up to 9.4 km from the ocean.

According to some sources, hundreds of thousands of men were \\"fished\\" before the practice was discontinued. Etymology and definition The term is derived from Matthew 4:19 from the New Testament, in which Jesus tells two fishermen that he will make them \\"fishers of men\\".Matthew 4:19 (KJV, NIV, NKJV). Retrieved from BibleGateway.com. Cult leader David Berg extrapolated from this that women in his movement should be \\"flirty fishers\\" (also called \\"bait\\" or \\"fisherwomen\\"). The targeted men were called \\"fish\\". The cult published several documents with exact instructions. Flirty Fishing was defined as using sex appeal for proselytizing. If masturbation, oral, or penetrative sex ensued, this was termed as \\"loving sexually\\", and also counted as a \\"deep witness\\", meaning that the \\"bait\\" earned more brownie points within the group than by mere flirting. Berg noted that Flirty Fishing did not necessarily entail intercourse, but that this was by far the most efficient method of proselytizing.In a 1982 family publication, Berg stated that only one-seventh (14%) of fish were \\"loved sexually\\", but he also noted that \\"loving sexually\\" was far and above the most effective method of witnessing in that it was 3,000 times more effective than conventional forms of proselytizing. The 7 F's of FFing! Within the Children of God = The Impact on Members = Women who objected to being what the cult itself bluntly described as \\"God's whores\\" or \\"hookers for Jesus\\" were admonished not to \\"let self and pride enter in\\",True Komix #293 DO \\"The Little Flirty Fishy\\" and reminded that their body did not really belong to them, as according to 1 Corinthians 6:19‚Äì20 it had been \\"bought\\" (by Jesus through his crucifixion) \\"with a price\\". After an initial phase, male members no longer partook in this drive, partially because of the cult's dismissive stance toward homosexuality, but also because Berg thought it did not \\"pay off financially\\". Many of the flirty fishers had boyfriends, were married, or had children. In Family publications, flirty fishers and escort service practitioners (see below) frequently reported that they found their work hard, dangerous and exhausting. = ESing = The financial benefit of Flirty Fishing soon led to a further degeneration of the practice from mere flirting into \\"loving sexually\\" to \\"escort servicing\\" (ESing)--described as \\"making FFing pay\\" by Berg--in which female cult members would work as regular call girls for escort agencies or freelance, and \\"witness\\" (proselytize) to their clients merely when the occasion offered itself. =Effects= The Children of God practised flirty fishing and escort servicing from 1974 until 1987, when it was officially abandoned, in part because of the AIDS epidemic. As the women were expected to keep exact records of their \\"fruits\\" (successes), a 1988 statistic showed that more than 223,000 men had been \\"fished\\" since 1978--and that FFing had nevertheless continued into 1988. As the cult generally discourages birth control, the practice also resulted in numerous pregnancies, the offspring of which were termed Jesus babies by the organization.\\"Jesus baby\\" article from xfamily.org Similar phenomena The Chinese sect known as Eastern Lightning has been alleged to entice people into joining by offering them sexual favors.

The New Zealand sea lion numbers around 10,000 and is perhaps the world's rarest sea lion species. They are the only species of the genus Phocarctos. Physiology and behaviour New Zealand sea lions are one of the largest New Zealand animals. Like all otariids, they have marked sexual dimorphism; adult males are long and weigh , while adult females are long and weigh . At birth, pups are long and weigh ; the natal pelage is a thick coat of dark brown hair that becomes dark gray with cream markings on the top of the head, nose, tail and at the base of the flippers. Adult females' coats vary from buff to creamy grey with darker pigmentation around the muzzle and the flippers. Adult males are blackish-brown with a well-developed black mane of coarse hair reaching the shoulders. New Zealand sea lions are strongly philopatric. Distribution The main breeding populations are at the Auckland and Campbell Islands in the NZ Subantarctic, where approximately 99% of the species' annual pup production occurs. There are currently three functioning breeding rookeries on the Auckland Islands. Most sea lions are born on Dundas Island. A smaller rookery exists at Sandy Bay on Enderby Island and the smallest rookery is on Figure of Eight Island. An even smaller rookery at South East Point on Auckland Island appears to now have been abandoned. The other major breeding area is the Campbell Islands. For the first time in 150 years, sea lions began breeding again on the South Island coast in 1994, on the Otago Peninsula. Other small populations of breeding sea lions have recently begun to establish in various parts of the Stewart Island coastline and have been observed on the Catlins coast south of the Clutha River. Recent DNA information indicates the New Zealand sea lion is a lineage previously restricted to subantarctic regions. Somewhere between 1300 and 1500 AD, a genetically distinct mainland lineage was wiped out by the first Maori settlers,Wishart S.. Newcomers. The New Zealand Geographic and the subantarctic lineage has since then gradually filled the ecological niche. It has been inferred from middens and ancient DNA that a third lineage was made extinct at the Chatham Islands due to predation by the Moriori people. Diet and predation New Zealand sea lions are known to prey on a wide range of species including fish such as Antarctic horsefish and Patagonian toothfish, cephalopods (e.g. New Zealand arrow squid and yellow octopus), crustaceans, seabirds and other marine mammals, and even New Zealand fur seals. Studies indicate a strong location effect on diet, with almost no overlap in prey species comparing sea lions at Otago Peninsula and Campbell Island, at the north and south extents of the species' breeding range. New Zealand sea lions are in turn preyed on by great white sharks, with 27% showing evidence of scarring from near-miss shark attacks in an opportunistic study of adult NZ sea lions at Sandy Bay, Enderby Island. Status One of colonies on Enderby Island New Zealand sea lions are considered the most threatened sea lion in the world. The species' status is largely driven by the main breeding population at the Auckland Islands, which declined by ~50% between 2000 and 2015. The 2013 sea lion pup production count on the Auckland Islands showed the number of pups born on the islands has risen to 1931, from the 2012 figure of 1684 (dead pups are also counted, since the annual pup count is used to assess the population of breeding females, but not future births when the counted pups mature). The 2013 number was the highest in five years. The Campbell Island population 'appears to be increasing slowly' and births here comprise ~30% of the species' total. The Otago and Stewart Island sea lion populations are currently small, though increasing. Population estimates for the whole species declined from ~15,000 in the mid-1990s to 9,000 in 2008 (based on the number of pups born). In 2010, the Department of Conservation‚Äîresponsible for marine mammal conservation‚Äîchanged the New Zealand Threat Classification System ranking from Nationally Endangered to Nationally Critical. The Department of Conservation estimates that Auckland Islands' sea lions, nearly 80% of the total, could be functionally extinct by 2035. However, the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries considers research on which this prediction is based is low quality and ‚Äòshould not be used in management decisions‚Äô. In 2015, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) changed the classification of this species to \\"Endangered\\", based on low overall population size, the small number of breeding populations and the projected trend of the Auckland Islands breeding population. Sea lions on Aramoana in the Otago Harbour With kayakers in Karitane Harbour Female on Smaills Beach Threats =Subsistence hunting and commercial sealing= Subsistence hunting and commercial harvest of sea lions greatly reduced the breeding range and population size of New Zealand sea lions between the 13th and 19th Centuries. In 1893, sealing for both New Zealand sea lions and New Zealand fur seals was prohibited by law in New Zealand. =Commercial fishery bycatch= In the 1990s, as the volume of squid fishing around the Auckland Islands increased, numbers of sea lions were captured as bycatch and drowned in the squid trawl nets. The government uses a modelling system to set a fishing-related mortality limit (FRML) each year. If the limit is predicted to be exceeded, the Minister of Primary Industries may close the fishery. The last time the FRML was exceeded was in 2000, though a number of closures occurred in the 1990s. The estimated (as different from reported) captures in the 2014 season were 11.58% of the FRML.Ministry for Primary Industries, SQU6T Weekly Report for week ending 29 June The proportion of vessels in the Auckland Island squid fishery with government observers has increased over the years, providing independent reports of bycatch based on observation rather than computer model estimates. In the 2014 season, the observers' coverage was of 84% of tows. In late February 2013, the first observed sea lion mortalities in the Auckland Island squid fleet in three years occurred. Juvenile sea lions slipped through the grid at the opening of the net into its cod end. The 23-cm grid aperture is designed to hold adult sea lions in the SLED and yet still allow squid to pass into the net. In 2013, one adult female was taken as incidental bycatch.Ministry for Primary Industries, SQU6T Weekly Report for week ending 26 May In the concluded 2014 season, two sea lions were reportedly captured in the fishery. In August 2013, the seasonal southern blue whiting fleet captured 21 male sea lions in fishing grounds more than 100 km off the Campbell Islands. Four were released alive. No captures were reported by government observers the year before. The government responded to the captures by requesting the vessels try sea lion exclusion devices (SLEDs) to reduce this bycatch. Sea lion exclusion devices In 2001, the sea lion exclusion device (SLED) was introduced into the Auckland Island squid fishery to reduce sea lion bycatch. Conservation advocates have supported SLED use to protect other marine animals or sharks. Since 2007, all vessels in the Auckland Islands fishery have been equipped with SLEDs. Some scientists still do not believe sea lions survive the interaction with a SLED, though the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) believes the direct effect of fishing-related mortality on the sea lion population is minimal. MPI has concluded that a sea lion has an 85% chance of escaping the SLED and a 97 per cent probability of surviving a SLED escape, though it says this estimate may be 'mildly pessimistic'. =Food limitation= Food availability is a well-known, major cause of population change in pinniped species. The Auckland Islands population has displayed numerous indicators of food limitation during the recent decline in breeder numbers, including: poor maternal condition, delayed maturation, years with very low pupping rate, low survival of pups born and long-term shifts in diet composition. Starvation was provisionally identified as cause of mortality for 62% of pups necropsied at Campbell Island in 2015, when 58% of all pups born were estimated to have died in the first month of life. =Disease= Though the Auckland Island sea lion pup production is highly variable, a decline trend for some years followed the outbreak of an introduced bacterial disease caused by a Campylobacter species in 1998 which killed an estimated 53% of newborn pups and 20% of adult females. In 2002, another probably introduced bacterial disease caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae killed 32% of pups, and in 2003 another 21% of the pups. Since 2002, K. pneumoniae bacteria have caused significant mortality in the sea lion pups at Enderby Island. Infected pups have meningitis, as well as sepsis. On 12 March 2014, the Conservation Minister Nick Smith was quoted as saying an \\"excessive focus on fishing bycatch\\" existed and 300 pups had died this summer from an as yet unidentified disease. =Mainland threats= The mainland population was estimated to reach 1000 animals by 2044, leading to issues of ‚Äòmarine protected areas, local fishing quotas and numbers management‚Äô.

This album was recorded in the period from December 17 to 28, 1995. At that time most of the United States were experiencing severe winter weather, but the Sonoran Desert region, where this album was recorded, was enjoying a period temperate calm and clear skies. While recording this album, Kent and Newby, along with their families, stayed at Roach‚Äôs home in Tucson. While there, the group enjoyed casual walks through the surrounding desert, serving as inspiration for their daily creative explorations in the studio. Halcyon is the ancient Greek name for a bird now believed to be the kingfisher. In Greek Mythology Alcyone was a queen whose husband Ceyx was killed when his ship was lost at sea. She was overcome by grief and tried to drown herself, but the gods took pity on her and transformed her into a kingfisher. In the myth, the seas are calmed during a two-week period surrounding the winter solstice, when Alcyon‚Äôs descendants lay their eggs on the still water. This period is known as the Halcyon Days. The music has a predominantly acoustic quality although much of the percussion and textures are rendered by computer algorithms designed by Kenneth Newby (Halcyon Days, Calyx Revelation, Rainfrog Dreaming) or programmed by Steve Roach (First Day, Kingfisher Flight), with didgeridoo and flute. Sampled electroacoustic textures are used throughout with only limited use of synthesizers. On some tracks, Stephen Kent plays a cello, in a fashion that resembles the sintir, a Moroccan plucked stringed instrument with a sound resembling an upright bass. This gives these tracks slight jazz overtones.

Gestational hypertension is defined as having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 on two separate occasions at least 6 hours apart.  Signs and symptoms  No single diagnostic test currently exists to predict the likelihood of developing gestational hypertension. High blood pressure is the major sign in diagnosing gestational hypertension. Some women with gestational hypertension may present asymptomatic, but a number of symptoms are associated with the condition.

Severe pre-eclampsia involves a blood pressure greater than 160/110, with additional medical signs and symptoms. HELLP syndrome is a type of pre-eclampsia. It is a combination of three medical conditions: hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count. ;Eclampsia :This is when tonic-clonic seizures appear in a pregnant woman with high blood pressure and proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are sometimes treated as components of a common syndrome. Treatment There is no specific treatment, but is monitored closely to rapidly identify pre-eclampsia and its life- threatening complications (HELLP syndrome and eclampsia). Drug treatment options are limited, as many antihypertensives may negatively affect the fetus. Methyldopa, hydralazine, and labetalol are most commonly used for severe pregnancy hypertension. The fetus is at increased risk for a variety of life-threatening conditions, including pulmonary hypoplasia (immature lungs). If the dangerous complications appear after the fetus has reached a point of viability, even though still immature, then an early delivery may be warranted to save the lives of both mother and baby. An appropriate plan for labor and delivery includes selection of a hospital with provisions for advanced life support of newborn babies. Evolutionary considerations =Humans= Gestational hypertension is one of the most common disorders seen in human pregnancies. Though relatively benign on its own, in roughly half of the cases of gestational hypertension the disorder progresses into pre-eclampsia, a dangerous condition that can prove fatal to expectant mothers. However, gestational hypertension is a condition that is fairly rare to see in other animals. For years, it has been the belief of the scientific community that gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia were relatively unique to humans, although there has been some recent evidence that other primates can also suffer from similar conditions, albeit due to different underlying mechanisms. The underlying cause of gestational hypertension in humans is commonly believed to be an improperly implanted placenta. Humans have evolved to have a very invasive placenta to facilitate better oxygen transfer from the mother to the fetus, to support the growth of its large brain. =Origins of the placenta= Placental circulation The origins of gestational hypertension may lie with the development of humans' hemochorial placenta. A hemochorial placenta optimizes the amount of oxygen and nutrients that can be absorbed into the fetal blood supply, while at the same time ensuring rapid diffusion of wastes away from the fetus. This hemochorial placenta differs from lower primates' epitheliochorial placentae in the way that it allows the fetal tissues to interact directly with the mother's blood. The hemochorial placenta thereby promotes more rapid diffusion to and from the fetal blood supply.Campbell, Bernard Grant. \\"Reproduction and the Placenta.\\" Human Evolution: An Introduction to Man's Adaptations. New York: Aldine De Gruyter, 1998. 317-20. In animals with epitheliochorial placentae such as horses and pigs, the greatest resistance to maternal blood flow in the vascular system was found within the placenta. However, in animals with hemochorial placental structures such as rodents and primates, the vascular resistance in the placenta was low, leading scientists to the conclusion that the greatest resistance to maternal blood flow is found elsewhere in the maternal vascular system. The high vascular resistance outside of the placenta leads to higher maternal blood pressure throughout the body. The fetal cells that implant into the uterine wall are known as the trophoblast. The hemochorial placenta bathes the fetal trophoblast in maternal blood by forming lacunae, or lakes, of the mother's blood that surround fetal tissue. The lacunae are filled by the spiral arteries, which means that the mother's blood pressure is the driving force behind the introduction of new blood, which contains both oxygen and food for the fetus, to the system. It is thought that humans need the increased diffusion provided by the hemochorial placenta in order to grow the large brains compared to their body size that distinguish them from other primates. =Incorrect placental implantation= It is thought that \\"failings\\" in normal hemochorial placental structure lead to pre-eclampsia and gestational hypertension. The human placenta implants \\"earlier, deeper, and more extensively\\" into the uterine wall, which can potentially lead to many problems that are found in human pregnancies, but not as much in other animals. Miscarriage and pre-eclampsia are both very rare in other species, but are two of the most common pregnancy-related diseases in humans. The genetic roots of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia are certain, as women with a family history of the condition are three times more likely to suffer from it when they are pregnant. One of the potential causes of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia is when the trophoblast does not invade far enough into the uterine lining. When the fetus's trophoblast does not fully extend into the uterine wall, the spiral arteries do not become fully converted into low-resistance channels. It has been found that this incomplete conversion of spiral arteries increases the resistance to uterine blood flow during pregnancy, and that this occurrence was associated with gestational hypertension. One potential cause of this incomplete breach of the spiral arteries that leads to gestational hypertension is a mistaken immune response by the maternal tissue, reaction to the alien fetal tissue. Therefore, it is clear that the complication of gestational hypertension has roots in the early implantation of the fetus in the uterine wall, an implantation technique that is unique to humans. The highly invasive placenta that is found in humans is thought to be linked to humans' high circulating levels of the hormones CG and hCG. It has been shown that the higher the levels of these hormones, the deeper the trophoblast's invasion into the uterine wall. Instances of gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have been shown to occur when the invasion of the uterine wall is not deep enough, because of lower CG and hCG levels in the mother. =Evolutionary tradeoff= Despite these risks for gestational hypertension, the hemochorial placenta has been favored because of its advantages in the way that it aids in diffusion from mother to fetus later in pregnancy. The bipedal posture that has allowed humans to walk upright has also led to a reduced cardiac output, and it has been suggested that this is what necessitated humans' aggressive early placental structures. Increased maternal blood pressure can attempt to make up for lower cardiac output, ensuring that the fetus's growing brain receives enough oxygen and nutrients. The benefits of being able to walk upright and run on land have outweighed the disadvantages that come from bipedalism, including the placental diseases of pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension. Similarly, the advantages of having a large brain size have outweighed the deleterious effects of having a placenta that does not always convert the spiral arteries effectively, leaving humans vulnerable to contracting gestational hypertension. It is speculated that this was not the case with Neanderthals, and that they died out because their cranial capacity increased too much, and their placentae were not equipped to handle the fetal brain development, leading to widespread pre-eclampsia and maternal and fetal death. Gestational hypertension in the early stages of pregnancy (trimester 1) has been shown to improve the health of the child both in its first year of life, and its later life. However, when the disease develops later in the pregnancy (subsequent trimesters), or turns into pre-eclampsia, there begin to be detrimental health effects for the fetus, including low birth-weight. It has been proposed that fetal genes designed to increase the mother's blood pressure are so beneficial that they outweigh the potential negative effects that can come from pre-eclampsia. It has also been suggested that gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia have remained active traits due to the cultural capacity of humans, and the tendency for midwives or helpers to aid in delivering babies. =Relevance of evolutionary history= It is the goal of evolutionary medicine to find treatments for diseases that are informed by the evolutionary history of a disease. It has been suggested that gestational hypertension is linked to insulin resistance during pregnancy. Both the increase in blood sugar that can lead to gestational diabetes and the increase in blood pressure that can lead to gestational hypertension are mechanisms that mean to optimize the amount of nutrients that can be passed from maternal tissue to fetal tissue. It has been suggested that techniques used to combat insulin insensitivity might also prove beneficial to those suffering from gestational hypertension. Measures to avoid insulin resistance include avoiding obesity before pregnancy, minimizing weight gain during pregnancy, eating foods with low glycemic indices, and exercising.

She served in the cabinet of NDP Premier Howard Pawley, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the party's leadership in 1988. She was born Maureen Lucille Miller, the daughter of James Leroy Miller and Elaine Agnes McParlor, in Grand Forks, British Columbia, and was educated at Bralorne. She served on the Assiniboine South School Board in 1969, 1970 and 1973. She married H. David Hemphill but they had divorced by the 1980s. Hemphill first ran for the provincial legislature in 1977, in the southwest Winnipeg riding of Charleswood. She was defeated by Progressive Conservative leader Sterling Lyon, whose party defeated Edward Schreyer's New Democratic Party to win the election. The Manitoba NDP regained power under Howard Pawley in 1981, and Hemphill was easily elected for the north Winnipeg riding of Logan (former Mayor Steve Juba was a distant second). Hemphill was appointed Minister of Education on November 30, 1981, and retained this position for the entirety of the Pawley government's first mandate. She increased state support for private and parochial schools while holding this portfolio, despite the NDP's historical objections to such funding. Hemphill was re-elected without difficulty in 1986 (defeating future Liberal MLA Kevin Lamoureux), and was appointed Minister of Business Development and Tourism on April 17, 1986. On September 21, 1987, a cabinet shuffle made her the Minister of Community Services. When the Pawley government lost a parliamentary vote of non- confidence in 1988, Hemphill was one of four candidates to become the party's new leader. She placed fourth on the first ballot, and gave her support to third-place candidate Andy Anstett, who was eliminated on the second ballot. Hemphill was again re-elected in 1988, albeit by a reduced margin. She was not a candidate in 1990. In 1993, Hemphill ran for the national New Democratic Party in the riding of Winnipeg North Centre, but placed second to incumbent Liberal David Walker.

BATUS is the British Army's largest armoured training facility, and it can accommodate live-firing and tactical effect simulation (TES) exercises up to battle group level. CFB Suffield is 19% the size of Northern Ireland and offers the British Army the ability to conduct large exercises that UK military bases cannot accommodate.  History  CHAVRE of the Royal Engineers in Canada in 2005. A British chemical weapons testing facility was located in French-controlled Algeria. However, upon the conquest of France by Germany in 1940, the facility was lost. The British could find no suitable location in the UK, and an agreement was signed between Canada and the UK to allow the Suffield area to become available to British scientists for testing. Consequently, British and Canadian forces employed the area for a variety of experiments. Upon the end of World War II, the British departed the Suffield area and it was formally taken over by the Canadian Defence Research Board. In 1969, Colonel Gaddafi led a coup in Libya, took control of the country and proceeded, after negotiations, to close down British military installations located at El Adem and Tobruk, and American installations located near Tripoli. This presented the UK with a problem, as there were no areas large enough to allow the British Army to undertake large-scale armoured warfare exercises in Europe. In 1971 a 10-year lease was signed between the British and Canadian Governments that authorized battle group training to take place in the Suffield area by the British Army. In January 1972, the British Army Training Unit Suffield was formally established. In July, the first live rounds were fired by the 4th Royal Tank Regiment Battle Group. In 1981, the lease for Suffield was extended, and in 1991, the lease was again extended. In 2006, on the expiration of this lease, the British and Canadian governments concluded an agreement that would allow British forces to maintain their training practices in Canada indefinitely.  Current  A row of Challenger II on a firing range at BATUS. A battlegroup on display at BATUS in 2014. Due to the hostile winters, BATUS conducts training from May to October each year.

The organization was founded in Karlskrona on 8 August 1994. It became a political party on 20 April 1999, the 110th birthday of Adolf Hitler. The party's official newspaper‚Äînow defunct‚Äîwas named Den Svenske Nationalsocialisten (\\"The Swedish National Socialist\\"), also known as Den Svenske (\\"The Swedish\\"). The party ran in the municipal council elections in Karlskrona in 2002, but only attracted 0.5% of the votes which was not sufficient for a mandate. In 2006 the party entered the elections at a national level. There it gained 1,417 votes, or 0.03% (in order to enter the Swedish parliament a party needs at least 4% of the total votes). The party was most successful in Trollh√§ttan, where it received 208 votes or 0.65%, although this was not enough to enter the municipal assembly. 2006 was the best election year in the party's history. In 2007 the NSF demonstrated in Stockholm for the release of Holocaust denier Ernst Z√ºndel. The party had as its main goals the abolition of democracy, the repatriation of immigrants, internment of communists into work camps, a repeat of the holocausthttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVm7HlCs25A and the implementation of scientific racism and cutting taxes for families with many genetically healthy children. The NSF also launched a campaign to defend Mel Gibson over the criticism he received from Abraham Foxman for making the film The Passion of the Christ. The National Socialist Front had a mandatory political uniform dress code during marches and demonstrations, which included a black combat- sweater or shirt, black military-cap, boots, khaki-coloured combat pants and the party's logo on the arms. This uniform was taken out of use after the police stated in 2006 that it was a hate crime to wear them during demonstrations. The members of the party often wore a blue T-shirt with yellow text that said \\"NSF\\" after this. History The party was formed in 1994 by a number of sympathisers of the former White Aryan Resistance (Swedish: Vitt Ariskt Motst√•nd) in Karlskrona. From the beginning 1994 to December 1999, the party was led by Anders H√∂gstr√∂m. When he left, he introduced a so-called reich council consisting of Anders √Ñrleskog and Daniel H√∂glund. Anders H√∂gstr√∂m left NSF to instead become involved in the Social Democrats. As of April 1999, the National Socialist Front saw itself as a party political organization, but never registered a party designation. Several people related to the organization were convicted of violent crime which was against the public. Among other things, the perpetrators of the Malexander murders 1999 had connections to NSF. One of the perpetrators, Andreas Axelsson, had previously been a member of NSF in a shorter period, and an ex-neo-Nazi and Yugoslav Wars mercenary and war criminal Jackie Arkl√∂v, who assumed responsibility for the shooting of the two policemen, had written a letter to NSF's partition. The National Socialist Front was sometimes focussed on media because of outward activities such as demonstrations and fly-spreading. NSF's former uniform was abolished before the 2006 election and then a blue T-shirt with yellow text was often used on which it was called \\"NSF\\". The previous uniforms included: black military-like cap, party logo tags on the arms, black long-sleeved sweater, beige combat pants and optional black boots. Among the propaganda party spread there was an extensive sale of white power products, including CDs, via the Internet.  Party program  The organization was hierarchically structured with a central management and subgroups. The action program showed that the organization worked for, among other things, national self-sufficiency, repatriation of all overseas immigrants, establishing a state race control to \\"secure the mental and biological health of the Nordic race\\" as well as state control of mass media. The overall objective was to \\"pave the way for a national socialist power access\\" and then abolish democracy. The National Socialist Front would introduce a people's government under the Nordic leadership and responsibility principle, consisting of expert representatives selected within the various professions, which would only serve the people in the country of birth. Even the death penalty for serious sexual offenses and treason was included in the program. The organizationion wanted Sweden to exit from the European Union and the United Nations. The party also wanted to abolish the aid to communist states and dictatorships. Dissolution The National Socialist Front was officially dissolved on 22 November 2008. A new party, the People's Front (\\"Folkfronten\\"), was founded at the same time with the same people in charge. The People's Front was later reconstituted as the Party of the Swedes which ran in the 2010 and 2014 general elections and received about 1,000 votes in the 2014 election to the European Parliament, before being dissolved the following year.

The first volume was released in February 1999 by DJ Nick Warren. Since volume seven, the albums have borne the subtitle \\"A personal collection for after-hours grooving\\". Back to Mine was published by the Disco Mix Club, but ended the series with Volume 28. The artwork for Volumes 6‚Äì19 and 25‚Äì28 were produced by London-based artist Tommy Penton. Back to Mine returned in 2019 to celebrate their 20th anniversary with Nightmares on Wax. The album was released on 25 January 2019.

Howe Building The C.D. Howe Building (French: √âdifice C.D.-Howe) is an office tower in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, that is the home of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, the Office of the Auditor General and other smaller tenants. It was built by Olympia and York. The federal government sold the land to O&Y; for a dollar and signed an agreement to lease the final building for a set rate until 2012. The eleven-story building was opened in 1978.  Description  It was named after C. D. Howe, a noted federal minister in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. It is located at the prominent intersection of Bank Street and Sparks Street. The lower levels of the building contain a shopping mall named 240 Sparks. The mall covers 3 floors with 50 stores including a Holt Renfrew store (closed 2015). The most notable element of the building's interior is the amount of greenery and the large waterfall. Public Works and Government Services greened the rooftop to address environmental concerns including energy conservation, storm water management, biodiversity, and air quality, and to provide the occupants a landscaped tranquil outdoor space. More than 30% of the roof is landscaped and grows indigenous flowers, grasses and shrubs. Another 30% of the rooftop uses green roof technology. The C.D. Howe Building was included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa in both 2012 and 2014.http://ottawa.ca/doorsopen Doors Open Ottawa The two elevator banks contain two storey tall cars that rise in a large atrium that stretches the entire height of the building. The C.D. Howe Building was recognized by the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) as the \\"Government Office Building of the Year - Canada\\" in 1997/98 for excellence in management. The award was presented to the Property Manager, Ronald Vadeboncoeur RPA, FMA, CPM in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Overview Gerhard Gentzen is the founder of proof-theoretic semantics, providing the formal basis for it in his account of cut-elimination for the sequent calculus, and some provocative philosophical remarks about locating the meaning of logical connectives in their introduction rules within natural deduction. The history of proof-theoretic semantics since then has been devoted to exploring the consequences of these ideas. Dag Prawitz extended Gentzen's notion of analytic proof to natural deduction, and suggested that the value of a proof in natural deduction may be understood as its normal form. This idea lies at the basis of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, and of intuitionistic type theory. His inversion principle lies at the heart of most modern accounts of proof-theoretic semantics. Michael Dummett introduced the very fundamental idea of logical harmony, building on a suggestion of Nuel Belnap. In brief, a language, which is understood to be associated with certain patterns of inference, has logical harmony if it is always possible to recover analytic proofs from arbitrary demonstrations, as can be shown for the sequent calculus by means of cut-elimination theorems and for natural deduction by means of normalisation theorems. A language that lacks logical harmony will suffer from the existence of incoherent forms of inference: it will likely be inconsistent.

The resulting \\"hybrid\\" is a general-purpose bike that can tolerate a wide range of riding conditions and applications. Their stability, comfort and ease of use make them popular with novice cyclists, casual riders, commuters, and children. Hybrids typically borrow the flat, straight handlebars and upright seating posture of a mountain bike, which many bicyclists find comfortable and intuitive. Hybrids also employ the lighter weight, thinner wheels and smooth tires of road bikes, allowing for greater speed and less exertion when riding on the road. Hybrid bikes often have places to mount racks and bags for transporting belongings, much like a touring bike. Hybrid bikes have spawned numerous sub-categories satisfying diverse ridership. They are classified by their design priorities, such as those optimized for comfort or fitness -- and those offered as city, cross or commuter bikes. History From the early 20th century until after World War II, the utility roadster constituted most adult bicycles sold in the United Kingdom and in many parts of the British Empire. In Britain, the roadster declined noticeably in popularity during the early 1970s, as a boom in recreational cycling caused manufacturers to concentrate on lightweight (23-30 lb.), affordable derailleur sport bikes, actually slightly-modified versions of the racing bicycle of the era. In the 1980s, U.K. cyclists began to shift from road-only bicycles to all-terrain models such as the mountain bike. The mountain bike's sturdy frame and load-carrying ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual U.K. bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, almost all of them were mountain and road/sport models. A different situation, however, was occurring in most Asian countries: roadsters are still widely made and used in countries such as China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and others as well in parts of north- western Europe. Trekking bike Lightweight trekking bike A trekking bike is a hybrid with all the accessories necessary for bicycle touringmudguards, pannier rack, lights etc. Cross bike Cross bikes use a road bicycle frame similar to a racing or sport/touring bicycle, and are normally equipped with nearly flat handlebars to provide a more upright riding position than a racing or sport/touring bike. As a hybrid bike intended for general recreational and utility use, the cross bike differs from the cyclo-cross bicycle, which is a racing bicycle purposely designed to compete in the sport of cyclo-cross competition. Cross bikes are fitted with 700c (ISO 622) wheels using somewhat wider semi-treaded tires () than those fitted to most racing or sport/touring models. The additional tire width and tread is intended to give the cross bike hybrid some ability to deal with rough or littered surfaces that might be encountered on paved or unpaved bike trails, such as gravel, leaves, hard- packed sand, and shallow mud. Most cross bikes are biased towards moderate off-pavement use and light weight, and as such are not normally fitted with fenders, lights, or carrier racks. The larger 700c wheels are a little faster on paved surfaces and can give an advantage for longer trips or for touring purposes. Commuter bike The commuter bike is a hybrid designed specifically for commuting over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, 700c wheels with fairly light tires, a carrier rack, full fenders, and a frame with suitable mounting points for attachment of various load-carrying baskets or panniers. It sometimes, though not always, has an enclosed chainguard to allow a rider to pedal the bike in long pants without entangling them in the chain. A well-equipped commuter bike typically features front and rear lights for use in the early morning or late evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day. City bike Giant Innova is an example of a typical 700c hybrid city bicycle. Similar to the commuter bike, the city bike is more optimized for urban commuting. Unlike the European city bike, it has mountain bike heritage, gearing, and strong yet lightweight frame construction.Howells, Bob, and Lehrer, John, A City Bike Sampler, Outside Magazine (March 1992), Vol. 17, pp. 88-91Mellion, Morris B., Sports Medicine Secrets, Elsevier Health Sciences, 3rd ed. (2003), , , p. 552Museum of Mountain Bike Art & Technology Article It usually features mountain bike- sized 26-inch (ISO 559) wheels, a more upright seating position, and \\"middleweight\\" heavy belted tires designed to withstand road hazards commonly found in the city, such as broken glass.Howells, pp. 88‚Äì91 Using a sturdy welded chromoly or aluminium frame derived from the mountain bike, the city bike is more capable at handling urban hazards such as deep potholes, drainage grates, and jumps off city curbs. City bikes are designed to have reasonably quick, yet solid and predictable handling, and are normally fitted with full fenders for use in all weather conditions. A few city bikes may have enclosed chainguards, others may have suspension forks, similar to mountain bikes. City bikes may also come with front and rear lighting systems for use at night or in bad weather. Comfort bike Giant brand Sedona comfort bike on the Pinellas Trail in Dunedin, Florida. Trek Navigator 200 comfort bike Another subclass of the hybrid category is the comfort bike. Comfort bikes are essentially modern versions of the old roadster and sports roadster bicycle, though modern comfort bikes are often equipped with derailleur gears rather than hub gears. They typically have a modified mountain bike frame with a tall head tube to provide an upright riding position, 26-inch (ISO 559) or 28-inch (ISO 622) wheels, and \\"middleweight\\" smooth or semi-slick tires. Comfort bikes typically incorporate such features as front suspension forks, seat post suspension with wide plush saddles, and drop-center, angled North Road-style handlebars designed for easy reach while riding in an upright position.

The colobium sindonis (Latin for \\"shroud tunic\\") is a simple sleeveless white linen shift worn by British Monarchs during part of the Coronation service. It symbolises divesting oneself of all worldly vanity and standing bare before God. Following the anointing in the coronation service, the colobium sindonis is placed over the monarch's clothes, and then the supertunica, a long robe of gold brocade, is placed over that. Wearing these garments, the monarch is invested with the regalia, crowned and enthroned. Both garments are removed before the final procession out of the abbey. Both of these robes are of very ancient design; those used by the medieval kings of England were said to have been used by King Edward the Confessor at his coronation in 1043, however these were destroyed by the Parliamentarians after the English Civil War.Gosling pp. 42-43 In modern times, a new colobium sindonis has been made for each coronation.

Micronations: The Lonely Planet Guide to Home-Made Nations described Atlantium in 2006 as \\"a refreshing antidote to the reactionary self-aggrandisement of so many micronations\\", and \\"an extremely sophisticated nation-state experiment, as well as an entirely serious claimant to legitimate statehood\\". The book's entry on Atlantium notes its espousal of \\"progressive, liberal policies\\" and characterises it as a \\"secular humanist utopia\\". Among the causes Atlantium supports are the right to unrestricted international freedom of movement, the right to abortion, the right to assisted suicide and decimal calendar reform. In 2015, the micronation had almost 3,000 \\"citizens\\", most of whom signed up online from over a hundred countries, and have never been to Atlantium. History Atlantium was established in 1981 by three Sydney teenagers ‚Äì George Francis Cruickshank, Geoffrey John Duggan and Claire Marie Coulter (n√©e Duggan). The three claimed a \\"provisional territory\\" in the southern suburb of Narwee as Atlantium's first capital, and declared Cruickshank to be Sovereign Head of state, with the title \\"Emperor George II\\". Geoffrey Duggan was elected as Prime minister in 1982, serving until 1986. Damian Scott held the position from 1986 to 1988 and Kevin Fanucchi became Prime Minister in 1988, but by 1990, when the original group members had graduated from university and moved away, the group ceased to be active. In 1999 Cruickshank purchased an apartment in the inner Sydney suburb of Potts Point, and soon after revived Atlantium, launching a website, which was instrumental in attracting new members. The apartment, known as the Imperium Proper, became the second capital of Atlantium. Concordia became the third capital of Atlantium on 12 January 2008, when the rural Province of Aurora, approximately southwest of Sydney, was created. The Atlantium website describes Aurora as Atlantium's \\"global administrative capital, ceremonial focal point and spiritual homeland\\". Status and operations The Atlantium website used several different self-descriptions, including \\"self-declared state\\", \\"aspirant microstate\\" and \\"global sovereign state\\". In line with its claim to be a \\"primarily non-territorial\\" state Atlantium does not maintain any formal territorial claims; however, it does promote the idea that Cruickshank's apartment, and the Province of Aurora, have extraterritorial status. In practice these properties remain under Australian jurisdiction. No established nation had recognised Atlantium's sovereignty claims, and it had no reciprocal diplomatic relations. Atlantium had appointed \\"unaccredited diplomatic representatives\\" called \\"Imperial Legates\\" in the United States, Pakistan, Poland, Brazil, India, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Serbia and Switzerland. The group had awarded \\"Imperial Honours\\" to various recipients, generally in recognition of political activism or for service to local communities. Stamps, coins and banknotes Stamps, coins and banknotes were sold by Atlantium, which used a decimal currency system of 100 imperial centi to the imperial solidus. Atlantium's website claimed that the profits from those sales are used for \\"the Empire's ongoing operations\\" as well as charitable causes. The earliest documented media report referring to Atlantium is a 1984 philatelic magazine article about its cinderella stamp releases. There were 12 issues of Atlantian stamps. Atlantium minted coins, though the levels of Atlantian economic activity remained low. The first coin was the 20th anniversary 10 solidi coin, which has a likeness of George Cruickshank as the obverse and the imperial eagle as the reverse. In 2011, a 30 solidi coin was issued to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Atlantium. The coin had the likeness of George Cruickshank on the obverse and the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) on the reverse and was struck in cupronickel and plated with 9 carat gold. Banknotes of Atlantium were denominated in imperial solidi (10, 25, 50 and 100 imperial solidi) and are currently divided into a 2006 series and a 2007 series.Banknotes of the Empire of Atlantium Numismondo (www.numismondo.net). Retrieved on 14 February 2013. Citizenship , Atlantium had almost 3,000 citizens from (and still therein residing due to the small area of the Empire of Atlantium) over 100 countries. The website names individuals holding such functions as minister, director, magister and imperial legate. Atlantium said its citizenship does not supersede existing citizenships. Atlantians contend that they are all dual citizens, and that Atlantium actively encourages its citizens to participate in the political processes of their resident countries. In late 2016, Atlantium stopped accepting citizenship requests according to a reply posted on the official Facebook page. On 1 January 2018 the citizen application process was re- opened, charging a US$25 fee.

That is, v is conjugate to u if f(z):=u(x,y)+iv(x,y) is holomorphic on \\\\Omega. As a first consequence of the definition, they are both harmonic real-valued functions on \\\\Omega. Moreover, the conjugate of u, if it exists, is unique up to an additive constant. Also, u is conjugate to v if and only if v is conjugate to -u. Description Equivalently, v is conjugate to u in \\\\Omega if and only if u and v satisfy the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations in \\\\Omega. As an immediate consequence of the latter equivalent definition, if u is any harmonic function on \\\\Omega\\\\subset\\\\R^2, the function u_y is conjugate to -u_x, for then the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations are just \\\\Delta u=0 and the symmetry of the mixed second order derivatives, u_{xy}=u_{yx}. Therefore, a harmonic function u admits a conjugated harmonic function if and only if the holomorphic function g(z):=u_x(x,y)-iu_y(x,y) has a primitive f(z) in \\\\Omega, in which case a conjugate of u is, of course, \\\\mathrm{Im} f(x+iy). So any harmonic function always admits a conjugate function whenever its domain is simply connected, and in any case it admits a conjugate locally at any point of its domain. There is an operator taking a harmonic function u on a simply connected region in \\\\R^2 to its harmonic conjugate v (putting e.g. v(x0)=0 on a given x0 in order to fix the indeterminacy of the conjugate up to constants). This is well known in applications as (essentially) the Hilbert transform; it is also a basic example in mathematical analysis, in connection with singular integral operators. Conjugate harmonic functions (and the transform between them) are also one of the simplest examples of a B√§cklund transform (two PDEs and a transform relating their solutions), in this case linear; more complex transforms are of interest in solitons and integrable systems. Geometrically u and v are related as having orthogonal trajectories, away from the zeroes of the underlying holomorphic function; the contours on which u and v are constant cross at right angles. In this regard, u+iv would be the complex potential, where u is the potential function and v is the stream function. Examples For example, consider the function : u(x,y)=e^x \\\\sin y. Since : {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial x } = e^x \\\\sin y, \\\\quad {\\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial x^2} = e^x \\\\sin y and : {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial y} = e^x \\\\cos y, \\\\quad {\\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial y^2} = - e^x \\\\sin y, it satisfies : \\\\Delta u = abla^2 u = 0 (\\\\Delta is the Laplace operator) and is thus harmonic. Now suppose we have a v(x,y) such that the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations are satisfied: : {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial x} = {\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial y} = e^x \\\\sin y and : {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial y} = -{\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial x} = e^x \\\\cos y. Simplifying, : {\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial y} = e^x \\\\sin y and : {\\\\partial v \\\\over \\\\partial x} = -e^x \\\\cos y which when solved gives : v = -e^x \\\\cos y + C. Observe that if the functions related to u and v were interchanged, the functions would not be harmonic conjugates, since the minus sign in the Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations makes the relationship asymmetric. The conformal mapping property of analytic functions (at points where the derivative is not zero) gives rise to a geometric property of harmonic conjugates. Clearly the harmonic conjugate of x is y, and the lines of constant x and constant y are orthogonal. Conformality says that contours of constant u(x,y) and v(x,y) will also be orthogonal where they cross (away from the zeroes of f‚Ä≤(z)). That means that v is a specific solution of the orthogonal trajectory problem for the family of contours given by u (not the only solution, naturally, since we can take also functions of v): the question, going back to the mathematics of the seventeenth century, of finding the curves that cross a given family of non-intersecting curves at right angles. Harmonic conjugate in geometry There is an additional occurrence of the term harmonic conjugate in mathematics, and more specifically in projective geometry. Two points A and B are said to be harmonic conjugates of each other with respect to another pair of points C, D if the cross ratio (ABCD) = ‚Äì1.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1988, and again from 1990 to 2007. Conrado as his family and friends called him, had three children: Evelyn Santos, Conrad Santos and Robert Santos. The son of Federico Santos and Marcelina de Regla, he was born in the Philippines and was educated at Harvard University and the University of Michigan, receiving a PhD in Political Science from the latter institution. He moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1965 after receiving a teaching position at the University of Manitoba, where he retired from in 2008. Santos has also worked as a consultant for the Instituto Centro-Americano de Administracion Publica in Costa Rica, and was a board member of the Citizenship Council of Manitoba from 1977 to 1980. He sought the New Democratic Party of Manitoba (NDP) nomination for Fort Garry in the 1973 election, but was defeated. He ran for the Winnipeg City Council in 1977 and 1980, but lost both times. Santos was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1981 provincial election as a New Democrat in the northwest Winnipeg riding of Burrows, defeating NDP-turned-Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Ben Hanuschak. He was re-elected in the 1986 election. In June 1984, there were unconfirmed rumours that he was considering a move to the Progressive Conservative Party.\\"Santos says he will run again\\", Free Press Weekly, 17 April 1986, p. 8. Santos lost the Burrows NDP nomination to Doug Martindale in 1988, and subsequently entered the party's leadership election. He was not regarded as a prominent candidate, and received only five votes on the first ballot. He ran for mayor of Winnipeg in 1989, and finished a distant fourth. In 1990, Santos won the NDP nomination for Broadway by a single vote over Marianne Cerilli, whose candidacy was supported by the party leadership. He defeated Liberal incumbent Avis Gray in the 1990 general election, and was re-elected in the 1995 election. In 1995, he endorsed Lorne Nystrom's bid to lead the federal NDP. When the Broadway riding was eliminated by redistribution in 1999, Santos won the NDP nomination in Wellington (also in Winnipeg's northwest), and was returned by a wide margin in the 1999 provincial election. He was again re-elected in the 2003 election. Santos was named Deputy Speaker after the elections of 1986 and 1999. Santos left the New Democratic Party caucus shortly before the 2007 provincial election after being accused of improperly selling party membership cards. He campaigned as an independent, and finished last in a field of five candidates. He later pleaded guilty to paying the membership fees of as many as one hundred new party members, during the time when he was trying to retain his nomination. He was fined $200 under the provincial Election Finances Act, as well as court fees of $150. His lawyer argued that Santos was simply trying to help his low- income supporters, saying that the MLA \\"didn't have the heart\\" to request membership fees from people who were unable to feed their families.Mike McIntyre, \\"Former MLA's career comes to an end with guilty plea\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 7 March 2008, A7.

Description South American fur seals have a dark grey or brown coat of fur. Adult males are much larger than females, with thicker necks and larger shoulders. Males also develop manes of longer guard hairs on their neck and shoulders.Marine Mammals > Species: Arctocephalus australis (South American fur seal) Size of the seals varies based on region, but on average, adult males measure up to 2 m long and weigh 150‚Äì200 kg and females measure up to 1.5 m long and weigh 30‚Äì60 kg.South American Fur Seal, Arctocephalus australis at MarineBio.org Newborns are 60 to 65 cm and 3.5 to 5.5 kg. Distribution and habitat The South American fur seal is found on neotropical ocean coasts from the Paracas Peninsula of southern Peru south to Cape Horn on the Pacific coast, and northward to southern Brazil on the Atlantic coast. They are also found on the Falkland Islands, Staten Island, and Escondida Island.ADW: Arctocephalus australis: Information A. australis seals prefer rocky shores and islands, particularly those with steep slopes. They have been found in sea caves in Peru, where some climb up to 15 m to find a spot to rest. There have been isolated records from continental Ecuador, the Gal√°pagos Islands, and the Gorgona Island (Colombia).

Amundsen Gulf is a gulf located mainly in the Inuvik Region, Northwest Territories, Canada with a small section in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut.Amundsen Gulf, Nunavut It lies between Banks Island and Victoria Island and the mainland. It is approximately in length and about across where it meets the Beaufort Sea. Satellite Image of Amundsen Gulf, looking bright blue before thaw The Amundsen Gulf was explored by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen between 1903 and 1906. The gulf is at the western end of the famous Northwest Passage, a route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. Few people live along the shores of the gulf, but there are a few towns and communities, including Sachs Harbour, Ulukhaktok, and Paulatuk. Heading north in the gulf one would find the Prince of Wales Strait. Heading southeast and east, the gulf leads through the Dolphin and Union Strait, past Simpson Bay and into the Coronation Gulf. From there one would go through the Dease Strait and into the Queen Maud Gulf, and eventually head northeast into the Victoria Strait. Heading west and northwest a traveller would first enter the Beaufort Sea and then the Arctic Ocean. The entire gulf is in the Arctic tundra climate region, characterized by extremely cold winters. In late winter the Amundsen Gulf is covered in sea ice.

Common land is land owned collectively by a number of persons, or by one person, but over which other people have certain traditional rights, such as to allow their livestock to graze upon it, to collect wood, or to cut turf for fuel.Natural England . A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner. This article deals mainly with common land in Great Britain. Although the extent there is much reduced due to enclosure of common land from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century, a considerable amount of common land still exists, particularly in upland areas, and there are over 7,000 registered commons in England alone. Common land or former common land is usually referred to as a common; for instance, Clapham Common or Mungrisdale Common. Origins Modern-day pannage, or common of mast, in the New Forest Conjectural map of a mediaeval English manor. The part allocated to \\"common pasture\\" is shown in the north- east section, shaded green. Originally in medieval England the common was an integral part of the manor, and was thus part of the estate held by the lord of the manor under a feudal grant from the Crown or a superior peer, who in turn held his land from the Crown which owned all land. This manorial system, founded on feudalism, granted rights of land use to different classes. These would be appurtenant rights, that is the ownership of rights belonged to tenancies of particular plots of land held within a manor. A commoner would be the person who, for the time being, was the occupier of a particular plot of land. Some rights of common were said to be in gross, that is, they were unconnected with tenure of land. This was more usual in regions where commons are more extensive, such as in the high ground of Northern England or on the Fens, but also included many village greens across England and Wales. Most land with appurtenant commons rights is adjacent to the common or even surrounded by it, but in a few cases it may be some considerable distance away. Historically Manorial courts defined the details of many of the rights of common allowed to manorial tenants, and such rights formed part of the copyhold tenancy whose terms were defined in the manorial court roll. Example rights of common are: * Pasture. Right to pasture cattle, horses, sheep or other animals on the common land. The most widespread right. * Piscary. Right to fish. * Turbary. Right to take sods of turf for fuel. * Common in the Soil. This is a general term used for rights to extract minerals such as sands, gravels, marl, walling stone and lime from common land. * Mast or pannage. Right to turn out pigs for a period in autumn to eat mast (beech mast, acorns and other nuts). * Estovers. Right to take sufficient wood for the commoner's house or holding; usually limited to smaller trees, bushes (such as gorse) and fallen branches.New Forest explorers guide.UK government. On most commons, rights of pasture and pannage for each commoner are tightly defined by number and type of animal, and by the time of year when certain rights could be exercised. For example, the occupier of a particular cottage might be allowed to graze fifteen cattle, four horses, ponies or donkeys, and fifty geese, whilst the numbers allowed for their neighbours would probably be different. On some commons (such as the New Forest and adjoining commons), the rights are not limited by numbers, and instead a marking fee is paid each year for each animal turned out.Forest rights. However, if excessive use was made of the common, for example, in overgrazing, a common would be stinted,Susan Jane Buck Cox - \\"No tragedy on the Commons\\" Journal of Environmental Ethics, Vol 7, Spring 1985 that is, a limit would be put on the number of animals each commoner was allowed to graze. These regulations were responsive to demographic and economic pressure. Thus rather than let a common become degraded, access was restricted even further. The Lord of the Manor must only exercise his rights so far as to leave a \\"sufficiency\\" of resource for commoners. This was at Issue in 1889 when the Lord of the Manor and owner of Banstead Downs and Heath, a Mr Hartopp, excavated gravel and threatened to reduce the available pasture. The meaning of sufficiency was challenged in court, expert witnesses stated that the grazing capacity was 1200 animals, the commoners rights totaled 1440 animals, and 600 animals were normally turned out. It was decided sufficiency was whether enough grazing would be available for all the animals that could be turned out. The judgement was that \\"The Lord is bound to leave pasture enough to satisfy the commoners rights whether such rights are to be exercised or not\\". Commoners also have the right to \\"peaceful enjoyment\\" of their rights, so that they cannot be hindered by the Lord of the Manor. This was first proposed in 1500 and became case law in 1827.A guide to the Law of Commons. Ian Campbell LLB. Open Spaces Society 1971 Types of common Snake's head fritillary, North Meadow, Cricklade. This is grazed as Lammas common land. View of the Scafell massif from Yewbarrow, Wasdale, Cumbria. In the valley are older enclosures and higher up on the fell-side are the parliamentary enclosures following straight lines regardless of terrain. =Pasture commons= Pasture commons are those where the primary right is to pasture livestock. In the uplands, they are largely moorland, on the coast they may be salt marsh, sand dunes or cliffs, and on inland lowlands they may be downland, grassland, heathland or wood pasture, depending on the soil and history. These habitats are often of very high nature conservation value, because of their very long continuity of management extending in some cases over many hundreds of years. In the past, most pasture commons would have been grazed by mixtures of cattle, sheep and ponies (often also geese). The modern survival of grazing on pasture commons over the past century is uneven. =Arable and haymeadow commons= Surviving commons are almost all pasture, but in earlier times, arable farming and haymaking were significant, with strips of land in the common arable fields and common haymeadows assigned annually by lot. When not in use for those purposes, such commons were grazed. Examples include the common arable fields around the village of Laxton in Nottinghamshire, and a common meadow at North Meadow, Cricklade. =Lammas rights= Lammas rights entitled commoners to pasture following the harvest, between Lammas day, 12 August (N.S.), to 6 April, even if they did not have other rights to the land. Such rights sometimes had the effect of preventing enclosure and building development on agricultural land. Enclosure and decline Most of the medieval common land of England was lost due to enclosure. In English social and economic history, enclosure or inclosure is the process which ends traditional rights such as mowing meadows for hay, or grazing livestock on common land formerly held in the open field system. Once enclosed, these uses of the land become restricted to the owner, and it ceases to be land for the use of commoners. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (enclosed) and deeded or entitled to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to large areas of rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small residual parcels of land in the lowlands. Enclosure could be accomplished by buying the ground rights and all common rights to accomplish exclusive rights of use, which increased the value of the land. The other method was by passing laws causing or forcing enclosure, such as Parliamentary enclosure. The latter process of enclosure was sometimes accompanied by force, resistance, and bloodshed, and remains among the most controversial areas of agricultural and economic history in England. Enclosure is considered one of the causes of the British Agricultural Revolution. Enclosed land was under control of the farmer who was free to adopt better farming practices. There was widespread agreement in contemporary accounts that profit making opportunities were better with enclosed land. Following enclosure, crop yields and livestock output increased while at the same time productivity increased enough to create a surplus of labour. The increased labour supply is considered one of the factors facilitating the Industrial Revolution. Following the era of enclosure, there was relatively little common land remaining of value although some residual commoners remained until the end of the Second World War. By that time lowland commons had become neglected because the commoners were able to find better- paid work in other sectors of the economy. As a result they largely stopped exercising their rights; relatively few commoners exist today. Modern use Much common land is still used for its original purpose. The right to graze domestic stock is by far the most extensive commoners right registered, and its ongoing use contributes significantly to agricultural and rural economies. Rights to graze sheep are registered on 53% of the Welsh and 16% of the English commons. Cattle are registered on 35% of Welsh and 20% of English commons, whilst horses and ponies are registered on 27% of Welsh and 13% of English commons. In some cases rights to graze goats, geese and ducks are registered, whilst in others the type of livestock is not specified. These figures relate to the number of common land units, and due to discrepancies in the registers and large numbers of small commons with no rights in England, the apparent distinction between Wales and England may be exaggerated. Today, despite the diverse legal and historical origins of commons, they are managed through a community of users, comprising those who hold rights together with the owner(s) of the soil. Such communities generally require joint working to integrate all interests, with formal or informal controls and collaborative understandings, often coupled with strong social traditions and local identity. However, 26% of commons in Wales, and as many as 65% in England, have no common rights shown on the registers. Such areas are derived from wastes of manors, where rights probably existed formerly. When such open habitats are no longer grazed they revert to scrub and then dense woodland, losing the grassy or heathland vegetation which may have occupied the land continuously for many centuries. In 2007 Ashdown Forest, the Sussex heathland which was the setting for the Winnie-the-Pooh stories, became the centre of a dispute between some local residents and the Forest's governing body, the Board of Conservators, which is responsible for administering the Forest's of common land. The Conservators wished to restore the Forest's landscape to one that predominantly consisted of heathland‚Äîits defining characteristic until the mid-twentieth century, but something that was in danger of being lost after the Second World War as a result of the advance of woodland into traditional heathland areas when, as one commentator stated.. The Conservators were forced to intervene to stem the invasion of trees, scrub and bracken that threatened the ecologically precious heathlands, cutting down saplings, removing scrub and mowing the bracken. Some residents complained that the results looked like a First World War battle field. This is not a problem restricted to this common, but according to Jonathan Brown writing in the Independent on 21 April 2007 \\"similar debates are raging between locals and the authorities at other heathland areas in the New Forest and Surrey\\". In 2008 the Foundation for Common Land was created in the UK to try to enhance the understanding and protection of commons.[Bathe, Graham \\"Common Land\\" .Pitkin. 2015] Governing law in England and Wales The legal position concerning common land has been confused, but recent legislation has sought to remedy this and remove the legal uncertainties so that commons can be better used and protected. Most commons are based on ancient rights under British common law, which pre-date statutes passed by the Parliament of England. The exact usufruct rights which apply to individual commons were in some cases documented, but more often were based on long-held traditions. A major reform began in 1965, with a national register of common land which recorded the land ownership and the rights of any commoners, and two other important statutes have followed. Owners of land in general have all the rights of exclusive ownership, to use the land as they wish. However, for common land the owner's rights are restricted, and other people known as commoners have certain rights over the land. The landowner may retain other rights to the land, such as rights to minerals and large timber, and to any common rights left unexercised by the commoners. The commoners will continue to exercise their rights, or have a document which describes their rights, which may be part of the deeds of another property. A number of commoners still exercise rights, for example, there are 500 practising commoners in the New Forest, and there is a federation of commoners in Cumbria.Federation of Cumbrian Commoners website ‚Äì retrieved Nov 2014 [Cumbria http://www.cumbriacommoners.org.uk/commons- councils ] In many cases commons have no existing commoners, the rights having been neglected. =Erection of Cottages Act 1588= There was a belief that if an Englishman or woman could‚Äîbetween sunrise and sunset in a single day‚Äîbuild a house on common land, raise the roof over their head and light a fire in the hearth, then they would have the right of undisturbed possession.Harrison. The Common People. p. 135 The belief‚Äîsometimes called \\"keyhole tenure\\", and which persisted as recently as the early 20th century‚Äîwas actually a fallacy, but to stop landless peasants unlawfully squatting on commons, an act known as the Erection of Cottages Act 1588 (31 Eliz c. 7, long title \\"An Act against the erecting and maintaining of Cottages\\"), was introduced.Basket. Statutes at Large. p. 664 =Commons Act 1876= Under the Commons Act 1876 some 36 commons in England and Wales were regulated. The act also enabled the confirmation of Orders providing for the inclosure of common land or common fields. =Commons Act 1899= The Commons Act 1899 provides a mechanism of enabling district councils and National Park authorities to manage commons where their use for exercise and recreation is the prime consideration and where the owner and commoners do not require a direct voice in the management, or where the owner cannot be found. There are at least 200 schemes of management made under the 1899 act. =The Law of Property Act 1925= The Law of Property Act 1925, which still forms the core of English property law, has two provisions for common land: * Section 193 gave the right of the public to \\"air and exercise\\" on Metropolitan commons and those in pre-1974 urban districts and boroughs. This constituted about one fifth of the commons, but the 1925 Act did not give this right to commons in essentially rural areas (although some urban districts had remarkably rural extent, such as the Lakes Urban District), which had to wait for the 2000 CROW Act. * Section 194 restricted the inclosure of commons, which would now require Ministerial consent. =Commons Registration Act 1965= The UK government regularised the definitions of common land with the Commons Registration Act 1965,Commons Registration Act 1965, UK. which established a register of common land. Not all commons have owners, but all common land by definition is registered under 1965 Commons registration Act, along with the rights of any commoners if they still exist. The registration authorities are the County Councils, and when there is no ownership, a local council, such as a parish council is normally given guardianship by vesting the property under the Act (section 8). An online database of registered common land was compiled by DEFRA in 1992‚Äì93 as part of a survey of the condition and wildlife of commons. The official up to date Registers of common land are held by the Commons Registration Authorities. The following registration information is held:Cumbria CC website 2014 * Land Section This includes a description of the land, who applied to register the land, and when the land became finally registered. There are also related plans which show the boundaries of the land. * Rights Section This includes a description of the rights of common (e.g. a right to graze a certain number of sheep), the area of common over which the right is exercisable, the name of the holder of the right and whether the right is attached to land in the ownership of the holder of the right (the commoner) or is a right held in gross i.e. unattached to land. * Ownership Section This includes details of the owner(s) of the common land. Entries in this section however, are not held to be conclusive. Numerous inconsistencies and irregularities remained, mainly because a period of only 3 years was given for registration submissions. However, there is now an opportunity to clear these up under the 2006 Act, and to add land omitted under the 1965 act.Defra , UK. =Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW)= Other than for those commons covered by the Law of Property Act 1925, the Commons Act 1899 and certain other statutes, the public did not have the right to use or enjoy common land if they were not a commoner. However, the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 gave the public the Freedom to roam freely on all registered common land in England and Wales. The new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced, and are available online as \\"open access maps\\" produced by Natural England. Commons are included in the public access land now shown on the Ordnance Survey Explorer Maps. =Commons Act 2006= The Commons Act 2006 is an important recent piece of legislation. The Act: * Enables commons to be managed more sustainably by commoners and landowners working together through commons councils with powers to regulate grazing and other agricultural activities * Provides better protection for common land and greens ‚Äì this includes reinforcing existing protections against abuse, encroachment and unauthorised development * Recognises that the protection of common land has to be proportionate to the harm caused and that some specified works can be carried out without the need for consent * Requires commons registration authorities to bring their registers up-to-date by recording past changes affecting the registers during a 'transitional period', and to keep the registers up-to-date by recording new changes affecting the registers ‚Äì commons registration authorities will have new powers to correct many of the mistakes in the registers * Sets out new, clearer criteria for the registration of town or village greens * Prohibits the severance of rights of common grazing, preventing commoners from selling, leasing or letting their rights away from the property to which rights are attached, though temporary severance of such rights is permitted for renewable terms of up to two years (in England) and five years (in Wales).[Natural England \\"Commons Toolkit\\" NE 285] Several hundred square kilometres of 'waste land' that was provisionally registered under the Commons Registration Act 1965 was not, in fact, finally registered. As a consequence, it ceased to be recognised as common land. A partial remedy for this defect in the earlier legislation is provided by the Commons Act 2006. Under Schedule 2(4) to the Act, applications that failed to achieve final registration under the 1965 Act may, in certain circumstances, be reconsidered ‚Äì offering, in effect, a second chance for the land to be confirmed ('re-registered') as common. Land that is re-registered in this way will enjoy the special legal protection afforded to common land. It will also become subject in due course to the public right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000; or depending on location, may qualify as a section 193 'urban' common (in which case, it would also be subject to a right of access for horse-riders).Open Spaces Society website retrieved Nov 2014 ‚Äì section on the Commons Act 2006 =Fencing= windmill on Wimbledon Common. The act of transferring resources from the commons to purely private ownership is known as enclosure, or (especially in formal use, and in place names) Inclosure. The Inclosure Acts were a series of private Acts of Parliament, mainly from about 1750 to 1850, which enclosed large areas of common, especially the arable and haymeadow land and the better pasture land. The maintenance of fences around a common is the responsibility of the occupiers of the adjacent enclosed land, not (as it would be with enclosed land) the responsibility of the owners of the grazed livestock. This can lead to difficulties where not all adjacent occupiers maintain their fences properly. However the fencing of land within a registered common is not allowed, as this is a form of enclosure and denies use of the land to others. A celebrated landmark case of unauthorised fencing of a common was in 1866 by Lord Brownlow who illegally enclosed 434 acres of Berkhamsted Common to add to his Ashridge Estate. Brownlow had failed to buy out the commoners, so resorted to this action. A public outcry followed, and the Commons Preservation Society found a champion in Augustus Smith who had the inclination and the money to act, and himself held commons rights. Smith hired 120 navvies armed with hammers, chisels and crowbars, who on the night of 6 March 1866, under the aegis of the newly formed Commons Preservation Society (now the Open Spaces Society), felled to the ground two miles of iron railings. Soon after, local people flocked in. Lord Brownlow took action against Augustus Smith and the court case lasted until 1870 when it ended with the complete vindication of Smith. =Controls on development= Development of common land is strictly controlled. The government states that common land should be open and accessible to the public, and the law restricts the kind of works that can be carried out on commons. HM Planning Inspectorate is responsible for determining applications under the 2006 Act regarding common land in England, and several other pieces of legislation regarding commons and greens. All applications are determined on behalf of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Under section 38 of the Commons Act 2006, you need consent to carry out any restricted works on land registered as common land under the Commons Registration Act 1965. Restricted works are any that prevent or impede access to or over the land. They include fencing, buildings, structures, ditches, trenches, embankments and other works, where the effect of those works is to prevent or impede access. They also include, in every case, new solid surfaces, such as for a new car park or access road. =Boards of Conservators and Commons Councils= Some commons are managed by Boards of Conservators for the wider public benefit. However, for areas where these are not established, or an improved system is required, the Commons Act 2006Commons Act 2006, UK. provides for the establishment of Commons Councils to manage common land.How is Common Land managed? , Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, UK. The Standard Constitution Regulations relating to commons councils were formally approved in April 2010, and Commons Councils are most likely to be useful where they can improve current management practices. This may be where commons are in agricultural use, but where it can be difficult to reach agreement on collective management. Commons Councils are voluntary and can be established only where there is substantial support among those with interests in the land, such as; the Commoners (especially those who actively exercise their rights); owners and other legal interests. Commons Councils enable decisions to be made by majority voting, so relieving the burden of trying to reach unanimous decisions. They will have the power to make rules about agricultural activities, the management of vegetation, and the exercise of common rights, which are binding on all those with interests on a common. =Roadways= A parliamentary enclosure road near Lazonby in Cumbria. The roads were made as straight as possible, and the boundaries much wider than a cart width to reduce the ground damage of driving sheep and cattle. Commons are often crossed by unfenced public roads, and this leads to another problem on modern pasture commons where grazing survives (or is to be reintroduced). Historically, the roads would have been cart-tracks, and there would have been no conflict between their horse-drawn (or ox-drawn) traffic and the pastured animals, and no great difficulty if pastured animals wandered off the common along the roads. However, these roads now have fast motorised traffic which does not mix safely with animals. To continue (or restore) grazing, such roads may need fencing or at least blocking at the edge of the common with cattle grids ‚Äì however fencing a common is reminiscent of the process of enclosure, historically fatal to its survival, and permission for fencing on a common is a strictly controlled process within the UK planning system. Public roads through enclosed common land were made to an accepted width between boundaries. In the late eighteenth century this was at least , but from the 1790s this was decreased to , and later as the normal maximum width. The reason for these wide roads to was to prevent excessive churning of the road bed, and allow easy movement of flocks and herds of animals.Transforming Fell and Valley, Ian Whyte. Published by Centre for North West regional Studies, University of Lancaster 2003 Finland and Sweden  A partition unit is a corporation that owns common land. In this case, the land is not state-owned or in joint-ownership under a trust, but is owned by a definite partition unit, a legal partnership whose partners are the participating individual landowners. Common lands and waterways owned by a partition unit were created by an agreement where certain land was reserved for the common use of all adjacent landowners. For the most part, this was due to the Great Partition (Swedish: storskiftet, Finnish: isojako), which started in 1757 and was largely complete by the 1800s. Earlier, the land of a village was divided into narrow stripes of farmland for each to own, with the remainder commonly owned, and work on the land was collective. In the Great Partition, villages were organized as corporations termed partition units (Swedish: skifteslag, Finnish: jakokunta), and land was divided into large chunks that were divided among the households (commoners) for individual cultivation and habitation. Land or waterways that remained undivided was kept by the partition unit as commons, owned by the partition unit. Later, Gustaf III claimed the yet unclaimed forest for the Crown ‚Äì this was the origin of the large forest holdings of the state in Sweden and Finland. Today, partition units are a common way of owning waterways. Ireland In Ireland, commonage () is a holding held by two or more persons in specified shares or jointly and originally purchased from the Irish Land Commission under the Land Purchase Acts (1885 and 1903). Traditionally, tenants on large estates rented their land from the landlord. The farm consisted of an enclosed parcel of land and permission to use nearby unenclosed land belonging to the landlord. In many areas access unenclosed land (the \\"hill\\") was vital as it allowed the tenant to keep livestock and gain a cash income. There are over 4,500 commonages in Ireland, with 11,000‚Äì14,000 farmers having grazing rights. of commonage is currently grazed, mostly in counties Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Donegal, Kerry and Wicklow. It is generally used for grazing sheep in upland areas. Overgrazing in the 1980s and 1990s led to damage to hill areas and river banks; numbers are now limited. In Gaelic Ireland, prior to the Norman-English conquest of Ireland (begun in the 12th century AD, not complete until the late 16th century), land was owned by tribes. A portion of the tribe's territory, known as the Fearan Fine (\\"tribe's quarter\\") was held in common by the entire tribe. This was generally low-quality land, used for grazing pigs and cattle, and was leased to tribe members for a year at a time. Scotland Commoning has probably existed in Scotland for over a millennium. However, there is no modern legislation relating to commons which formally identifies the extent of common land or clarifies the full range of rights. The right of turbary ‚Äì the ability to cut peat as fuel ‚Äì clearly exists in large parts of Scotland, whilst the scale of such rights, and the extent to which they are utilised, remain unknown. The main work undertaken on Scottish commons concerns grazing, using a pragmatic definition, where such commons were defined as pastures with multiple grazing rights and/or multiple graziers. There are seven main historic types of common land in Scotland, some of which have similarities to common land in England and Wales. =Commonties= The overwhelming majority of areas of common land in lowland Scotland and the Highland fringes were commonties. A commonty is an area of land where the rights of property or use are shared by two or more neighbouring (though not necessarily adjacent) landowners. They are not therefore truly 'common' land in the sense that anyone can use them, and this distinction meant that it was often very easy for commonties to be divided between landowners after a series of Acts permitting this were passed by the Parliament of Scotland in the 17th century, most notably the 1695 Act for the Division of Commonties. As a result, the number of commonties declined very rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries. =Common mosses= Common mosses were areas of bog where the right to dig peat for fuel were shared by neighbouring landowners. They are therefore similar to commonties and most commonties included a common moss. However the difficulties of dividing such wet areas meant that they were left out of many commonty divisions and many common mosses may still survive, un-noticed because of the decline of peat-cutting. =Run rig= Run rig is a system of agriculture involving the cultivation of adjacent, narrow strips of raised land (rigs). Traditionally adjacent rigs would be used by different farmers and the rigs were periodically re-allocated between them. The system was common throughout Scotland until the 18th century, but survived longer in the Western Highlands, where runrig was often associated with an adjacent area of common hill grazing which was also shared by the same farmers as the runrig. =Scattalds= Scattalds are unique to Shetland and are based on udal law, rather than the feudal law that predominated in the rest of Scotland. However, Scattalds are very similar to commonties and many were divided under the same 1695 Act that allowed for the division of commonties. =Crown Commons= Crown Commons were areas of land held directly by the crown and therefore the common rights that could be used were rights of use rather than rights of property. Unlike commonties, the rights to use crown commons (for example for grazing livestock) were available to anyone, not just the neighbouring landowners. There are no crown commons left in Scotland; those that survived into the 20th century were taken over by the Crown Estate. =Greens and loans= Greens were small areas of common land near a settlement where livestock could be kept overnight, markets held and other communal activities carried out. Sometimes they were adjacent to drovers' roads near river crossing points or overnight accommodation. Most were genuinely common land with only the Crown holding any title to them. A loan was a common route through private property allowing access to an area of common land or other public place. As the traditional uses of greens and loans declined, they were often absorbed by the neighbouring landowners. =Burgh commons= Burgh commons were areas of common land where property rights or privileges of use were held by the burgh for their inhabitants. They could include any of the other six types of common land and were sometimes shared with landowners outside the burgh. By the early 19th century, most burgh commons had been appropriated by the wealthy landowners who dominated burgh councils, and very few have survived. United States Common land, an English development, was used in many former British colonies, for example in Ireland and the United States. The North American colonies adopted the English laws in establishing their own commons. Famous examples include the Boston Common in Massachusetts and the New Haven Green in New Haven, Connecticut, some of the oldest commons in the United States.

The curandero's life is dedicated to the administration of remedies for mental, emotional, physical and spiritual illnesses. The role of a curandero can also incorporate the roles of psychiatrist along with that of doctor and healer. Some curanderos, such as Don Pedrito, the Healer of Los Olmos, make use of simple herbs, waters, and even mud to effect their cures. Others add Catholic elements, such as holy water and pictures of saints. The use of Roman Catholic prayers and other borrowings and lendings is often found alongside native religious elements. Many curanderos emphasize their native spirituality in healing while being practicing Roman Catholics. Curanderos are often respected members of the community. Believers consider their powers to be supernatural and think that many illnesses are caused by lost malevolent spirits, a lesson from God, or a curse. History in Latin America The term curanderos can be traced back to the Spanish colonization of Latin America. Curanderos in this part of the world are the result of the mixture of traditional Indigenous medicinal practices and Catholic rituals. There was also an influence from African rituals brought to Latin America by slaves. The term stems from the Spanish word for \\"to heal\\", curar. Curanderos go beyond Western medicine, linking illness with evil spirits. This extends a curandero's duties to cover not only physical ailments but also psychological and interpersonal issues. Traditional communities see all of these issues as a loss of spirit. They believe that the curanderos can enter different dimensions where they are able to find the solutions to a person's illness or problem. Furthermore, they believe that God or the Higher Creator gives curanderos difficult and painful experiences so that they are better able to assist their patients. In Colonial Latin America, female folk healers, or curanderas, were often conflated with brujas (witches), which refers to those who cast spells; although curanderas were persecuted during such times, it is likely because they were females in positions of authority, not because of their healing methods. Today many women and men continue the curandero tradition in Mexico and the southwestern United States. History in the United States Historically, in the United States, curanderos were only found in concentrated Amerindian populations. It was largely thought that Curanderos mainly practiced along the US/Mexico border. Recent historical research shows however that the practice of Curanderismo was not relegated to the American Southwest. The practice of Curanderismo was prevalent in the 1880s in Northeastern Tennessee. In the mid- to late 1970s the rise in ethnic minority and immigrant populations grew in tandem with the public presence of curanderos in areas outside of the historical geographic regions of the United States which had large Indigenous populations. Since the 1990s, it has become more commonplace to see curanderos in northern-tier cities in the United States. Types There are many different types of curanderos. Yerberos are primarily herbalists. Hueseros are bone and muscle therapists who emphasize physical ailments. Parteras are midwives. Oracionistas work primarily through the power of prayer. Other types include sobadors, who are masseurs, and brujas, who are witches. Among these broader terms there are several subspecialties. For instance, yerberos who work primarily with tobacco to heal patients are known as tabaqueros. Healers who work primarily with ayahuasca are known as ayahuasqueros. Healers who work with peyote are known as peyoteros. Although many curanderos do have a specialty and may identify with it, that does not mean that these healing modalities are necessarily strict and do not overlap. As an example, an oracionista may also be a yerbera, and so on. Further information The Moche people of ancient Peru often depicted curanderos in their art.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. The Spirit of Ancient Peru: treasures from the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Rafael Larco Herrera. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1997. In the Andes, one of the instruments of the curandero is the chonta, a lance carved from the chonta palm, Bactris gasipaes, thought to be imbued with magical powers. The palm grows only in the Amazon basin and is the object of a brisk commerce. The Jivaro people of the Amazon Rainforest use the hardwood of the chonta to carve their spears.Karsten, Rafael. Blood, Revenge, War and Victory Feasts Among the Jibara Indians of Eastern Ecuador. Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2004. . Page 6. The shaman is also known as chonteador, and his most important wand is the chonta defensa; if he dies without disciples, the chonta is thrown, wrapped in rubands and weighted with stones, to the bottom of a lake with the belief that its power will reemerge when a new shaman will take office. The shamans also use wands of huatulco wood, Loxopterygium huasango.M.

The two widely recognized variations of the kunai are short kunai (Â∞èËã¶ÁÑ° sh≈ç-kunai) and the big kunai (Â§ßËã¶ÁÑ° dai-kunai). Although a basic tool, in the hands of a martial arts expert, the kunai could be used as a multi-functional weapon. The kunai is commonly associated with the ninja, who used it to gouge holes in walls. Many popular manga characters use kunai as both their primary and secondary weapons.  Design  The kunai was conventionally wrought in lengths ranging from 20 cm to 30 cm. It was used by peasants as a multi-purpose gardening tool and by workers of stone and masonry. The blade is made of soft iron, and is left unsharpened because the edges are used to smash relatively soft materials such as plaster and wood, for digging holes and for prying. Normally, only the tip is sharpened. A Kunai normally had a leaf-shaped blade and a handle with a ring on the pommel for attaching a rope. The attached rope allowed the kunai's handle to be wrapped to function as a grip, or to be strapped to a stick as a makeshift spear; to be tied to the body for concealment; to be used as an anchor or piton, and sometimes to be used as the Chinese rope dart. Contrary to popular belief, kunai were not designed to be used primarily as throwing weapons. Instead, kunai were primarily tools and, when used as weapons, were stabbing and thrusting implements. Varieties of kunai include short, long, narrow-bladed, saw-toothed, and wide-bladed. In some cases, the kunai and the shikoro, a wide-bladed saw with a dagger-type handle, are difficult to distinguish.  Uses  = Weapon = Many ninja weapons were adapted from farming tools, not unlike those used by Shaolin monks in China. Since kunai were cheaply produced farming tools of a useful size and weight and could be easily sharpened, they were readily available to be converted into simple weapons. As a weapon, the kunai is larger and heavier than a shuriken and with the grip could also be used in hand-to-hand combat more readily than a shuriken. = Climbing = In addition, it could be used for climbing, either as a kind of grappling hook or as a piton.  Popular culture  As with ninjutsu, the exaggeration persistent in ninja myths played a large role in creating the popular culture image of kunai. In fictional depictions of ninjas, the kunai is commonly portrayed as a steel knife that is used for stabbing or particularly throwing, sometimes confusing it with the shuriken.

Jerome was one of the chief followers of Jan Hus and was burned for heresy at the Council of Constance. Early life Jerome was born in Prague, Kingdom of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) in 1379 and graduated from the Charles University of Prague in 1398. He later studied at Oxford University where he first became familiar with the reformist teachings of John Wycliffe. He was a philosopher, theologian, university professor, and church reformer who dedicated his life to eradicate those church doctrines and dogmas he found to be corrupt. He was constantly in and out of jail.Bernard, Paul P. \\"Jerome of Prague, Austria and the Hussites\\". Church History. 27.1 (1958), p. 7. His radical ideas eventually brought about his death by execution as a heretic to the church, but made him a martyr for the Protestant Reformation and followers of Jan Hus (known as Hussites). He was well-educated and spent most of his life traveling, trying to incite religious reform in various cities. It was for his criticisms rather than heresy that he was martyred.. Early life and education Jerome spent time teaching at the universities of Paris, Cologne, and Heidelberg, but was accused of heresy at all these universities and forced to return to Bohemia. He spent much of his life traveling about various universities, but frequently returned to Bohemia where he was virtually safe from any prosecution. He earned popular renown, as his rhetoric and oratory skills were acclaimed and often roused the public into demonstrations against the church, although they sometimes ended badly. He secured, in 1399, permission to travel. In 1401 he returned to Prague, but in 1402 visited England, where, at Oxford University, he copied out the Dialogus and Trialogus of John Wycliffe, and thus evinced his interest in Lollardry. He became an ardent and outspoken advocate of realism and, thereafter, of Wyclifism; charges of which were constantly getting him into trouble. In 1403 he went to Jerusalem, in 1405 to Paris. There he took his master's degree, but Jean Gerson drove him out. In 1406 he took the same degree at the University of Cologne, and a little later at the University of Heidelberg. He was no safer in Prague, where he returned and where, in 1407, he took the same degree. In that year he returned to Oxford, but was again compelled to flee. During 1408 and 1409 he was in Prague, and there his pronounced Czech preferences aroused opposition to him in some quarters. Early in January 1410, he made a cautious speech in favour of Wycliffe's philosophical views, and this was cited against him at the Council of Constance four years later. In March 1410, a Papal Bull against Wycliffe's writings was issued, and on the charge of favouring them, Jerome was imprisoned in Vienna, but managed to escape to Moravia. For this he was excommunicated by the bishop of Krak√≥w. Returned to Prague, he appeared publicly as the advocate of Hus. Popular legend attributes to Jerome leadership of a protest in which papal bulls were first strung around the neck of a prostitute in a cart and then carried to the pillory in Prague to be publicly burned, but the leader was actually Wok of Waldstein. Middle life and teachings Scutum fidei Christianae\\" diagram Jerome tended to teach radical ideas pertaining to Roman Catholic doctrine, namely that God‚Äôs teachings were directly accessible to a Christian without need for the church or church officials. He taught that one should obey the direct teachings of Jesus, even when they conflicted with those of the Catholic Church. He was largely a follower of the ideologies of both church reformers John Wyclif and Jan Hus.Bernard, Paul P. Jerome of Prague, Austria and the Hussites. Church History. 27.1 (1958): 3. As his teachings were contrary to those of the Roman Catholic Church, he was constantly on the run from authorities. Hus, although much less disruptive in his approach, was a mentor for Jerome. Jerome incited public demonstrations in Paris, Vienna, Prague, and everywhere in between; most of these demonstrations took place in cities with universities where Jerome taught. Teaching at universities allowed Jerome to reach a broad audience. In Krak√≥w, he was publicly examined as to his acceptance of the forty-five articles which the enemies of Wyclif had made up from Wyclif's writings and which they asserted represented Wyclif's heretical teachings. Jerome declared that he rejected them in their general tenor. Trial and death Jerome of Prague being dragged to prison, 1870 illustration When, on 11 October 1414, Hus left for the Council of Constance, Jerome assured him that if needed, he would come to his assistance, contrary to the wishes of Hus. Hus was tricked into attending the Council of Constance by means of a letter promising immunity, and upon his arrival in the city he was arrested and imprisoned. Jerome kept his promise, even though Hus and other friends of Jerome warned him not to come. On 4 April 1415, he arrived at Constance. Predictably, he created a stir in the town. As he had, unlike Hus, come without a safe-conduct, Jerome's friends persuaded him to return to Bohemia. But on his way back he was arrested in Hirschau on 20 April and taken to Sulzbach, where he was imprisoned, and was returned to Constance on 23 May. He was immediately arraigned before the council on the charge of fleeing a citation. The humanist Poggio Bracciolini , present in those days in Constance, left a direct testimony of Girolamo's trial and execution, through a letter in Latin addressed to Leonardo Bruni on the same day as he was sentenced to the stake. \\"Conducted in public and commanded to respond to each accusation, for a long time he refused to answer, stating that he would first clarify his position rather than respond to the specific accusations made by his opponents [...] But deny him this possibility, so he said below: \\"What iniquity is this, which for a good 340 days I have been in a very hard prison, in a thousand ugliness, in the filth, in the stocks, in the lack of everything, while you have always listened to my accusers and detractors, and \\"Now do you not want to listen to me for an hour? Having given them an audience for so long, they have persuaded you that I am a heretic, an enemy of faith and a persecutor of the church. You have judged in your minds that I am a wicked man, before having could have known which man I really am.But I remind you that you are men, not gods, you are mortal, not immortal, you can spend, err, be deceived and seduced [...] \\" But having been repeatedly interrupted by the clamor and noise of many, in the end it was decided in the Council that Girolamo mainly replied on the errors of which he was accused, and that he was then granted the faculty of being able to speak as much as he wanted [...] \\" The accusations of being a detractor of the papacy and of the Roman pope , enemy of the cardinals, persecutor of the prelates and of the clergy and enemy of the Christian religion, rejected the doctrinal orthodoxy on the doctrine of the Eucharist , and he was insulted with titles of hypocrite and donkey. The hearing was postponed three days later, he was allowed to speak: he remembered the fate of Socrates, Plato's imprisonment, the tortures suffered by Anaxagoras and Zeno, the death of Boethius and the condemnations of John the Baptist, of Christ and of saint Stephen. \\"But being the whole weight of the cause placed on the witnesses of the prosecution, with many reasons he showed that they should not be trusted, showing that they had said all those things not for the sake of truth but out of hatred, malevolence and envy [...] They were the minds of the surrounding contracted and bent almost to mercy [...]\\".Poggio Bracciolini Letter of Poggio to Leonardo Aretino, S.

Everyone was waiting for him to admit and retract his errors and ask for forgiveness but \\"in the end he began to praise a certain John Hus, who had been condemned to the stake and said he had been a good man, just, holy and not worthy of that death. Prepared with a strong and constant mind to support any suspicion rather than giving in to his enemies, to those false witnesses, who will not be able to lie before God, when they will have to give an account of things said. The pain of the surrounding was great and everyone wished he was spared death, if he really had been sincere. Girolamo, persevering in his convictions, praised that Giovanni and confirmed that he had never heard him say anything against the state of the church of God, but against the perverse customs of the clerics, against the arrogance and pomp of the prelates, also devastators of church property. Since the assets of the churches had to be distributed first to the poor, then to the pilgrims and to the church factory, it was not worthy to spend them with prostitutes, at banquets, in horses, in dogs, in pumping clothes and in so many other unworthy things of the religion of Christ\\". He was still given two days to confess his alleged faults; after which, on May 30, 1416, it was judged a heretic by the Council and condemned to the stake. \\"To whom he came with a playful forehead and with a happy face, not frightened by fire, not by torments, not by death, and there was never any stoic who, like him, sustained death with such a strong and constant heart. When he arrived at the place of torture, he stripped himself of his clothes and, kneeling down, greeted the pole to which he was then tied with many ropes and was tightened, naked, with a chain. After much wood had been placed around his chest and kidneys, mixed with straw, and fire was set, Girolamo began to sing a certain hymn, which was interrupted by smoke and flames\\". John Foxe's Book of Martyrs (1563) His condemnation was predetermined in consequence of his open acceptance of the heretical views and ideas of Wyclif, especially on the Eucharist, and his open admiration for Hus and his doctrines. Refusing to recant those beliefs, the Council used the conditions of imprisonment to coerce Jerome to recant his heresies. In public sessions of the council on 11 and 23 September 1415 Jerome abjured his heresies and renounced Wyclif and Hus. In letters to the king of Bohemia and the University of Prague, he declared that he had become convinced that Hus had been rightfully burned for heresy. (Hus had been burned at the stake while Jerome was imprisoned.) However, he remained imprisoned as the Council rightly doubted the sincerity of his recantation. On 23 May 1416, and on 26 May, he was again brought before the Council in order for them to ascertain the truth of his abjuration. On the second day he withdrew his recantation, and as a result, having 'again fallen' back into heresy, he was condemned by the Council and handed over to the secular authorities to be burned. Subsequently, Jerome was claimed as a martyr of the Hussites and adopted by later protestants such as John Foxe to demonstrate a historical 'past' for the new denominations of the sixteenth century Protestant Reformation.\\"Jerome of Prague\\" profile, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Academic Edition, ibid.

Emblem The station's badge features a vertical sword through a crown. The motto is Defend and Strike. Facilities Extending over an area of 3,875 hectares, which includes 3,100 hectares of intertidal mudflats and 775 hectares of salt marsh, the air weapons range provides facilities for RAF and NATO-allied aircraft to practice dropping bombs and firing their aircraft weapons, including pre-deployment training. Since 1993 this has included night bombing and helicopter operations. The range facilities are not only used by air force squadrons stationed in the United Kingdom but also fly over directly from airbases located throughout Europe. An assortment of range targets, 8 in total, include several retired merchant ships which have been beached on the sands of The Wash for this purpose. Observation towers parallel to the target line are manned and allow the fall of aircraft ordnance to be calculated for accuracy by means of triangulation. The range includes a helicopter landing pad near the main control tower and since 2010 a new range headquarters building. At the present time aircraft types such as the Tornado GR4, Eurofighter Typhoon, F-35B Lightning II (No. 617 Squadron RAF), USAF F-15 Eagle/F-15E Strike Eagle (from 48th Fighter Wing), Hawk TrainerVideo Footage: July 2013 - showing aircraft Tornado GR4 and Hawk Trainer aircraft practicing at RAF Holbeach Bombing Range. and AgustaWestland Apache AH1 helicopters can be seen operating on the range at various times of the day, including on occasions CV-22B Osprey (from 7th Special Operations Squadron), HH-60G Pave Hawk (from 56th Rescue Squadron), Chinook, Merlin and Puma HC helicopters.Video Footage: March 2013 - F-15Es, Apache & Tornado aircraft practicing over RAF Holbeach Bombing Range. The range also hosts frequent Forward Air Control (FAC) or Joint Terminal Attack Controller (JTAC) exercises. =Strafing= F-15E aircraft seen over the range RAF Holbeach also has facilities for scoring strafing runs. The strafing targets are a number of three-metre square net with an orange bullseye made by weaving plastic strips through the chicken-wire net. The Strafe Scoring detects the X-Y position of the projectile from the acoustic signature of the supersonic shock wave. This result is sent by radio to the control tower, where it is displayed to the Air Traffic Controller for relaying to the pilot. The range also has semi- automatic bomb and rocket scoring systems.

Music Written in E major, the melody uses the pentatonic scale and alternates between flute and oboe. Unusually, the climax occurs early in the piece at the first forte which signifies the sun breaking through.Edvard Grieg (1843‚Äì1907) Vol. 4: Peer Gynt Suites; Orchestral Songs, Naxos Records, liner notes by Bjarte Engeset The time signature is and the tempo instruction is Allegretto pastorale. It is orchestrated for flutes, oboes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, and string section. A performance takes about four minutes. Setting The piece depicts the rising of the sun during act 4, scene 4, of Ibsen's play, which finds Peer Gynt stranded in the Moroccan desert after his companions took his yacht and abandoned him there while he slept. The scene begins with the following description: \\"Dawn. Acacias and palm trees. Peer [Gynt] is sitting in his tree using a wrenched- off branch to defend himself against a group of monkeys.\\" As the Peer Gynt suites take their pieces out of the original context of the play, \\"Morning Mood\\" is not widely known in its original setting, and images of Grieg's Scandinavian origins more frequently spring to the minds of its listeners than those of the desert it was written to depict.

Although used as a bomber station during the Second World War, RAF Honington is now the RAF Regiment depot. History =Royal Air Force use= Construction of Honington airfield, which was undertaken by John Laing & Son, began in 1935, and the facility was opened on 3 May 1937.Ritchie, p. 91 Squadrons of RAF Bomber Command using the airfield prior to the Second World War were: * No. 77 Squadron RAF (Hawker Harts and Vickers Wellesleys) (July 1937 ‚Äì July 1938) * No. 102 Squadron RAF (Handley Page Heyford) (July 1937 ‚Äì July 1938) ‚Äì Moved to RAF Driffield * No. 75 Squadron RAF (Handley Page Harrow and Vickers Wellington) (July 1938 ‚Äì July 1939) ‚Äì Moved to RAF Stradishall. * No. 215 Squadron RAF (Harrow and Wellington) (July 1938 ‚Äì July 1938) ‚Äì Moved to RAF Bassingbourn. * IX Squadron (Wellington Mk Is, later changing to Mk lAs.) (4 September 1939 ‚Äì 1940). IX Squadron flew the first RAF bombing raid of the Second World War on 4 September 1939 flying a mission against the Kriegsmarine in the Baltic resulting in the loss of two Wellingtons. The squadron lost 79 Wellingtons flying from Honington before moving to RAF Waddington. In July 1940, No. 311 (Czech) Squadron RAF formed at Honington with Wellingtons, later moving to RAF East Wretham in November 1940. The Luftwaffe made several attacks on the airfield one of which killed about twenty airmen who were crossing the old parade ground on their way to tea. Another bomb demolished part of Barrack Block 76, which was rebuilt between 1993 and 1996. In 1941, a Junkers Ju 88 was shot down by ground fire from Honington. The aircraft crashed at the east end of E Hangar. Then, in May of that year, a Wellington returning from a night trip attempted to land at Honington with its wheels retracted. It skidded to one side and crashed into the main bomb dump where it burst into flames. Group Captain J. A. Gray and Squadron Leader J. A. McCarthy, the station medical officer, were the first on the scene of the crash. Both entered the burning aircraft in an attempt to rescue the crew who were trapped and, between them, two crew-members were saved. For this gallantry, both officers were awarded the George Medal.London Gazette Issue 35270 published on 9 September 1941. Page 1 =United States Army Air Forces use= left In June 1942, the airfield was transferred to the USAAF and was upgraded to a Class A Bomber base. Honington was assigned USAAF designation Station 375. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Honington were: * 314th Service Group : 467th Service Squadron; HHS 314th Service Group * 18th Weather Squadron * 68th Station Complement Squadron * 9th Depot Repair Squadron * Headquarters (Western Base Section) Regular Army Station Units included: * Headquarters & Headquarters Battery (386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion) * 386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery AW Battalion * 386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion * 1097th Signal Company * 1178th Quartermaster Company * 1221st Military Police Company * 1599th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 2017th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon 1st Strategic Air Depot Under USAAF control, an additional facility, called Troston, was constructed to the west of the main airfield as a specialized air depot for the repair of badly- damaged B-17 Flying Fortress bombers and supporting the 3d Bomb Division located in the area. Badly damaged Fortresses were often instructed to crash land at Honington on return from operations, particularly if their landing gear could not be lowered, as this avoided the necessity to dismantle and transport the aircraft from its home base for repair. 364th Fighter Group left In addition to the air depot, Honington also housed an operational fighter unit when the 364th Fighter Group took up residence at Honington in February 1944, arriving from Santa Maria AAF, California. The group was under the command of the 67th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the 364th were identified by a blue/white stripe pattern around their cowlings. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 383d Fighter Squadron (N2) * 384th Fighter Squadron (5Y) * 385th Fighter Squadron (5E) The 364th FG flew escort, dive-bombing, strafing, and patrol missions in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany. At first, the group operated primarily as escort for B-17/Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. The group patrolled the English Channel during the Normandy invasion in June 1944, and, while continuing escort operations, supported ground forces in France after the invasion by strafing and bombing locomotives, marshalling yards, bridges, barges, and other targets. Converted from Lockheed P-38 Lightnings to North American P-51 Mustangs in the summer of 1944 and from then until the end of the war flew many long-range escort missions heavy bombers that attacked oil refineries, industries, and other strategic objectives at Berlin, Regensburg, Merseburg, Stuttgart, Brussels, and elsewhere. The 364th received a Distinguished Unit Citation for an escort mission on 27 December 1944 when the group dispersed a large force of German fighters that attacked the bomber formation the group was escorting on a raid to Frankfurt. The 364th also flew air-sea rescue missions, engaged in patrol activities, and continued to support ground forces as the battle line moved through France and into Germany. Took part in the effort to invade the Netherlands by air, September 1944; the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 ‚Äì January 1945; and the assault across the Rhine, March 1945. Although the last mission by the 364th took place on 25 April 1945, the group did not depart until November, returning to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, for inactivation. Even then, Honington remained the lone Eighth Air Force outpost in the UK becoming Fighter Command HQ on 5 October.leftHonington was the last USAAF station to be returned to the RAF. By the beginning of 1946, the airfield remained the only active station which had been used by the Eighth Air Force and a fitting ceremony was planned to mark its closure and official handing back to the Royal Air Force. On 26 February, Brigadier General Emil Kiel ‚Äì the Eighth Fighter Command commander ‚Äì was present to hand over the keys of the station to Air Marshal Sir James Robb, AOC RAF Fighter Command. An RAF band played The Star-Spangled Banner as the Stars and Stripes were lowered for the RAF Ensign to be hoisted in its place. The airfield, which was the first transferred to the United States Army Air Forces for its use in 1942, was the last to be returned to the Air Ministry. =Back to Royal Air Force control= With the departure of the USAAF in February 1946, Honington airfield was returned to the RAF. It became a major servicing centre for RAF Transport Command aircraft. During the Berlin Airlift, RAF Honington played a major role in keeping the aircraft of Transport Command flying. In 1949, the station reverted to Bomber Command. From 1950 to 1956, RAF Honington housed No. 94 Armament Maintenance Unit for bomb storage. The airfield was upgraded during this time to include a 9,000 ft concrete runway. English Electric Canberra bomber squadrons, 10, XV, 44, and 57 were based at RAF Honington from February 1955 to 1957. 10 and XV Squadrons took part in the Suez Crisis of 1956. In 1956, RAF Honington also became one of the main V bomber bases maintaining three Vickers Valiant squadrons, Nos, 7, 90, and 199. Later Handley Page Victor Squadrons, 55 and 57 were added. New facilities were constructed including a large East-West runway. These squadrons left in 1965 and the airfield was placed in reserve for conversion to accommodate the new General Dynamics F-111 fleet. While in reserve, Honington Married Quarters were used to accommodate evacuees from the Aden Emergency in 1967, as recorded in the book \\"From Barren Rocks to Living Stones\\". In the event, the F-111 never entered service with the RAF, and in 1968, the airfield became the UK base for the RAF's Hawker Siddeley (Blackburn) Buccaneer bomber. The first aircraft arrived in November 1969 and deliveries continued throughout the early 1970s. Nos. 12, 15 and 16 squadrons were formed. 15 and 16 squadrons moved to RAF Laarbruch in West Germany in 1971. These were followed by No. 237 OCU (Operational Conversion Unit) which was formed when the RAF took over Buccaneer training from the Royal Navy, then finally 208 and briefly 216 squadrons. Panavia Tornado GR1 of No. 45 Squadron otherwise known as the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit. The station was then selected to become a base for the RAF's Panavia Tornado fleet with the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit (TWCU) established there in 1981. The UK-based Buccaneer fleet (12, 208, and 237 OCU) were relocated to RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland. In August 1982 IX(B) Squadron reformed at RAF Honington, becoming the world's first operational Tornado squadron, with the squadron's equipment including the WE.177 nuclear laydown bomb. IX Squadron relocated to RAF Bruggen in Germany in 1986, leaving the TWCU (which had acquired the \\"shadow\\" designation of No. 45 Squadron in 1983) was the sole occupant until XIII Squadron formed there in January 1990. At this time only one RAF Regiment Sqn was based at Honington, 20 Sqn. Their equipment was sent to the Gulf via Hercules aircraft from RAF Lyneham. = RAF Regiment Depot = On 15 July 1992, it was announced that the Tornados would depart Honington and that the station would relinquish its primary flying role and become the RAF Regiment Depot. As a result, the TWCU moved to Lossiemouth (to replace the Buccaneers) in November 1993. Honington ceased to be a flying station on 1 February 1994 when No. 13 Squadron relocated to RAF Marham. RAF Honington became the RAF Regiment Depot in June 1994, when RAF Catterick in North Yorkshire, home of the existing depot, closed. RAF Honington became the home to 611 Volunteer Gliding Squadron due to the closure of RAF Watton in April 2012, requiring their conversion to the Grob 109B Vigilant motor glider until the closure of that unit in 2016. During 2018, No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment moved to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, completing the move in September of that year. No. 20 Wing RAF Regiment (Defence Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Wing) disbanded on 1 April 2019 having been at Honington since 2011. The CBRN role was taken over by 28 Engineer Regiment of the British Army, with No. 27 Squadron RAF Regiment coming under the army's command.  Role and operations  RAF Honington's mission statement is \\"Delivering Air Force Protection Capability for the RAF and Defence\\". The station is the single hub for RAF Force Protection, incorporating the RAF Regiment Headquarters and the RAF Police Headquarters. Together they are responsible for protecting the RAF at home and abroad. The station is home to over 1,500 military personnel, civil servants and contractors. = Command = Group Captain Matt M Radnall MA RAF was appointed station commander of Honington in December 2018. Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, is Honorary Air Commandant. The station is under the command of No. 2 Group (Air Combat Support). = RAF Regiment = RAF Honington is home to three front-line RAF Regiment field squadrons. Through the RAF Force Protection Centre and RAF Regiment Training Wing, the station also provides initial and advanced training for members of the RAF Regiment and specialist training for the RAF's entire Force Protection capability. = RAF Police = The RAF Police is the service police branch of the Royal Air Force and Honington is home to the RAF Police Headquarters. It also accommodates No. 1 (Tactical) Police Squadron which provides field policing, and reserve unit No. 3 (Tactical) Police Squadron (Royal Auxiliary Air Force) which provides a general policing and aviation security capability.

The head of St. Edmund represents the nearby town of Bury St Edmunds which is approximately to the south east of the station, in whose coat of arms the representation is featured. The arrows in saltire, represent St. Edmund's martyrdom. The station's motto (Pro anglia valens) is in Latin and translates into English as Valiant for England. = Built heritage = The turret of a Pickett-Hamilton fort, fully raised and manned during the Second World War. Two Second World War era hardened field fortification survive within the airfield boundary. The Pickett-Hamilton forts were designated as scheduled monuments by English Heritage (now Historic England) in September 2002. The forts were constructed in late 1940 in order to provide ground defence for the airfield. A third example is thought to have been destroyed during redevelopment of the station after the war. The forts were designed to be lowered into the ground while not in use, as such they would be inconspicuous and would not interfere with the passage of taxiing aircraft or other vehicles. The forts could be raised to about above ground level where it would be a physical impediment to aircraft and vehicles and from where a small crew could fire with rifles or light machine guns. The examples at Honington are described by Historic England as having \\"importance as comparatively rare surviving examples of an unusual and innovative type of airfield defence installation. The outer structure and lifting heads of both remain in good condition, and the example which is in working order, with its principal internal fittings intact, is of particular interest.\\" Former units The following units were here at some point: See also * List of Royal Air Force stations *Royal Air Force Police *Royal Air Force Regiment References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Freeman, Roger A., Airfields of the Eighth, Then And Now, 1978 * Honington www.controltowers.co.uk * Honington mighty8thaf.preller.us * Maurer Maurer, Air Force Combat Units of World War II, Office of Air Force History, 1983 * Baugher, J USAAS-USAAC-USAAF-USAF Aircraft Serial Numbers‚Äî1908 to present * * External links * *Honington Herald ‚Äì RAF Honington station magazine * RAF Regiment Heritage Centre Category:Royal Air Force stations in Suffolk Category:Airfields of the VIII Fighter Command in Suffolk Category:Airports in England Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom Category:1937 establishments in England ","title":"RAF Honington"},{"id":"910569","text":"Kentucky Wesleyan College (KWC) is a private Methodist college in Owensboro, Kentucky.

The Inside Passage () is a coastal route for ships and boats along a network of passages which weave through the islands on the Pacific Northwest coast of the North American Fjordland. The route extends from southeastern Alaska, in the United States, through western British Columbia, in Canada, to northwestern Washington state, in the United States. Ships using the route can avoid some of the bad weather in the open ocean and may visit some of the many isolated communities along the route. The Inside Passage is heavily travelled by cruise ships, freighters, tugs with tows, fishing craft and ships of the Alaska Marine Highway, BC Ferries, and Washington State Ferries systems. The term \\"Inside Passage\\" is also often used to refer to the ocean and islands around the passage itself. Route It is generally accepted that the southernmost point of the Inside Passage is Olympia, Washington, which is also the southernmost point of Puget Sound. Moving north, the passage continues into the waters of the greater Salish Sea. It then passes through the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait, between northeastern Vancouver Island and the coast of mainland British Columbia. From there it continues further northwest into the Alaska Panhandle. During the Klondike Gold Rush the passage was one of the sea routes from Seattle and California, carrying American prospectors northward. Today, approximately 36,000 recreational cruising boats utilize portions of the Inside Passage route. [Brant Thornton/Mark Bunzel/Wagooneer. =Washington portion= Washington's portion of the route is made up almost entirely of the waterways of Puget Sound. Starting from the southernmost point of Budd Inlet, the waterway turns toward the northeast and broadens as it becomes the Nisqually Reach of Puget Sound. The waterway then continues northeast, though the Tacoma Narrows, northward toward the San Juan Islands just southeast of the border with Canada. =British Columbia portion= British Columbia's portion of the route includes the narrow, protected Strait of Georgia between Vancouver Island and the B.C. mainland, the Johnstone Strait and Discovery Passage between Vancouver Island and the mainland, as well as a short stretch along the wider and more exposed Hecate Strait near Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands). From Fitz Hugh Sound northwards, the route is sheltered from Pacific winds and waves by the various large islands in the area such as Princess Royal Island and Pitt Island. This section includes a series of channels and straits, from south to north: Fisher Channel, Lama Passage, Seaforth Channel, Milbanke Sound, Finlayson Channel, Sarah Passage, Tolmie Channel, Princess Royal Channel (includes Graham Reach and Fraser Reach), McKay Reach, Wright Sound, Grenville Channel, Arthur Passage, and Chatham Sound. =Alaska portion= A map of the Alaskan portion of the Inside Passage. Alaska's portion of the Inside Passage extends from north to south and from east to west. The area encompasses 1,000 islands and thousands of coves and bays. While the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska provides some protection from the Pacific Ocean weather, much of the area experiences strong semi-diurnal tides which can create extreme differences between high and low tide, so careful piloting is necessary in many places to avoid grounding. Lynn Canal is the northernmost waterway of the Inside Passage. Tourism The Inside Passage is a popular tourism destination. The coastal mountain ranges and islands offer wildlife viewing and opportunities for boating, fishing, kayaking, camping and hiking. Wildlife viewing in the region ranges from birding to whale watching and bear viewing. Designated bear viewing is available at Anan Creek near Wrangell and at Pack Creek Bear Sanctuary on Admiralty Island near Juneau. The most popular way to explore the Inside Passage during summer is by cruise ship. Over 2 million people take cruises each year in this region, impacting the local economy significantly. Because there are no restrictions on ship size, all of the large main line cruise ships offer Inside Passage itineraries. Some of the major players include Norwegian, Disney, Princess, Celebrity Cunard etc. Most of these cruises offer round-trips from either Vancouver or Seattle. Although a smaller industry, there are also a handful of expedition cruises that explore the Inside Passage. These ships tend to be smaller than main line cruises and focus more on wildlife watching. National Geographic operate several expedition boats here. 1994 Transit Fee Crisis During the salmon treaty negotiations in early 1994, Canada concluded that the United States was not responsive to Canada's urgent concerns. Accordingly, on June 15, 1994, Canada imposed a transit fee on all US commercial fishing boats using the Canadian Inside Passage, this fee was eventually lifted through bilateral negotiations. Fortunately, this crisis remained peaceful and there were no violent incidents between US fishing boats and Canadian enforcement officials. In response to the Canadian action, on October 24, 1995, the US Congress passed an amendment to the Fishermen's Protective Act, adding provisions permitting the U.S. government to directly reimburse US fishers for fines and other costs associated with illegal seizures by foreign governments. Cultural references British author Jonathan Raban described his journey by boat through the Inside Passage from Seattle to Juneau in his 1999 travelogue Passage to Juneau: A Sea and Its Meanings.

It was later adapted with an afterburner for supersonic designs, and in this form it was the world's first production afterburning turbofan, going on to power the F-111 and the F-14A Tomcat, as well as being used in early versions of the A-7 Corsair II without an afterburner. First flight of the TF30 was in 1964 and production continued until 1986. Design and development In 1958, the Douglas Aircraft Company proposed a short-range, four-engined jet airliner to fill the gap below its new DC-8 intercontinental, known internally as the Model 2067. Intended to be marketed as DC-9, it was not directly related to the later twin-engined Douglas DC-9.Connors 2010, p. 341 Pratt & Whitney (P&W;) had offered its JT8A turbojet for the airliner, but Douglas preferred to go with a turbofan engine, which would have a greater fuel efficiency than a turbojet. P&W; then proposed the JT10A, a half-scale version of its newly developed JT8D turbofan. Development of the new design began in April 1959, using the core of the JT8.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%200018.html TURBOFANS: A Survey of Current Airline Powerplants Douglas shelved the model 2067 design in 1960, as the targeted US airlines preferred the newly offered Boeing 727.Donald 1999, p. 609 In 1960, the United States Navy selected the JT10A, designated TF30-P-1, to power the proposed Douglas F6D Missileer, but the project was canceled in April 1961.AERO ENGINES 1962 Meanwhile, the TF30 had been chosen by General Dynamics for its entrant in the TFX competition for the United States Air Force and USN, which was selected for production as the F-111.Connors 2010, p. 346 The version of the TF30 for the F-111 included an afterburner. Operational history =F-111= A TF30-P-109 from an RAAF F-111 at Defence Force Air Show RAAF Amberley, October 2008 The F-111A, EF-111A and F-111E used the TF30-P-3 turbofan.F-111. Federation of American Scientists. The F-111 had problems with inlet compatibility, and many faulted the placement of the intakes behind the disturbed air of the wing. Newer F-111 variants incorporated improved intake designs and most variants featured more powerful versions of the TF30 engine. The F-111E was updated to use TF30-P-103 engines, the F-111D included the TF30-P-9/109, the FB-111A used the TF-30-P-7/107, and the F-111F had the TF30-P-100. The TF30 proved itself to be well-suited to the requirements of a high-speed low-altitude strike aircraft with a relatively long operational range, and F-111s in all guises would continue to use TF30s until their retirement. =A-7= In 1964, the subsonic LTV A-7A Corsair II won the US Navy's VAL competition for a light attack aircraft to replace the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk.Connors 2010, p. 347 The A-7A used a non-afterburning variant of the TF30, which would also power the improved A-7B and A-7C. In 1965, the USAF selected the A-7D as a replacement for its fast-jet F-100 and F-105 supersonic fighter-bombers in the close air support role. Though the USAF had wanted the TF30, Pratt & Whitney was unable to meet the production timetable because its facilities were already committed to producing other engines. Instead of producing the TF30 under license for P&W;, the Allison Engine Company offered its own TF41 turbofan, a license-built version of the RB.168-25R Spey, to the Air Force.http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%200025.html The more powerful TF41 was selected by the USAF for the A-7D, and by the USN for its similar A-7E. =F-14= A TF30-P-412A being prepared for installation in an F-14A Tomcat on board a carrier The Grumman F-14 Tomcat with the TF30-P-414A was underpowered, because it was the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of 1 lbf:1 lb or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon). However, due to the intent to incorporate as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant. The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA) if the throttles were moved aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or inverted spin, from which recovery was very difficult. The F-14's problems did not afflict TF30 engines in the USAF and RAAF F-111s to nearly the same extent. The F-111, while technically designated as a \\"fighter,\\" was actually used as a ground attack aircraft and tactical bomber. A typical ground strike mission is characterized by less abrupt changes in throttle, angle of attack and altitude than an air-to-air combat mission. While it can still involve hard and violent maneuvers to avoid enemy missiles and aircraft, these maneuvers are generally still not nearly as hard and violent as those required in air combat, and the F-111 is a larger and less-maneuverable aircraft to begin with. Though the F-14A entered service with the Navy powered by Pratt & Whitney TF30, by the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the Department of Defense began procuring F110-GE-400 engines and installed them in the F-14A Plus (later redesignated to F-14B in 1991), which entered service with the fleet in 1988. These engines solved the reliability problems and provided nearly 30% more thrust, achieving a 1:1 dry thrust to weight ratio with a low fuel load. The subsequent F-14D, a combination of both remanufactured/upgraded F-14As and new manufacture F-14Ds, also used F110-GE-400 engines.

History Imjin Barracks is located at the site RAF Innsworth which was a non-flying Royal Air Force station between 1940 and 2008.left The station opened in 1940, the first unit based there being No 7 School of Technical Training who trained engine and airframe fitters and mechanics. In December 1941, No 2 WAAF Depot was opened at Innsworth and from then on the Station became increasingly associated with the Women's branch of the service. Eventually it was decided to reserve the Station almost exclusively for WAAF training, including barrage balloon training amongst other vital roles. In 1951 the Headquarters of the RAF Record Office which had been based nearby in Gloucester and Barnwood, moved to the station and gained Group status. Three years later in 1954 No. 5 Personnel Despatch Unit arrived, charged with the administration and processing of personnel selected for overseas service. Just after the war ended the RAF Base Accounts Office moved from York to Gloucester and grew into the Central Pay Office and became part of the RAF Personnel and Training Command, which formed in 1994, based at Innsworth. In 2005 it was announced that HQ Personnel and Training Command was to co-locate with HQ RAF Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe. The new collocated HQ's were subsequently merged to form Air Command and the decision was taken to close RAF Innsworth. The drawdown took place over the next three years with elements of the Personnel Management Agency moved to High Wycombe and RAF Cranwell. RAF Innsworth finally closed on 31 March 2008. Army base The Innsworth site is now managed by the Army and has been renamed Imjin Barracks. When the RAF vacated the site in 2008, elements of AFPAA (renamed Defence Business Services in 2014) including the MoD Medal Office and Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre continued to operate from the site. In 2010 the station also became home to the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) which relocated from the Rheindahlen Military Complex in Germany.\\"The former RAF Innsworth site in Gloucestershire was officially renamed Imjin Barracks at a special ceremony on Friday 21 November 2008\\".

Erected in 1807, two years after the death of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, victor of the Battle of Trafalgar, it was placed by his friend and sometime agent, Alexander Davison, who owned an estate centred on the now demolished Swarland Hall. It is a Grade II listed monument. This relatively obscure memorial is situated by the old A1 (the great road between Morpeth and Alnwick, according to an 1868 gazetteer). Davison made his fortune in the late 18th century after travelling to Quebec, where he met and became friends with the 24-year-old Nelson, who was commanding HMS Albemarle, which was docked at Quebec City during the War of American Independence. Later in life, Nelson engaged Davison as an agent to represent him at naval tribunals dealing with the distribution of the spoils of battle. The obelisk is not the only Nelson memorial extant at Swarland. A line of trees on the estate represents the Nile delta, whilst other groups of trees represent the positions of French and British ships engaged in the Battle of the Nile. The Nile Clumps near Amesbury were also planted to commemorate the Battle of the Nile. The main inscription on the obelisk There are three inscriptions on the monument; from top to bottom: *England expects every man to do his duty *Victory 21 October 1805 (the date referring to the Battle of Trafalgar) *Not to Commemorate the Public Virtues and Heroic Achievements of Nelson, which is the duty of England; But to the Memory of Private Friendship, this erection is dedicated by Alexander Davison, Swarland Hall The erection of the memorial arguably represented the zenith of Davison's social standing; he was imprisoned for a year for fraud in 1808, and never recovered his position. In contemporary times, the memorial has become obscure since the course of the road has changed as the A1 passing Swarland was converted to a dual carriageway. Davison's obelisk lies on the old A1, used only by local traffic, hidden from the main road by a stand of trees. Carved onto the face of the obelisk are two Ordnance Survey bench marks, and on the south side is Ordnance Survey flush bracket number 1973. Maps indicate the height of the flush bracket as 117 metres above sea level. The stonemason's name is carved on the top of the plinth on the north side. The monument and site was restored by the local authorities, and a plaque erected, in about 2003. References External links *Lord Nelson: Hero and...Cad!

The 94th Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War II, and of the United States Army Reserve from 1956 until 1963. It continued in the Army Reserve as the 94th Command Headquarters (Divisional) from 1963 until the Army's realignment of reserve component combat arms into the Army National Guard in 1967. The 94th Army Reserve Command (later redesignated 94th Regional Support Command and 94th Regional Readiness Command) was a regional command and control headquarters over most United States Army Reserve units throughout the six New England states of Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. For forty years, beginning in the late 1960s, the United States Army Reserve was divided up into a varying number of regional, branch- immaterial commands. Originally designated \\"army reserve commands\\" (\\"ARCOMs\\"), several were disbanded in and around 1995, while the remainder were redesignated \\"regional support commands\\" (\\"RSCs\\") at that time and re-dubbed \\"regional readiness commands\\" (\\"RRCs\\") in 2001. In addition to the RRCs, several mission-oriented commands were established, including such as training divisions and engineer commands. Like most RRCs, the 94th Regional Readiness Command was scheduled to be deactivated in fiscal year 2009 as part of the Army Reserve's reorganization into a functionally based command structure reporting to respective major Army commands (\\"MACOMs\\"); plans were altered, the 94th became a training division headquartered at Fort Lee. The 94th ARCOM/RSC/RRC wore the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 94th Infantry Division but did not, according to the United States Army Center of Military History, perpetuate the lineage of the old division and was thus not entitled to the division's battle honors. Army Regulation 840-10 dictates that the distinguishing flag of an RRC features a white-bordered, 38.1 cm (15 in.) tall rendering of the shoulder sleeve insignia on a plain blue background, rather than on the horizontally divided bi-colour background of red over blue as carried by an infantry division. The 94th Division (Force Sustainment) is a unit of the United States Army Reserve, charged with providing sustainment training throughout the United States. The division is based at Fort Lee, Virginia and is subordinate to the 80th Training Command. The division has subordinate brigades that perform military occupational specialty (MOS) reclassification training. The division has brigades in the Continental United States and a multi-functional brigade in Puerto Rico. The 94th Infantry Division's standard (flag) and lineage bestowed upon the 94th Division (Force Sustainment) at its activation in 2009. World War I The 94th started as a provisional division in 1918. It was originally going to be formed as the 94th (Puerto-Rico) Division, based in Puerto Rico and composed of Spanish-speaking troops. However, the US Army lacked enough Spanish-speaking instructors to train the necessary support and technical services units, so it was agreed to create it as a \\"paper\\" division like the 93rd. The infantry regiments were assigned numbers 373 through 376, which would have been associated with the National Army's 94th Division. Only the 373rd‚Äì375th Infantry Regiments were formed. With the close of World War I, the division was disbanded. One of the Division's nicknames, the \\"Neuf-Cats\\" most likely comes from this era as most World War I combat was set in France, and the number '94' was pronounced in French as \\"Neuf-Quatre\\", literally, \\"Nine-Four\\". As the French numeral \\"Quatre\\" is pronounced as the English \\"cat\\", the division decided to adopt this as a nickname and pluralized it. Inter-war years 94th Division distinguishing flag, 1923‚Äì1942 In 1921 the 94th Division was reconstituted as an element of the Organized Reserve (\\"OR\\") and nicknamed the \\"Pilgrim Division\\" in reference to the rich cultural history of the state of Massachusetts to which it was assigned. The headquarters was organized in November 1921. A shoulder sleeve insignia featuring a Native American with bow and arrow was authorized on 21 July 1922. This design was superseded 6 September 1923 by one depicting the black silhouette of a Puritan carrying a blunderbuss on his shoulder, on a gray circle (the wording of the new design's description was amended on 22 December of the same year). Like the other OR divisions, the 94th was an authorized only a cadre organisation of officers and men; even then, the OR units were perpetually under-strength and received little equipment or funds with which to train. World War II =Re-formed = 94th Infantry Division distinguishing flag, 1942‚Äì1956 The 94th Division, like the other divisions of the Organized Reserve was not mobilized as a complete unit. In August 1940, the officers and men of the Organized Reserve had been called to active duty individually, being disbursed to existing Regular Army and Army National Guard units. The majority of mid-level officers (captains through lieutenant colonels) in the U.S. Army during the Second World War were Reserve officers.Twice The Citizen: A History of the United States Army Reserve, 1908‚Äì1995, Second and Expanded Edition, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (1997), p. 67. As such, the 94th provided leaders to every theater in the war. With virtually all of the division's personnel having gone off to war without it, the 94th Division existed only on paper when its shoulder sleeve insignia was changed on 5 September 1942 to a half-black, half-gray circle with the Arabic numerals 9 and 4 superimposed in reverse colors. Ten days later, on 15 September 1942, the division was ordered into active military service as the 94th Infantry Division at Fort Custer near Kalamazoo, Michigan. To effect the initial organization of the 94th, the officer cadre below regimental level and the entire enlisted cadre was selected from the soldiers of the 77th Infantry Division, then stationed at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. =Order of battle= * Headquarters, 94th Infantry Division * 301st Infantry Regiment * 302nd Infantry Regiment * 376th Infantry Regiment * Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 94th Infantry Division Artillery ** 301st Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) ** 356th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) ** 390th Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) ** 919th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) * 319th Engineer Combat Battalion * 319th Medical Battalion * 94th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized) * Headquarters, Special Troops, 94th Infantry Division ** Headquarters Company, 94th Infantry Division ** 794th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company ** 94th Quartermaster Company ** 94th Signal Company ** Military Police Platoon ** Band * 94th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment =Statistics= *Called into federal service: 15 September 1942 *Overseas: 6 August 1944. *Campaigns: Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace, Central Europe *Days of combat: 209 *Awards: ** Unit *** 1 Presidential Unit Citation (formerly called a Distinguished Unit Citation) ** Individual *** 1 Medal of Honor *** 54 Distinguished Service Crosses *** 2 Distinguished Service Medals *** 510 Silver Stars *** 10 Legions of Merit *** 12 Soldier's Medals *** 2792 Bronze Star Medals *** 66 Air Medals *Commanders: ** Major General Harry J.

The 94th inflicted over 2,700 casualties on the enemy and took 566 prisoners before being relieved by the 66th Infantry Division on New Year's Day 1945. As part of General George Patton's United States Third Army, the 94th Infantry Division (\\"94th ID\\") was known as \\"Patton's Golden Nugget\\". Moving east, the division relieved the 90th Infantry Division on 7 January 1945, taking positions in the Saar-Moselle Triangle south of Wasserbillig, facing the Siegfried Switch Line. Fresh for the fight, the 94th shifted to the offensive, 14 January, seizing Tettingen and Butzdorf that day. The following day, the Nennig-Berg-Wies area was wrested from the enemy, severe counterattacks followed, and it was at Nennig that the Germans gave the division its nickname \\"Roosevelt's Butchers\\" for stacking the dead in houses and along roads and refusing prisoners, lacking the means to guard and transport them. Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On the 20th, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the switch position, resulted in loss of most of two companies. In early February, the division took Campholz Woods and seized Sinz. On 19 February 1945, supported by heavy artillery and air support, the division launched a full-scale attack with all three regiments, storming the heights of Munzigen Ridge, to breach the Siegfried Line switch-line defenses and clear the Berg-Munzingen Highway.

Moving forward, the 94th Infantry Division and the 10th Armored Division secured the area from Orscholz and Saarburg to the confluence of the Saar and Moselle Rivers by 21 February 1945. At Ayl, General Patton ordered troops to cross the Saar immediately, against the advice of many of his officers. Under command of Lieutenant Colonel William A. McNulty, the 94th's 3rd Battalion, 301st Infantry Regiment crossed the icy and swollen Saar on 23 February 1945. Despite Lt. Col. McNulty's own preparatory reconnaissance in absence of other adequate intelligence and undertaken at considerable personal risk, many men and materiel were lost during the very ill-prepared Saar crossing. Two of the three crossings sites were eventually abandoned due to heavy and pinpoint German artillery and machinegun fire.Tony Le Tissier Patton‚Äôs Pawns The 94th U.S. Infantry Division at the Siegfried Line (2007) University of Alabama Press, Chapter 8 \\"Crossing the Saar\\" (commencing at p. 147) p. 158citation text of General Orders: Headquarters, 3d Army, General Order No. 158 (2 July 1945), awarding Lt. Col. William A. McNulty the Silver Star After establishing a bridgehead at Serrig, the 376th Infantry Regiment was detached to assist the 10th Armored Division in the capture of Trier. By 2 March 1945, the division stretched over a 10-mile front, from Hocker Hill on the Saar through Zerf, and Lampaden to Ollmuth. A heavy German attack near Lampaden achieved penetrations, but the line was shortly restored, and on 13 March, spearheading XX Corps, the division broke out of the Ruwer River bridgehead by ford and bridge. Driving forward, the 94th reached the Rhine on 21 March, where it fought in the Battle for Ludwigshafen. Ludwigshafen was taken on 24 March, in conjunction with Combat Command A of the 12th Armored Division. The division then moved by rail and motor to the vicinity of Krefeld, Germany, relieving the 102nd Infantry Division on 3 April and assuming responsibility for containing the western side of the Ruhr Pocket from positions along the Rhine. With the reduction of the pocket in mid-April, the division was assigned military government duties, first in the Krefeld and later in the D√ºsseldorf areas. By mid-April, the division relieved the 101st Airborne Division and assumed military government duties, first in the Krefeld vicinity and later around D√ºsseldorf. It was in that status when hostilities were declared at an end on 7 May 1945. From mid- June until the end of November, the division served the military government in Czechoslovakia. The 94th Infantry Division was inactivated at Camp Rucker, Alabama on 9 February 1946. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 6,533Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 1,009Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Wounded in action: 4,789Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Missing in action: 116Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Prisoner of war: 619Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) =Assignments in ETO= * 27 July 1944: XIII Corps, Ninth Army. * 28 August 1944: XIII Corps, Ninth Army, 12th Army Group. * 23 September 1944: Ninth Army, 12th Army Group. * 9 October 1944: 12th Army Group. * 5 January 1945: 12th Army Group, but attached to Oise Section, Communication Zone, for supply. * 6 January 1945: XX Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group. * 29 March 1945: XII Corps, Fifteenth Army, 12th Army Group. Cold War 94th Infantry Division distinguishing flag, 1956‚Äì1967 =94th Infantry Division= The division was reactivated in the United States Army Reserve in 1956. On 14 May of that year, the \\"9/4\\" shoulder sleeve insignia was rescinded, and the former Puritan shoulder sleeve insignia (with a minor change in the design) was reinstated. =94th Command Headquarters (Divisional)= The division was redesignated the 94th Command Headquarters (Divisional) on 16 October 1963, and was deactivated in 1967 as part of the compromise between U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara who wanted to merge the Army Reserve into the Army National Guard, and the United States Congress who wanted to maintain the Army Reserve as it then existed. Under the compromise plan, all of the combat divisions and most separate combat brigades of the Army Reserve were deactivated with a corresponding increase in the National Guard; at the same time, non-divisional combat support and combat service support units were reallocated in the Army Reserve.Twice The Citizen, at 174‚Äì177. =94th Army Reserve Command= 94th Army Reserve Command distinguishing flag, 1968‚Äì91. Under the aforementioned compromise plan agreed to by the Congress and the Defense Department, the fourteen area corps were deactivated; in their place, eighteen army reserve commands (\\"ARCOMs\\") were established. Commanded by a reserve major general, each ARCOM served as a regional non-tactical peacetime headquarters for unrelated support units. Each ARCOM was, in turn, assigned to one of five continental U.S. armies (\\"CONUSAs\\") under Continental Army Command (\\"CONARC\\"). On 22 April 1968, the number and shoulder-sleeve insignia of the former 94th Division were re- allocated to the new 94th U.S. Army Reserve Command (\\"ARCOM\\"), headquartered at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts and subordinate to First United States Army. Two company-level units within the 94th ARCOM served in the Vietnam War: Headquarters & Headquarters Company, 513th Maintenance Battalion (Direct Support); and the 241st Military Intelligence Detachment. 94th ARCOM units participated annually in Exercise REFORGER (from REturn of FORces to GERmany) and Operation Bright Star throughout the Cold War. These exercises were intended to ensure that NATO and the United States military had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany and Egypt in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union. In 1980, the peacetime Army Reserve chain of command was overlaid with a CAPSTONE wartime trace. In an expansion of the roundout and affiliation program begun ten years earlier, CAPSTONE purported to align every Army Reserve unit with the active and reserve component units with which they were anticipated to deploy.James T. Currie and Richard B. Crossland, Twice The Citizen: A History of the United States Army Reserve, 1908‚Äì1995 (2nd revised & expanded edition), Washington, D.C.: Office of the Chief, Army Reserve (1997), pp. 254‚Äì255. Units maintained lines of communication with the units‚Äîoften hundreds or thousands of miles away in peacetime‚Äîwho would presumably serve above or below them in the event of mobilization. This communication, in some cases, extended to coordinated annual training opportunities. Many of the 94th's units and individual soldiers rotated through Honduras in the 1980s. Operation Fuertes Caminos (\\"strong roads\\") provided villagers with roads on which to move their crops to market, while providing invaluable real-world training and experience to reserve engineers, medical personnel, logisticians and others. Operation Nordic Shield was held in the summer of 1987. Units of the 94th ARCOM; principally the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the 167th Support Group (Corps) and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Units under the 94th Army Reserve Command participated in a series of mobilization exercises in the 1980s, including the Selected Reserve Call-Up (23‚Äì25 October 1987), Golden Thrust '88 (November 1988), and Proud Eagle 90 (12 October through 2 November 1989). Each of these was designed to evaluate not only the units' ability to prepare to mobilize, but to examine the mobilization processes, systems, and logistical coordination so as to find and correct the unanticipated flaws. In 1990‚Äì1991, over 1,000 soldiers from the 94th ARCOM served overseas in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Despite the commonly held belief that CAPSTONE traces were set in stone, the process of selecting units to mobilize and deploy largely ignored CAPSTONE. Post Cold War =94th Regional Support Command= 94th Regional Support Command / Regional Readiness Command distinguishing flag, 1991‚Äì2009 The ARCOM's Puritan shoulder sleeve insignia reverted again to the \\"9/4\\" design on 27 November 1991. Operation Nordic Shield II was held in the summer of 1992. As they did five years before, units of the 94th ARCOM; principally the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate), the 167th Support Group (Corps) and their subordinate battalions and companies; deployed to Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in southern New Brunswick, to simulate the defense of Iceland against Warsaw Pact forces, the CAPSTONE mission of both the 187th and 167th. Part of the 1992 exercise included lanes training as part of the United States Army Forces Command's \\"Bold Shift\\" initiative to reinforce unit war-fighting task proficiency. In 1995, the 94th ARCOM was redesignated the 94th Regional Support Command (RSC) and moved from Hanscom Air Force Base to Fort Devens, Massachusetts. The 94th RSC deployed soldiers to Honduras and Guatemala in 1999 in support of Operation New Horizon, and later to the Balkans in support of Operation Joint Guardian and Operation Joint Forge. Continuing with Operation New Horizon, the command deployed members of the 94th Military Police Company to Rambala-Bocas del Toro, Panam√° in spring 2007. Global War on Terror After 11 September 2001, the 94th RSC deployed soldiers in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. Mission areas include Continental United States (\\"CONUS\\"), Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Iraq, Kuwait, the Horn of Africa and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 804th Medical Brigade, a major subordinate command of the 94th Regional Support Command, mobilized at Fort Devens and trained for combat in support of operations in Kuwait (and eventually Iraq) at Fort Drum, New York in February 2003. The 804th arrived in Kuwait in March 2003 and assumed command and control of over 4400 soldiers in five countries in support of both Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. In mid-February 2004 the 804th arrived back at Fort Devens after successfully completing an over 12-month activation. The 804th conducted a relief-in-place/transfer-of-authority with the 8th Medical Brigade from New York City. In December 2002, the 94th RSC moved into its final headquarters at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. =94th Regional Readiness Command= In August 2003, the 94th RSC was redesignated the 94th Regional Readiness Command (RRC). At its end, the 94th Regional Readiness Command was made up of more than 6,000 citizen-soldiers serving within fifty-six units located throughout New England. The 94th RRC mobilized and deployed over twenty units and more than 2,500 soldiers in support of the Global War on Terror. =94th Division rebirth in the 21st century= 94th Division (Force Sustainment) distinguishing flag, 2009‚Äìpresent In September 2008, the 94th Training Division (Force Sustainment) entered \\"carrier status\\", under the command of Brigadier General Mark Corson, at Ft. Lee, Virginia. The division is one of three major divisions under the umbrella of the 80th Training Command (The Army School System), the third-largest command organization in the U.S. Army Reserve. On 17 October 2009, the 94th Training Division was reactivated, under the command of Brigadier General Karen LeDoux, at Ft. Lee, Virginia. The activation ceremony included many of the veterans of who served in the 94th Training Division during World War II. The event included the 3rd Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) and its Fife and Drum Corps. The 94th Training Division's original red and blue colors flown by the division during World War II were returned by Army Heraldry.  Subordinate units  As of 2018 the following units are subordinated to the 94th Training Division (Force Sustainment): * 1st Brigade (Quartermaster)http://www.usar.army.mil/Commands/Training/80th-TNG-CMD/94th- TD-FS/ ** 80th Battalion (Quartermaster) ** 95th Battalion (Quartermaster) ** 100th Battalion (Quartermaster) ** 104th Battalion (Quartermaster) ** 108th Battalion (Quartermaster) * 2nd Brigade (Transport) ** 80th Battalion (Transport) ** 95th Battalion (Transport) ** 100th Battalion (Transport) ** 104th Battalion (Transport) ** 108th Battalion (Transport) * 3rd Brigade (Ordnance) ** 80th Battalion (Ordnance) ** 95th Battalion (Ordnance) ** 98th Battalion (Ordnance) ** 100th Training Battalion (Ordnance) ** 108th Training Battalion (Ordnance) * 4th Brigade (Personnel Services) ** 95th Battalion (Personnel Services) ** 98th Battalion (Personnel Services) ** 100th Battalion (Personnel Services) ** 104th Battalion (Personnel Services) ** 108th Battalion (Personnel Services) * 5th Brigade (Health Services) ** 11-98th Battalion (Health Services) ** 10-95th Battalion (Health Services) ** 8-100th Battalion (Health Services) ** 10-108th Battalion (Health Services) ** 9-104th Battalion (Health Services) Insignia right =Shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI)= * Native American design: Featured a Native American with bow and arrow. * Puritan design: ** Description: On a disc silver gray, edged with a .32 cm (1/8-inch) black border, depicting the black silhouette of a Puritan carrying a flintlock blunderbuss on his shoulder.

The geometric four- sided figure commemorates the four European campaign honors. Blue is the color used for infantry. The bust of the Puritan with flintlock blunderbuss is from the shoulder sleeve insignia worn during the period 1923‚Äì1942 and 1956‚Äì1991. It represents the history and traditions of the area with which past and present organizations have always identified. The nine sides of the device and the four sides of the oblong also allude to the numerical designation of the unit. * Background: The distinctive unit insignia was originally authorized for the 94th U.S. Army Reserve Command on 4 June 1970. It was reassigned and authorized for 94th U.S. Army Regional Support Command on 16 April 1996. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 July 2003 for the U.S. Army 94th Regional Readiness Command.

Essentially a velomobile with an electrical hybrid engine, it can be driven in electric-only mode or electric + pedal power mode. Pedaling warms the user, making electric heating in winter unnecessary, extends the range of the vehicle but does not substantially add to the vehicle's top speed. Constructed of lightweight materials such as aluminium (frame) and plastic (shell), the 246 kg (542 lb) (unladen, varying with battery weight) tricycle vehicle first used NiCd batteries, later Li-Mn, LiFePO4 and LiIon. Typically ranges reach from 50 to over 500 km depending on battery size, type, status on one side and speed and altitude profile and load on the other. Energy is reclaimed while driving through regenerative braking, and load is removed from the electric system by use of the pedalling system which transfers its input directly to the drivetrain (i.e., both systems operate in parallel, not in series). Description Late 1990s model Twike The Twike is a three-wheeled two seater. The two rear wheels are direct-driven via a differential gear by one motor - and optionally additionally by 2 pairs of pedals in the case of the model \\"active\\". Twike is steered by joystick - for the right hand of the left-side seated pilot - via cables and has pedal brakes. The vehicle can reach speeds of up to 85 kilometers per hour (53 mph), using 7.4 kWh per 100 km. At 50 km/h it can drive up to 80 km. History Interior of an early versionGreenfleet.info The Twike I was developed for the 1986 World EXPO in Vancouver, Canada, by a group of Swiss students. It won the \\"Functionality Award\\" for the best ergonomic design in the Innovative Vehicle Design Competition (IVDC) and a first prize in the International Human Powered Vehicle Speed Championship . The Twike I was completely driven by human power. Inspired by the success of the Twike I, a group of enthusiasts including Ralph Schnyder and Peter Zeller began to develop the Twike II as a step towards a vehicle for everyday road use. It was developed in cooperation with Alusuisse- Lonza Holding, was shown on the HEUREKA exhibition in Z√ºrich, and took part in the 1991 Tour de Sol Alpin. The Twike II had a belt pedal drive with infinitely variable mechanical transmission and a DC motor powered by NiCd batteries to help propel the vehicle. The suitability for everyday use turned out to be significantly improved. In 1992, the newly founded Twike Ltd. decided to develop the Twike II into a production vehicle and began looking for capital and customers. Production of the Twike III began in 1995 and during 1996 the reformed Twike AG produced and sold 190 vehicles, mostly in Switzerland and Germany. The Twike III was already equipped with an asynchronous AC motor and 336V NiCd batteries, the system still in use today. The pedal drive was simplified to a 5-speed hub gear and was included in all but very few special order vehicles. In 1998, FINE Mobile GmbH launched its German Twike production line and finally became the exclusive producer of the Twike after taking over the rights of the SwissLEM AG in 2002. Today the Twike is produced in Rosenthal, a small village in Hessen near Marburg. Pricing for a Twike starts at about ‚Ç¨25.000 (basic version, two battery packs included). By 2011, 900 were claimed to have been sold. 2010, team TW4XP took part at the Automotive X Prize in the US with their Twike-based TW4XP human-electric hybrid vehicle (Twike 4).

Feargal Sharkey was hired as a guest vocalist for the A-side of the group's only single, \\"Never Never\\". Clarke and Radcliffe had planned to use a different singer on each track the group recorded, but the group disbanded after the release of \\"Never Never\\", and no other vocalists were employed by the duo. Band history Clarke founded The Assembly shortly after disbanding Yazoo (featuring vocalist Alison Moyet), upon completion and distribution of Yazoo's 1983 album, You and Me Both. The Assembly marked the most involved phase of Clarke's long-term professional relationship with sound engineer Radcliffe, who had contributed significant influences to the recordings of Clarke's previous bands, Depeche Mode and Yazoo. However, the Assembly project never became a full-fledged band and resulted in only one single release, the UK hit \\"Never Never\\". It featured a sampled guitar track triggered note for note on a Fairlight CMI). The sound was augmented by session musician Clem Clempson on electric guitar. Former Undertones frontman Feargal Sharkey was hired to sing on this track. Clarke and Radcliffe had planned to use a different singer on each track the group recorded, but none were released after \\"Never Never\\". The other track on the single, \\"Stop/Start,\\" was an instrumental, featuring Clarke's signature songwriting style with syncopation that gradually became the downbeat of the musical phrase. Despite the commercial success of the single, The Assembly was no longer a functioning entity by the end of 1984. Clarke went on to form Erasure with vocalist and co-songwriter Andy Bell in 1985. Although Erasure worked with Radcliffe on some of their early work, they eventually began working with other producers and engineers, including Flood. Sharkey, for his part, began a successful solo career in 1984, and achieved his only UK number one single in 1985 with \\"A Good Heart\\". \\"Never Never\\" was re-released on CD single in 1996 with four tracks, containing both the normal and extended versions of both the title song, and \\"Stop/Start\\". The music video for \\"Never Never\\", filmed at Upminster Windmill in the London Borough of Havering, was featured on the first Now That's What I Call Music! video in 1983, though it did not feature on the corresponding compilation album. Reunion In May 2011, Sharkey appeared on stage during the Erasure set at Mute Records's Short Circuit music festival for a one-off performance of \\"Never, Never\\" with Clarke.

Roberts is well financed, due mainly to past business dealings, and is well known for his folk music, which presents conservative ideas with gusto. The film is Robbins' directorial debut, and is based on a short segment of the same title and featuring the same character that Robbins portrayed on Saturday Night Live.AllMovie Plot Bob Roberts takes place in Pennsylvania in 1990. It depicts a fictitious senatorial race between a conservative Republican folk singer, Bob Roberts (Tim Robbins), and the incumbent Democrat, Brickley Paiste (Gore Vidal). The film is shot through the perspective of Terry Manchester (Brian Murray), a British documentary filmmaker who is following the Roberts campaign. Through his lens we see Roberts travel across the state, performing songs about drug users, lazy people and the triumph of traditional family values over the rebelliousness of the 1960s. As the campaign continues, Paiste remains in the lead until a scandal arises involving him and a young woman who was seen emerging from a car with him. Paiste claims that she was a friend of his granddaughter whom he was driving home, but he cannot shake the accusations. Throughout the campaign, reporter Bugs Raplin (Giancarlo Esposito) attempts to use the documentary being made about Roberts as a way to expose him to the public as a fraud. Raplin believes that Roberts' anti-drug charity, Broken Dove, is connected to an old Central Intelligence Agency drug trafficking scheme. As the election approaches, Roberts is asked to appear on a network's sketch comedy show. When Roberts announces that he will not be playing the song he had originally proposed, a dispute breaks out between the cast and producers of the show. This new song turns out to be nothing more than a thinly veiled campaign endorsement, and an angry staff member of the network pulls the plug mid-performance. As Roberts is leaving the studio, he is seemingly shot by a would-be assassin. Raplin, who has been causing problems for the campaign, is initially linked to the shooting, but he is later cleared when it is found that due to constrictive palsy in his right hand he physically could not have fired the gun. Following the incident, Raplin contends that Roberts was never actually shot and that the gun was fired into the ground. The campaign is boosted by public support following the assassination attempt, and Roberts wins the election with 52 percent of the vote. Although Roberts claims that his wounds have left him paralyzed from the waist down, he is seen tapping his feet at a celebration party. While Terry Manchester is interviewing Roberts' supporters outside the new senator's hotel, a boy runs up shouting, \\"He's dead, he's dead, they got him!\\" When Manchester asks him what he is talking about, the boy shouts, \\"Bugs Raplin! He's dead! They got him!\\" A joyful celebration breaks out among Roberts' supporters, the shot changes to an image of his hotel room, and an upright walking shadow suggesting Roberts' profile passes the window before the lights go out. The film ends with a radio news report about Raplin's death at the hands of a right-wing fanatic and a shot of Manchester standing in the Jefferson Memorial, looking at the words, \\"I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man\\", inscribed there.

Their work centers on a cerebrally robotic, usually instrumental, semi-danceable, minimalistic format, with influences including Krautrock, heavy metal, hardcore punk, synthpop, electronic music, and folk music. They are known for constant touring (with bands such as Tortoise, Pan Sonic, The Fucking Champs, and Tool), cryptic album artwork, and continual thematic re-invention. Biography Nathan Means (bass, keyboards, vocoder, vocals), Philip Manley (lead guitar, bass, keyboards, vocals), and Sebastian Thomson (drums, bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) formed Trans Am in 1990 near Washington, D.C.. The band started as a HarDCore project but their sound evolved as the members finished college to include additional influences, such as new wave, classic rock, and experimental rock. In 1995, they began recording their music, which until 1998 was almost entirely instrumental. Their sound is generally marked with acoustic and electronic drums, guitars, electronics, and a varying amount of often-heavily processed vocals. Instrumental virtuosity (especially on drums) is a focal point. All of their albums have been released on the Chicago-based independent record label Thrill Jockey. Trans Am's self-titled debut, recorded after just a few rehearsals, contained instrumentals which were largely improvised versions of simple rock-oriented motifs based loosely on 1970s bands such as Boston, Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive, and Yes. The album was produced by John McEntire of labelmates Tortoise at Chicago's Idful Studios. Afterwards, the band opened for Tortoise on a brief US tour. In the fall of 1996, Trans Am released a self-titled EP, which showed a greater reliance on electronics. The group expanded that approach to album length on Surrender to the Night (1997) and The Surveillance (1998). Their sound during this period was reminiscent of such acts as Kraftwerk, Can, and New Order, interspersed with more rock-oriented material. In 1996, they appeared on a split 12\\" with Wingtip Sloat, which accompanied the zine Tuba Frenzy. One track from that record, \\"Starjammer\\", was later included on the highbrow electronica label Mille Plateaux's double-CD compilation In Memoriam Gilles Deleuze. In their live shows, the band began to incorporate trigger devices and MIDI-wired beatboxes in order to perform their electronics-heavy songs. Around the time of the release of The Surveillance, Trans Am started to perform material with vocorder-heavy vocals by Nathan Means. Their fourth album, Futureworld, came out in 1999. The first side of this album featured songs with vocoder and the second side had all instrumentals, including the sprightly \\"Cocaine Computer\\". A music video for the title song was filmed and released. In 2000, the group followed up with the double album Red Line, recorded in the ir own National Recording Studio. A rarities collection, You Can Always Get What You Want, was also released that year. In 2002, Trans Am released TA, complete with tongue- in-cheek promo photos featuring the band in boy band-esque matching white outfits. TA's cover art was a parody of a REO Speedwagon best-of collection. Though the album was essentially a spoof of the electroclash genre, it was mostly panned by music critics. During the 2004 U.S. election year, Trans Am released the politically charged Liberation, an album which questioned the George W. Bush presidency and addressed such issues as the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the War on Terror, and paranoia. Sex Change, the band's sixth studio album, was released in 2007. Following the release, Trans Am did a tour of the United States with Zombi and The Psychic Paramount, seventeen shows opening for Tool, and they played the Thrill Jockey 15th anniversary show in Chicago, Illinois. Also in 2007, Trans Am contributed to the soundtrack of the video game After Burner: Black Falcon for the PSP. In April 2017, Trans Am released California Hotel, an eight-song album on Thrill Jockey.

As defined by the United States Geological Survey, the canyon begins at Glen Aulin and ends directly above Hetch Hetchy Valley. Geography The Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne starts at Glen Aulin, immediately below the confluence of Cold Canyon, Conness Creek, and the Tuolumne River. Here, the valley walls pull away from each other and become steeper. The water meanders and forms deep pools. After the waterfall that marks the end of Glen Aulin, the canyon becomes deeper again, and roughly \\"V\\"-shaped in cross-section. The walls are not as steep and bare as those of Yosemite Valley. The flora of the valley bottom is a haphazard melange of chaparral, manzanita scrub and oak woodland characteristic of the foothills and lowlands with a coniferous forest reminiscent of (but different from) that found above the canyon rim. This vegetation clings and clambers up every ledge of the valley walls to the top, giving it a lusher appearance than Yosemite Valley, though this area in fact experiences a drier climate. Many dramatic waterfalls are found in the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. Whereas Yosemite Valley's celebrated falls occur on tributary streams along the sides, these lie on the main river itself. Many watercourses do join the Tuolumne River, but their canyons form deep clefts in the sides of the Grand Canyon and descend to its bottom. The Tuolumne‚Äôs own bed, beginning even above Glen Aulin, is fashioned as a great staircase punctuated by waterfalls. Waterwheel Falls Perhaps the greatest of these is Waterwheel Falls, named for a dramatic circular plume of water that appears when the river and the winds run high. A few kilometres below Glen Aulin, the walls of the lower canyon pinch together to form a narrow chasm of less than in length, the Muir Gorge. A short way below the Muir Gorge, the Grand Canyon widens again, much as it does at Glen Aulin, though here it is deeper. This broad plain bears the name of \\"Pate Valley.\\" Some below here, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir (created by O‚ÄôShaughnessy Dam) claims the Tuolumne River. Recreation A trail runs along the Tuolumne River from its headwaters to below Pate Valley (though it leaves the valley floor for some time to avoid the impassable Muir Gorge). It is diligently built, but due to the nature of the terrain it is often rocky, steep and generally difficult. The walking distance from the Tioga Road to the Glen Aulin High Sierra Camp is roughly . White Wolf campground, southeast of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, is within day-hiking distance of the canyon rim, but the return trip from the very bottom is long and steep. Between the eastern tip of the reservoir and the point where the trail begins the climb to White Wolf, the valley is a trackless wilderness.

It is believed to be the world's rarest pinniped species. Description This species of seal grows from approximately long at birth up to an average of as adults, females slightly shorter than males. Males weigh an average of and females weigh , with overall weight ranging from . They are thought to live up to 45 years old; the average life span is thought to be 20 to 25 years old and reproductive maturity is reached at around age four. The monk seals' pups are about long and weigh around , their skin being covered by 1‚Äì1.5 centimeter-long, dark brown to black hair. On their bellies, there is a white stripe, which differs in color and shape between the two sexes. In females the stripe is usually rectangular in shape whereas in males it is usually butterfly shaped. This hair is replaced after six to eight weeks by the usual short hair adults carry. Adults will continue to mold annually, causing their color vibrancy to change throughout the year. Pregnant Mediterranean monk seals typically use inaccessible undersea caves while giving birth, though historical descriptions show they used open beaches until the 18th century. There are eight pairs of teeth in both jaws. Believed to have the shortest hair of any pinniped, the Mediterranean monk seal fur is black (males) or brown to dark grey (females), with a paler belly, which is close to white in males. The snout is short broad and flat, with very pronounced, long nostrils that face upward, unlike their Hawaiian relative, which tend to have more forward nostrils. The flippers are relatively short, with small slender claws. Monk seals have two pairs of retractable abdominal teats, unlike most other pinnipeds. =Reproduction= A colony on Cabo Blanco in 1945 Very little is known of this seal's reproduction. Scientists have suggested that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in September, October, and November. Although mating will take place in the water, females will give birth and care for the pups on beaches or underwater caves. The use of underwater caves may have began in order to make predatory actions almost impossible as these caves are difficult to access. Because they will stay with the pups to nurse and protect, they will feed off of their stored fat. Data analysis indicates that only 29% of pups born between September and January survive. One cause of this low survival rate is the timing of high surf around the areas of breeding, creating a threat to young pups. As well, because of smaller populations there is an increase in genetic events such as inbreeding and lack of genetic variation. During other months of the year, pups have an estimated survival rate of 71%. In 2008, lactation was reported in an open beach, the first such record since 1945, which could suggest the seal could begin feeling increasingly safe to return to open beaches for breeding purposes in Cabo Blanco. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed for an average of nine hours. Most female individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age unto which they will begin to breed. Males begin to breed at age six. The gestation period lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a gestation period lasting slightly longer than a year. Diet Mediterranean monk seals are diurnal and feed on a variety of fish and mollusks, primarily octopus, squid, and eels, up to 3 kg per day. Although they commonly feed in shallow coastal waters, they are also known to forage at depths up to 250 meters, with an average depth varying between specimens. Monk seals prefer hunting in wide-open spaces, enabling them to use their speed more effectively. They are successful bottom-feeding hunters; some have even been observed lifting slabs of rock in search of prey. Habitat The habitat of this pinniped has changed over the years. In ancient times, and up until the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. In more recent times, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for these activities. Often these caves are inaccessible to humans. Often their caves have underwater entries and their caves are often positioned along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves. Status This earless seal's former range extended throughout the Northwest Atlantic Africa, Mediterranean and Black Sea coastlines, including all offshore islands of the Mediterranean, and into the Atlantic and its islands: Canary, Madeira, Ilhas Desertas, Porto Santo... as far west as the Azores. Vagrants could be found as far south as Gambia and the Cape Verde islands, and as far north as continental Portugal and Atlantic France. Several causes provoked a dramatic population decrease over time: on one hand, commercial hunting (especially during the Roman Empire and Middle Ages) and, during the 20th century, eradication by fishermen, who used to consider it a pest due to the damage the seal causes to fishing nets when it preys on fish caught in them; and, on the other hand, coastal urbanization and pollution. Some seals have survived in the Sea of Marmara,Inanmaz E.√ñ.. Deƒüirmenci √ñ.. G√ºc√º C.A.. 2014. A new sighting of the Mediterranean Monk Seal, Monachus monachus (Hermann, 1779), in the Marmara Sea (Turkey). pp.278-280. Zoology in the Middle East. Volume 60, 2014 - Issue 3. The Taylor & Francis. Retrieved on 28 March 2017 but the last report of a seal in the Black Sea dates to 1997. Monk seals were present at Snake Island until the 1950s, and several locations such as the and Doƒüankent were the last known hauling-out sites post-1990.Sergei R. Grinevetsky, Igor S. Zonn, Sergei S. Zhiltsov, Aleksey N. Kosarev, Andrey G. Kostianoy, 2014, The Black Sea Encyclopedia Nowadays, its entire population is estimated to be less than 700 individuals widely scattered, which qualifies this species as endangered. Its current very sparse population is one more serious threat to the species, as it only has two key sites that can be deemed viable. One is the Aegean Sea (250‚Äì300 animals in Greece, with the largest concentration of animals in Gyaros island, and some 100 in Turkey); the other important subpopulation is in the Atlantic Ocean, in the Western Saharan portion of Cabo Blanco (around 270 individuals which may support the small, but growing, nucleus in the Desertas Islands ‚Äì approximately 30-40 individuals). There may be some individuals using coastal areas among other parts of Western Sahara, such as in Cintra Bay. These two key sites are virtually in the extreme opposites of the species' distribution range, which makes natural population interchange between them impossible. All the other remaining subpopulations are composed of less than 50 mature individuals, many of them being only loose groups of extremely reduced size ‚Äì often less than five individuals. Other remaining populations are in southwestern Turkey and the Ionian Sea (both in the eastern Mediterranean). The species status is virtually moribund in the western Mediterranean, which still holds tiny Moroccan and Algerian populations, associated with rare sightings of vagrants in the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and other western Mediterranean locations, including Gibraltar. In Sardinia the Mediterranean monk seal was last sighted in May 2007 and April 2010. The increase of sightings in Sardinia suggests that the seal occasionally inhabits the Central Eastern Sardinian coasts, preserved since 1998 by the National Park of Golfo of Orosei. Colonies on the Pelagie Islands (Linosa and Lampedusa) were destroyed by fishermen, which likely resulted in local extinction.A brief survey of Linosa island =Cabo Blanco 1997 die off and recovery= Cabo Blanco, in the Atlantic Ocean, is the largest surviving single population of the species, and the only remaining site that still seems to preserve a colony structure. In the summer of 1997, more than 200 animals or two-thirds of its seal population were wiped out within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided between a morbilivirus or, more likely, a toxic algae bloom, the mass die-off emphasized the precarious status of a species already regarded as critically endangered throughout its range. Numbers in this all-important location started a slow- paced recovery ever since. A small but incipient (up to 20 animals by 2009) sub-population in the area had started using open beaches. In 2009, for the first time in centuries, a female delivered her pup on the beach (open beaches is the optimal habitat for the survival of pups, but had been abandoned due to human disturbance and persecution in past centuries).The recovery of the Mediterranean monk seal in the Atlantic Only by 2016 the colony had recovered to its previous population (about 300 animals). This was made possible by a recovery plan financed by Spain. Also in 2016, a new record of births was set for the colony (83 pups). However, the threat of a similar incident, which could severely reduce or wipe out the entire population, remains. =Recent sightings= On Coaling Island in September 2012, possibly the first record in the Strait of Gibraltar On rocky shore at Serifos In June 2009, there was a report of a sighting off the island of Giglio, in Italy. On 7 January 2010, fishermen spotted an injured Mediterranean monk seal off the coasts of Tel Aviv, Israel. When zoo veterinarians arrived to help the seal, it had slipped back into the waters. Members of the Israel Marine Mammal Research and Assistance Center arrived at the scene and tried to locate the injured mammal, but with no success. This was the first sighting of the species in the region since Lebanese authorities claimed to have found a population of 10‚Äì20 other seals on their coasts 70 years earlier. In addition, the seal was also sighted a couple of weeks later in the northern kibbutz of Rosh Hanikra. In April 2010, there was a report of a sighting off the island of Marettimo, in the Egadi Islands off the coast of Italy, in Trapani Province. In November 2010, a Mediterranean monk seal, supposedly aged between 10 and 20, had been spotted in Bodrum, Turkey. On 31 December 2010, the BBC Earth news reported that the MOM Hellenic Society had located a new colony of seals on a remote beach in the Aegean Sea. The exact location was not communicated so as to keep the site protected. The society was appealing to the Greek government to integrate the part of the island on which the seals live into a marine protected area. On 8 March 2011, the BBC Earth news reported that a pup seal had been spotted on 7 February while monitoring a seal colony on an island in the southwestern Aegean Sea. Soon after, it showed signs of weakness and it was taken to a rehabilitation centre to try to save it. The aim is to release it back into the wild as soon as it is strong enough. In April 2011, a monk seal was spotted near the Egyptian coast after long absence of the species from the nation. On 24 June 2011, the Blue World Institute of Croatia filmed an adult female underwater in the northern Adriatic, off the island of Cres and a specimen of unverified sex on 29 June 2012. On 2 May 2013 a specimen was seen on the southernmost point of Istrian peninsula near the town of Pula. On 9 September 2013, in Pula a male specimen swam to a busy beach and entertained numerous tourists for five minutes before swimming back to the open sea. In summer 2014 sightings in Pula have occurred almost daily and monk seal stayed multiple times on crowded city beaches, sleeping calm for hours just few meters away from humans. To prevent accidents and preserve monk seal, local city council acquired special educational boards and installed on city beaches. Despite clear instructions, an incident occurred with a tourist harassing a seal. The whole event was filmed. Less than a month later on 25 August 2014 this female monk seal was found dead in the Mrtvi Puƒá bay near ≈†i≈°an, Croatia. Experts said it was natural death caused by her old age. In 2012, a Mediterranean monk seal, was spotted in Gibraltar on the jetty of the private boat owners club at Coaling Island. In the week of 22‚Äì28 April 2013, what is believed to have been a monk seal was viewed in Tyre, southern Lebanon; photographs have been reported among many local media. A study by the Italian Ministry of the Environment in 2013 confirmed the presence of monk seals in marine protected area in the Egadi Islands. In September and October 2013, there were a number of sightings of an adult pair in waters around RAF Akrotiri in British Sovereign Base waters in Cyprus. In November 2014, an adult monk seal was reportedly seen inside the port of Limassol, Cyprus. A female monk seal, called Argiro by the locals, was repeatedly seen on beaches of Samos island in 2014 and 2015, and two were reported in April 2016.Monk seals spotted in Paphos sea On 7 April 2015, a large floating \\"fish\\" was reported near Raouche, Beirut in Lebanon, and collected by a local fisherman. This turned out to be the body of a female monk seal known to have been resident there for some time. Further investigations revealed that she was pregnant with a pup. On 13 August 2015, ten monk seals were spotted in Governor's Beach, Limassol, Cyprus.Monk seals spotted off Limassol On 6 January 2016, a monk seal climbed aboard a parked boat in Ku≈üadasƒ±.Ku≈üadasƒ±'nda limana baƒülƒ± tekneye fok √ßƒ±ktƒ± On 10 April 2016, a monk seal was spotted and photographed by a group of foreign exchange students and local bio-engineers in a creek in Manavgat District in Turkey's southern Antalya Province. According to the scientists involved in local projects to protect the animals, this was the first ever documented sighting of a monk seal swimming in a river. Possible reasons for the animal's appearance included better opportunities for hunting, as well as higher salinity levels due to lower water levels.Rare monk seal spotted by students in Antalya (Hurriyet Daily News, 11 April 2016) On 26 April 2016, two monk seals were spotted at the municipal baths area of Paphos, Cyprus.Monk seals spotted in Paphos sea On 18 October 2016, a monk seal was captured on video around Gulf of Ku≈üadasƒ±.Nesli t√ºkenen fok Ku≈üadasƒ±'ndan √ßƒ±ktƒ± On 3 November 2016, a monk seal was spotted at the coast of Gialousa in Cyprus.Yeni Erenk√∂y'de Akdeniz foku g√∂r√ºnt√ºlendi On 13 June 2017, a specimen was spotted and photographed by a group of fishermen off the coasts of Tricase in the south of Italy.Monk seal spotted off Tricase, Italy In early 2018 a mother and her pup were spotted around Paphos Harbour in Cyprus.Rare baby monk seal reunited with mother In November 2018, a young monk seal was spotted at the coast of Karavostasi in Cyprus, only to be found dead at the same area a few days later.Gemikonaƒüƒ± sahilinde Akdeniz Foku On 15 March 2019, a monk seal was spotted and photographed by a group of citizens at a marina in Ku≈üadasƒ±.Ku≈üadasƒ±‚Äônda 15 ay aradan sonra Akdeniz foku g√∂r√ºld√º On 26 March 2019, a young monk seal and a mature one 1.5 meter were sighted in Vlora, Albania, in the Ionian sea. On 20 July 2019, a monk seal was spotted in Protaras bay area in Cyprus . On 27 January 2020, a young monk seal was spotted in Apulia. Some day later, it was found dead in another beach. Preservation A seal swims at Ras Nouadhibou Damage inflicted on fishermen's nets and rare attacks on off-shore fish farms in Turkey and Greece are known to have pushed local people towards hunting the Mediterranean monk seal, but mostly out of revenge, rather than population control. Preservation efforts have been put forth by civil organizations, foundations, and universities in both countries since as early as the 1970s. For the past 10 years, many groups have carried out missions to educate locals on damage control and species preservation. Reports of positive results of such efforts exist throughout the area. In the Aegean Sea, Greece has allocated a large area for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort for the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal. The complex politics concerning the covert opposition of the Greek government towards the protection to the monk seals in the eastern Aegean in the late 1970s is described in a book by William Johnson. Oil companies apparently may have been using the monk seal sanctuary project as a stalking horse to encourage greater cooperation between the Greek and Turkish governments as a preliminary to pushing for oil extraction rights in a geopolitically unstable area. According to Johnson, the Greek secret service, the YPEA, were against such moves and sabotaged the project to the detriment of both the seals and conservationists, who, unaware of such covert motivations, sought only to protect the species and its habitat. One of the largest groups among the foundations concentrating their efforts towards the preservation of the Mediterranean monk seal is the Mediterranean Seal Research Group (Turkish: Akdeniz Foklarƒ±nƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rma Grubu) operating under the Underwater Research Foundation (Turkish: Sualtƒ± Ara≈ütƒ±rmalarƒ± Derneƒüi) in Turkey (also known as SAD-AFAG). The group has taken initiative in joint preservation efforts together with the Fo√ßa municipal officials, as well as phone, fax, and email hotlines for sightings.SAD-AFAG Preservation of the species requires both the preservation of land and sea, due to the need for terrestrial haul-out sites and caves or caverns for the animal to rest and reproduce. Even though responsible scuba diving instructors hesitate to make trips to known seal caves, the rumor of a seal sighting quickly becomes a tourist attraction for many. Irresponsible scuba diving trips scare the seals away from caves which could become habitation for the species. The Environment and Urbanization Minister of Turkey announced on 18 November 2019 that a plan was proposed to further preserve the species to allow the sub species of Fo√ßa, G√∂kova, Dat√ßa and Bozburun to increase in numbers. Conservation Under the auspices of the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), also known as the Bonn Convention, the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning Conservation Measures for the Eastern Atlantic Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal was concluded and came into effect on 18 October 2007. The MoU covers four range States (Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal and Spain), all of which have signed, and aims at providing a legal and institutional framework for the implementation of the Action Plan for the Recovery of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in the Eastern Atlantic. As there are indications of small population increases in the subpopulations, as of 2015, the Mediterranean monk seal's IUCN conservation status has been updated from critically endangered to endangered in keeping with the IUCN's speed-of-decline criteria, with a recommendation for re-assessment in 2020.

Themes central to the film include the occult, biker subculture, homosexuality, Catholicism, and Nazism. The film also explores the worship of rebel icons of the era, such as James Dean and Marlon Brando (referred to by Anger as Byron's \\"heroes\\"). Like many of Anger's films, the film does not contain any dialogue; it instead features a prominent soundtrack consisting of 1960s pop, including songs by Ricky Nelson, The Angels, The Crystals, Bobby Vinton, Elvis Presley, and Ray Charles. Release The film premiered in October 1963 at the Gramercy Arts Theater in New York City. When the film was screened at an art theater in Los Angeles, it was protested by the American Nazi Party on the basis that it insulted their flag. The police were ultimately called to the site and arrested the theater manager for public obscenity and canceled the film's run. The case went to the California Supreme Court, where the case was settled in Anger's favor.Interview with Kenneth Anger by Pam Grady from reel.com Anger explained in an interview: Soundtrack Scorpio Rising is considered by some to be the first drama film to feature a rock & roll soundtrack.

When it was screened in New York City in 1964, Scorpio Rising garnered additional positive reviews from The New Yorker, Variety, and Newsweek. Nora Sayre of The New York Times reviewed the film in 1975 stating, \\"Oddly enough, the references to the nineteen-fifties, which seemed dated and rather ponderous in 1965, don't make the film appear old-fashioned now.

Early life and education Benaissa was born on 3 January 1937 in Asilah, Morocco. He received a bachelor's degree in communications from the University of Minnesota in 1963, which also awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2007. Career After studying at Columbia University, Benaissa went on to serve the United Nations and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for approximately eleven years, first as press attache to the UN Moroccan Mission in New York (1965), then as information officer at the UN headquarters in New York and in Addis Ababa (1965‚Äì1967), regional information adviser for Africa at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in Accra, Ghana (1967‚Äì1971), communications adviser for the FAO at Rome (1961‚Äì1974), director of the information division at the same (1974‚Äì1976), and finally as Assistant- Secretary General at the UN World Food Conference (1974‚Äì1975). Benaissa returned to Morocco to become Member of Parliament for the city of Asilah from 1977 to 1983, and then Mayor of Asilah in 1984, a position to which he has been reelected three times up to 2010. From 1977 to 1985 he served as chief editor to Al Mithaq (Arabic) and Al Maghrib (French) dailies, the newspapers of the Rassemblement National des Ind√©pendants (RNI) party to which he then belonged. Benaissa was the Minister of Culture from 1985 to 1992, and the Moroccan Ambassador to the United States from 1993 to 1999. In April 1999, King Hassan II appointed Benaissa to the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs just three months before the former's death. Benaissa remained in his position under Hassan's successor, King Mohammed VI, until he was replaced by Foreign Minister Delegate Taieb Fassi Fihri in the government formed on 15 October 2007 under Prime Minister Abbas El Fassi.\\"Morocco Forms New Government\\", Associated Press, 15 October 2007.\\"Le roi nomme un nouveau gouvernement apr√®s des tractations difficiles\\", AFP, 15 October 2007 .

In 2010, Benaissa won the Sheikh Zayed Book Award \\"Culture Personality of the Year\\", an award worth about $300,000. Aboubakr Jama√Ø defamation suit In April 2000, Benaissa filed a defamation lawsuit against editors Aboubakr Jama√Ø and Ali Amar of the Moroccan news weekly Le Journal Hebdomadaire for a 1999 series of articles alleging that Benaissa had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States. Jama√Ø later speculated that Benaissa \\"was waiting for a signal\\" to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of a government ban. In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages to Benaissa of 2 million dirhams (US$200,000). In addition, Jama√Ø was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and Amar to two months.

It designates theories or aspects of theories that are concerned with the exploration of relationships between real and external people as well as internal images and the relations found in them. It maintains that the infant's relationship with the mother primarily determines the formation of his personality in adult life. Particularly, the need for attachment is the bedrock of the development of the self or the psychic organization that creates the sense of identity.  Theory  While object relations theory is based on psychodynamic theory, it modified it so that the role of biological drives in the formation of adult personality received less emphasis. The theory suggests that the way people relate to others and situations in their adult lives is shaped by family experiences during infancy. For example, an adult who experienced neglect or abuse in infancy would expect similar behavior from others who remind them of the neglectful or abusive parent from their past. These images of people and events turn into objects in the unconscious that the \\"self\\" carries into adulthood, and they are used by the unconscious to predict people's behavior in their social relationships and interactions. The first \\"object\\" in someone is usually an internalized image of one's mother. Internal objects are formed by the patterns in one's experience of being taken care of as a baby, which may or may not be accurate representations of the actual, external caretakers. Objects are usually internalized images of one's mother, father, or primary caregiver, although they could also consist of parts of a person such as an infant relating to the breast or things in one's inner world (one's internalized image of others). Later experiences can reshape these early patterns, but objects often continue to exert a strong influence throughout life.Greenberg, J. & Mitchell, S. (1983). Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London, England. Objects are initially comprehended in the infant mind by their functions and are termed part objects. The breast that feeds the hungry infant is the \\"good breast\\", while a hungry infant that finds no breast is in relation to the \\"bad breast\\". With a \\"good enough\\" facilitating environment, part object functions eventually transform into a comprehension of whole objects. This corresponds with the ability to tolerate ambiguity, to see that both the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" breast are a part of the same mother figure. History The initial line of thought emerged in 1917 with Ferenczi and, early in the 1930s, Sullivan, coiner of the term \\"interpersonal\\".Ogden, T. (2005). This Art of Psychoanalysis: Dreaming undreamt dreams and interrupted cries. NY: Routledge. (p. 27). British psychologists Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, Harry Guntrip, Scott Stuart, and others extended object relations theory during the 1940s and 1950s. Ronald Fairbairn in 1952 independently formulated his theory of object relations.Fairbairn, W.R.D. (1952). Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1981. The term has been used in many different contexts, which led to different connotations and denotations. While Fairbairn popularized the term \\"object relations\\", Melanie Klein's work tends to be most commonly identified with the terms \\"object relations theory\\" and \\"British object relations\\", at least in contemporary North America, though the influence of 'what is known as the British independent perspective, which argued that the primary motivation of the child is object seeking rather than drive gratification',Glen O. Gabbard, Long-Term Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (Washington, DC 2010) p. 12 is becoming increasingly recognized. Klein felt that the psychodynamic battleground that Freud proposed occurs very early in life, during infancy. Furthermore, its origins are different from those that Freud proposed. The interactions between infant and mother are so deep and intense that they form the focus of the infant's structure of drives. Some of these interactions provoke anger and frustration; others provoke strong emotions of dependence as the child begins to recognize the mother is more than a breast from which to feed. These reactions threaten to overwhelm the individuality of the infant. The way in which the infant resolves the conflict, Klein believed, is reflected in the adult's personality.Gomez, 1997 p. 12 Freud originally identified people in a subject's environment with the term \\"object\\" to identify people as the object of drives. Fairbairn took a radical departure from Freud by positing that humans were not seeking satisfaction of the drive, but actually seek the satisfaction that comes in being in relation to real others. Klein and Fairbairn were working along similar lines, but unlike Fairbairn, Klein always held that she was not departing from Freudian theory, but simply elaborating early developmental phenomena consistent with Freudian theory. Within the London psychoanalytic community, a conflict of loyalties took place between Klein and object relations theory (sometimes referred to as \\"id psychology\\"), and Anna Freud and ego psychology. In America, Anna Freud heavily influenced American psychoanalysis in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. American ego psychology was furthered in the works of Hartmann, Kris, Loewenstein, Rapaport, Erikson, Jacobson, and Mahler. In London, those who refused to choose sides were termed the \\"middle school,\\" whose members included Michael Balint and D.W. Winnicott. A certain division developed in England between the school of Anna Freud and that of Melanie Klein, which later influenced psychoanalytic politics worldwide. Klein was popularized in South America while A. Freud garnered an American allegiance. Fairbairn revised much of Freud's model of the mind. He identified how people who were abused as children internalize that experience. Fairbairn's \\"moral defense\\" is the tendency seen in survivors of abuse to take all the bad upon themselves, each believing he is morally bad so his caretaker object can be regarded as good. This is a use of splitting as a defense to maintain an attachment relationship in an unsafe world. Fairbairn introduced a four-year-old girl with a broken arm to a doctor friend of his. He told the little girl that they were going to find her a new mommy. \\"Oh no!\\" the girl cried. \\"I want my real mommy.\\" \\"You mean the mommy that broke your arm?\\" Fairbairn asked. \\"I was bad,\\" the girl replied. She needed to believe that her love object (mother) was all good, so that she could believe she would one day receive the love and nurturing she needed. If she accepted her mother was bad, then she would be bereft and alone in the world, an intolerable state. She used the Moral Defense to make herself bad, but preserve her mother's goodness. Kleinian object relations theory =Unconscious phantasy = Klein termed the psychological aspect of instinct unconscious phantasy (deliberately spelled with 'ph' to distinguish it from the word 'fantasy'). Phantasy is a given of psychic life which moves outward towards the world. These image-potentials are given a priority with the drives and eventually allow the development of more complex states of mental life. Unconscious phantasy in the infant's emerging mental life is modified by the environment as the infant has contact with reality. > From the moment the infant starts interacting with the outer world, he is > engaged in testing his phantasies in a reality setting. I want to suggest > that the origin of thought lies in this process of testing phantasy against > reality; that is, that thought is not only contrasted with phantasy, but > based on it and derived from it. The role of unconscious phantasy is essential in the development of a capacity for thinking. In Bion's terms, the phantasy image is a preconception that will not be a thought until experience combines with a realization in the world of experience. The preconception and realization combine to take form as a concept that can be thought.Bion, W. (1962) \\"A theory of thinking\\". In Second thoughts: Selected papers on psycho-analysis (pp. 111‚Äì119). London: Karnac. 1967Bion, W. (1977). Two papers: The grid and caesura. Karnac: London.Ogden, T. (1990). The matrix of the mind: Object relations and the psychoanalytic dialogue. Lanham, MD: Aronson. The classic example of this is the infant's observed rooting for the nipple in the first hours of life. The instinctual rooting is the preconception. The provision of the nipple provides the realization in the world of experience, and through time, with repeated experience, the preconception and realization combined to create the concept. Mental capacity builds upon previous experience as the environment and infant interact. > The first bodily experiences begin to build up the first memories, and > external realities are progressively woven into the texture of phantasy. > Before long, the child's phantasies are able to draw upon plastic images as > well as sensations‚Äîvisual, auditory, kin√¶sthetic, touch, taste, smell > images, etc. And these plastic images and dramatic representations of > phantasy are progressively elaborated along with articulated perceptions of > the external world.Isaacs, S. (1948). \\"The Nature and Function of Phantasy\\". > International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, v. 29, pp. 73‚Äì98 . Retrieved > December 17, 2007 from PEP Archive. With adequate care, the infant is able to tolerate increasing awareness of experience which is underlain by unconscious phantasy and leads to attainment of consecutive developmental achievements, \\"the positions\\" in Kleinian theory. =Projective identification= As a specific term, projective identification is introduced by Klein in ‚ÄúNotes on some schizoid mechanisms.‚Äù > [Projection] helps the ego to overcome anxiety by ridding it of danger and > badness. Introjection of the good object is also used by the ego as a > defense against anxiety. . . .The processes of splitting off parts of the > self and projecting them into objects are thus of vital importance for > normal development as well as for abnormal object-relation. The effect of > introjection on object relations is equally important. The introjection of > the good object, first of all the mother‚Äôs breast, is a precondition for > normal development . . . It comes to form a focal point in the ego and makes > for cohesiveness of the ego. . . . I suggest for these processes the term > ‚Äòprojective identification‚Äô. Klein imagined this function as a defense which contributes to the normal development of the infant, including ego structure and the development of object relations. The introjection of the good breast provides a location where one can hide from persecution, an early step in developing a capacity to self-soothe. Ogden identifies four functions that projective identification may serve. As in the traditional Kleinian model, it serves as a defense. Projective identification serves as a mode of communication. It is a form of object relations, and ‚Äúa pathway for psychological change.‚Äù As a form of object relationship, projective identification is a way of relating with others who are not seen as entirely separate from the individual. Instead, this relating takes place ‚Äúbetween the stage of the subjective object and that of true object relatedness‚Äù. =The paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions= The positions of Kleinian theory, underlain by unconscious phantasy, are stages in the normal development of ego and object relationships, each with its own characteristic defenses and organizational structure. The paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions occur in the pre- oedipal, oral phase of development. In contrast to Fairbairn and later Guntrip,Guntrip, H. (1975). Schizoid phenomena, object relations and the self. Madison, CT: International Universities Press. p. 21. Klein believed that both good and bad objects are introjected by the infant, the internalization of good objects being essential to the development of healthy ego function. Klein conceptualized the depressive position as ‚Äúthe most mature form of psychological organization‚Äù, which continues to develop throughout the life span.. The depressive position occurs during the second quarter of the first year. Prior to that the infant is in the paranoid-schizoid position, which is characterized by persecutory anxieties and the mechanisms of splitting, projection, introjection, and omnipotence‚Äîwhich includes idealizing and denial‚Äîto defend against these anxieties. Depressive and paranoid-schizoid modes of experience continue to intermingle throughout the first few years of childhood. Paranoid-schizoid position The paranoid-schizoid position is characterized by part object relationships. Part objects are a function of splitting, which takes place in phantasy. At this developmental stage, experience can only be perceived as all good or all bad. As part objects, it is the function that is identified by the experiencing self, rather than whole and autonomous others. The hungry infant desires the good breast who feeds it. Should that breast appear, it is the good breast. If the breast does not appear, the hungry and now frustrated infant, in its distress, has destructive phantasies dominated by oral aggression towards the bad, hallucinated breast. Klein notes that in splitting the object, the ego is also split. The infant who phantasies destruction of the bad breast is not the same infant that takes in the good breast, at least not until obtaining the depressive position, at which point good and bad can be tolerated simultaneously in the same person and the capacity for remorse and reparation ensue. The anxieties of the paranoid schizoid position are of a persecutory nature, fear of the ego's annihilation. Splitting allows good to stay separate from bad. Projection is an attempt to eject the bad in order to control through omnipotent mastery. Splitting is never fully effective, according to Klein, as the ego tends towards integration. Depressive position Klein saw the depressive position as an important developmental milestone that continues to mature throughout the life span. The splitting and part object relations that characterize the earlier phase are succeeded by the capacity to perceive that the other who frustrates is also the one who gratifies. Schizoid defenses are still in evidence, but feelings of guilt, grief, and the desire for reparation gain dominance in the developing mind. In the depressive position, the infant is able to experience others as whole, which radically alters object relationships from the earlier phase. ‚ÄúBefore the depressive position, a good object is not in any way the same thing as a bad object. It is only in the depressive position that polar qualities can be seen as different aspects of the same object.‚Äù Increasing nearness of good and bad brings a corresponding integration of ego. In a development which Grotstein terms the \\"primal split\\", the infant becomes aware of separateness from the mother. This awareness allows guilt to arise in response to the infant's previous aggressive phantasies when bad was split from good. The mother's temporary absences allow for continuous restoration of her ‚Äúas an image of representation‚Äù in the infant mind. Symbolic thought may now arise, and can only emerge once access to the depressive position has been obtained. With the awareness of the primal split, a space is created in which the symbol, the symbolized, and the experiencing subject coexist. History, subjectivity, interiority, and empathy all become possible. The anxieties characteristic of the depressive position shift from a fear of being destroyed to a fear of destroying others. In fact or phantasy, one now realizes the capacity to harm or drive away a person who one ambivalently loves. The defenses characteristic of the depressive position include the manic defenses, repression and reparation. The manic defenses are the same defenses evidenced in the paranoid-schizoid position, but now mobilized to protect the mind from depressive anxiety. As the depressive position brings about an increasing integration in the ego, earlier defenses change in character, becoming less intense and allowing for in increased awareness of psychic reality. In working through depressive anxiety, projections are withdrawn, allowing the other more autonomy, reality, and a separate existence. The infant, whose destructive phantasies were directed towards the bad mother who frustrated, now begins to realize that bad and good, frustrating and satiating, it is always the same mother. Unconscious guilt for destructive phantasies arises in response to the continuing love and attention provided by caretakers. > [As] fears of losing the loved one become active, a very important step is > made in the development. These feelings of guilt and distress now enter as a > new element into the emotion of love. They become an inherent part of love, > and influence it profoundly both in quality and quantity. From this developmental milestone come a capacity for sympathy, responsibility to and concern for others, and an ability to identify with the subjective experience of people one cares about. With the withdrawal of the destructive projections, repression of the aggressive impulses takes place. The child allows caretakers a more separate existence, which facilitates increasing differentiation of inner and outer reality. Omnipotence is lessened, which corresponds to a decrease in guilt and the fear of loss. When all goes well, the developing child is able to comprehend that external others are autonomous people with their own needs and subjectivity. Previously, extended absences of the object (the good breast, the mother) was experienced as persecutory, and, according to the theory of unconscious phantasy, the persecuted infant phantisizes destruction of the bad object. The good object who then arrives is not the object which did not arrive. Likewise, the infant who destroyed the bad object is not the infant who loves the good object. In phantasy, the good internal mother can be psychically destroyed by the aggressive impulses. It is crucial that the real parental figures are around to demonstrate the continuity of their love. In this way, the child perceives that what happens to good objects in phantasy does not happen to them in reality. Psychic reality is allowed to evolve as a place separate from the literalness of the physical world. Through repeated experience with good enough parenting, the internal image that the child has of external others, that is the child's internal object, is modified by experience and the image transforms, merging experiences of good and bad which becomes more similar to the real object (e.g. the mother, who can be both good and bad). In Freudian terms, the pleasure principle is modified by the reality principle. Melanie Klein saw this surfacing from the depressive position as a prerequisite for social life. Moreover, she viewed the establishment of an inside and an outside world as the start of interpersonal relationships. Klein argued that people who never succeed in working through the depressive position in their childhood will, as a result, continue to struggle with this problem in adult life. For example: the cause that a person may maintain suffering from intense guilt feelings over the death of a loved one, may be found in the unworked- through depressive position. The guilt is there because of a lack of differentiation between phantasy and reality. It also functions as a defense mechanism to defend the self against unbearable feelings of sadness and sorrow, and the internal object of the loved one against the unbearable rage of the self, which, it is feared, could destroy the internal object forever. Further thinking regarding the positions Wilfred Bion articulates the dynamic nature of the positions, a point emphasised by Thomas Ogden, and expanded by John Steiner in terms of '\\"The equilibrium between the paranoid-schizoid and the depressive positions\\"'.John Steiner, in Robin Anderson ed., Clinical Lectures on Klein and Bion (London 1992) p. 46-58 Ogden and James Grotstein have continued to explore early infantile states of mind, and incorporating the work of Donald Meltzer, Ester Bick and others, postulate a position preceding the paranoid-schizoid. Grotstein, following Bion, also hypothesizes a transcendent position which emerges following attainment of the depressive position. This aspect of both Ogden and Grotstein's work remains controversial for many within classical object relations theory. =Death drive= Sigmund Freud developed the concept object relation to describe or emphasize that bodily drives satisfy their need through a medium, an object, on a specific focus. The central thesis in Melanie Klein's object relations theory was that objects play a decisive role in the development of a subject and can be either part-objects or whole-objects, i.e. a single organ (a mother's breast) or a whole person (a mother). Consequently, both a mother or just the mother's breast can be the focus of satisfaction for a drive. Furthermore, according to traditional psychoanalysis, there are at least two types of drives, the libido (mythical counterpart: Eros), and the death drive, mortido (mythical counterpart: Thanatos). Thus, the objects can be receivers of both love and hate, the affective effects of the libido and the death drive. Ronald Fairbairn's six ego positions Fairbairn posited six ego positions or inner voices, or 3 pairs: * The Whole Ego relating to the Good Object, is the healthy inner child relating to the patient and nurturing inner parent. This is the part of the inner world that object relations therapists try to expand and grow. * The Antilibidinal Ego relating to the Bad Object, is the depressed, angry or hopeless inner child relating to the rejecting or neglectful inner parent. Whenever someone speaks in a tantrum-like way they are speaking from the Antilibidinal Ego, and they are speaking to the Bad Object. Whenever someone is overly critical and harshly judgmental they are speaking from the Bad Object part of their personality, and are speaking to the Antilibidinal Ego (hopeless inner child). * The Libidinal Ego relating to the Exciting Object, is the gullible and overly hopeful inner child relating to the exciting over-promising inner parent. Whenever a person goes back to their cheating or abusive spouse they are operating from their Libidinal Ego and relating to the Exciting Object in their inner worlds. Whenever they are in an addiction they are treating whatever they are addicted to as if it were an Exciting Object. The Fairbairnian object relations therapist imagines that all interactions between the client and the therapist are occurring in the client's inner object relations world, in one of the three dyads. If the client thinks the therapist is wise and compassionate the therapist sees this as an interaction between the client's Libidinal Ego and Exciting Object. If the client is angry at the therapist for not meeting the client's needs, the therapist might see it as an interaction between the client's Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object. The therapist might ask the client if this particular interaction reminds the client of something from childhood. The Fairbairnian object relations therapist also uses his/her own emotional reactions as therapeutic cues. If the therapist is feeling irritated at the client, or bored, he/she might interpret that as a re-enactment of the Antilibidinal Ego and the Bad Object, with the therapist cast in the role of Bad Object. If the therapist can patiently be an empathic therapist through the client's re- enactment, then the client has a new experience to incorporate into their inner object world, hopefully expanding their inner picture of their Good Object. Cure is seen as the client being able to receive from their inner Good Object often enough to have a more stable peaceful life. The Fairbairnian object relations Therapist also uses their mistakes in the therapy. If the therapist has absent mindedly made a mistake that hurts the client, the therapist admits the mistake, and empathizes with the client's pain, but instead of apologizing, the therapist asks: How did this mistake in therapy re-enact a childhood scene? Numerous research studies have found that most all models of psychotherapy are equally helpful, the difference mainly being the quality of the individual therapist, not the theory the therapist subscribes to. Object Relations Theory attempts to explain this phenomenon via the theory of the Good Object. If a therapist can be patient and empathic, most clients improve their functioning in their world. The client carries with them a picture of the empathic therapist that helps them cope with the stressors of daily life, regardless of what theory of psychology they subscribe to. Continuing developments in the theory Attachment theory, researched by John Bowlby and others, has continued to deepen our understanding of early object relationships. While a different strain of psychoanalytic theory and research, the findings in attachment studies have continued to support the validity of the developmental progressions described in object relations. Recent decades in developmental psychological research, for example on the onset of a \\"theory of mind\\" in children, has suggested that the formation of the mental world is enabled by the infant-parent interpersonal interaction which was the main thesis of British object-relations tradition (e.g. Fairbairn, 1952). While object relations theory grew out of psychoanalysis, it has been applied to the general fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy by such authors as N. Gregory Hamiltonhttp://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=166427 American Journal of Psychiatry article\\\\ and Glen O. Gabbard. In making object relations theory more useful as a general psychology N. Gregory Hamilton added the specific ego functions to Otto F. Kernberg's concept of object relations units.Hamilton, N.G.

Development Afterburner - concentric ring structure inside the exhaust In 1967, the United States Navy and United States Air Force issued a joint engine Request for Proposals (RFP) for the F-14 Tomcat and the FX. (The FX became the parallel fighter design competition that led to the F-15 Eagle in 1970.) This engine program was called the IEDP (Initial Engine Development Program). It was funded and managed out of the Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD) at Wright Patterson AFB. Under ASD, a Systems Project Office Cadre was assigned to manage both the FX Aircraft and Engine definition phase. The Turbine Engine Division of the Air Force Propulsion Laboratory was employed in a support role to assist ASD Systems Engineering in evaluations of technical risks. Later upon selection of the F-15 the ASD engineering cadre became the F-15 Systems Project Office. Adjustable exhaust nozzle contracted The IEDP was created to be a competitive engine design/demonstration phase followed with a down select to one winning engine design and development program. General Electric and Pratt Whitney were placed on contract for an approximately 18-month program with goals to improve thrust and reduce weight to achieve a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8. At the end of the IEDP, GE and PW submitted proposals for their engine candidates for the Aircraft that had been selected in the FX Competition. That Fighter was the McDonnell F-15 Fighter. The engine was designated the Pratt Whitney F-100 engine. The Air Force would award Pratt & Whitney a contract in 1970 to develop and produce F100-PW-100 (USAF) and F401-PW-400 (USN) engines. The Navy would cut back and later cancel its order, choosing to continue to use the Pratt & Whitney TF30 engine from the F-111 in its F-14.Davies, Steve. Combat Legend, F-15 Eagle and Strike Eagle.

Due to the advanced nature of engine and aircraft, numerous problems were encountered in its early days of service including high wear, stalling and \\"hard\\" afterburner starts. These \\"hard\\" starts could be caused by failure of the afterburner to start or by extinguishing after start, in either case the large jets of jet fuel were lit by the engine exhaust resulting in high pressure waves causing the engine to stall. Early problems were solved in the F100-PW-220, and the engine is still in the USAF fleet to this day. =F100-PW-200= The F-16 Fighting Falcon entered service with the F100-200, with only slight differences from the -100. Seeking a way to drive unit costs down, the USAF implemented the Alternative Fighter Engine (AFE) program in 1984, under which the engine contract would be awarded through competition. The F-16C/D Block 30/32s were the first to be built with the common engine bay, able to accept the existing engine or the General Electric F110. =F100-PW-220/220E= Due to the unsatisfactory reliability, maintenance costs, and service life of the F100-PW-100/200, Pratt & Whitney was eventually pressured into upgrading the engine to address these issues. The resulting engine, designated F100-PW-220, almost eliminates stall-stagnations and augmenter instability as well as doubling time between depot overhauls. Reliability and maintenance costs were also drastically improved, and the engine incorporates a digital electronic engine control (DEEC). The F100-PW-220 was introduced in 1986 and could be installed on either an F-15 or F-16. A non-afterburning variant, the F100-PW-220U powers the Northrop Grumman X-47B UCAV. The \\"E\\" abbreviation from 220E is for equivalent. The abbreviation is given to engines which have been upgraded from series 100 or 200 to 220, thus becoming equivalent to 220 specifications. =F100-PW-229= The first -229 was flown in 1989 and has a thrust of (dry thrust) and with afterburner. It currently powers late model F-16s and F-15Es.

The enrollment is currently around 6,800 students. Lewis offers more than 80 undergraduate majors and programs of study, 22 graduate programs, and accelerated programs for working adults. History Lewis University was founded in 1932 by the Archdiocese of Chicago and Bishop Bernard J. Scheil as the Holy Name Technical School. The school gets its name from philanthropist Frank J. Lewis who funded the construction of many of the school's buildings. During these early days, aviation technology courses were chosen as the special emphasis of instruction, becoming the origin of today's highly regarded Department of Aviation and Transportation Studies. The school was incorporated in 1934 under the name Lewis Holy Name Technical School. In 1935, it became Lewis Holy Name School of Aeronautics, a name which is engraved in stone on the building now known as the Philip Lynch Theatre at the Oremus Fine Arts Center. During World War II, normal classes were suspended as the campus was given to the United States Navy to train pilots. The campus is adjacent to the Lewis University Airport. Regular classes resumed in late 1944 and the college soon adopted a more traditional arts and science curriculum. Women were admitted for the first time in 1949. Three years later the school's name was changed to the Lewis College of Science and Technology. The school's name was shortened to simply Lewis College in 1962 and finally received its current name of Lewis University in 1973. In 2004 and 2005, Lewis enrolled more than 5,000 total students. Lewis‚Äô strengths as an institution of higher learning have been evidenced through various sources. The University has been cited as one of the best colleges in the region by both The Princeton Review and U.S. News and World Report. The University is included in the top tier of U.S. News and World Report's rankings of the best Midwest master's-level universities, most recently ranked in the Top 20. The Princeton Review named Lewis one of the \\"Best Midwestern Colleges,\\" with Lewis being ranked among a select list of 23 Illinois colleges and 158 Midwest institutions. In 2019, Lewis University offered more than 80 undergraduate majors and programs of study, an accelerated degree completion option for working adults, various aviation programs, and 35 graduate programs. The University also offers degree programs in Albuquerque, New Mexico. On February 8, 2016, the Lewis University Presidential Search Committee and Board of Trustees selected David J. Livingston, PhD, then president of Lourdes University in Sylvania, Ohio, to replace Brother James Gaffney, FSC as the 10th President of the university. Livingston succeeded Brother Gaffney, who retired June 30, 2016, after 28 years of leadership and service to Lewis University and its students.

Maj. Gen. James L. Bradley commanded the 96th Infantry Division throughout its entire life in World War II. His Assistant Division Commander (ADC), Brig. Gen. Maj. General Claudius M. Easley (killed in action on Okinawa on 19 June 1945), personally supervised and emphasized the 96th Division's marksmanship training, leading to the 96th's nickname of \\"Deadeye Division\\". The 96th Infantry Division trained in Hawaiian Islands, July to September 1944, before entering combat in an assault landing in Leyte Gulf, Philippine Islands, between Tanauan and Dulag, 20 October 1944. Enemy resistance in the beachhead area was quickly broken and the Division had advanced to and secured the Tanauan-Dagami-Tabontabon sector by 9 November after heavy fighting. The Division continued to wipe out resistance on the island, engaging in small unit actions, patrolling, probing, and wiping out pockets of Japanese. Chalk Ridge was taken, 12 December 1944, and major organized resistance was at an end by Christmas Day. The next 3 months were spent in mopping up, security duty, training, and loading for the coming invasion of Okinawa. The Division left the Philippines, 27 March 1945, for Okinawa, making an assault landing on the island, 1 April 1945. The landing was unopposed and a beachhead was established near Sunabe, 1‚Äì3 April. Resistance stiffened considerably as the Division advanced to Kakazu Ridge, where fighting was fierce, 7‚Äì16 April. The 96th assaulted and cracked the fanatically defended enemy defense line, Tanabaru Nishibaru, 17‚Äì23 April, and after advancing slightly against extremely determined resistance, was relieved, 30 April, by the 77th Infantry Division. The Division trained and rested, 1‚Äì9 May, while elements mopped up bypassed enemy pockets and then returned to the offensive, 10 May, attacking and capturing Conical-Sugar Hill Ridge, 21 May, thus breaking the right flank of the Shuri defenses. Heavy rains the following week slowed down the advance. The offensive was resumed, 30 May, against weakening enemy resistance; Japanese north of Yonabaru-Shuri- Naha Road area were cleared out. Resistance stiffened again, 3 June, and Laura Hill was taken, 14 June 1945, only after a bloody fight; the last important Japanese defense position, the Yuza-Dake, Yaeju-Dake Hill mass, was secured by 17 June, and on 22 June all resistance was declared at an end. The Division patrolled an area from Chan to Ogusuku until 30 June. After resting in July, the Division left Okinawa for Mindoro, in the Philippines, and engaged in a training program. The Division left the Philippines, 17 January 1946, for the United States.  Postwar  The division commenced its Army Reserve role in December 1946, commanded by Colonel Ross J. Wilson of Kalispell, Montana.History of the 96th Infantry Division and 96th Army Reserve Command The division headquarters was Fort Missoula, Montana. Major units were located at Great Falls, Montana, Phoenix, Arizona, and Salt Lake City. The division appears to have kept the 381st, 382nd, and 383rd Infantry Regiments. In August 1948, Colonel LeRoy H. Anderson of Conrad, Montana was appointed as the Commander. The headquarters moved to Helena, Montana, and then transferred to Fort Douglas, Utah in 1962. Major General Michael B. Kauffman was named commander, followed by Brigadier General Ray D. Free. The division was inactivated in December 1965, although some elements of the division remained active within the newly activated 191st Infantry Brigade. On 22 December 1967, the Department of the Army announced that Salt Lake City, Utah had been chosen as the site for one of the eighteen new nationwide Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) headquarters. The ARCOM would command all Army Reserve units in Utah, Idaho and Montana. In March 1968, the numbers \\"96\\" were assigned to the command. Also in March the 259th Quartermaster Battalion, an ARCOM unit in Pleasant Grove, Utah was ordered to active duty. In September, the 259th transferred overseas for duty in Vietnam and served with distinction, being awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation. It was released from active duty on 18 September 1969. Sterling R. Ryser succeeded Major General Free as ARCOM commander in early 1969. In 1971 with the consolidation of Fourth and Fifth Army areas, the 96th ARCOM's span of command was increased to include North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Colorado. In 1973 the command was again reorganized, gaining the state of New Mexico and losing North and South Dakota. Since 1974, 96th ARCOM units have trained with their regular Army counterparts throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. Franklin McKean was appointed Commanding General in 1975, followed by Larry Morris in 1979. In 1984, the ARCOM was again reorganized, losing New Mexico and regaining North and South Dakota. Richard O. Christiansen was appointed as Commanding General. In 1985, the 96th ARCOM was geographically the largest Army Reserve Command in the United States. The ARCOM consisted of 94 units and 9,320 reservists, augmented by 243 full-time soldiers and 288 civilian employees. On 9 April 1989 Donald M. Bagley was appointed Commanding General. In 1991, 3rd Battalion, 87th Infantry Regiment, located in Colorado, was mobilized for security duties in Germany during the Gulf War.Thomas D. Dinackus, 2000, 10-2. In 1993 MG Richard F. Reeder assumed command of the 96th ARCOM. In 1996, as part of the US Army Reserve Command restructuring, the 96th ARCOM became the 96th Regional Support Command. After the end of the Cold War, the command was finally redesignated the 96th Regional Readiness Command. Subordinate units of the 96th RRC have been deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Djibouti in support of the Global War on Terror from 2001. Units have also been deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of peacekeeping operations in the Balkans. Effective 17 September 2008, the unit became the 96th Sustainment Brigade, with its headquarters located at Fort Douglas, Salt Lake City, Utah. The 96th Sustainment Brigade deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2009. The brigade returned to the United States in May, 2010. In 2015, members of the headquarters element mobilized in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, providing support to Special Operations Command Central, and returned to the U.S. in April, 2016.

It was formerly made of low expansion borosilicate glass and ideal for oven use. Currently it is made of tempered soda-lime-silicate glass. History Fire-King was originally produced in the 1940s for everyday use, rather than display. It was often sold in bags of flour as a promotional item or was given away at gas stations. Fire-King could also be purchased at local grocery and hardware stores. Several varieties of Fire King dishes were made; nesting bowls, dessert bowls, glass beverage containers, casserole dishes, mugs and more. The vintage nesting bowls, produced by the Anchor Hocking Company, are one of the most sought after collectible dishes of this type. Products The Fire-King line includes bowls, casseroles, cups, plates, serving platters, creamers, vases and more. Fire-King is not designed for dishwasher use, which can dull its original lustre and remove any applied paint decorations. Patterns and colors There are many decalled patterns that are very popular including Blue Mosaic, Wheat, Primrose, Fleurette, Forget Me Not and Anniversary Rose.

Commonly known as Memorial Stadium, it is the home field for the University of California Golden Bears of the Pac-12 Conference. The venue opened in 1923 and currently seats around 63,000 fans for football. The playing field runs NW-SE, at an elevation of 410 feet (125 m) above sea level. It has been named one of the top college football stadiums by various publications, and it was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on November 27, 2006. Memorial Stadium was funded from public contributions, as a memorial to Californians who lost their lives in World War I (1917‚Äì18). The chair of the architectural committee was John Galen Howard, the university's chief architect, and his influence is evident in the stadium's neoclassical motif. In addition to its unique architecture, the stadium's position at the foot of the Berkeley hills provides top row spectators with panoramic views of San Francisco Bay and west side viewers with views of the Berkeley Hills and Strawberry Canyon. This has earned it a reputation as one of the most scenic venues in college football. Traditionally, during all football games and especially during the Big Game against Stanford, the hill overlooking the eastern side of Memorial Stadium attracts spectators hoping to watch a game for free, earning the nickname \\"Tightwad Hill\\". Before Memorial Stadium =West Field= On February 14, 1885, the first football game was played on the University of California campus between the hometown Bears and a football club from San Francisco known as the Merions. The field was located where the Valley Life Sciences Building currently stands and the game drew some 450 people. In subsequent years, the field was officially named West Field and was expanded to hold around 5,000 spectators. However, by 1904, California's football team had become so popular that West Field became too small, therefore, the university decided to build a new stadium with an excess of 20,000 seats. =California Field= California Field opened its doors in 1904 to replace the antiquated West Field and the boosted capacity allowed California to host important games for the first time. While playing at West Field, the Bears played important games (namely the Big Game) at neutral site venues in San Francisco and with a new over 20,000 seat stadium, California was able to host the first Big Game played outside of San Francisco. The new stadium was located much closer to the center of campus (where Hearst Gymnasium now stands) and was able to draw unprecedented crowds for the time. California Field is also notable because it is where many of California's longstanding traditions began to take form. In 1910, the first card stunt was performed at the Big Game and after victories, the students would \\"serpentine\\" around the field‚Äîsomething that is mentioned in the song \\"Big C\\". California Field is also where the Golden Bears gained national prominence under head coach Andrew Latham Smith. Four of the Bears' five consecutive undefeated seasons were played at California Field and housed the stadium was home to three of California's four straight national championships. Because of this success, it became evident that California needed an even larger venue to host its football team, therefore, the team and its fans began pushing for a new stadium. =The drive to build Memorial Stadium= The early 1920s saw four major collegiate venues open in the State of California: Stanford Stadium, the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, and California Memorial Stadium. With the success of the California football program and the openings of the new football venues for Stanford and USC, the campus community was nearly unanimous in its desire to see the Bears get a new stadium of their own. One of the first proposals for a new stadium was on the south-western corner of the campus where Edwards Stadium and Evans Diamond currently stand. This proposal was eventually rejected and the regents settled on a site at the mouth of Strawberry Canyon. The location caused considerable controversy, with objections rising from local community arguing that it would \\"ruin the beauty of the canyon, destroy the canyon as a natural biological laboratory for the University, and create traffic and transportation problems.\\" There were also protests from homeowners whose homes would be demolished, as well as those whose views would be blocked by the building. However, the popularity of Andy Smith's \\"Wonder Teams\\" prevailed and fundraising began in 1922. The $1 million stadium was funded completely by 10,000 seat subscriptions at $100 per subscription, the fundraising drive through these subscriptions was a complete success having sold out in less than ten days. WIth the funding secured, the university broke ground in January 1923 hoping to open the new stadium in time for the 1923 Big Game. = Construction = Because the stadium would be directly atop the Hayward Fault, it was constructed out of two halves, the eastern side was built into the hills, while the west side contained the main structure built in the neo- classical architecture style to resemble the Roman Coliseum. Expansion joints were placed where the two sides connected, allowing them to separately move during an earthquake. During the construction 2,500 pine trees were planted on what became known as the Tightwad Hill. Original California Memorial Stadium: 1923‚Äì2010 =History= none California played its first seven games of the 1923 season at old California Field preparing to open the new 75,000 seat stadium at Strawberry Canyon for the final game of the season‚Äîthe Big Game‚Äîagainst Stanford. Both teams were having a good season in 1923 with California going undefeated up to that point (with a tie to Nevada) and Stanford going into the Big Game with a record of 7‚Äì1. Leading up to the first game at Memorial Stadium, some in the media suggested to Bears coach Andy Smith that the opening of new stadiums was cursed: Stanford lost the first game played at Stanford Stadium while USC lost the inaugural game of both the Rose Bowl and the Los Angeles Coliseum. Smith simply replied, \\"Why, of course they did, it was always California they invited to help dedicate their stadiums.\\" The Bears went on to win the inaugural game at California Memorial Stadium by a final score of 9‚Äì0, beating Stanford for the fifth straight year and securing their fourth straight undefeated season. When California Memorial Stadium opened in 1923, the permanent capacity of the venue was around 75,000 and expandable to around 85,000. For important games, the university would bring out temporary bleachers that would stand around the eastern rim of the stadium. It was during this time, that California set their all-time attendance record in 1947 with an announced crowd of 83,000 for a game against Navy. As the California football team's fortunes on the field began to fall in the second half of the century and there was a demand for wheelchair seating along the eastern rim, the university did away with the temporary bleachers bringing the stadium's maximum football capacity back down to the permanent capacity of 75,000. Due to the seismic vulnerability of the old press box, the University of California dismantled the structure and installed a temporary facility that stood until the 2010 season. The installation of the temporary press box brought the stadium's capacity down to 73,347 and then down to 72,516 for the 2004 season. California brought the seating capacity further down to 67,537 with tarps being placed over four sections (one in each corner). The university did remove the tarps, however, for important games allowing a full 72,516 to attend. Because of safety concerns, the university brought the capacity down to 71,799 for the 2008 season. After the 2010 season, the entire west side of the bowl was demolished and rebuilt. The stands in the original stadium descended right down to the football field, and the view from the lowest midfield seats on the west side could be blocked by the standing visiting team members. To eliminate this problem, the surface of the field was lowered four feet to allow unobstructed seats in the first few rows during the 2010-12 renovation. The capacity of the refurbished stadium is now 63,186, and was sold out for the first game of the 2012 season in a 31-24 Cal loss against the University of Nevada Wolf Pack. =Capacity= Satellite view, November 2008 *2013‚Äìpresent: 62,467 *2012: 63,186 *2008‚Äì2010: 71,799 *2006‚Äì2007: 72,516 *2003‚Äì2005: 67,537 (expandable to 72,516) *2002: 73,347 *1998‚Äì2001: 75,028 *1996‚Äì1997: 74,909 *1982‚Äì1995: 75,662 *1961‚Äì1981: 76,780 *1951‚Äì1960: 81,490 *1949‚Äì1950: 80,239 *1938‚Äì1948: 80,000 *1937: 77,963 *1927‚Äì1936: 78,461 *1926: 78,671 *1923‚Äì1925: 72,609 =Other major events= California Memorial Stadium has seen a number of major events throughout the years other than California football. Before 1970, the general commencement exercises of the University of California was regularly held at Memorial Stadium. The large campus-wide commencement, however, was cancelled in 1970 because of the many protests that were taking place at the time‚Äîuniversity officials at the time did not see it wise to have such a large gathering annually with the protests going on. General Commencements have since returned to the University of California campus, with the exercises being performed at Memorial Stadium, Haas Pavilion, Hearst Greek Theatre, and most recently Edwards Stadium. On March 23, 1962, to commemorate Charter Day (the anniversary of the founding of the University of California), President John F. Kennedy gave a speech at Memorial Stadium in front of an above capacity crowd of 88,000. Real Madrid and Inter Milan played at Memorial Stadium on July 26, 2014, one of their matches in the 2014 International Champions Cup. The match, played before a sold-out crowd of 62,583, ended in a 1-1 tie after regulation and Inter Milan won the shootout 3-2.Inter Edges Real Madrid in Penalty Kick Shootout ICC.com July 26, 2014 Retrieved July 27, 2014 The usual artificial turf was converted and this match was played on natural grass. Oakland Raiders The NFL's Oakland Raiders played their second game of the 1973 regular season at Memorial Stadium. The game against the defending Super Bowl champion Miami Dolphins was moved from the Raiders' regular home, the Oakland Coliseum, because of a scheduling conflict with the Oakland Athletics, who hosted the Minnesota Twins at the Coliseum the following night. The Raiders ended the Dolphins' NFL record 18-game winning streak with a 12-7 victory on four field goals by 45-year-old George Blanda on September 23. Several preseason games were also played at the stadium in the early 1970s. Ultimately, in response to traffic and parking issues associated with these games (while Cal games drew a large number of students who live on or near campus and walk to the games, Raider games attracted fans from a larger geographic area who were used to tailgating at the Coliseum and were more likely to drive to games), the City of Berkeley passed a Professional Sports Events License Tax in which the city collected 10% of all gate receipts, making the staging of professional games inside the city cost-prohibitive. The Raiders were granted an injunction from the city collecting the tax, arguing that the tax was a regulatory measure rather than a revenue measure, and was therefore an improper regulation on land held in trust by the Regents of the University of California. However, the grant of the injunction was reversed by the California Court of Appeals, who found it to be a revenue measure, despite the fact that the city had made the measure immediately effective \\"due to danger to the public peace, health, and safety of the City of Berkeley as a result of the holding of professional sports events there.\\" =Playing surface= Originally a natural grass field, AstroTurf was installed in Memorial Stadium in 1981 and remained for 14 seasons. Natural grass returned for the 1995 season. During this return, the varsity football practices were held at Witter Rugby Field, saving the stadium's grass field for game days only. In 2003 artificial turf was re-installed with Momentum Turf, an infilled artificial turf, similar to FieldTurf. The Momentum Turf surface allowed for minimal maintenance and increased utilization of the stadium, for football practices and other sports, on the space-limited UC Berkeley campus. Memorial Stadium's field is also marked for international soccer, but this allows little reserve room beyond the official lines. Renovation: 2010‚Äì2012 =Need for renovation= Due to creeping of the Hayward fault, the stadium walls were slowly separating The Hayward Fault passes directly under the playing field of Memorial Stadium (nearly from goal post to goal post.), where right-lateral strike-slip motion is shifting the east half of the building to the south at a rate of 1.2 mm/yr; during its construction, expansion joints have been placed in the walls of the stadium to maintain the integrity of the building. A 1998 seismic safety study on the California campus gave the stadium a \\"poor\\" rating (meaning that the building represents an \\"appreciable life hazard\\" in an earthquake), and estimated the cost of making the structure safe at $14 million. Because the stadium is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places and because of the nostalgia that surrounds the site, the university decided that a retrofit and renovation (as opposed to building a new stadium elsewhere) would be the best scenario for the California football program. In February 2005, Chancellor Robert Birgeneau announced plans to renovate Memorial Stadium, improving the existing facilities and creating a safer environment for the fans as well as the people that work at the stadium. HNTB Architecture and STUDIOS Architecture were the architects for the renovation of the stadium and the new Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance. =Phase I= Phase I consisted of building the Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance next to the west wall of the stadium. The center was built to be the home of football and 12 of California's Olympic sports that were previously housed in Memorial Stadium. The center saw the construction of new locker rooms, offices meeting rooms, training and sports medicine facilities, and an academic center in the SAHPC. The roof of the athletic center also acts as a pedestrian plaza. Phase I of the renovations were originally scheduled to begin the spring and summer of 2006 but was delayed by a court injunction due to three lawsuits against the project. A small group of tree-sitters occupied the oak grove on the west side of the stadium beginning on the \\"Big Game\\" day in December 2006 but in September 2008 the court injunction was lifted, the protesters came down, and construction of the athletic center began. The Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance (originally SAHPC) opened in the Fall of 2011 and became 100% operational in January 2012. =Phase II= Progress of the refurbishing after the final football game in December 2010, from Tightwad Hill On January 19, 2010, the UC Board of Regents approved the retrofit and renovation of California Memorial Stadium. The $321 million project commenced in June 2010 and was completed in time for the 2012 season. The Bears played at AT&T; Park in San Francisco for the 2011 season while the renovations were being made. The west side of the stadium was demolished and rebuilt except for the outer wall. Club levels, a new press box, bathrooms and concession stands were added. The surface of the field was lowered four feet to improve the view from the lowest midfield seats on the west side, which previously were blocked by standing visiting team members. A surface rupture block was placed in each end zone where the fault line passes through the stadium. These blocks can move independently from the rest of the stadium and were built on top of three feet of sand and plastic sheets. Expansion joints were placed between the surface rupture blocks and the rest of the stadium. =Phase III= Phase III of the Memorial Stadium renovation and retrofit is the renovation of the stadium's east side by adding modern amenities to that side of the stadium. Originally, this part of the project was to begin in the Fall of 2009, but because of the delay of phase II, the east side's improvements have been delayed indefinitely. The eventual improvements on the east side of the stadium called for an extension of the concourse to wrap around the stadium, new restrooms, ADA seating, and vendors. Renovation financing Construction progress in June 2011 For the stadium's $321 million renovation and a new $153 million Student-Athlete High Performance Center, the university incurred a controversial $445 million of debt which it planned to finance with the sale of special stadium seats in the Endowment Seating Program. Before the start of the stadium reconstruction, Professor Brian Barsky showed that the financial plan was unrealistic and calculated that although $215 million had been claimed to have been raised as of Jan. 15, 2010, the true figure was closer to only about $20 million as of Dec. 2010, and that the total financial obligation including interest would exceed a billion dollars. His calculations were subsequently corroborated by the Wall Street Journal which reported in April 2012 that only $31 million had been received as of the end of Dec. 2011; this was followed by further reporting of poor seat sales in the Endowment Seating Program. As of June 30, 2016, the fund balance was $60.98 million, far short of the $215 million that had been claimed five years earlier. The roughly $18 million interest-only annual payments on the debt consumes 20% of Cal's athletics' budget and 15% of the campus structural deficit; principal repayment begins in 2032 when the annual debt payment will rise to about $26 million per year, about $28 million in 2033, about $30 million per year for 2034-2038, and about $37 million per year for 2039-2044. The debt payments are scheduled to continue for one hundred years from its 2013 inception, concluding in 2113. On November 3 2017, Chancellor Carol Christ announced that the university would overtake the earthquake retrofitting expenses part of the renovation. This amount is estimated to be approximately 60 percent of the total expenses or $200 million with the remaining expenses still being retained by the athletic department. Exactly where in the budget the funds would be taken was not announced, although the chancellor did state that they would not be taken out of student tuition or tax-payer funds for the university. It was not ruled out that the money could be taken out of funds for academic departments. Renovated California Memorial Stadium: 2012‚Äìpresent =Opening ceremony= The stadium during the 2012 football season The University of California reopened the stadium on September 1, 2012, for a home football game against the University of Nevada. This was the first football game in Berkeley since the end of the 2010 season. The sellout crowd of 63,186 watched the Nevada Wolf Pack spoil the grand re-opening with a 31-24 victory, Cal's first loss to Nevada at home since before the original stadium opened in 1923. There were many noticeable differences between the new, more modern stadium and the old stadium that closed in 2010. Except the historic fa√ßade entire west side of the stadium was demolished, allowing the university to make the venue seismically safe, and add modern amenities. Most noticeable changes included club along with a new pressbox, atop the western stands. The east side, however, has remained relatively unchanged. The stadium was originally dedicated to the memory of those Californians that were lost in World War I, and on October 6, 2012, the university rededicated California Memorial Stadium in the memory of all Californians who sacrificed their lives in service to the nation. =Capacity= Because of the inclusion of seat back and bench back seating in the same footprint as before, the renovation and retrofit reduced the seating capacity by around 10,000 seats. Original estimates stated that the official stadium capacity would be around 63,000‚Äì65,000, down from the 71,799 capacity that Memorial Stadium had in 2010. Capacity at the beginning of the 2012 season ended up at 63,186. 2012‚Äìpresent: 63,186 Estimate during construction: 62,717 =Playing surface= The playing field was lowered to improve sight lines, and surfaced with Matrix Turf, an artificial turf with crumb rubber infill along with a silica pea gravel base to allow improved field drainage. In 2017, the playing surface was changed to FieldTurf as part of Cal's transition to its new partnership with Under Armour.

Other modules add toolbars to Internet Explorer, such as the Alexa Toolbar that provides a list of web sites related to the one you are currently browsing, or the Google Toolbar that adds a toolbar with a Google search box to the browser user interface. The Conduit toolbars are based on a BHO that can be used on Internet Explorer 7 and up. This BHO provides a search facility that connects to Microsoft's Bing search.  Concerns  The BHO API exposes hooks that allow the BHO to access the Document Object Model (DOM) of the current page and to control navigation. Because BHOs have unrestricted access to the Internet Explorer event model, some forms of malware have also been created as BHOs. One type of Malware that targets the page is C2.LOP For example, the Download.ject malware installs a BHO that would activate upon detecting a secure HTTP connection to a financial institution, record the user's keystrokes (intending to capture passwords) and transmit the information to a website used by Russian computer criminals. Other BHOs such as the MyWay Searchbar track users' browsing patterns and pass the information they record to third parties. Many BHOs introduce visible changes to a browser's interface, such as installing toolbars in Internet Explorer and the like, but others run without any change to the interface. This renders it easy for malicious coders to conceal the actions of their browser add-on, especially since, after being installed, the BHO seldom requires permission before performing further actions. For instance, variants of the ClSpring trojan use BHOs to install scripts to provide a number of instructions to be performed such as adding and deleting registry values and downloading additional executable files, all completely transparently to the user.Computer Associates malware entry at ca.com, retrieved 1/16/2009 The DyFuCA spyware even replaces Internet Explorer's general error page with an ad page. In response to the problems associated with BHOs and similar extensions to Internet Explorer, Microsoft debuted an Add-on Manager in Internet Explorer 6 with the release of Service Pack 2 for Windows XP (updating it to IE6 Security Version 1, a.k.a. SP2). This utility displays a list of all installed BHOs, browser extensions and ActiveX controls, and allows the user to enable or disable them at will. There are also free tools (such as BHODemon) that list installed BHOs and allow the user to disable malicious extensions. Spybot S&D; advanced mode has a similar tool built in to allow the user to disable installed BHOs.

It is primarily an undergraduate institution, having for example a liberal arts program, but also features graduate programs. Total enrollment exceeds 14,000 students, with over 12,000 undergraduate students and nearly 2,000 graduate students. Northern Kentucky University is the third largest university, behind the University of Cincinnati and Miami University, of Greater Cincinnati's four large universities and the youngest of Kentucky's eight, although it joined the state system before the University of Louisville. Notable among the university's programs are the Salmon P. Chase College of Law and the College of Informatics, founded in 2006. History Northern Kentucky University's \\"Loch Norse\\" and University Center =Early history= Northern Kentucky University began in 1948, when an extension campus for the University of Kentucky was opened in Covington, Kentucky, known as the UK Northern Extension Center. After 20 years in operation as an extension center for UK, it became an autonomous four-year college under the name Northern Kentucky State College (NKSC). In 1970, Dr. W. Frank Steely was hired as the first president.\\"Northern Kentucky University\\" by Will Frank Steely, The Kentucky Encyclopedia (University Press of Kentucky, 1992): 684-685. The following year, the Salmon P. Chase College of Law, formerly an independent law school in Cincinnati, merged with Northern Kentucky State College. The main campus moved from Covington to Highland Heights, Kentucky, in 1972. NKSC awarded its first bachelor's degrees in May 1973. Rapid expansion resulted in the school being upgraded to university status in 1976.Google cached page from NKU 2007 catalog =Recent history= Since its founding in 1968 and elevation to university status in 1976, Northern Kentucky University has expanded with numerous construction projects, new colleges and a much larger, more diverse student body. One recent former president of the university, James C. Votruba, is largely credited with transforming the image of the university since his arrival in 1997, helping to build the university's reputation as a respected academic institution. As part of Votruba's administration, the university has increased its admissions standards and improved the academic performance of its students. Northern Kentucky University also launched a new university logo and branding effort in 2002. In recent years, the university has also concentrated on the construction of new and improved facilities across campus. =Presidents= * W.

The campus was built beginning in the early 1970s, and the first building, Nunn Hall, opened in 1972. Although most of the university's students commute daily to the campus, approximately 2,000 students live on campus. In recent years, the university has been in the process of expanding its campus and facilities. The $60 million BB&T; Arena is a recently completed 9,400-seat arena. It serves as the primary venue for athletics on campus, and also as a venue for entertainment, such as live bands and concerts. The arena was originally known as The Bank of Kentucky Center, named after The Bank of Kentucky, which made an endowment of $5 million toward construction. The name was changed in 2015 when that bank was purchased by BB&T.; Additionally, a new $37 million, Student Union building, which opened to students in August 2008, largely replaces an old university center and is designed to accommodate student needs on campus. The building includes cafeterias, stores, a game room, offices for student life programs, and other amenities for students. Other recent projects included the construction of a new parking garage to accommodate the arena and a European-style roundabout for traffic control and flow management. The most recent university master plan envisions a massive expansion of the campus by the year 2020, including multiple new academic buildings, housing developments, campus quad areas, athletic fields, parking lots and connector roads. The Landrum Academic Center houses an Anthropology Museum. The university campus is also the first educational institute in the world to have a laser-projection planetarium, as part of the Dorothy Westerman Hermann Natural Science Center. The Covington campus, located in Covington, Kentucky, closed at the end of 2008. It mainly served nontraditional and adult students and also hosted the Program for Adult-Centered Education and Emergency Medical Technology programs.The Northerner: NKU Covington campus closes Northern Kentucky University's Grant County Center, located in Williamstown, Kentucky, is a partnership between the Grant County Foundation for Higher Education and Northern Kentucky University.

It was a major access route from the coast to Yukon goldfields in the late 1890s. The trail became obsolete in 1899 when a railway was built from Dyea's neighbor port Skagway along the parallel White Pass trail.Gold rush stories The Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1978. In 1987, the trail was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1998, the centennial of the gold rush, Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site in British Columbia merged with the U.S. park to create the Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. History =Indigenous use= Tlingit Indians used the trail as a vital trade route to trade for resources available in the interior. As pressures from American settlers and the Hudson's Bay Company weakened the traditional Tlingit trading system, the Chilkoot Trail slowly became utilized by explorers and prospectors. =Klondike era= Chilkoot Pass during gold rush. March‚ÄìApril 1898 The Klondike Gold Rush (1896‚Äì1899) transformed the Chilkoot Trail into a mainstream transportation route to Canada's interior. The gold rush was primarily focused in the region around Dawson City in Yukon and the Yukon River. Of the several overland routes, the Chilkoot Trail was the most direct, least expensive, and, soon enough, most popular. The other primary route to the headwaters of the Yukon River, however, was also based out of Skagway: the rival White Pass route. The White Pass route was slightly longer but less rigorous and steep, whereas the Chilkoot was shorter and more difficult. Skagway, because of its deepwater harbor, served as the principal port for both routes (nearby Dyea, the beginning of the Chilkoot Trail, was built on the extensive, shallow Taiya River delta). Prospectors who chose the Chilkoot were ferried to Dyea by small boat or ferry. Soon, both Skagway and Dyea were bustling tent cities as sensationalist headlines of the gold rush spurred men from across the United States to leave their jobs and families and gain passage up the Inside Passage to Skagway. As it became apparent that many of the prospectors who chose the Chilkoot simply were not going to survive the arduous terrain and harsh weather, Canada's North-West Mounted Police (now the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) declared that prospectors could only enter Canada if they had at least one ton of gear (enough to supply a prospector for one year. See also: Klondike supply list). Prospectors ferried the gear from campsites along the trail, slowly moving closer to the headwaters of the Yukon. With all the equipment and supplies being transported, alternative methods, especially those with a little supplemental income, sprouted up. Many prospectors purchased pack animals (although that method was more commonly used on the rival White Pass), and many others paid Tlingit Indians to haul gear on a per-pound rate from campsite to campsite. Tramways Aerial tramway companies soon were hauling tons of gear over the head of the prospectors every day. By the end of the Chilkoot Trail's heyday, there were five distinct tramway operations on different parts of the trail competing for the influx of gear and money in the region. Many of the trams constituted world-class engineering feats of the era. =Post-Klondike= After the Klondike Gold Rush, the trail became more or less deserted. Prospectors late to the gold rush now made their way to the Yukon on the new White Pass and Yukon Route narrow-gauge railroad, which took them all the way to Whitehorse, Yukon in the Yukon Territory. In 1969, the U.S. and Canadian governments jointly declared their intention to make Chilkoot Trail a component of a Klondike Gold Rush International Historic Park. The U.S. portion was eventually established in 1976 as Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, comprising part of Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle, Washington, various sites throughout Skagway, Alaska, the abandoned town site of Dyea, Alaska, and the U.S. portion of the Chilkoot Trail. The Canadian portion of the trail was christened Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site, one of several sites that compose the Canadian national park associated with the Klondike. But not until the centennial of the gold rush, in 1998, was the dream of an international park realized, when Klondike Gold Rush NHP and Chilkoot Trail NHS were merged to form Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Current status Briefing at Sheep Camp, 2016 The Chilkoot Trail is a popular recreational trail among residents of Southeast Alaska and Yukon Territory. The trail also attracts many tourists from abroad. To manage demand, and to prevent overuse and maintain the remote character of the trail, the National Park Service and Parks Canada allow no more than 50 backpackers to begin the trail each day by way of a permit system. In return for these fees, both countries have full- time trail maintenance crews, ranger/warden stations, well-designed campgrounds, and have placed numerous interpretive signs adjacent to notable historical sites and objects. The \\"official\\" hiking season (when rangers are on-duty and trail crew is on-site) varies, but usually begins in late May and ends in early September. Peak demand runs from June through August. Avalanche danger lingers into late May, as well as large snow fields that slow progress, whereas September is associated with rain and colder weather. =Running= The Chilkoot is also a challenging ultra-run. The fastest known time belongs to ultramarathoner Geoff Roes in 5 hours and 27 minutes.ProBoards: \\"Chilkoot Trail (AK)\\"I Run Alaska (blog): A Look Back on 2012 and a Look Ahead Route and attractions The Chilkoot trail features a number of natural and historical sites as shown on the map. By following the numbers on the map from south to north, the hiker will go along the same route as the old prospectors. The trip normally takes three to five daysNational Park Service, Chilkoot Trail and to stay for the night, a number of designated campground are made. The trail is roughly divided into three climatic zones: coastal rainforest, high alpine (above tree limit) and boreal forest. In the end it is connected to White Pass historical railway leading back to Skagway the modern port of the trail. In the following, the points of the map are highlighted with bold letters. =Coastal rainforest zone= Dyea, head of Lynn Canal, 2005 The trail begins in Dyea, a ghost town and campground, 15 minutes from Skagway. From the trailhead, the route winds through coastal rainforest along to the Taiya River. The first campsite is Finnegan's Point. This stretch of the trail is in flat terrain with no substantial obstacles. The trail becomes noticeably cooler after Finnegan's Point owing to cool air sinking down from snow and ice fields in the surrounding mountains. Numerous streams also cascade down the mountain sides. This stretch of the trail contains the least amount of visible artifacts. The next camp is Canyon City. Many hikers, especially those desiring a more modest pace or those who have had a late start, stop at Canyon City the first night. The shelter located at Canyon City houses many gold rush-era artifacts. Close to the Canyon City campsite are the Canyon City ruins. Canyon City was a tent city during the gold rush and its ruins‚Äîbuilding foundations, a large restaurant stove, a large boiler‚Äîare still visible. The ruins are accessible by crossing the Taiya River by suspension footbridge. Between Finnegan's Point and Canyon City, 2004 After Canyon City ruins, the trail diverges away from the river for the first time as the river disappears into a small canyon (Canyon City's namesake) and climbs up valley wall, traversing sub-alpine forest. For many sections of the trail, old telegraph and tram wires are exposed adjacent to the trail. For the gold rush prospectors, this section of the trail was one of the most difficult. In winter, when the Taiya River was frozen, the gold rush stampeders could easily travel up the ice highway; however, in the summer this segment was described as \\"the worst piece of trail on the road, fairly muddy with many boulders and with some short, steep ascents and descents in and out of small gulches.\\" The next landmark is Pleasant Camp. There is an informational trail sign at the original site of Pleasant Camp, a quarter mile before the present Pleasant Camp campground. Pleasant Camp marks the reunion of the trail with Taiya River and serves as a lightly used, small campground. From Pleasant Camp the trail is fairly flat and weaves through forest and over small creeks. The trail next comes to Sheep Camp, the last campground on the American side of the trail as well as the final resting stop before the trek up Chilkoot Pass. It is the largest of the campsites on the American side of the trail. After leaving Sheep Camp and before the U.S. ranger station, the trail passes through a large avalanche chute. The slide has wiped out all previously existing forest and leaves a young brushy and alder-dominated landscape. A short distance after the ranger station is a small museum of gold rush-era artifacts in an old cabin. Soon after leaving the cabin the sub-alpine forest slowly yields to a treeless alpine landscape that allows a grand view of the rapidly narrowing Taiya River valley. As the trail climbs in altitude, its path becomes more improved, often demarcated by yellow markers planted in snowfields. =High alpine zone= Pass, June 2004 Within sight of the pass, and at the base of the \\"Golden Stairs\\" (the long difficult incline that leads to the pass), are The Scales. The Scales were a weight station where freight would be reweighed before the final trek to the pass. Often, Native packers would demand higher packing rates. The Scales also hosted a small tent city, including six restaurants, two hotels, a saloon, and many freighting offices and warehouses. The imposing Golden Stairs also prompted many would-be prospectors to turn around, often leaving behind their required ton of equipment. Because of this, and the snow's preserving properties, artifacts are prevalent at this altitude, including many remnants of wooden structures. After The Scales is the final push up to the Chilkoot Pass: the fabled Golden Stairs. The Golden Stairs acquired its name from the steps that prospectors painstakingly carved into the snow and ice of the pass and has retained the name ever since. At the pass proper, at the Canada‚ÄìUS border, is a warming cabin and part-time Parks Canada warden station. Occasionally, if a party is making poor time, the warden or U.S. ranger will offer the warming cabin as an overnight shelter so to not risk the group from being caught in the barren and exposed alpine landscape between the pass and Happy Camp. There are also many artifacts scattered about the Golden Stairs and ridge lines surrounding the pass, including a cache of intact (canvas, wood, etc.) prefabricated boats on the southeastern side of the pass. Stone Crib is situated a half mile after the pass. Stone Crib served as the terminus of the Chilkoot Railroad and Transport Company's aerial tramway, a huge rocky counterbalance for the tram. This function is still apparent today with the wooden structure well preserved by the snow. The trail wends its way by a series of alpine lakes: First Crater Lake, Morrow Lake, and finally Happy Camp. =Boreal forest zone= Lake Lindeman in the early summer, 2004 The trail continues to pass another couple of lakes‚ÄîLong Lake and Deep Lake‚Äîbefore crossing tree line. Adjacent to Deep Lake, and amidst tree line, is another campground. The Canadian half of the Chilkoot Trail, in the rain shadow of the Coast Mountains, is much dryer, and pine forest, first appearing at Deep Lake, readily contrasts to the more lush temperate rain forest on the U.S. half before Chilkoot Pass. After the trail passes Deep Lake, the outlet river runs parallel to the trail for a short distance before entering a small canyon. Many boat and boat-related artifacts are visible in this area. The trail continues at a gentle decline until the turquoise-colored Lake Lindeman comes into view and the trail concludes its descent to the Lake Lindeman campground, the headquarters of Canadian trail operations. The trail climbs a steep bluff after Lindeman and offers an expansive view of the lake and surrounding forest. After Lake Lindeman, the trail passes Bare Loon Lake and the Bare Loon Lake campground. The trail diverges after Bare Loon Lake. One branch continues to Lake Bennett and the tracks of the White Pass & Yukon Route railroad. The other branch, the Log Cabin cut-off, connects with the Klondike Highway, but was closed by Parks Canada in 2010. Bennett consists of a campground, a White Pass and Yukon Route depot, several houses (all private property) belonging to White Pass employees or First Nations citizens, and the only gold rush-era building still standing along the trail today, the renovated St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. Pilings from bygone piers dot the lakeshore and an assortment of cans and other metal artifacts are scattered throughout the woods. Campgrounds As shown on the route map there are a total of nine designated, maintained campgrounds on the Chilkoot Trail. Camping is allowed in these places only. Hikers must use their own tents or shelters as the cabins at the campgrounds are for warming and cooking only. For cooking a backpacking stove must be brought along, even though wood stoves are available in some places. Open fires are prohibited. Use of campgrounds must be planned in advance.Parks Canada, Designated Camping In addition to the camps, a U.S. Ranger Station is located north of Sheep Camp to present the history of the pass and inform about weather and trail conditions before crossing the summit. Safety Bear track, 2004 Bears are the primary safety concern in the park. It is very common for hikers to encounter them. Firearms are not permitted on the Canadian side of Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Almost all parties take bear spray and/or bear bangers as repellents, but most importantly both sides of the park mandate smart bear practices. It is required to stow food in bear-safe locations. Weather and terrain also pose a challenge to hikers. There are few risks in the forest regions of the trail, however once the trail climbs into the alpine, weather and the elements pose more of a concern; the same does vertigo. Often the American ranger from Sheep Camp sweeps late in the day up to Chilkoot Pass to monitor for straggling groups that may not make Happy Camp and would be in need of emergency shelter.

Charles Grodin co-stars as the family's patriarch who consents to permit cameras in his Arizona home. Real- life producer Jennings Lang also has an acting role in Real Life. Plot Comedian Albert Brooks (played by himself) leads a documentary film project meant to encapsulate the joys, sorrows and intimacy of real life by filming a regular american family at all times for a full year using expensive cameras: some installed on walls and four large helmet-like ones worn by a small camera crew that follows Brooks and the family in and out of their neighboring homes (a regular film crew is hired by the studio but aren‚Äôt needed.)

Brooks tells the audience that the Feltons are the clear pick because they live in Wisconsin and the Yeagers live in Arizona. The studio picks the Yeagers. The Yeagers are sent on vacation and filming starts as soon as they arrive back at the airport, causing immediate nervousness in the family. Brooks takes an hour off to do antiquing while the Yeagers have pizza and argue about rules at the dinner table. The father, Warren, makes a few unsympathetic remarks and ends up eating alone. Doctors Howard Hill and Ted Cleary are there to observe the project‚Äôs integrity and progress. Cleary does not appreciate Brooks‚Äô intrusive method of constantly filming the family, worrying that their hold of reality is being threatened. The mother, Jeanette, leaves the house without cameras to unwind and meets Brooks later to thank him by inviting him to an appointment at the gynecologist. Brooks is thrilled until Jeanette kisses him, which he dislikes. He warns her that he‚Äôs no better than her husband and that his charisma ‚Äò‚Äôdoesn‚Äôt run deep.‚Äô‚Äô The gynecologist refuses to be on camera because of a damning news story that ran about him years ago. Brooks offers him $500 to accept but then recognizes the man as ‚Äò‚Äôthe baby broker‚Äô‚Äô from the news story and the deal is off. Warren brings the crew to witness a day at his work as a veterinarian. Being nervous from the cameras, he starts surgery on a horse by accidentally ordering an anesthetic drug twice and killing the animal instantly. He asks Brooks to not show the footage in the film but Brooks won‚Äôt sign off on that. Jeannette‚Äôs grandmother also dies and the family enters a deep depression. In trying to cheer the family up, Brooks invites Jeanette to a dinner date which she declines, having changed her mind on her attraction to him. Brooks then shows up to the house in a clown costume to cheer the kids but they are at school. While still in costume, Brooks is asked to sit down with Warren and Jeannette, where Warren confesses to feeling a nervous breakdown. Brooks is dismissive of the claim, saying that it‚Äôs okay to be sad and confused as long as you don‚Äôt ‚Äò‚Äôclam up‚Äô‚Äô. After a meeting with the doctors, some scientists from the institute and an old-timey film producer obsessed with getting movie stars involved, Dr. Cleary leaves the project, disapproving of how the family is being treated. The family return to a happier, more harmonious lifestyle until Cleary‚Äôs book on the project is published, calling it ‚Äò‚Äômind-control‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äôpsychological rape‚Äô‚Äô. The book attracts attention on the family from newscasters, much to the anger of Brooks and the discomfort of the Yeagers. Another meeting with Dr. Hill, the institute and the film producer calls for the termination of the project. Brooks brings The Yeagers to the meeting and, to his surprise, they also want to end the project. Despite his pleas and threats for them to stay, they do not change their minds and the producer calls for the Yeagers to be paid anyway to apologize for the stress they endured. Brooks suggests to start the project over with the Feltons back in Wisconsin but is turned down by the producer. While dressing back into the clown costume for a benefit at a children‚Äôs hospital, Brooks starts losing his mind over the project. In a desperate attempt to find a solid ending to the film, Brooks recalls the endings of famous films and picks Gone With The Wind as the one he should copy. He burns down the Yeagers house with elation in front of them, the camera crew and the scientists. No one is harmed. An epilogue is presented in text form saying that the house was rebuilt with a tennis court added for ‚Äòappreciation‚Äô, that Dr. Cleary‚Äôs book sold poorly and he is now ill. Real- life historians are invited to call 1-800-555-3824, should they want documentation on the project.

An idea is not enough for a movie. Characters have to be developed, comic situations have to be set up before they can pay off and the story should have a conclusion instead of a dead stop. 'Real Life' fails in all of those areas ‚Äî fails so miserably that it lets its audiences down.\\" Conversely, Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised the film as an \\"often very funny assault on manners, moviemaking, an allegedly typical American family and everything its members hold dear ... Its manner is deadpan and sly, so sly that some viewers may not find it comic at all. But for anyone well-disposed toward Mr. Brooks, who is never without his absolute insincerity and irrational good cheer, 'Real Life' is full of delightful nonsense, a very funny account of one man's crusade to capture all the truth and wisdom that money can buy.\\"Maslin, Janet (March 2, 1979). \\"Screen: Albert Brooks Turns 'Real Life' Into Movie\\". The New York Times. C12. Variety noted, \\"Expanding on the deadpan satiric tone of the short parodies and pseudo-documentaries he's filmed in the past for NBC's 'Saturday Night Live' into his first feature, Albert Brooks has come up with a mostly very funny (though uneven) take-off on social-minded docu filmmaking that stands to draw boxoffice support from the young adult, primarily college crowd that's made the late-night tv show the success it is.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Real Life\\". Variety. March 7, 1979. 20. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"Admittedly, documentary filmmaking doesn't sound like the greatest subject to be satirized, but 'Real Life' is full of undeniable laughs.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 30, 1979). \\"Brooks' 'Real Life' is full of real off-the-wall laughs\\".

The work is usually known by its Latin title. The work begins by analyzing simple categoric propositions, and draws a series of basic conclusions on the routine issues of classifying and defining basic linguistic forms, such as simple terms and propositions, nouns and verbs, negation, the quantity of simple propositions (primitive roots of the quantifiers in modern symbolic logic), investigations on the excluded middle (what to Aristotle is not applicable to future tense propositions‚Äîthe problem of future contingents), and on modal propositions. The first five chapters deal with the terms that form propositions. Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the relationship between affirmative, negative, universal and particular propositions. These relationships are the basis of the well-known Square of opposition. The distinction between universal and particular propositions is the basis of modern quantification theory. The last three chapters deal with modalities. Chapter 9 is famous for the discussion of the sea-battle. (If it is true that there will be a sea-battle tomorrow, then it is true today that there will be a sea-battle. Thus a sea-battle is apparently unavoidable, and thus necessary. Another interpretation would be: that we cannot know that which has not yet come to pass. In other words: if there is a sea battle tomorrow then it is true today that tomorrow there will be a sea battle. So, only if we can know whether or not there will be a sea battle tomorrow then can we know if there will be a sea battle).  Contents  Chapter 1. Aristotle defines words as symbols of 'affections of the soul' or mental experiences. Spoken and written symbols differ between languages, but the mental experiences are the same for all (so that the English word 'cat' and the French word 'chat' are different symbols, but the mental experience they stand for‚Äîthe concept of a cat‚Äîis the same for English speakers and French speakers). Nouns and verbs on their own do not involve truth or falsity. Chapter 2. A noun signifies the subject by convention, but without reference to time. Chapter 3. A verb carries with it the notion of time. 'He was healthy' and 'he will be healthy' are tenses of a verb. An untensed verb indicates the present, the tenses of a verb indicate times outside the present. Chapter 4. The sentence is an expression whose parts have meaning. The word 'cat' signifies something, but is not a sentence. Only when words are added to it do we have affirmation and negation. Chapter 5. Every simple proposition contains a verb. A simple proposition indicates a single fact, and the conjunction of its parts gives a unity. A complex proposition is several propositions compounded together. Chapter 6. An affirmation is an assertion of something, a denial an assertion denying something of something. (For example, 'a man is an animal' asserts 'animal' of 'man'. 'A stone is not an animal' denies 'animal' of stone'). Chapter 7. Terms. Some terms are universal. A universal term is capable of being asserted of several subjects (for example 'moon'‚Äîeven though the Earth has one moon, it may have had more, and the noun 'moon' could have been said of them in exactly the same sense). Other terms are individual. An individual or singular term ('Plato') is not predicated (in the same) sense of more than one individual. A universal affirmative proposition, such as, 'Every man is mortal' and a universal negative proposition having the same subject and predicate, such as, 'No man is mortal,' are called contrary. A universal affirmative proposition (\\"Every man is mortal\\") and the non-universal denial of that proposition in a way (\\"Some men are not mortal\\") are called contradictories. Of contradictories, one must be true, the other false. Contraries cannot both be true, although they can both be false, and hence their contradictories are both true. For example, both 'Every man is honest' and 'No man is honest' are false. But their contradictories, 'Some men are not honest' and 'Some men are honest,' are both true. Chapter 8. An affirmation is single, if it expresses a single fact. For example, 'every man is mortal'. However, if a word has two meanings, for example if the word 'garment' meant 'man and horse', then 'the garment is white' would not be a single affirmation, for it would mean 'the man and horse are white', which is equivalent to the two simple propositions 'a man is white and a horse is white'. Chapter 9. Of contradictory propositions about the past and present, one must be true, the other false. But when the subject is individual, and the proposition is future, this is not the case. For if so, nothing takes place by chance. For either the future proposition such as, 'A sea battle will take place,' corresponds with future reality, or its negation does, in which case the sea battle will take place with necessity, or not take place with necessity. But in reality, such an event might just as easily not happen as happen; the meaning of the word 'by chance' with regard to future events is that reality is so constituted that it may issue in either of two opposite possibilities. This is known as the problem of future contingents. Chapter 10. Aristotle enumerates the affirmations and denials that can be assigned when 'indefinite' terms such as 'unjust' are included. He makes a distinction that was to become important later, between the use of the verb 'is' as a mere copula or 'third element', as in the sentence 'a man is wise', and as a predicate signifying existence, as in 'a man is [i.e. exists]'. Chapter 11. Some propositions appear to be simple, but are really composite. In a single proposition, the nouns referring to the subjects combine to form a unity. Thus, 'two-footed domesticated animal' applies to a 'man', and the three predicates combine to form a unity. But in the term 'a white walking man' the three predicates do not combine to form a unity of this sort. Chapter 12. This chapter considers the mutual relation of modal propositions: affirmations and denials which assert or deny possibility or contingency, impossibility or necessity. Chapter 13. The relation between such propositions. Logical consequences follow from this arrangement. For example, from the proposition 'it is possible' it follows that it is contingent, that it is not impossible, or from the proposition 'it cannot be the case' there follows 'it is necessarily not the case'. Chapter 14. Is there an affirmative proposition corresponding to every denial? For example, is the proposition 'every man is unjust' an affirmation (since it seems to affirm being unjust of every man) or is it merely a negative (since it denies justice)?  Square of opposition (logical square) and modal logic  The logical square, also called square of opposition or square of Apuleius has its origin in the four marked sentences to be employed in syllogistic reasoning: Every man is white, the universal affirmative and its negation Not every man is white (or Some men are not white), the particular negative on the one hand, Some men are white, the particular affirmative and its negation No man is white, the universal negative on the other. Robert Blanch√© published with Vrin his book Structures intellectuelles in 1966 and since then many scholars think that the logical square or square of opposition representing four values should be replaced by the logical hexagon which by representing six values is a more potent figure because it has the power to explain more things about logic and natural language. The study of the four propositions constituting the square is found in Chapter 7 and its appendix Chapter 8. Most important also is the immediately following Chapter 9 dealing with the problem of future contingents. This chapter and the subsequent ones are at the origin of modal logic. Translations Aristotle's original Greek text, Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ·ºôœÅŒºŒ∑ŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ (Peri Hermeneias) was translated into the Latin \\"De Interpretatione\\" by Marius Victorinus, at Rome, in the 4th century.

It was founded in 1860 by Franciscan friars. The university enrolls about 1,100 students. History Francis Hall Tower A small group of Franciscan friars left Germany in 1858 to serve the German-speaking population in what was then the frontier state of Illinois. On February 6, 1860, they founded the institution as St. Francis Solanus College. This school was established at 8th and Maine Street. Under the leadership of Fr. Anselm Mueller, who served as president for a total of 37 years beginning in 1863, the institution moved to its current location on what is now College Avenue. Following two other name changes during the twentieth century, the current name, Quincy University, was adopted in 1993. The university name was adopted in part to recognize the addition of graduate programs. From its founding, Quincy University has combined a deep commitment to the liberal arts with a recognition of the importance of professional programs. The earliest course catalogs, from the 1870s, combined a strong focus on the liberal arts with courses in accounting and other ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù programs. Quincy University continues to offer majors in the liberal arts and in the professions. Quincy University typically enrolled under 300 students until the 1930s. The first woman enrolled at the university in the 1920s, and women were regularly admitted beginning in 1932. Quincy University was involved in educating Army reservists and Navy cadets during World War II, and enrollment grew after the Second World War. The university first enrolled over 1,000 students in the late 1950s. In response to this enrollment growth, several new buildings were planned and put up during the 1960s. The Franciscan friars made up the majority of the university faculty until the late twentieth century. The distinctive Franciscan intellectual tradition remains central to the mission and values of the university. Since the founding of the institution, many Franciscan friars in the Midwest have been educated at Quincy University. Today, the university is home to people of all faiths, who are welcomed in the Franciscan tradition of hospitality. In 1990, the campus became home to Franciscan Press (formerly Franciscan Herald Press). The press closed in 2007. Academics John 'Pete' Brown Mock Trial Courtroom Quincy Media Inc. Broadcast Studio at QU's North Campus. Quincy University is organized into four divisions and two schools: Divisions *Behavioral & Social Sciences *Fine Arts & Communication *Humanities *Science and Technology Schools *Business *Education At the undergraduate level, QU requires completion of the Bonaventure general education program, which includes a significant service requirement for all students. Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees are offered in 46 major areas of concentration. The university also supports a variety of non-degree programs and multiple degree-completion options for non- traditional students. Courses are offered in traditional, online, or hybrid formats. At the graduate level, QU offers a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, a Master of Science in Education (M.S.Ed.) degree and a (M.S. Ed) Master of Science in Education in Counseling degree. The MBA degree is offered entirely online. Classroom technologies and resources are tailored to the needs of specific academic programs. Updated and renovated laboratories in computer science, cybersecurity, biology, and chemistry are available, as is the John ‚ÄúPete‚Äù Brown Mock Trial courtroom. =Accreditations= Quincy University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. QU also has specialized accreditation from the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP). Campus Quincy University's compact, walkable campus is located in a residential area, a few blocks away from Quincy's Broadway Avenue shopping and business district. Historic Francis Hall is at the center of campus and was built and expanded between 1871-1898. The campus also features many distinctive examples of Mid-Century modern architecture in its residence halls and classroom and administration buildings. Friar's Field, a large lawn that held various athletic fields during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, now creates a park-like setting for the campus. The newest additions to campus include a large health and fitness center and an apartment-style residence hall. The historic campus holds several noteworthy traditional and contemporary public art installations. The Brenner Library includes the highly regarded Gray Gallery, which features art exhibitions throughout the year. The spiritual center of Quincy University is its beautiful chapel, which was built in 1911 and has been renovated on several occasions. The chapel design was shortened and modified to preserve the baseball field then located just to the north of Francis Hall. A former Franciscan seminary is now part of Quincy University, just a few minutes to the north of the university's historic campus. Now called the North Campus, this extensively renovated facility houses most of the Division of Science and Technology, the Connie Niemann Center for Music, and the QUTV television studio. The university's soccer stadium and softball complex are located adjacent to the North Campus. The football stadium and baseball field are part of the main campus and feature distinctive limestone walls. The football and baseball facilities were built in the 1930s and have been extensively renovated. Campus life at Quincy University features many student clubs and activities, including three Greek-letter organizations. Greek houses are located on campus. Each year, the Inaugural ceremony brings together faculty, staff, new students, and parents to celebrate the beginning of the university experience for new students. Following a procession by the faculty in academic regalia, the ceremony takes place in St. Francis Solanus Church, a Franciscan parish located across the street from Quincy University. Quincy University is located in Quincy, Illinois, an attractive, affordable small city of about 40,000. Located on the Mississippi River, Quincy was the site of a Lincoln-Douglas debate and has played an important role in Illinois and U.S. history. With several manufacturers and health-care providers, Quincy provides many opportunities for employment and internships. Students and alumni The student body at Quincy University is about 52% men and 48% women. Most students come from Illinois and Missouri, but several other states in the Midwest and South are well represented at QU. Over 15,000 Quincy University alumni live in all 50 states and 12 foreign countries. Every year at Homecoming QU hosts a hot air balloon glow for the community, alumni and students. Athletics Quincy University is a member of NCAA Division II and has been a part of the Great Lakes Valley Conference (GLVC) for most sports since the 1995-96 school year. Men's volleyball competes in the Midwestern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (NCAA Division I).

It is from via . The station is managed by Southern, which also operates many of the trains. Thameslink, Gatwick Express and Great Western Railway also operate some trains from Brighton. It was built by the London & Brighton Railway in 1840, initially connecting Brighton to Shoreham-by-Sea, westwards along the coast, and shortly afterwards connecting it to London Bridge and the county town of Lewes to the east. In 1846, the railway became the London Brighton and South Coast Railway following mergers with other railways with lines between Portsmouth and Hastings. With over 17 million passenger entries and exits in 2018/19, Brighton is the seventh-busiest station in the country outside London. History and development The London and Brighton Railway (L&BR;) built a passenger station, goods station, locomotive depot and railway works on a difficult site on the northern edge of Brighton. This site was from, and above the sea shore, and had involved considerable excavation work to create a reasonable gradient from Patcham Tunnel. =Passenger station= The station forecourt showing Mocatta's original building which is now largely obscured The passenger station was a three-storey building in an Italianate style, designed by David Mocatta in 1839‚Äì40 which incorporated the head office of the railway company. (This building still stands but has been largely obscured by later additions.) The station is said to have many similarities to the Nine Elms railway station of the London and Southampton Railway (1838) designed by Sir William Tite. Baker & Son were paid ¬£9766 15s for the station building between May and August 1841.Cole (1958), pp.150. The platform accommodation was built by John Urpeth Rastrick and consisted of four pitched roofs each . It opened for trains to Shoreham on 12 May 1840, and to London on 21 September 1841. Brighton Station interior in 1962 The station site was extended for the opening of the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway on 8 June 1846 (which had been purchased by the L&BR; in 1845). In July 1846, the L&BR; merged with other railways to form the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. Further extensions to the station occurred during the mid-19th century but only a limited number of additional platforms could be added because of the awkward sloping site. By the late 1870s the facilities were inadequate for the growing volume of traffic and so the existing platforms were lengthened to be able to accommodate two trains, and the three separate roofs were replaced by an overall roof during 1882/1883. The station has an impressive large double-spanned curved glass and iron roof covering all of the platforms, which was substantially renovated in 1999 and 2000.Project information from Kier Construction Ltd At the front of the station is a bus station. The station taxi rank is outside the rear of the station. A tunnel runs under the station which once provided an open-air cab run at a shallower gradient than Trafalgar Street outside, which had been the main approach to the station before the construction of Queen's Road (which was financially supported by the railway, and intended to improve access). The cab run was covered (forming a tunnel) when the station above was extended over it on cast iron columns. The cab run remains in situ but has been sealed at the station end. The station roof as refurbished Help, a dog used to collect charitable donations, was displayed at the station following its death in 1891. =Goods station and yard= A goods station and yard was also constructed on the eastern side of the passenger station but on a site due to the sloping site, which was initially accessed from the Shoreham line by a second tunnel under the passenger station. The tunnel entrance was filled in after new tracks were laid into the goods yard, but a portion of it was converted into offices during World War II, and these were in use until the early 21st century. A portion of the tunnel is still used by a local rifle club. The site of the goods yard has since been redeveloped, and much of it forms the New England Quarter. =Locomotive and carriage works= To the north of the station, on the east side of the main line, the railway constructed its locomotive and carriage works, which operated from 1841 until 1911, when the carriage works was moved to Lancing and 1957 when the locomotive works closed. Thereafter Isetta cars were briefly built in a part of the works. =Locomotive depot= Brighton Locomotive Depot seen from above 11 July 1954 The London and Brighton Railway opened a small locomotive shed and servicing facility to the north west of the station for locomotives on the Shoreham line, in May 1840, and another, adjacent to the locomotive works for main line locomotives, the following year. During 1860‚Äì1861 John Chester Craven, the Locomotive Superintendent of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) began the removal of a large chalk hill to the north of the station, which had been dumped during the excavation of the main line. The space created was used to accommodate a new much enlarged motive power depot in 1861, replacing the two existing facilities.Cooper (1981), p. 58Griffiths (1999), p. 69 During the early 1930s, following the electrification of the lines the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size. It was closed 15 June 1961, but remained in use for stabling steam locomotives until 1964, and was demolished in 1966. The maintenance depot The site is currently the Network Rail's ECR and infrastructure maintenance depot, and Southern's Lovers Walk Depot, used for servicing most of Southern's single voltage Class 377 Electrostar, Class 387 Electrostar and Class 313 fleets. =Listed status= Brighton station was listed at Grade II* on 30 April 1973. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Platform layout The station has 8 platforms, numbered 1 to 8 from left to right when looking from the main entrance. All platforms are long enough to accommodate 12-car trains. * Platforms 1 and 2 can only be used by services on the West Coastway line. They are served by Southern services towards , , , and ; platform 1 is also used by GWR services to and beyond. * Platform 3 is the only platform that can be used by services on all three lines, although trains on the West Coastway Line are limited to 4 carriages in length; services on the Brighton main and East Coastway lines are not restricted. The signalling also allows this platform to be occupied by two units on two separate lines at the same time, with a West Coastway train at the near end of the platform and a Brighton main or East Coastway train (up to 4 carriages long) at the far end. During the day, the platform is usually used by Southern and Gatwick Express services to . * Platforms 4-8 can be used by services on the Brighton main line and the East Coastway line. Usually, platform 4 shares with platform 3 the Southern and Gatwick Express services to London Victoria; platform 5 is served by Thameslink trains to , platform 6 by those to , while platforms 7 and 8 are used by Southern services on the East Coastway Line. However, this usage can be changed at times of disruption.  Services  Currently, all trains are operated by Southern, Thameslink, Gatwick Express or Great Western Railway. =Brighton Main Line= The typical off-peak service from Brighton on the Brighton Main Line is: * 2 tph (trains per hour) to (semi-fast), operated by Southern; * 2 tph to London Victoria calling only at , operated by Gatwick Express; * 2 tph to via Gatwick Airport and (stopping), operated by Thameslink; * 2 tph to Cambridge via Gatwick Airport, London Bridge and Stevenage operated by Thameslink; =West Coastway Line= The typical off- peak service from Brighton on the West Coastway Line is: * 2 tph to (stopping), operated by Southern; * 2 tph to (to connect with semi-fast services from London Victoria to ), operated by Southern; * 1 tph to (semi- fast), operated by Southern; * 1 tph to (semi-fast), operated by Southern. There are also several trains per day to , some of which run further to . These services are operated by Great Western Railway. =East Coastway Line= The typical off-peak service from Brighton on the East Coastway Line is: * 2 tph to via (stopping); * 2 tph to Lewes only (stopping); * 2 tph to via Lewes and (semi-fast), one of which is extended one stop to . All services on this line are operated by Southern. =Former operators and services= Thameslink service ready for a dawn departure from Brighton 4 Cig under the Southern Region of British Rail in 1986. The following companies have served Brighton in the past: * London & Brighton Railway * London, Brighton & South Coast Railway * Southern Railway * British Rail * CrossCountry * South West Trains * Virgin CrossCountry * Connex South Central * Wessex Trains * Thameslink (original) * First Capital Connect Until 1967 a service operated between Brighton and Birkenhead Woodside via Redhill, Reading, Oxford, Birmingham Snow Hill, Wolverhampton Low Level, Shrewsbury and Chester. The stock was provided on alternate days by British Railways successors to the Southern Railway and the Great Western Railway being the Southern Region and Western Region. South West Trains used to operate regular services from this station, to Reading and Paignton, via Worthing and Chichester. These services were withdrawn on 10 December 2007 because of new franchise obligations, and South West Trains no longer operate any services from Brighton. CrossCountry also served Brighton, with services to and beyond. These services were withdrawn from the December 2008 timetable change, as they were no longer required by the new franchise. Until May 2018, Brighton was served by an hourly express service to Ashford International, via Lewes, Eastbourne and Hastings, but it has been discontinued since. Now, all Ashford trains run from Eastbourne as stopping services. = Disruptions to services from the station = Football matches at the Falmer Stadium are served by train services from Brighton to Falmer. A queuing system is in operation from 2 hours before kick off for trains departing from platforms 7 and 8. The stadium's 30,750 capacity means these queues are large close to kick off. After the game, fans leave the station via the emergency gates, and a queuing system is in operation for West Coastway Line services departing from platforms 1 and 2. The Lewes Bonfire night, usually on 5 November, attracts large numbers of people, many travelling through Brighton station. As a result, Southern operate a queuing system from the afternoon onwards. The London to Brighton Bike Ride in June each year attracts large numbers of cyclists. As a result, Southern ban bicycles from many trains on the day, and on the following day they operate a queuing system at Brighton station. The train operators had in the past allowed bicycles on trains for the many cyclists returning to London.  Facilities  Passenger facilities include a ticket office, a travel information office, and several retail outlets. There are bus stops, a taxi rank, a car park and bicycle storage. Facilities for cyclists were extended in 2014 when a \\"cycle hub\\" was built at the rear entrance to the station. The three-storey building combines storage space for 500 bicycles with shops to buy or hire a bicycle, a repair facility, toilets, showers, changing facilities and a caf√©. It is open 24 hours a day and storage is free of charge; most funding came from the Department for Transport (¬£500,000), Network Rail (¬£200,000), local rail operator Southern and the city council (¬£100,000 each). In 2012 ¬£4.5 million was secured from the Department for Transport's Station Commercial Project Facility for renovation of the concourse. Changes included an increased number of ticket barriers, improved layout, more seating and retail outlets and the removal of the previous WH Smiths structure. Train Crew Depots Both Southern and Thameslink have Driver, On Board Supervisor and Conductor depots at Brighton station. Accidents On 4 August 1909, a motor-train hauled by Terrier No.83 Earlswood collided with the buffers at Brighton, due to the driver's error. Nineteen people were injured. Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, died at the station on 13 August 1884.  Concourse  The concourse includes food shops, caf√©s, a newsagent and other food and retail outlets. The front of the station often sees stalls and street food vans. Following a request by Labour MP Peter Kyle in 2014, Southern added a street piano to the concourse, with a vintage Southern Railway logo inscribed.

The show was created by Mark Burnett, the creator of Survivor. It was canceled shortly before the last three episodes of the series could be broadcast due to dismal ratings. However, sister station Fox Reality Channel picked up The Casino and broadcast the unaired episodes and then ran the series in re-runs until its cancellation from that network. Production Scenes of Tim Poster and Thomas Breitling were filmed around Las Vegas in January 2004. Filming at the Golden Nugget was initially scheduled to begin that same month, but was delayed and began instead on February 2, 2004. Casinos such as the Aladdin Resort & Casino and Caesars Palace were initially considered rather than the Golden Nugget. An area of the Golden Nugget's casino was closed off to allow for filming of high-stakes gambling at a roulette wheel, a dice table, and four blackjack tables. The Casino was the first reality series to be shot with high- definition video cameras. Eighteen camera crews shot approximately 270 hours of footage for each hour-long episode. Executive producer James Bruce speculated that the show \\"could go on forever\\" because of its variety. Other filming locations included the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas. Filming at the Golden Nugget concluded on March 17, 2004, with additional background footage to be shot at a later time. The theme song, \\"Two Shots of Happy, One Shot of Sad\\", was written by Bono and The Edge, and performed by Matt Dusk. Broadcast The Casino began airing on June 14, 2004. In July 2004, it was reported that The Casino was a ratings disappointment, and that Poster, Breitling, and employees did not like the show's portrayal of the Golden Nugget, including its \\"staged feel\\".

The LaRouche movement is made up of activists who follow LaRouche's views. Economics and politics According to Matko Me≈°troviƒá, emeritus senior research fellow at the Institute of Economics of Zagreb, Croatia, LaRouche's economic policies call for a program modeled on the economic-recovery program of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, including fixed exchange rates, capital controls, exchange controls, currency controls, and protectionist price and trade agreements among partner-nations, although Roosevelt generally pursued trade liberalization. LaRouche also calls for a reorganization of debt world-wide, and a global plan for large-scale, continental infrastructure projects. He rejects free trade, deregulation, and globalization. =Marxist roots= Lyndon LaRouche began his political career as a Trotskyist and praised Marxism, but he and the National Caucus of Labor Committees abandoned this ideology in the late 1970s. From then on, LaRouche no longer opposed private ownership of the means of production, and his analysis of political events is no longer phrased in terms of class. According to Tim Wohlforth, during and after his break with Trotskyism, LaRouche's theory was influenced by what he called his \\"Theory of Hegemony\\" derived from Vladimir Lenin's view of the role of intellectuals in being a vanguard helping workers develop their consciousness and realize their leading role in society. He was influenced by Antonio Gramsci's concept of hegemony as an intellectual and cultural elite which directs social thought. LaRouche's theory saw himself and his followers as becoming such a hegemonic force. He rejected Gramsci's notion of \\"organic intellectuals\\" being developed by the working class itself. Rather, the working class would be led by elite intellectuals such as himself. LaRouche was influenced by his readings of Rosa Luxemburg's The Accumulation of Capital and Karl Marx's Capital developing his own \\"theory of reindustrialization\\", saying that the West would attempt to industrialize the Third World, particularly India, and attempt to solve the economic crisis both by developing new markets in the Third World and using its cheap and surplus labor to increase profits and minimize costs (see neocolonialism.) To oppose this, LaRouche argued for a \\"reindustrialization\\" of the United States with himself at the vanguard of the effort allowing him to personally resolve the crisis of capitalism. Though his arguments have since been stripped of their quasi-Marxist language and citations, his core theories have remained essentially the same since the late 1960s.  Dialectical Economics  In the book Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy, which was published in 1975 by D. C. Heath and Company under the pen name Lyn Marcus, LaRouche tried to show that numerous Marxists‚Äîranging from the Monthly Review group to Ernest Mandel, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro and the \\"Soviet economists\\"‚Äîhad failed to understand and to interpret correctly Marx's writing. Marxists he admired‚Äîapart from Marx himself‚Äîwere Rosa Luxemburg and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky. According to a review by Martin Bronfenbrenner in The Journal of Political Economy, about half of the book was devoted to dialectical philosophy, \\"with a strong epistemological stress\\", with the other half devoted to discussions of economic and general history, anthropology and sociology, and actual economics, including a surprisingly large helping of business administration‚ÄîBronfenbrenner noted that LaRouche seemed to have \\"more private-business experience than the great majority of academic economists\\", including a familiarity with the way speculative overcapitalization, operating at the borders of white-collar crime, creates \\"fictitious capitals\\" that later do not match their actual earning power. Like Thorstein Veblen, LaRouche subscribed to an overcapitalization theory of economic depression. According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed conventional economics as a \\"withered arm of philosophy\\", which had taken a wrong turn toward reductionism under the influence of British empiricists such as John Locke and David Hume. LaRouche's definition of reductionism was as follows: > The fundamental fallacy of ordinary understanding is the delusion that the > universe is reducible to simple substance, or‚Äîthe more Hume-like view‚Äîthat > the content of human knowledge is limited to simple-substance-like, self- > evident sense perceptions. This discredited outlook‚Äîwhether it takes the > naive mechanistic [form] or the equivalent mechanistic outlook of > empiricism‚Äîis termed reductionism. All varieties of reductionism are > formally premised on the fallacious assumption of formal logic, that the > universe can be represented as discrete points interconnected by formal > relations. From this it followed, Bronfenbrenner said, that LaRouche viewed bourgeois economists' concern with prices as reductionism, versus the Marxian concern with values. The reductionist fallacy then lies in adjusting a value theory like labor theory to fit in with price theory; in LaRouche's view, economists should work in the opposite direction. According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed capitalist America as headed for a kind of fascism not much better than that of the Nazis; but he noted that LaRouche's own vision of socialism, and the trade-off between necessity and freedom in a centrally planned economy, seemed apt to result in the justification of a different kind of dictatorship: > Judging from his controversial manner, [LaRouche] impresses at least one > reader as a Me-for-Dictator type to whom it would be dangerous to entrust > the task of drawing any boundary between the domain of freedom and that of > necessity or order. =LaRouche's campaign platforms= The campaign platforms of LaRouche and his followers have included these elements: * A return to a gold-based national and world monetary system, and fixed exchange rates; and replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a national bank; * A war on drug trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering; * An emphasis on large-scale economic infrastructure, including the building of a world land bridge of railroads and a tunnel under the Bering Strait, the building of nuclear power plants, accelerating research on fusion energy, the North American Water and Power Alliance, and rebuilding or nationalizing the country's steel industry; *A crash program to build particle-beam weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI); *Opposition to the USSR and support for a military buildup to prepare for imminent war; *Growth in food production and a farm debt moratorium; *Low interest rates and opposition to the Gramm‚ÄìRudman balanced-budget law; =Later orientation= According to China Youth Daily Online, LaRouche was once a Marxist, but now supports capitalism. He supports public control of financial capital and low-interest loans. Lyndon LaRouche ... used to endorse Marxism, but later switched to supporting the American- style capitalist economy. ... He also states that if the public controlled the financial capital and revitalized industries with low-interest loans, American people can return to the spirit of innovation. LaRouche said banks should not be bailed out, but be placed in receivership by the state. He said that a \\"firewall\\" should prevent state aid from being diverted to speculative entities, which should be allowed to fail, and that such failures would clean up the financial markets. LaRouche believes in the principles of the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and favors state intervention in the economy. LaRouche also said that he supported the approach of U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who established a banking system geared to develop production. Italian Economics Minister Giulio Tremonti said that he had encountered LaRouche at a debate held in 2007 in Rome, and that he appreciates LaRouche's writings. According to an article by Ivo Caizzi in Corriere della Sera, a group of Italian Senators led by Oskar Peterlini asked the Berlusconi government to tackle the financial crisis using legislation developed by LaRouche in 2007. The legislation proposed that public money should save only the commercial infrastructure required for the financing of productive enterprises. The \\"Triple Curve\\", or \\"typical collapse function\\", is an economic model developed by LaRouche which tries to illustrate the growth of financial aggregates at the expense of the physical economy and how this leads to an inevitably collapsing bubble economy. According to the China Youth Daily Online interview, LaRouche's main point is that the real economy (production) is dropping while the nominal economy (money and financial instruments) is going up. As the nominal economy greatly overreaches the real economy, an unavoidable economic crisis ensues. His basic points about the unavoidability of the current US economic crisis are: the production of real goods is constantly dropping, but the credit supplies are steadily increasing, the real and nominal economies form two curves with one going up, and another one going down, which creates a great contrast. When the nominal economy greatly overreaches the real economy, the world will fall into an economic crisis. Since 2000, the LaRouche movement has: *Called for a moratorium on Third World debt. *Opposed deregulation. According to LaRouche's publications, \\"LaRouche has consistently called for reregulation of utilities, transportation, health care (under the \\"Hill-Burton\\" standard), the financial (especially the speculative markets) and other sectors ...\\" They support the renewal of Glass‚ÄìSteagall Act regulations on banks. *In 2007, LaRouche proposed a \\"Homeowners and Bank Protection Act\\". This called for the establishment of a federal agency that would \\"place federal- and state- chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities\\". The bill envisioned a foreclosure moratorium, allowing homeowners to make the equivalent of rental payments for an interim period, and an end to bank bail-outs, forcing banks to reorganize under bankruptcy laws. A LaRouche spokesman said that bank bail-outs \\"reward corrupt swindlers with taxpayer money\\". The proposal attracted support from Democrats at city council and state legislature level. Pennsylvania Democrat Paul Kanjorski opposed the bill, stating it would involve government seizure of \\"every American bank\\". Mike Colpitts of Housing Predictor stated that LaRouche's economic forecasts had been correct, and that he might have received more mainstream credibility had it not been for his controversial history.\\"Former candidate returns to Illinois\\", saukvalley.com, November 2, 2007. Neoplatonism LaRouche references an old dispute between Plato (left) and Aristotle (right), here illustrated in a fresco by Raphael. Aristotle gestures to the earth, representing his belief in knowledge through empirical observation. Plato gestures to the heavens, representing his belief in The Forms. LaRouche's philosophy references an old dispute between Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle believed in knowledge through empirical observation and experience. Plato believed in The Forms. According to LaRouche, history has always been a battle between Platonists‚Äîrationalists, idealists and utopians who believe in absolute truth and the primacy of ideas‚Äîand Aristotelians‚Äîrelativists who rely on empirical data and sensory perception. Platonists in LaRouche's worldview include figures such as Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Leibniz. LaRouche states that many of the world's ills are due to the fact that Aristotelianism, as embraced by British philosophers like Locke, Hume, Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham and represented by \\"oligarchs\\", foremost among them wealthy British families, has dominated, leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the metaphysical, embraces moral relativism, and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. LaRouche frames this struggle as an ancient one, and sees himself and his movement in the tradition of the philosopher-kings in Plato's Republic. For the English empiricists, see also , p. 196. *For the list of friends and foes, see , pp. 22, 188, 192‚Äì193. LaRouche and his followers use Neoplatonism as the basis for an economic model that posits \\"the absolute necessity of progress\\". Economies evolve in stages as humanity devises new technologies, stages that LaRouche compares to the hierarchical spheres in Kepler's model of the solar system based on the Platonic solids. The purpose of science, technology and business must be to assist this progress, enabling the Earth to support an ever-growing humanity. Human life is the supreme value in LaRouche's world view; environmentalism and population control are seen as retrogressive steps, promoting a return to the Dark Ages. Rather than curtailing progress, because of dwindling resources, LaRouche advocates using nuclear technology to make more energy available to humanity, freeing humanity to enjoy music and art. Kepler's Platonic solid model of the solar system from Mysterium Cosmographicum (1596)In LaRouche's view, the people opposing this vision are part of the Aristotelian conspiracy. They may not necessarily be in contact with one another: \\"From their standpoint, [the conspirators] are proceeding by instinct\\", LaRouche has said. \\"If you're asking how their policy is developed‚Äîif there is an inside group sitting down and making plans‚Äîno, it doesn't work that way ... History doesn't function quite that consciously.\\" Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led LaRouche to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, Black Muslims, Teamsters, pro-lifers, and followers of the Ku Klux Klan‚Äîeven though LaRouche counts the Klan itself among his foes. George Johnson, in Architects of Fear (1983), has described LaRouche's Neoplatonist conspiracy theory as a \\"distortion of a real philosophical distinction\\". He has written that the resulting philosophy can be applied to any number of situations in a manner that becomes plausible once one accepts its basic premise. In his view, it forms the foundation of a conspiracy theory that rationalizes paranoid thinking, an opinion echoed by John George and Laird Wilcox in American Extremists: Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists & Others (1996)., p. 2. *, p. 187ff. * *Also see . Discussing LaRouche's view of history, they write (p. 194): \\"We have found no person who has developed a more complex, or more ingenious, paranoid theory than Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche, Jr.\\" *For the relationships LaRouche has formed, including with Klan followers, see , p. 2. *For the list of friends and foes, see , pp. 22, 188, 192‚Äì193. See p. 22 for inclusion of the Klan among his foes. *For LaRouche on his philosophy, see Writing in The New York Times in 1989, Johnson described LaRouche as \\"a kind of Allan Bloom gone mad\\" who seems to \\"believe the nonsense he spouts\\", a view of the world in which Aristotelians use \\"sex, drugs and rock-and-roll\\" and \\"environmentalism and quantum theory\\" to support wealthy oligarchs and create a civilization-destroying \\"new Dark Age\\". Conspiracies LaRouche wrote that conspiracy was natural in human beings. In 1998, he responded to critics of his conspiracism, such as Daniel Pipes and said that Pipes wrongly believed that all reports of conspiracy are axiomatically false. LaRouche's critics, particularly Dennis King and Chip Berlet, characterize his current orientation as being a conspiracist worldview. They say the Marxist concept of the ruling class was converted by LaRouche into a conspiracy theory, in which world capitalism was controlled by a cabal including the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Henry Kissinger, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Daniel Pipes said that LaRouche personalizes his conspiracy theories, and associates \\"all of his adversaries with the forces of darkness.\\" The Executive Intelligence Review (EIR), a LaRouche publication, ran an \\"investigative report\\" titled \\"Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy At It Again, With a New Twist\\" in 2007. The article states: In 2001, LaRouche said that rogue elements within the American military took part in, or planned, the September 11, 2001, attacks as part of a coup d'√©tat. =The \\"British\\" conspiracy= LaRouche is known for alleging conspiracies by the British. LaRouche has said that the dominant imperialist strategic force acting on the planet today is not the United States, but the \\"Anglo-Dutch liberal system\\" of the British Empire, which he asserts is an oligarchic financial consortium like that of medieval Venice, more like a \\"financial slime-mold\\" than a nation. According to this theory, London financial circles protect themselves from competition by using techniques of \\"controlled conflict\\" first developed in Venice, and LaRouche attributes many wars in recent memory to this alleged activity by the British. According to Chip Berlet and Dennis King, LaRouche has always been stridently anti-British and has included Queen Elizabeth II, the British Royal Family, and others, in his list of conspirators who are said to control the world's political economy and the international drug trade. According to Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen, LaRouche is the \\"most illustrious\\" Anglophobe. These views are reflected in three books authored by members of his organization: *Dope, Inc. by David P. Goldman, Konstandinos Kalimtgis and Jeffrey Steinberg, 1978 (): this book discusses the history of narcotics trafficking, beginning with the Opium War, and alleges that British interests have continued to dominate the field up to the modern era, for example through money laundering in British offshore banking colonies. The heart of the conspiracy, according to LaRouche, is the financial elite of the City of London. *The Civil War and the American System by Allen Salisbury, 1979 (): alleges that British interests encouraged and financed the secession movement and supported the Confederacy against the Union in the American Civil War, because they preferred North America to be a primitive agrarian economy that they could dominate through policies of free trade. *The New Dark Ages Conspiracy by Carol White, 1980 (): alleges that a group of British intellectuals led by Bertrand Russell and H. G. Wells attempted to control scientific progress in order to keep the world backward and more easily managed by Imperialism. In this conspiracy theory, Wells wished Science to be controlled by some kind of priesthood and kept from the common man, while Russell wished to stifle it altogether by restricting it to a closed system of formal logic, that would prohibit the introduction of new ideas. This conspiracy also involved the promotion of the counterculture. The Queen and Prince Philip According to book critic and columnist Scott McLemee: > The emergence of the [LaRouche Youth Movement] is all the more surprising, > given that LaRouche himself has long since become the walking punchline to a > very strange joke. He is known for some of the most baroque conspiracy > theories ever put into circulation. Members of the LYM now deny that he ever > accused the Queen of England of drug trafficking‚Äîthough in fact, he did > exactly that throughout the 1980s. At the time, he won admirers on the > extreme right wing by denouncing Henry Kissinger as an agent of the KGB and > calling for AIDS patients to be quarantined. In 2004, in a segment about the death of Jeremiah Duggan during a LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden in March 2003, BBC's Newsnight re- broadcast a BBC interview with LaRouche from 1980, in which he said about the Queen: \\"Of course she's pushing drugs. That is, in the sense of a responsibility, the head of a gang that is pushing drugs, she knows it's happening and she isn't stopping it.\\"Samuels, Tim. \\"Jeremiah Duggan's death and Lyndon LaRouche\\", Newsnight, BBC, February 2004, at 3:49 of part 1 as hosted on YouTube. A 1998 editorial in LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review cited a statement by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in The Daily Telegraph that described LaRouche as the \\"publisher of a book that accuses the Queen of being the world's foremost drug dealer\\", characterising it as a \\"bit of black propaganda\\" and a \\"reference to the book Dope, Inc., ... which laid bare the role of the London-centered offshore financial institutions and allied intelligence services, in running the global drug trade, from the time of Britain's nineteenth-century Opium Wars against China.\\"\\"LaRouche's enemies are Clinton's enemies\\", Executive Intelligence Review, June 12, 1998. Evans- Pritchard further said LaRouche had claimed that the Queen was involved in the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales.Pritchard-Evans, Ambrose. \\"US cult is source of theories\\", The Daily Telegraph, June 4, 1998. The Executive Intelligence Review responded that Evans-Pritchard's article was \\"pure fiction\\", written in response to EIR reporter Jeff Steinberg's appearance on a British ITV television program about the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. In a brief part of an interview with Steinberg broadcast the following day by Channel 4's Dispatches, Steinberg said that while there was \\"no smoking gun proof\\" that Prince Philip asked British intelligence to assassinate Diana, he could not \\"rule out\\" the possibility.Steinberg, Jeffrey, \\"New \`Diana Wars' in Britain Put Focus on LaRouche\\", Executive Intelligence Review, June 19, 1998 =Leo Strauss= LaRouche's initial essay on the influence of Leo Strauss within neoconservatism and the George W. Bush administration, \\"The Essential Fraud of Leo Strauss\\", was written in March 2003. In the same year, a series of pamphlets entitled \\"Children of Satan\\" later consolidated into a book, began appearing. LaRouche charges that there was a conspiracy dominated by what are called Straussians (followers of Leo Strauss) within the Bush administration, and that the dominant personality in this conspiracy was Dick Cheney (whose photo appears on the cover of the book.) LaRouche claimed that these conspirators deliberately misled the American public and the US Congress in order to initiate the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He writes that the Straussians created the Office of Special Plans in order to fabricate intelligence and bypass traditional intelligence channels. According to LaRouche movement member Tony Papert, an important part of this theory is the LaRouchian analysis of the ideas of Leo Strauss which borrows heavily from the writings of Shadia Drury.Papert, Tony, \\"The Secret Kingdom of Leo Strauss\\", Executive Intelligence Review, April 18, 2003 Robert Bartley of The Wall Street Journal has condemned LaRouche's views on this subject, and says that it may have influenced other commentators who subsequently published a similar analysis, such as Seymour Hersh and James Atlas in their articles for The New York Times. Bartley quotes the assertion by LaRouche movement member Jeffrey Steinberg that a \\"cabal of Strauss disciples, along with an equally small circle of allied neo-conservative and Likudnik fellow-travelers\\" have plotted a \\"not-so-silent coup\\" using the September 11 attacks as a justification, similar to the Reichstag fire of 1933. Bartley complains that Strauss's \\"words are twisted from their meaning\\" in order to justify the theory. Canadian journalist Jeet Heer has commented that LaRouche's followers \\"argue that Strauss is the evil genius behind the Republican Party\\". Political science scholars Catherine and Michael Zuckert say that LaRouche's writings were the first to connect Strauss to neoconservatism and the Bush foreign policy and initiated the discussion of the topic, though the views about it changed as it percolated through to international journalism. =Bush family= The Executive Intelligence Review (EIR) published an article by Anton Chaitkin alleging that Prescott Bush \\"had persevered with his comrades in the old Auschwitz gang\\" and that \\"the smoldering bodies in Auschwitz followed logically upon the race propaganda festival which had been staged by the Harriman-Bush enterprise a decade earlier in New York.\\"CRIMES OF THE BUSH DYNASTY Dubya's Grandpa and Great-Granddad Helped Put Adolf Hitler into Power by Anton Chaitkin, Executive Intelligence Review August 25, 2000 EIR published a book, George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography, by Webster Griffin Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, in 1992, which said that \\"virtually all the Nazi trade with the United States was under the supervision of the Harriman-Bush interests\\", and that \\"Bush's family had already played a central role in financing and arming Adolf Hitler for his takeover of Germany; in financing and managing the buildup of Nazi war industries for the conquest of Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the development of Nazi genocide theories and racial propaganda, with their well-known results. ... The President's family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powerful Anglo- American family associations, which later boosted him into the Central Intelligence Agency and up to the White House, were his father's partners in the Hitler project.\\"The Hitler Project by Anton Chaitkin, EIR 1992Gary Indiana (May 18, 2004). \\"No such thing as paranoia\\", The Village Voice In 2006, The Larouche Political Action Committee and EIR published \\"Larouche to Rumsfeld: FDR Defeated the Nazis, While Bushes Collaborated\\". PANIC proposal and AIDS In 1974, an organisation affiliated to LaRouche predicted that there would be pandemics in Africa. When AIDS was first recognized as a medical phenomenon in the early 1980s, LaRouche activists were convinced that this was the pandemic about which the task force had warned. LaRouche and his followers stated (incorrectly) that HIV, the AIDS virus, could be transmitted by casual contact, citing as supporting evidence the high incidence of the disease in Africa, the Caribbean and southern Florida. LaRouche said that the transmission by insect bite was \\"thoroughly established\\". John Grauerholz, medical director of the BHTF, told reporters that the Soviet Union may have started the epidemic and that U.S. health officials aided the Soviets by not doing more to stop AIDS. AIDS became a key plank in LaRouche's platform. His slogan was \\"Spread Panic, not AIDS!\\" LaRouche's followers created \\"Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee\\" (PANIC), which sponsored California Proposition 64, the \\"LaRouche Initiative\\", in 1986. Mel Klenetsky, co-director of political operations for the Larouche-affiliated National Democratic Policy Committee and LaRouche's campaign director, said that there must be universal testing and mandatory quarantining of HIV carriers. \\"Twenty to 30 million out of 100 million people in central Africa have AIDS\\", Klenetsky said. \\"It is spreading because of impoverished economic conditions, and that is a direct result of IMF policies that have destroyed people's means of resisting the disease.\\" Klenetsky said that LaRouche believed that not only drug users and homosexuals are vulnerable to the disease. The measure was met with strong opposition and was defeated. A second AIDS initiative qualified for the ballot in 1988, but the measure failed by a larger margin. In response to a survey which predicted that 72% of voters would oppose the measure, a spokesman called the poll \\"an obvious fraud\\", saying that pollsters deliberately worded questions to prejudice respondents against the initiative. He additionally said that the poll was part of a \\"big lie ... witch hunt\\" orchestrated by Armand Hammer and Elizabeth Taylor. As early as 1985, NDPC members ran for local school boards on a platform of keeping infected students out of school. In 1986 LaRouche supporters traveled from Seattle to Lebanon, Oregon to urge the school board there to reverse a policy that would allow children with AIDS to enroll. In 1987, followers tried to organize a boycott of an elementary school in the Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen, sending a van with loudspeakers through the district. They disrupted an informational meeting and, according to press accounts, told parents that \\"The blood of your own children will be on your hands if you allow this child with AIDS in your school\\", or shouted at opponents, \\"He has AIDS! He has AIDS!\\" LaRouche purchased a national TV spot during his 1988 presidential campaign, in which he summarized his views and proposals with respect to the AIDS epidemic. He said most statements about how AIDS is spread were an \\"outright lie\\" and that talk of safe sex was just propaganda put out by the government to avoid spending the money required to address the crisis. LaRouche-affiliated candidates used AIDS as an issue as late as 1994. Opponents characterized it as an anti-gay measure that would force HIV-positive individuals out of their jobs and into quarantine, or create \\"concentration camps for AIDS patients.\\" According to newspaper reports, the LaRouche newspaper New Solidarity said the initiative was opposed by Communist gangs composed of the \\"lower sexual classes\\" and he warned of the recruitment of millions of Americans into the ranks of \\"AIDS-riddled homosexuality\\". Environment and energy Me≈°troviƒá says LaRouche follows Vladimir Vernadsky in seeing the human mind as a force transforming the biosphere into a higher form, the no√∂sphere. LaRouche favors a highly industrialized civilization reaching for innovation and interplanetary colonization. The movement says that the theory of man-caused global warming prevents the development of emerging economies.Rodriguez, Martin, Iluminados y malditos, Noticias Urbanas, December 5, 2008 It also says the top level organizations in the command structure of the environmental movement include the World Wildlife Fund, headed by Prince Philip, the Aspen Institute, and the Club of Rome. According to Chip Berlet, \\"Pro-LaRouche publications have been at the forefront of denying the reality of global warming\\". The LaRouche movement's 21st Century Science & Technology magazine has been called \\"anti- environmental\\" by Mother Jones magazine. LaRouche publications denounced the concept of a nuclear winter, the theory that nuclear war could lead to global cooling, as early as 1983, calling it a \\"fraud\\" and a \\"hoax\\" popularized by the Soviet Union to weaken the U.S. Some of the movement's ideas were later adopted by the Wise use movement. The LaRouche movement opposed ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which failed in the U.S. Senate in 1994. =Energy-flux density= LaRouche asserts a concept energy-flux density, which is the rate of energy use per person and per unit area of the economy as a whole. He asserts that an increase in energy flux density as a fundamental principle of the universe in general (contrary the second law of thermodynamics), and the appropriate destiny or goal for mankind in general. Consequently, policies or ideologies deemed to oppose this increase must be opposed and are foolish and dangerous: for example, moves to decrease energy consumption or improve efficiency, or to reduce consumption, or to reduce population; policies deemed increase it should be pursued: higher energy fuels such as nuclear fuels, higher populations, higher consumption.Video of LaRouche and others asserting energy-flux density, among numerous subjects =Nuclear power= LaRouche says that nuclear and especially fusion power is necessary for the continued growth of civilization. He founded the Fusion Energy Foundation, which published the journal Fusion (later renamed to 21st Century Science & Technology). In his 1980 presidential platform, LaRouche promised 2500 nuclear power plants if elected. In 2007 LaRouche reiterated his position, saying that only the \\"massive investment\\" in fission and fusion technology could prevent the \\"collapse of human existence on this planet\\". The movement has targeted opponents of nuclear power. Members of the Clamshell Alliance, non-violent protesters at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, were called \\"terrorists\\" in 1977. Representatives of LaRouche's U.S. Labor Party gave incriminating information to law enforcement about them, which the FBI later determined had been fabricated, according to King.King (1989) ch.24 During a large demonstration against the plant in 1989, an airplane carried a banner overhead which read, \\"Free LaRouche! Kill Satan ‚Äì Open Seabrook\\". The movement blames cabalists, including then-congressman Dick Cheney, for inciting anti-nuclear sentiments during the late 1970s. LaRouche sources described the incident at the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island as sabotage, since they considered the control systems too sophisticated to fail by accident. =DDT= 21st Century Science & Technology's managing editor, Marjorie Mazel Hecht, called the campaign against DDT the \\"'mother' of all the environmental hoaxes\\".Rowell (1996) pp 135‚Äì136 Other articles compared anti-DDT campaigner Rachel Carson to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. 21st century, which is produced by LaRouche supporters, has published papers by entomologist J. Gordon Edwards, including one that urged the return of the insecticide DDT because he said it has \\"saved more millions of lives than any other man-made chemical\\". Rogelio (Roger) Maduro, an associate editor, wrote that the ban on DDT was part of a plan to reduce the population and had caused the deaths of 40 million people via a resurgence of malaria. =Ozone hole= LaRouche was part of what was called the \\"ozone backlash\\". 21st Century Science & Technology, which conducted what has been called \\"a very effective campaign of misinformation on the issue of ozone depletion\\", published The Holes in the Ozone Scare in 1992. The book, by LaRouche followers Rogelio Maduro and Ralf Schauerhammer, said that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were not destroying the ozone layer and opposed the proposal to ban them. It asserted that most chlorine in the atmosphere came from oceans, volcanoes, or other natural sources, and that CFCs were too heavy to reach the ozone layer. It went on to say that even if the ozone layer were depleted there would not be any harmful effects from additional ultraviolet radiation. It predicted that a ban would result in an additional 20 to 40 million deaths due to food spoilage. Lewis DuPont Smith, an heir to the DuPont Chemical fortune and a LaRouche follower, told Maduro that the DuPont Company had schemed to ban CFCs, which they had invented but which had become generic, in order to replace them with more expensive proprietary compounds. It has been called \\"probably the best known and most widely quoted text aimed at debunking the concept of ozone depletion\\". Its assertions were repeated by Dixy Lee Ray in her 1993 book Environmental Overkill, by Rush Limbaugh, and by Ronald Bailey. Some atmospheric scientists have said that it is based on poor research. At a 1994 shareholder's meeting, Smith called on Dupont to continue producing CFCs, saying there was no evidence of their harmfulness and that \\"This is nothing less than genocide\\". By 1995 LaRouche was noted as calling the ozone hole a \\"myth\\". Maduro's writings were the basis for the Arizona legislature's passage of a 1995 bill to allow the production of CFCs in the state despite federal and international prohibitions. =Global warming= The \\"Greenhouse effect\\" hoax: a world federalist plot, another book by Maduro, says that the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is a plot by the British royal family and communists to undermine the U.S. It was cited by science writer David Bellamy. LaRouche followers have promoted the documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle and attacked Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth, infiltrating showings to promote their viewpoints. They have stood on street corners proclaiming the falsity of global warming, and have protested Gore's appearances. 21st Century Science & Technology has published papers by climate change contrarians including Zbigniew Jaworowski, Nils-Axel M√∂rner, Hugh Ellsaesser, and Robert E. Stevenson. A 2007 article by LaRouche science advisor Laurence Hecht suggested that the varying levels of cosmic rays, whose change is dependent on Earth's motion through the galaxy, has a larger effect on the climate than local factors such as greenhouse gases or solar and orbital cycles. Christopher Monckton was praised as the leading spokesman of the \\"global warming swindle\\" in the introduction to an Executive Intelligence Review interview with him in 2009, but he was also considered to have a relatively limited view of the cabal behind the hoax. A movement newsletter says that environmental groups seek to \\"force ... CO2 emissions agreements down the throats of governments as a way of finishing off the nation-state system\\" on behalf of synarchist networks. Music and science LaRouche was fascinated by musical theory, as well as mathematics and physics, and this fascination also translates into his teachings; his followers for example have attempted to link the musical scale to his Neoplatonist model of economic evolution, and study singing and geometry. A common teaser used by the movement is to ask people whether they know how to \\"double the square\\"‚Äîdraw a square whose area is twice the size of an existing square. A motto of LaRouche's European Workers' Party is \\"Think like Beethoven\\"; movement offices typically include a piano and posters of German composers, and members are known for their choral singing at protest events, using satirical lyrics tailored to their targets.For LaRouche's interests, see LaRouche, Lyndon. \\"Correspondence: Classical Composition\\", The New Republic, December 26, 1988. *For the movement's interests, see *For \\"Think like Beethoven\\", see *For singing at events, see *For an example of a LaRouche choir singing at a protest, see  *For doubling the square, see LaRouche and his wife have an interest in classical music up to Johannes Brahms. LaRouche abhors contemporary music; holding that rock music is subversive, and was deliberately created to be so by British intelligence.For rock, see *for the Beatles, see Pearlman, September 23, 2003.}} LaRouche is quoted as saying that jazz music was \\"foisted on black Americans by the same oligarchy which had run the U.S. slave trade\\". This dislike for modern music also extends to classical music the movement disapproves of; LaRouche movement members have protested at performances of Richard Wagner's operas, denouncing Wagner as an anti-Semite who found favor with the Nazis, and called a conductor \\"satanic\\" because he played contemporary music. *Also see In 1988, LaRouche advocated that classical orchestras should return to the \\"Verdi pitch\\", a pitch that Giuseppe Verdi had enshrined in Italian legislation in 1884. Orchestras' pitches have risen since the 18th century, because a higher pitch produces a more brilliant orchestral sound, while imposing an additional strain on singers' voices. Verdi succeeded in 1884 in having legislation passed in Italy that fixed the reference pitch for A at 432 Hz, but in 1938, the international standard was raised to 440 Hz, with some major orchestras tuning as high as 450 Hz in recent times. LaRouche spoke about the resulting strain on singers' voices in his 1988 presidential campaign videos. By 1989 the initiative had attracted support from more than 300 opera stars, including Joan Sutherland, Pl√°cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Montserrat Caball√©. While many of these singers may or may not have been aware of LaRouche's politics, Renata Tebaldi and Piero Cappuccilli ran for the European Parliament on LaRouche's \\"Patriots for Italy\\" platform and appeared as featured speakers at a conference organised by the Schiller Institute. (The institute was founded by LaRouche and his wife, Helga.) The discussions led to debates in the Italian parliament about reinstating Verdi's legislation. LaRouche himself gave an interview to National Public Radio on the initiative in 1989 from prison. Stefan Zucker, the editor of Opera Fanatic (and, incidentally, the \\"world's highest tenor\\") opposed the initiative on the grounds that it would result in the establishment of a \\"pitch police\\", arguing that the way it presented the history of the tuning pitch was a \\"simplification\\", and that LaRouche was using the issue to gain credibility. The initiative in the Italian Senate failed to result in corresponding legislation being passed. *.  LaRouche considers pitch important, believing that the Verdi pitch has a direct relation to the structure of the universe, and that bel canto singing at the correct pitch maximizes the music's impact on both singers and listeners.McLemee, Scott. \\"The LaRouche Youth Movement\\", Inside Higher Ed, July 11, 2007 Opposition to Obama's health reforms LaRouche's organization opposed the Obama administration's health-care reform proposals. Posters of Obama wearing a Hitler-style mustache appeared at a LaRouche movement rally. As town-hall meetings on this issue during the summer of 2009 began to attract very large and angry crowds, the comparison of Obama to Hitler began to show up on many signs and banners. The Atlantic wrote that LaRouche supporters \\"patented the Obama-is-Nazi theme\\". Sexuality and politics In 1973, LaRouche wrote an article called \\"Beyond Psychoanalysis\\". He theorized that each culture had characteristic flaws that resulted in blocks to effective political organizing. LaRouche and his colleagues conducted studies of different \\"national ideologies\\", including German, French, Italian, English, Latin American, Greek, and Swedish.LaRouche, Lyndon, \\"Marat, De Sade, And \`Greenspin'\\", Executive Intelligence Review, June 29, 2001 In an article, \\"The Sexual Impotency of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party\\", LaRouche criticised Machismo. Regarding the role of women, he adds, \\"The task of real women's liberation is to generally strengthen women's self-consciousness and their power and opportunities to act upon self-consciousness.\\" Minority politics Critics say the movement is antisemitic, conspiracist, and anti-LGBT, and that its political and economic proposals are a cover for its actual beliefs.Berlet, Chip. \\"Protocols to the Left, Protocols to the Right: Conspiracism in American Political Discourse at the Turn of the Second Millennium.\\" Reconsidering \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\": 100 Years After the Forgery, October 30‚Äì31, 2005, Boston ¬§ Berlet, Chip & Bellman Joe. \\"Lyndon LaRouche: Fascism Wrapped in an American Flag\\", Political Research Associates, March 10, 1989 ¬§ Berlet, Chip & Lyons, Matthew.

A LaRouche-affiliated newspaper wrote that demonstrators against the LaRouche- sponsored AIDS initiative in California were from the \\"lower sexual classes.\\" =Judaism and Zionism= British journalist Roger Boyes wrote, \\"Anti-Semitism is at the core of LaRouche's conspiracy theories, which he adapts to modern events -most recently the war in Iraq.\\" Daniel Levitas wrote in 1995 that LaRouche \\"has been consistent in creating and elaborating conspiracy theories that contain a strong dose of antisemitism\\". As an example of LaRouche's alleged antisemitism, Dennis King cited LaRouche's statement (under the pen name L. Marcus) in The Case of Ludwig Feuerbach (1973), \\"Jewish culture ... is merely the residue left to the Jewish home after everything saleable has been marketed to the Goyim.\\" The charge of antisemitism in the LaRouche network resurfaced in the media in 2004 in accounts of the death of a Jewish student, Jeremiah Duggan, who had been attending a Schiller Institute event in Germany. British press reports described LaRouche as \\"the American leader of a sect with a fascist and antisemitic ideology\\", and said he was \\"infamous for his anti-Semitic views and claims the world's governments have been taken over by a Zionist conspiracy.\\" LaRouche denied over a long period that his movement is antisemitic. In 2006, LaRouche said, \\"Religious and racial hatred, such as anti-Semitism [is] the most evil expression of criminality to be seen on the planet today.\\" Debra Freeman, a spokesperson for LaRouche, told a newspaper in 2010 that, \\"Hitler was a lunatic, but his policies were based principally on economic policy and staying in power. We mourn the loss of six million Jews and countless others.\\" LaRouche's critics have said he is a \\"disguised anti- Semite\\", in that he takes the classical antisemitic conspiracy theory and substitutes the word \\"Zionist\\" for the word \\"Jew\\", and ascribes the classical antisemitic caricature of the \\"scheming Jew\\" to particular Jewish individuals and groups of Jews, rather than to the Jews as a whole. \\"Modern Zionism was not created by Jews, but was a project developed chiefly by Oxford University\\", LaRouche says. He says, \\"Zionism is not Judaism.\\"Special issue, \\"Zionism is not Judaism,\\" Campaigner, December 1978 In 1978, the same year LaRouche's article cited The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, the LaRouche group published Dope, Inc.: Britain's Opium War against the U.S., which cited the Protocols and defended its authenticity, likening the \\"Elders of Zion\\" to the Rothschild banking family, the British Royal family, and the Italian Mafia, and the Israeli Mossad, General Pike, and the B'nai B'rith. (Dope, Inc.) Later editions left out cites to The Protocols. This is the genesis of the claim that LaRouche has said Queen Elizabeth runs drugs. When asked by an NBC reporter in 1984 about the Queen and drug running, LaRouche replied, \\"Of course she's pushing drugs ... that is in a sense of responsibility: the head of a gang that is pushing drugs; she knows it's happening and she isn't stopping it.\\"(NBC News, First Camera, March 4, 1984, transcript from NBC News, excerpt used with permission). Chip Berlet argues that LaRouche indirectly expresses antisemitism through the use of \\"coded language\\" and by attacking neoconservatives. Dennis King maintains, for example, that words like \\"British\\" were really code words for 'Jew.'\\"George, John and Wilcox, Laird, American Extremists: Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists & Others, Prometheus Books, Amherst, New York. 1996 Other critics of LaRouche believe that LaRouche's anti-British statements disparage the British system rather than the Jewish religion. Laird Wilcox and John George write that \\"Dennis King goes to considerable lengths to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi, even engaging in a little conspiracy-mongering of his own.\\" =Race= Manning Marable of Columbia University wrote in a 1997 column that LaRouche had a \\"long attempted to destroy and manipulate black leaders, political organizations and the black church\\". During LaRouche's slander suit against NBC in 1984, Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, took the stand for LaRouche as a character witness, stating under oath that LaRouche's views on racism were \\"consistent with his own.\\" Asked whether he had seen any indication of racism in LaRouche's associates, he replied that he had not.. Innis received criticism from many blacks for having testified on LaRouche's behalf..Bivins, Larry. \\"Frist embraces King's legacy\\", USA Today, January 21, 2003. The African-American civil-rights leader James Bevel was LaRouche's running mate in the 1992 presidential election, and in the mid-1990s, the LaRouche movement entered into an alliance with Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam.. Another LaRouche movement member with a record in civil-rights issues is Amelia Boynton Robinson, who is vice-president of the Schiller Institute, a LaRouche organization; she has described the movement as following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr.: \\"Mr. And Mrs. LaRouche built a movement, taking up where Dr. King had left off. They realized ... there must be an universal image of mankind, which transcends all racial differences and barriers.\\" * Accusations of fascism against the LaRouche movement LaRouche supporter sign portraying Barack Obama with a \\"Hitler mustache\\" LaRouche's movement has frequently been accused of being fascist. Those making the accusation include Democratic National Committee chairman Paul G. Kirk, a local Texas Democratic district committee, and Democratic activist Bob Hattoy Dennis King, a former Marxist‚ÄìLeninist and member of the Progressive Labor Party in the 1960s and early 1970s, used this thesis in the title of his book-length study of LaRouche and his movement, Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism (1989). Operation Mop-Up, which is said to have consisted of violent physical attacks on left-wing meetings, is used as a basis for such accusations.\\"Chronology of Labor Committee Attacks, issued by New York Committee to Stop Terrorist Attacks, 1973; contemporary articles and photographs in the Daily World, the Militant, Workers Power, the Fifth Estate, the Boston Phoenix, and the Drummer; \\"An Introduction to NCLC: \\"The Word is Beware\\", Liberation New Service, #599, March 23, 1974; Charles M.

He replied that intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals, and that the charge has no basis in any real scientific analysis of politics. According to Fursov, it comes from the fact that LaRouche criticizes the supposedly \\"democratic\\" but actually \\"liberal totalitarian\\" system of the West. Fursov said that in Russia not so many people know of LaRouche and that the important thing is not the quantity, but the quality.Benedictine, Kyrill, interview with Andrei Fursov, Intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals , Terra-America, April 19, 2012 George Johnson, in a review of King's book in The New York Times, said that King's presentation of LaRouche as a \\"would-be F√ºhrer\\" was \\"too neat\\", and that it failed to take into account that several members of LaRouche's inner circle were themselves Jewish, while acknowledging that LaRouche's \\"conspiracy theory is designed to appeal to anti-Semitic right-wingers as well as to Black Muslims and nuclear engineers\\". In his 1983 book, Architects of Fear, Johnson described LaRouche's dalliances with radical groups on the right as \\"a marriage of convenience\\", and less than sincere; as evidence he cited a 1975 party memo that spoke of uniting with the right simply for the purpose of overthrowing the established order: \\"Once we have won this battle, eliminating our right-wing opposition will be comparatively easy.\\" At the same time, Johnson says, LaRouche also sought contact with the Soviet Union and the Ba'ath Party in Iraq; failing to recruit either the Soviets or right-wingers to his cause, LaRouche attempted to adopt a more mainstream image in the 1980s. Laird Wilcox and John George similarly stated that King had gone too far in trying \\"to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi\\" and that LaRouche's most severe critics, like King and Berlet, came from extreme leftist backgrounds themselves.

History =Founders= St. Catherine University was founded as the College of St. Catherine in 1905 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, under the leadership of Mother Seraphine Ireland. The University is named for St. Catherine of Alexandria, the fourth-century Egyptian lay philosopher who suffered martyrdom for her faith.Our History., St. Catherine University. Retrieved May 7, 2018. A site for St. Kate's was chosen atop the city's second-highest hill in St. Paul ‚Äî in the area now known as Highland Park. Hugh Derham of Rosemount contributed $20,000 for the first building. Derham Hall opened in January 1905, offering classes to high school boarding students and lower-division college students. The high school eventually moved to its own campus and merged with the Lasallian-run Cretin High School to form Cretin-Derham Hall High School in 1987. Upper-division courses were first offered in the academic year of 1911‚Äì12. In spring 1913, Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred on the first two students to complete four years at the new institution. In 1917, St. Kate's earned full accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. During World War II, St. Kate's responded to a critical nursing shortage by expanding its programs to include a baccalaureate degree in nursing and assuming leadership of the St. Joseph's and St. Mary's hospitals and schools of nursing ‚Äî and partnering with the U.S. Cadet Nursing Corps to provide students with financial assistance in exchange for nursing services. More than 170 St. Catherine alumnae served in military hospitals between 1942 and 1948. Prior to the 1970s, students would take classes at the nearby University of St. Thomas, which was then a men's college. =Expansion to Minneapolis= The St. Paul campus is the location for most day, evening/weekend, and graduate program classes, with 110 wooded acres in the Highland Park neighborhood, a central location between the Twin Cities' downtowns. St. Kate's coeducational Minneapolis campus in the Riverside neighborhood offers associate degree and certificate programs in numerous healthcare fields. In 1887, the Sisters of St. Joseph responded to a need for trained nurses in the region founding the St. Mary's School of Nursing at St. Mary's Hospital in Minneapolis. Student nurses in the three year Registered Nurse program lived in a dormitory at the hospital while studying first year academics at the College of St. Catherine. In 1964, the hospital program was expanded and opened under the title St. Mary's Junior College. St. Mary's offered associate degrees in healthcare, including the first occupational therapy assistant program and the first physical therapist assistant program in the United States.

A typical bicycle helmet A bicycle helmet is designed to attenuate impacts to the head of a cyclist in falls while minimizing side effects such as interference with peripheral vision. There is ongoing scientific research into the degree of protection offered by bicycle helmets in the event of an accident, and the effects of helmet wearing on cyclist and motor vehicle driver behaviour. There is active debate over what can be concluded from available studies, and on whether the use of helmets by cyclists should be promoted or mandated, either just for children, or for cyclists of all ages. In particular the debate over bicycle helmet laws has been intense and occasionally bitter, often based not only on differing interpretations of the scientific and other academic literature, but also on differing assumptions and interests of various parties.  History  Nat Butler 1910 Radhelm 1940er Martin Wierstra (NED) 1959 Bernhard Eckstein 1960 = History of designs = \\"Hairnet\\" helmet A cycle helmet should generally be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling can be an intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature, and the head in particular needs to be able to regulate its temperature. The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the leather \\"hairnet\\" style. This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal impact protection, and was mainly used by racing cyclists. More widespread use of helmets began in the US in the 1970s. After many decades, when bicycles were regarded largely as children's toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s. Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR, a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment, and Bell Sports, a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles. These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate plastic shells. The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc., having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business. The first commercially successful purpose-designed bicycle helmet was the Bell Biker, a polystyrene-lined hard shell released in 1975. At the time there was no appropriate standard; the only applicable one, from Snell, would be passed only by a light open-face motorcycle helmet. Over time the design was refined and by 1983 Bell were making the V1-Pro, the first polystyrene helmet intended for racing use. In 1984 Bell produced the Lil Bell Shell, a no-shell children's helmet. These early helmets had little ventilation. In 1985, Snell B85 was introduced, the first widely adopted standard for bicycle helmets; this has subsequently been refined into B90 and B95 (see Standards below). At this time helmets were almost all either hard-shell or no-shell (perhaps with a vacuum-formed plastic cover). Ventilation was still minimal due mainly to technical limitations of the foams and shells in use. Giro Atmos helmet, showing seamless in-mould micro shell construction. Around 1990 a new construction technique was invented: in-mould micro shell. A very thin shell was incorporated during the moulding process. This rapidly became the dominant technology, allowing for larger vents and more complex shapes than hard shells. Use of hard shells declined rapidly among the general cyclist population during the 1990s, almost disappearing from road and cross country mountain bike helmets by the end of the decade, but remaining popular with BMX riders and more aggressive mountain bike disciplines such as downhill riding. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw advances in retention and fitting systems, with cradles which adjust precisely to the rider's head, replacing the old system of varying thickness pads. This resulted in the back of the head being less covered by the helmet, although more recent designs have largely addressed this. Since more advanced helmets began being used in the Tour de France, carbon fiber inserts are often used to increase strength and protection of the helmet. The Giro Atmos and Ionos, as well as the Bell Alchera, were among the first to use carbon fiber. Some modern road and track racing bicycle helmets have a long tapering back end for streamlining. This type of helmet is mainly dedicated to time trial racing as they lack significant ventilation, making them uncomfortable for long races. = History of standards = In the United States the Snell Memorial Foundation, an organisation initially established to create standards for motorcycle and auto racing helmets, implemented one of the first standards, since updated. Snell's standard includes testing of random samples.http://www.smf.org/standards/b/b95std.html Snell 1995 Bicycle Helmet Standard. 1998 revision and amendments In 1990 the Consumers' Association (UK) market survey showed that around 90 % of helmets on sale were Snell B90 certified. By their 1998 survey, the number of Snell certified helmets was around zero. There are two main types of helmet: hard shell and soft/micro shell (no-shell helmets are now rare). Hard shells declined rapidly among the general cyclist population over this period, almost disappearing by the end of the decade, but remained more popular with BMX riders as well as inline skaters and skateboarders. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created a standard called ANSI Z80.4 in 1984. Later, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) created its own mandatory standard for all bicycle helmets sold in the United States, which took effect in March 1999. In the European Union (EU) the currently applicable standards are EN 1078:1997 and EN 1080:1997. An additional and voluntary standard was created by Swedish medical professionals. MIPS-compliant helmets are intended to reduce rotational violence to the brain caused by angled impacts. In Australia and New Zealand, the current legally required standard is AS/NZS 2063. A 2004 report concluded that the performance requirements of the 1996 version of this standard was slightly less strict than the Snell B95 standard but incorporated a quality assurance requirement, making it arguably safer. = Design intentions and standards = The standards are intended to reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards only look at linear accelerations and ignore rotational accelerations. The rotational accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can be large enough to cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and subdural haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce rotational accelerations in accidents. It is important that a helmet fit the cyclist properly ‚Äì in one study of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years, 96 % were found to be incorrectly fitted. Efficacy of incorrectly fitted helmets is reckoned to be much lower; one estimate states that risk is increased almost twofold. History of use Helmets use varies greatly between populations and between groups. Downhill mountain bikers and amateur sportive cyclists normally wear helmets,FUBICY, F√©d√©ration francaise des Usagers de la Bicyclette. Our helmet main page, English version. the ratio of cyclists wearing a helmet is close to 90% among sportive cyclists (86 to 94%), whereas this ratio is only 7% among urban cyclists or non-sportive leisure cyclists and helmet use is enforced in professional cycle sport and in a few legal jurisdictions. Utility cyclists and children are much less likely to wear helmets unless compelled. =Required helmet use in cycling sport= Historically, road cycling regulations set by the sport's ruling body, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), did not require helmet use, leaving the matter to individual preferences and local traffic laws. The majority of professional cyclists chose not to wear helmets, citing discomfort and claiming that helmet weight would put them in a disadvantage during uphill sections of the race. The first serious attempt by the UCI to introduce compulsory helmet use was 1991 Paris‚ÄìNice race, which resulted in a riders' strike, and UCI abandoned the idea. While voluntary helmet use in professional ranks rose somewhat in the 1990s, the turning point in helmet policy was the March 2003 death of Andrei Kivilev at the Paris‚ÄìNice. The new rules were introduced on 5 May 2003, with the 2003 Giro d'Italia being the first major race affected. The 2003 rules allowed for discarding the helmets during final climbs of at least 5 kilometres in length; subsequent revisions made helmet use mandatory at all times. Cycling risk and head injury Example of shock detector in bicycle helmet to signal when a crash has occurred Three types of modern bicycle helmet design technologies. Bontrager Wavecell (left), Smith Koroyd (center), and MIPS (right) In the US, two-thirds of cyclists admitted to hospital have a head injury. Ninety percent of cyclist deaths are caused by collisions with motor vehicles.. Effectiveness =Meta-analyses= There are several meta- analyses and reviews which synthesise and evaluate the results of multiple case-control studies. A 1999 Cochrane review of case-control studies of bicycle helmets by Thompson et al., a team funded by the helmet industry and based largely on the authors' own primary research, said that \\"helmets provide a 63 to 88% reduction in the risk of head, brain and severe brain injury for all ages of bicyclists. Helmets provide equal levels of protection for crashes involving motor vehicles (69%) and crashes from all other causes (68%). Injuries to the upper and mid facial areas are reduced 65%.\\" A 2001 meta- analysis commissioned by the Australian government said that there was \\"overwhelming evidence in support of helmets for preventing head injury and fatal injury\\". A 2012 re-analysis, by Elvik, concluded that the 2001 meta- analysis \\"was influenced by publication bias and time-trend bias that was not controlled for. As a result, the analysis reported inflated estimates of the effects of bicycle helmets\\". Elvik writes \\"When the risk of injury to head, face or neck is viewed as a whole, bicycle helmets do provide a small protective effect. This effect is statistically significant in older studies. New studies, summarised by a random-effects model of analysis, indicate only a statistically non-significant protective effect\\". As a result of a challenge to the accuracy of the meta-analysis, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration removed the language, \\"up to 85 percent effective\\" from their web site.National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, letter to James G. Titus, May 14, 2013 =Health benefits of cycling= Studies from China, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom show that regular cyclists live longer because the health effects far outweigh the risk of crashes. A reduction in the number of cyclists is likely to harm the health of the population more than any possible protection from injury. UK figures show that it takes at least 8,000 years of average cycling to produce one clinically severe head injury and 22,000 years for one death. De Jong developed a mathematical model to evaluate the health-risk trade-offs of all-age mandatory helmet laws, if they were to be introduced in various North American and Western European countries. He concluded that helmet laws appear to offer net health benefit only in those countries with more dangerous bicycling environments under optimistic assumptions of the efficacy of helmets. Newbold suggested improvements to the De Jong model, and, using published cycling statistics for the United States in his revised model, found that mandatory bicycle helmet laws would seem to have positive net public health benefits there. However, Newbold stressed that there were many parameters to these models which require further research to properly quantitate, and that results should be considered provisional rather than definitive. Some researchers have suggested that a legal requirement to wear helmets there may have dissuaded people from cycling, and that repeal of these laws could lead to increased cycling. This suggestion has been criticised. Fewer cyclists might lead to increased risks per cyclist due to the \\"safety in numbers\\" effect. This means that if the number of cyclists on the road doubles, then the average individual cyclist can ride for an additional 50 percent of the time without increasing the probability of being struck. It is thought that the increased frequency of motorist-cyclist interaction creates more aware motorists. =Risk compensation= It has been hypothesised that the wearing of helmets may make cyclists feel safer and thus take more risks. This hypothetical effect is known as risk compensation or risk homeostasis. Some authors have suggested that risk compensation occurs with other road safety interventions such as seat belts and anti-lock braking systems, but these views are disputed by other road safety experts. A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found that helmeted cyclists involved in accidents were less likely to have committed a traffic law violation than unhelmeted cyclists, and that helmeted cyclists were no more likely to have committed a speeding violation in association with the accident than unhelmeted cyclists. The authors concluded that \\"‚Ä¶although the findings do not support the existence of a strong risk compensation mechanism among helmeted cyclists, this possibility cannot be ruled out.\\" In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. An experimental study found that children negotiating an obstacle course on foot went faster and took more risks when wearing safety gear (including helmets). A telephone interview study found that in hypothetical scenarios of their children wearing protective equipment or not, parents' ratings of permissible risk for their children was higher if protective gear was hypothetically worn. Motorists may also alter their behaviour toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5 cm less) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres). An initial re-analysis of these data by other investigators agreed that with the 8.5 cm finding, but argued that there were not more \\"close passes\\" (which they defined as under 1 metre of clearance). In 2018, Walker published a rebuttal, arguing that there were more passes under 1.5m (the legal minimum distance in Spain and Germany) or 2m, and there was not enough evidence to say there weren't more passes at under 1m.https://psyarxiv.com/nxw2k In 1988 Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective#Rodgers1988; he found data errors and methodological weaknesses, and concluded that in fact the data showed \\"bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use\\". He mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association. = Counterfeits = With fake \\"knock-off\\" products of inferior quality and durability increasingly appearing for sale online, many direct from China, consumers are warned to be suspicious of prices that seem too good to be true, and to purchase helmets from reputable local or online sellers. The main target markets seem to be the US and Europe, with 90 percent of US counterfeit seizures coming from Hong Kong and China. =Accidents from wearing at inappropriate times= The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has warned that children should not wear bike helmets while using playground equipment, or any time when they are not biking, because of the risk of strangulation by the helmet strap should the helmet or strap be caught in playground equipment, a tree being climbed, and so on.U.

A study published in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport investigated the influence of BMX helmets and neck braces on translational and rotational accelerations in youth riders (6‚Äì9 years, 10‚Äì13 years and 14‚Äì18 years). The authors suggest that that accelerations at the head decreased with increased age, possibly due to the influence of greater stabilising musculature.

Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, does not support the use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value in the event of a collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist.

Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance. In 1998 the European Cyclists' Federation (ECF) adopted a position paper rejecting compulsory helmet laws as being likely to have greater negative rather than positive health effects. The UK's largest cyclists' organisation, Cycling UK, believes that the \\"overall health effects of compulsory helmets are negative.\\" The Dutch Fietsersbond (Cyclists' Union) summarised existing evidence and concluded that a compulsory helmet law (for utility cyclists) would have a negative impact on population health: \\"Helmet laws save a few brains, but destroy a lot of hearts\\".

A 2016 Irish postage stamp originally depicting a cyclist with helmet and hi-vis vest was altered to remove those after Cycling Ireland complained that it would discourage people from taking up cycling. Although a causal link is not proven, it is observed that the countries with the best cycle safety records (Denmark and the Netherlands) have among the lowest levels of helmet use.. Their bicycle safety record is generally attributed to public awareness and understanding of cyclists, safety in numbers, education, and cycling infrastructure. A study of cycling in major streets of Boston, Paris and Amsterdam illustrates the variation in cycling culture: Boston had far higher rates of helmet-wearing (32% of cyclists, versus 2.4% in Paris and 0.1% in Amsterdam), Amsterdam had far more cyclists (242 passing bicycles per hour, versus 74 in Paris and 55 in Boston). Cycle helmet wearing rates in the Netherlands and Denmark are very low. An Australian journalist writes: \\"Rarities in Amsterdam seem to be stretch-fabric-clad cyclists and fat cyclists. Helmets are non-existent, and when people asked me where I was from, they would grimace and mutter: \\"Ah, yes, helmet laws.\\" These had gained international notoriety on a par with our deadly sea animals.

Pucher and Buehler state: \\"The Dutch cycling experts and planners interviewed for this paper adamantly opposed the use of helmets, claiming that helmets discourage cycling by making it less convenient, less comfortable, and less fashionable.

The school is regarded for academics, arts, and athletics. History Founded in 1972, Brentwood School took over the property formerly owned by Brentwood Military Academy, which had existed at this location since 1930. The Academy, founded by Mary McDonnell in 1902, moved sites multiple times, and was always under the direction of Miss McDonnell and other family members. In spring 1972, it was announced that the military academy would not reopen in the fall, and the property was sold by John McDonnell to Terry Leavey Lemons and Walter Ziglar, who soon converted the school to non-profit status. Brentwood School opened in fall 1972 as a college preparatory day school serving Grades 6-10. The first Headmaster of Brentwood School was Richman Grant. Grade 11 was added in 1973, and the school graduated its first Senior class in June 1975. After that, the school remained Grades 7-12 until 1995 when, under the guidance of Headmaster Hunter M. Temple, Brentwood School purchased the Marymount Junior School campus and opened the Lower Division. With the opening of the Lower Division in fall 1995, the school became Grades K-6 on the West Campus and Grades 7-12 on the East Campus. In 2001 the 22 acre (89,000 m¬≤) Brentwood School Athletics Complex opened on the East Campus. On December 2, 2011, four new modular classrooms were installed by Gen7 at Brentwood School's East Campus. The classrooms, LEED Gold certified, will provide 100% of their own energy, making them the first zero net energy classrooms in Los Angeles County.http://www.gen7schools.com/pdf/PressRelease_Gen7Schools_Brentwood.pdfhttp://brentwood.patch.com/articles/brentwood- school-goes-greener-with-eco-friendly-classrooms Walter Ziglar and Terry Leavey Lemons are credited as founders of the school. For the first 5 years, Mr. Ziglar served as the President. He was also the Chair of the first Board of Executive Directors, which included Bill Badham of Curtis School and Vern Simpson of Montclair Prep. Each year, the Terry Leavey Lemons award is given ‚Äúto the senior who has enriched the Brentwood School community through his/her qualities of friendship, sincerity, courtesy, and understanding.‚Äù Overview The Brentwood School East Campus Tower. Combined enrollment on both campuses is 995 students ‚Äì 695 on the East Campus and 300 on the West Campus. For the 2017-2018 school year, tuition in the Lower School was listed a $34,460 per year, while tuition in the Middle and Upper Schools were listed at $40,760 per year. The school awards approximately $3,500,000 in need-based financial aid each year. Brentwood is a highly selective school, with major admissions entry points in kindergarten, 7th, and 9th grades, and only limited openings at other grade levels. Admissions decisions are made by a committee composed of faculty and administrators. Brentwood offers a liberal arts curriculum, including over 100 courses each year, including advanced placement courses in 17 subject areas. The School year runs from August 29 to June 9. =Athletics= During any given school year, Brentwood School fields 67 different athletic teams in grades 7-12. Brentwood School Upper Division fields 36 teams in 23 different sports. Students fill about 500 roster spots and work with more than 80 coaches. Approximately 80% of Brentwood‚Äôs students will participate in at least one interscholastic sport. The school primarily employs its own teachers as coaches, and requires that students maintain a certain degree of academic standing in order to participate in sports. Brentwood School has a history of hosting the annual Special Olympics Games put on in conjunction with the Special Olympics Southern California Westside Chapter. In 2003, Brentwood-area resident (and former Governor of California) Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Guest of Honor and presided over the Special Olympics Games' Opening Ceremony. Since 1992, the School has also provided venue for the Peter Vidmar Men's Gymnastic's Invitational, hosted by former U.S Gold-Medal winning Olympian and Brentwood School alumnus, Peter Vidmar. Relation to Olympics Brentwood School track and cross-country coaches Joanna Hayes and Malachi Davis participated in 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. Joanna Hayes was a Gold-Medalist in the Women's 100 metres hurdles competition for the United States. Davis was a participant in the Men's 4x400 metres relay for Great Britain. Jason Rogers, a Brentwood School alumnus as well as an Ohio State graduate, was a participant in the 2004 Olympic Games, as a Sabre Fencer for the United States National team. He was part of the 2008 team in the Beijing Olympics and won a Silver Medal in the Team tournament for Sabre. Peter Vidmar, who led the United States to a Gold-medal in Men's Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, is also a Brentwood School alumnus, and was a member of the Board of Trustees for several years.

The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government) is a work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke. The First Treatise attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of Robert Filmer's Patriarcha, while the Second Treatise outlines Locke's ideas for a more civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory. This publication contrasts former political works by Locke himself. In Two Tracts on Government, written in 1660, Locke defends a very conservative position; however, Locke never published it. In 1669, Locke co-authored the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which endorses aristocracy, slavery and serfdom.Armitage, David Armitage, D. (2004). John Locke, Carolina, and the two treatises of government. Political Theory, 32(5), 602‚Äì27. Some dispute the extent to which the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina portray Locke's own philosophy, vs. that of the Lord proprietors of the colony; the document was a legal document written for and signed and sealed by the eight Lord proprietors to whom Charles II had granted the colony. In this context, Locke was only a paid secretary, writing it much as a lawyer writes a will. Historical context King James II of England (VII of Scotland) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic William III of Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange), who as a result ascended the English throne as William III of England. He ruled jointly with Mary II, as Protestants. Mary was the daughter of James II, and had a strong claim to the English Throne. This is known as the Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the \\"Preface\\" to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III's ascension to the throne, though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679‚Äì1680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683).Laslett, \\"Introduction,\\" 59‚Äì61. According to Laslett, Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. Anthony Ashley- Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke's mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Richard Ashcraft, following in Laslett's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution, objected that Shaftesbury's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis. He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot.Ashcraft, Revolutionary Politics. Locke, Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile; some, such as Sidney, were even executed for treason. Locke knew his work was dangerous‚Äîhe never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime. Publication history The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century (1773) Two Treatises was first published, anonymously, in December 1689 (following printing conventions of the time, its title page was marked 1690). Locke was unhappy with this edition, complaining to the publisher about its many errors. For the rest of his life, he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning. Peter Laslett, one of the foremost Locke scholars, has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher \\"standard of perfection\\" than the technology of the time would permit.Laslett, Peter. \\"Introduction.\\" Two Treatises of Government. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 9. Be that as it may, the first edition was indeed replete with errors. The second edition was even worse, and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor. The third edition was much improved, but Locke was still not satisfied.See via Google Books He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends, as he died before it could be brought out.Laslett, \\"Introduction,\\" 8‚Äì9. The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve, but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft, occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises, has been irretrievably lost.Locke, John. Two Treatises of Government. Ed. Peter Laslett. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (1988), 137. Peter Laslett maintains that, while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689, he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section; he argues, for example, that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid- sentence.Laslett, \\"English Revolution,\\" 42. In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel, a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands. This translation left out Locke's \\"Preface,\\" all of the First Treatise, and the first chapter of the Second Treatise (which summarised Locke's conclusions in the First Treatise). It was in this form that Locke's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu, Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it.Laslett, \\"Introduction,\\" 12‚Äì13. The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston; it, too, left out all of these sections. There were no other American editions until the 20th century.Laslett, \\"Introduction,\\" 14‚Äì15. Main ideas Two Treatises is divided into the First Treatise and the Second Treatise. The original title of the Second Treatise appears to have been simply \\"Book II,\\" corresponding to the title of the First Treatise, \\"Book I.\\" Before publication, however, Locke gave it greater prominence by (hastily) inserting a separate title page: \\"An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government.\\"Laslett, 266. The First Treatise is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer, in particular his Patriarcha, which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism. Locke proceeds through Filmer's arguments, contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless, until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings. The Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society. Locke begins by describing the state of nature, a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes' state of \\"war of every man against every man,\\" and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God. From this, he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people. Therefore, any government that rules without the consent of the people can, in theory, be overthrown. First Treatise Filmer's Patriarcha (1680) The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer's Patriarcha. Locke's argument proceeds along two lines: first, he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis, and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer's thesis can lead only to slavery (and absurdity). Locke chose Filmer as his target, he says, because of his reputation and because he \\"carried this Argument [jure divino] farthest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection\\" (1st Tr., ¬ß 5). Filmer's text presented an argument for a divinely ordained, hereditary, absolute monarchy. According to Filmer, the Biblical Adam in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations. Locke attacks this on several grounds. Accepting that fatherhood grants authority, he argues, it would do so only by the act of begetting, and so cannot be transmitted to one's children because only God can create life. Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute, as Filmer would have it; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children referred to in the Bible. In the Second Treatise Locke returns to a discussion of parental power. (Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern feminists such as Carole Pateman.) Filmer also suggested that Adam's absolute authority came from his ownership over all the world. To this, Locke responds that the world was originally held in common (a theme that will return in the Second Treatise). But, even if it were not, he argues, God's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals, not human beings. Nor could Adam, or his heir, leverage this grant to enslave mankind, for the law of nature forbids reducing one's fellows to a state of desperation, if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely. And even if this charity were not commanded by reason, Locke continues, such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent. Locke intimates in the First Treatise that the doctrine of divine right of kings (jure divino) will eventually be the downfall of all governments. In his final chapter he asks, \\"Who heir?\\" If Filmer is correct, there should be only one rightful king in all the world‚Äîthe heir of Adam. But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam, no government, under Filmer's principles, can require that its members obey its rulers. Filmer must therefore say that men are duty-bound to obey their present rulers. Locke writes: > I think he is the first Politician, who, pretending to settle Government > upon its true Basis, and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes, ever > told the World, That he was properly a King, whose Manner of Government was > by Supreme Power, by what Means soever he obtained it; which in plain > English is to say, that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his, > who can by any Means seize upon it; and if this be, to be properly a King, I > wonder how he came to think of, or where he will find, an Usurper. (1st Tr., > ¬ß 79) Locke ends the First Treatise by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer's hypothesis. According to Locke, no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam. It is Filmer, Locke alleges, who is the innovator in politics, not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man. Second Treatise In the Second Treatise Locke develops a number of notable themes. It begins with a depiction of the state of nature, wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the law of nature requires. It also covers conquest and slavery, property, representative government, and the right of revolution. =State of Nature= Locke defines the state of nature thus: > To properly understand political power and trace its origins, we must > consider the state that all people are in naturally. That is a state of > perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons > as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature. People in this > state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others > to arrange matters on their behalf. The natural state is also one of > equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has > more than another. It is evident that all human beings‚Äîas creatures > belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all > the same natural advantages and faculties‚Äîare equal amongst themselves. They > have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God (the lord and > master of them all) had clearly set one person above another and conferred > on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.Two Treatises on > Government: A Translation into Modern English, ISR/Google Books, 2009, p. > 70. The work of Thomas Hobbes made theories based upon a state of nature popular in 17th-century England, even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions. Locke's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition. There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world, Locke argues. However, the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless. Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature. In contrast to Hobbes, who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility, Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist. Actually, it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government (i.e., one directly chosen by all the people subject to it). Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature, Locke points to its good points. It is free, if full of continual dangers (2nd Tr., ¬ß 123). Finally, the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship/tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life, liberty, and property under the rule of law. Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do. However, everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law. Thus, men are not free to do whatever they please. \\"The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that... no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions\\" (2nd Tr., ¬ß 6). The specifics of this law are unwritten, however, and so each is likely to misapply it in his own case. Lacking any commonly recognised, impartial judge, there is no way to correct these misapplications or to effectively restrain those who violate the law of nature. The law of nature is therefore ill enforced in the state of nature. > IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be > absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and > subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up > this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other > power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature > he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and > constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as > he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity > and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very > unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, > however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without > reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, > who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation > of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, > property. (2nd Tr., ¬ß 123) It is to avoid the state of war that often occurs in the state of nature, and to protect their private property that men enter into civil or political society, i.e., state of society. =Conquest and slavery= Ch. 4 (\\"Of Slavery\\") and Ch. 16 (\\"Of Conquest\\") are sources of some confusion: the former provides a justification for slavery, the latter, the rights of conquerors. Because the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina provided that a master had perfect authority over his slaves, some have taken these chapters to be an apology for the institution of slavery in Colonial America. In the rhetoric of 17th-century England, those who opposed the increasing power of the kings claimed that the country was headed for a condition of slavery. Locke therefore asks, facetiously, under what conditions such slavery might be justified. He notes that slavery cannot come about as a matter of contract (which became the basis of Locke's political system). To be a slave is to be subject to the absolute, arbitrary power of another; as men do not have this power even over themselves, they cannot sell or otherwise grant it to another. One that is deserving of death, i.e., who has violated the law of nature, may be enslaved. This is, however, but the state of war continued (2nd Tr., ¬ß 24), and even one justly a slave therefore has no obligation to obedience. In providing a justification for slavery, he has rendered all forms of slavery as it actually exists invalid. Moreover, as one may not submit to slavery, there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Most scholars take this to be Locke's point regarding slavery: submission to absolute monarchy is a violation of the law of nature, for one does not have the right to enslave oneself. The legitimacy of an English king depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from William the Conqueror: the right of conquest was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations. Locke does not say that all subsequent English monarchs have been illegitimate, but he does make their rightful authority dependent solely upon their having acquired the people's approbation. Locke first argues that, clearly, aggressors in an unjust war can claim no right of conquest: everything they despoil may be retaken as soon as the dispossessed have the strength to do so. Their children retain this right, so an ancient usurpation does not become lawful with time. The rest of the chapter then considers what rights a just conqueror might have. The argument proceeds negatively: Locke proposes one power a conqueror could gain, and then demonstrates how in point of fact that power cannot be claimed. He gains no authority over those that conquered with him, for they did not wage war unjustly: thus, whatever other right William may have had in England, he could not claim kingship over his fellow Normans by right of conquest. The subdued are under the conqueror's despotical authority, but only those who actually took part in the fighting. Those who were governed by the defeated aggressor do not become subject to the authority of the victorious aggressor. They lacked the power to do an unjust thing, and so could not have granted that power to their governors: the aggressor therefore was not acting as their representative, and they cannot be punished for his actions. And while the conqueror may seize the person of the vanquished aggressor in an unjust war, he cannot seize the latter's property: he may not drive the innocent wife and children of a villain into poverty for another's unjust acts. While the property is technically that of the defeated, his innocent dependents have a claim that the just conqueror must honour. He cannot seize more than the vanquished could forfeit, and the latter had no right to ruin his dependents. (He may, however, demand and take reparations for the damages suffered in the war, so long as these leave enough in the possession of the aggressor's dependants for their survival). In so arguing, Locke accomplishes two objectives. First, he neutralises the claims of those who see all authority flowing from William I by the latter's right of conquest. In the absence of any other claims to authority (e.g., Filmer's primogeniture from Adam, divine anointment, etc.), all kings would have to found their authority on the consent of the governed. Second, he removes much of the incentive for conquest in the first place, for even in a just war the spoils are limited to the persons of the defeated and reparations sufficient only to cover the costs of the war, and even then only when the aggressor's territory can easily sustain such costs (i.e., it can never be a profitable endeavour). Needless to say, the bare claim that one's spoils are the just compensation for a just war does not suffice to make it so, in Locke's view. =Property= In the Second Treatise, Locke claims that civil society was created for the protection of property.Second Treatise, Sec. 85 In saying this, he relies on the etymological root of \\"property,\\" Latin proprius, or what is one's own, including oneself (cf. French propre). Thus, by \\"property\\" he means \\"life, liberty, and estate.\\" By saying that political society was established for the better protection of property, he claims that it serves the private (and non-political) interests of its constituent members: it does not promote some good that can be realised only in community with others (e.g., virtue). For this account to work, individuals must possess some property outside of society, i.e., in the state of nature: the state cannot be the sole origin of property, declaring what belongs to whom. If the purpose of government is the protection of property, the latter must exist independently of the former. Filmer had said that, if there even were a state of nature (which he denied), everything would be held in common: there could be no private property, and hence no justice or injustice (injustice being understood as treating someone else's goods, liberty, or life as if it were one's own). Thomas Hobbes had argued the same thing. Locke therefore provides an account of how material property could arise in the absence of government. He begins by asserting that each individual, at a minimum, \\"owns\\" himself, although, properly speaking, God created man and we are God's property;Second Treatise, II, Section 6. this is a corollary of each individual's being free and equal in the state of nature. As a result, each must also own his own labour: to deny him his labour would be to make him a slave. One can therefore take items from the common store of goods by mixing one's labour with them: an apple on the tree is of no use to anyone‚Äîit must be picked to be eaten‚Äîand the picking of that apple makes it one's own. In an alternate argument, Locke claims that we must allow it to become private property lest all mankind have starved, despite the bounty of the world. A man must be allowed to eat, and thus have what he has eaten be his own (such that he could deny others a right to use it). The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.: it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree). This does not yet say why an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature. There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one's property, especially as they labour under the like necessity. Locke assures his readers that the state of nature is a state of plenty: one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything from someone else. Moreover, one can take only so much as one can use before it spoils. There are then two provisos regarding what one can take, the \\"enough and as good\\" condition and \\"spoilage.\\" Gold does not rot. Neither does silver, or any other precious metal or gem. They are, moreover, useless, their aesthetic value not entering into the equation. One can heap up as much of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food. By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples with the understanding that someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat). One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear. In this way, Locke argues that a full economic system could, in principle, exist within the state of nature. Property could therefore predate the existence of government, and thus society can be dedicated to the protection of property. =Representative government= Locke did not demand a republic. Rather, Locke felt that a legitimate contract could easily exist between citizens and a monarchy, an oligarchy or some mixed form (2nd Tr., sec. 132). Locke uses the term Common-wealth to mean \\"not a democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community\\" (sec. 133) and \\"whatever form the Common-wealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions.\\" (sec 137) Locke does, however, make a distinction between an executive (e.g. a monarchy), a \\"Power always in being\\" (sec 144) that must perpetually execute the law, and the legislative that is the \\"supreme power of the Common-wealth\\" (sec 134) and does not have to be always in being. (sec 153) Furthermore, governments are charged by the consent of the individual, \\"i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them.\\" (sec 140) His notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions. =Right of revolution= The concept of the right of revolution was also taken up by John Locke in Two Treatises of Government as part of his social contract theory. Locke declared that under natural law, all people have the right to life, liberty, and estate; under the social contract, the people could instigate a revolution against the government when it acted against the interests of citizens, to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against tyranny. Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in Two Treatises of Government: ‚Äúwhenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People, or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the Legislative shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, endeavor to grasp themselves, or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust they forfeit the Power, the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty\\". (sec. 222)Powell, Jim (1 August 1996): \\"John Locke: Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property\\". In: The Freemann. Foundation for Economic Education, Irvington, New York. Reception and influence =Britain= Although the Two Treatises would become well known in the second half of the 18th century, they were somewhat neglected when published. Between 1689 and 1694, around 200 tracts and treatises were published concerning the legitimacy of the Glorious Revolution. Three of these mention Locke, two of which were written by friends of Locke.Goldie, Mark. \\"Introduction\\". The Reception of Locke's Politics. 6 vols. London: Pickering & Chatto (1999), xxii. When Hobbes published the Leviathan in 1651, by contrast, dozens of texts were immediately written in response to it. As Mark Goldie explains: \\"Leviathan was a monolithic and unavoidable presence for political writers in Restoration England in a way that in the first half of the eighteenth the Two Treatises was not.\\"Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxii. While the Two Treatises did not become popular until the 1760s, ideas from them did start to become important earlier in the century. According to Goldie, \\"the crucial moment was 1701\\" and \\"the occasion was the Kentish petition.\\" The pamphlet war that ensued was one of the first times Locke's ideas were invoked in a public debate, most notably by Daniel Defoe.Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxxi. Locke's ideas did not go unchallenged and the periodical The Rehearsal, for example, launched a \\"sustained and sophisticated assault\\" against the Two Treatises and endorsed the ideology of patriarchalism.Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxiv. Not only did patriarchalism continue to be a legitimate political theory in the 18th century, but as J. G. A. Pocock and others have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, so was civic humanism and classical republicanism. Pocock has argued that Locke's Two Treatises had very little effect on British political theory; he maintains that there was no contractarian revolution. Rather, he sees these other long-standing traditions as far more important for 18th-century British politics.Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxviii. In the middle of the 18th century, Locke's position as a political philosopher suddenly rose in prominence. For example, he was invoked by those arguing on behalf of the American colonies during the Stamp Act debates of 1765‚Äì66.Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxxv. Marginalized groups such as women, Dissenters and those campaigning to abolish the slave trade all invoked Lockean ideals. But at the same time, as Goldie describes it, \\"a wind of doubt about Locke's credentials gathered into a storm. The sense that Locke's philosophy had been misappropriated increasingly turned to a conviction that it was erroneous\\".Goldie, \\"Introduction, xxxviii. By the 1790s Locke was associated with Rousseau and Voltaire and being blamed for the American and French Revolutions as well as for the perceived secularisation of society.Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" xxxviii. By 1815, Locke's portrait was taken down from Christ Church, his alma mater (it was later restored to a position of prominence, and currently hangs in the dining hall of the college). =North America= Locke's influence during the American Revolutionary period is disputed. While it is easy to point to specific instances of Locke's Two Treatises being invoked, the extent of the acceptance of Locke's ideals and the role they played in the American Revolution are far from clear. The Two Treatises are echoed in phrases in the Declaration of Independence and writings by Samuel Adams that attempted to gain support for the rebellion. Of Locke's influence Thomas Jefferson wrote: \\"Bacon, Locke and Newton I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical & Moral sciences\\". Jefferson called Bacon, Newton, and Locke, who had so indelibly shaped his ideas, \\"my trinity of the three greatest men the world had ever produced\\" The colonists frequently cited Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, which synthesised Lockean political philosophy with the common law tradition. Louis Hartz, writing at the beginning of the 20th century, took it for granted that Locke was the political philosopher of the revolution. This view was challenged by Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood, who argued that the revolution was not a struggle over property, taxation, and rights, but rather \\"a Machiavellian effort to preserve the young republic's 'virtue' from the corrupt and corrupting forces of English politics.\\"Goldie, \\"Introduction,\\" liii. Garry Wills, on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, sensibility and the controlled passions. Thomas Pangle and Michael Zuckert have countered, demonstrating numerous elements in the thought of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree.Pangle, Spirit of Modern Republicanism; Zuckert, Launching Liberalism, Natural Rights Republic. They argue that there is no conflict between Lockean thought and classical Republicanism. Controversies regarding interpretation Locke's political philosophy is often compared and contrasted with Thomas Hobbes‚Äô Leviathan. The motivation in both cases is self-preservation with Hobbes arguing the need of an absolute monarch to prevent the war of \\"all against all\\" inherent in anarchy while Locke argues that the protection of life, liberty, and property can be achieved by a parliamentary process that protects, not violates, one's rights. Leo Strauss and C. B. Macpherson stress the continuity of thought. In their view Locke and Hobbes describe an atomistic man largely driven by a hedonistic materialistic acquisitiveness. Strauss' Locke is little more than Hobbes in \\"sheep‚Äôs clothing\\". C. B. Macpherson argued in his Political Theory of Possessive Individualism that Locke sets the stage for unlimited acquisition and appropriation of property by the powerful creating gross inequality. Government is the protector of interests of capitalists while the \\"labouring class [are] not considered to have an interest\\". Unlike Macpherson, James Tully finds no evidence that Locke specifically advocates capitalism. In his A Discourse on Property, Tully describes Locke's view of man as a social dependent, with Christian sensibilities, and a God-given duty to care for others. Property, in Tully's explanation of Locke, belong to the community as the public commons but becomes \\"private\\" so long as the property owner, or more correctly the \\"custodian\\", serves the community. Zuckert believes Tully is reading into Locke rights and duties that just aren‚Äôt there. Huyler finds that Locke explicitly condemned government privileges for rich, contrary to Macpherson's pro-capitalism critique, but also rejected subsidies to aid the poor, in contrast to Tully's social justice apologetics. The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by Quentin Skinner, J. G. A. Pocock, Richard Ashcraft, and Peter Laslett, uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the political context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times. Ashcraft's Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy. Neal Wood puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie. Jerome Huyler and Michael P. Zuckert approach Locke in the broader context of his oeuvre and historical influence. Locke is situated within changing religious, philosophical, scientific, and political dimensions of 17th century England. Objecting to the use of the contemporary concept of economic man to describe Locke's view of human nature, Huyler emphases the \\"virtue of industriousness\\" of Locke's Protestant England. Productive work is man's earthly function or calling, ordained by God and required by self-preservation. The government's protection of property rights insures that the results of industry, i.e. \\"fruits of one‚Äôs labor\\", are secure. Locke's prohibition of ill-gotten gains, whether for well-connected gentry or the profligate, is not a lack of Locke's foresight to the problems in the latter stages of liberalism but an application of equal protection of the law to every individual. Richard Pipes argues that Locke holds a labor theory of value that leads to the socialist critique that those not engaging in physical labor exploit wage earners. Huyler, relying on Locke's Essays on the Law of Nature shows that reason is the most fundamental virtue, underwrites all productive virtue, and leads to human flourishing or happiness in an Aristotelean sense.

He was popularly depicted as a local leader representing the gentries of the Nanzhong region, but some historians doubt his historical existence. Meng Huo's popular image comes from the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. The novel portrays Meng Huo as a southern barbarian tribal leader. He also marries the fictional Lady Zhurong, who claims descent from the fire deity Zhurong. Historicity The absurdity of Meng Huo being captured and released seven times led many to doubt the story, and even of Meng Huo's existence. The Republican-era historian Zhang Hualan (ÂºµËèØÁàõ) wrote in his article \\"Discussion on Meng Huo\\" (Â≠üÁç≤ËæØ) that Meng was a fictional character invented by later historians, noting that the name \\"Huo\\" (Áç≤), which means \\"captured\\" in Chinese, is too coincidental considering Meng's fate on being captured ‚Äì a view shared by many academics. Meng Huo and the record of his captures first appeared in the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Han and Jin Dynasties, written by Xi Zuochi in the Eastern Jin dynasty, and were also detailed in the near- contemporary Chronicles of Huayang. The Liu Song dynasty historian Pei Songzhi, when compiling his annotated version of the Records of the Three Kingdoms, found Xi's work unreliable at times. Pei did not specifically comment on Meng Huo's historicity, but pointed out elsewhere that Xi wrote history not found in earlier records,(Â¶ÇÊ≠§Ë®Ä‰πãÈ°ûÔºåÁöÜÂâçÂè≤ÊâÄ‰∏çËºâÔºåËÄåÁå∂Âá∫ÁøíÊ∞è„ÄÇ‰∏îÂà∂Ë®ÄÊ≥ïÈ´î‰∏ç‰ººÊñºÊòîÔºåÁñëÊÇâÈëøÈΩíÊâÄËá™ÈÄ†ËÄÖ‰πüÔºü) Pei Songzhi's annotation in Sanguozhi zhu vol. 28. Pei accused Xi Zuochi of anachronistically inserting quotations in Wang Ling's biography that are unrelated to Meng Huo's passage. hence the historian Fang Guoyu (ÊñπÂúãÁëú) used Pei's doubts on Xi's unreliability to challenge the story of Meng Huo's seven captures. However, Fang did not go as far as to doubt Meng Huo's existence. Huang Chengzhong (ÈªÉÊâøÂÆó) of the Liangshan Yi Slave Society Museum believes Meng to be a real historical figure, though he is certain that the \\"seven times freed\\" story is fiction. Sichuan University professor Miao Yue (ÁπÜÈâû) contended Zhuge Liang would not be able to release the leader if the latter was indeed captured. Tan Liangxiao (Ë≠öËâØÂòØ), director of the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple in Chengdu, also stated the \\"seven times freed\\" story to be \\"strange and unbelievable\\", but like Fang and Huang, he believes Meng Huo did exist in history. In historical texts Meng Huo riding into battle on his red ox When the Shu Han emperor Liu Bei died in 223 CE, the local people of Nanzhong rebelled against Shu Han, stating that there were three lords claiming to be the legitimate ruler of China and they no longer knew whom they should pledge allegiance to. In retaliation, the Shu Han chancellor Zhuge Liang launched an invasion on the Nanzhong region and successfully quelled the uprising. The Spring and Autumn Annals of the Han and Jin Dynasties (Êº¢ÊôâÊò•Áßã) and the Chronicles of Huayang recorded that Zhuge Liang captured and released the local leader seven times until he finally swore allegiance to Shu Han. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms :Extracts from the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms about Meng Huo: ;Chapter 87 * \\"In the third year of Jianxing, a bulletin came to Yi Province announcing, \\"Meng Huo has led 100,000 Nanman tribesmen across our borders to plunder the villages.\\"\\" * \\"Despite protest from Court Councillor Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang leaves to lead 500,000 soldiers against the southern forces.\\" * \\"The Shu forces were led by Zhuge Liang. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan were his generals, their lieutenants being Wang Ping and Zhang Ni.\\" * \\"Meng Huo speaks to Zhuge Liang, \\"The whole of the riverlands once belonged to another.

There were never any troops. Next, I had Wei Yan lose a series of battles to strengthen their confidence... I ordered Ma Dai to deploy the black wagons in the valley - they had been loaded earlier with fire launchers called 'earth thunder', each containing nine missiles... We cut off the road and burned out the enemy...\\"\\" * \\"Finally, Meng Huo admits defeat: \\"Seven times captured, seven times freed! Such a thing has never happened! Though I stand beyond the range of imperial grace, I am not utterly ignorant of ritual, of what propriety and honour require. No, I am not so shameless!\\" He then stripped off one of his sleeves (a sign of swearing oath) and pledged: \\"By the Chancellor's celestial might, the Southerners will never rebel again.\\"\\" Legacy The Yi considered Meng Huo one of their rulers and called him Mot Hop (Yi language: ÍÇΩÍâº).

The Salon's original focus was the display of the work of recent graduates of the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, which was created by Cardinal Mazarin, chief minister of France, in 1648. Exhibition at the Salon de Paris was essential for any artist to achieve success in France for at least the next 200 years. Exhibition in the Salon marked a sign of royal favor.

In 1725, the Salon was held in the Palace of the Louvre, when it became known as Salon or Salon de Paris. In 1737, the exhibitions, held from 18 August 1737 to 5 September 1737 at the Grand Salon of the Louvre,‚ÄúPublic Access to Art in Paris: A Documentary History from the Middle Ages to 1800,‚Äù by Robert W. Berger, p. 171. became public. They were held, at first, annually, and then biennially, in odd-numbered years. They would start on the feast day of St. Louis (25 August) and run for some weeks. Once made regular and public, the Salon's status was \\"never seriously in doubt\\" (Crow, 1987). In 1748 a jury of awarded artists was introduced. From this time forward, the influence of the Salon was undisputed.  Prominence (1748‚Äì1890)  This portrait by John Singer Sargent of Virginie Am√©lie Avegno Gautreau depicting her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 Salon. The Salon exhibited paintings floor-to-ceiling and on every available inch of space. The jostling of artwork became the subject of many other paintings, including Pietro Antonio Martini's Salon of 1785. Printed catalogues of the Salons are primary documents for art historians. Critical descriptions of the exhibitions published in the gazettes mark the beginning of the modern occupation of art critic. The French revolution opened the exhibition to foreign artists. In the 19th century the idea of a public Salon extended to an annual government-sponsored juried exhibition of new painting and sculpture, held in large commercial halls, to which the ticket-bearing public was invited. The vernissage (varnishing) of opening night was a grand social occasion, and a crush that gave subject matter to newspaper caricaturists like Honor√© Daumier. Charles Baudelaire, Denis Diderot and others wrote reviews of the Salons. The 1848 revolution liberalized the Salon. The amount of refused works was greatly reduced. In 1849 medals were introduced. = Early splinter groups = The increasingly conservative and academic juries were not receptive to the Impressionist painters, whose works were usually rejected, or poorly placed if accepted. The Salon opposed the Impressionists' shift away from traditional painting styles. In 1863 the Salon jury turned away an unusually high number of the submitted paintings.King, Ross (2009). The Judgment of Paris: The Revolutionary Decade that Gave the World Impressionism. New York: Bloomsbury. pp. 59‚Äì60 An uproar resulted, particularly from regular exhibitors who had been rejected. In order to prove that the Salons were democratic, Napoleon III instituted the Salon des Refus√©s, containing a selection of the works that the Salon had rejected that year. It opened on 17 May 1863, marking the birth of the avant-garde. The Impressionists held their own independent exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886. In 1881, the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais to take responsibility for the show.  Secession  In December 1890, the leader of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, propagated the idea that the Salon should be an exhibition of young, not-yet-awarded, artists. Ernest Meissonier, Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin and others rejected this proposal and made a secession. They created the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts and its own exhibition, immediately referred to in the press as the Salon du Champ de Mars Auguste Dalligny, 'Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts ‚Äì l'Exposition du Champ de Mars', Journal des Arts, 16 May 1890 or the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux‚ÄìArts;Paul Bluysen, 'Le Salon du Champ de Mars ‚Äì IV, La R√©publique francaise, 23 June 1890 it was soon also widely known as the Nationale. In 1903, in response to what many artists at the time felt was a bureaucratic and conservative organization, a group of painters and sculptors led by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Auguste Rodin organized the Salon d'Automne.

Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (), also commonly known as the \\"Second Discourse\\", is a 1755 work by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau first exposes in this work his conception of a human state of nature, broadly believed to be a hypothetical thought exercise and of human perfectibility, an early idea of progress. He then explains the way in which, in his view, people may have established civil society, and this leads him to conclude that private property is the original source and basis of all inequality. Context The text was written in 1754 in response to a prize competition of the Academy of Dijon answering the prompt: \\"What is the origin of inequality among people, and is it authorized by natural law?\\" Rousseau did not win with his treatise (as he had for the Discourse on the Arts and Sciences); a canon of Besan√ßon by the name of Fran√ßois Xavier Talbert (l'abb√© Talbert) did. Rousseau published the text in 1755.Peter Gay, The Basic Political Writings of Jean Jacques Rousseau, Hackett Press, 1987, p. 25 Argument Rousseau's text is divided into four main parts: the dedication, the preface, an extended inquiry into the nature of the human being and another inquiry into the evolution of the human species within society. It also includes an appendix that elaborates primarily on eighteenth century anthropological research throughout the text. Rousseau discusses two types of inequality: natural, or physical inequality, and ethical, or moral inequality. Natural inequality involves differences between one human's body and that of another‚Äîit is a product of nature. Rousseau is not concerned with this type of inequality because he claims it is not the root of the inequality found in civil society. Instead, he argues moral inequality is unique to civil society and is evinced in differences in \\"wealth, nobility or rank, power and personal merit.\\" This type of inequality is established by convention. Rousseau appears to take a cynical view of civil society, where man has strayed from his \\"natural state\\" of individual independence and freedom to satisfy his individual needs and desires. His discussion begins with an analysis of a natural man who bears, along with some developed animal species, instincts for self-preservation‚Äîa non-destructive love of self (amour de soi m√™me)‚Äîand a \\"natural repugnance\\" to suffering‚Äîa natural pity or compassion. Natural man acts only for his own sake and avoids conflicts with other animals (and humans). Rousseau's natural man is more or less like any other animal, with \\"self-preservation being his chief and almost sole concern\\" and \\"the only goods he recognizes in the universe\\" being food, a female, and sleep... Rousseau's man is a \\"savage\\" man. He is a loner and self-sufficient. Any battle or skirmish was only to protect himself. The natural man was in prime condition, fast, and strong, capable of caring for himself. He killed only for his own self-preservation. Natural man's anthropological distinction (from the animal kingdom) is based on his capacity for \\"perfectibility\\" and innate sense of his freedom. The former, although translated as \\"perfectibility,\\" has nothing to do with a drive for perfection or excellence, which might confuse it with virtue ethics. Instead, perfectibility describes how humans can learn by observing others. Since human being lacks reason, this is not a discursive reasoning, but more akin to the neurological account of mirror neurons. Human freedom does not mean the capacity to choose, which would require reason, but instead the ability to refrain from instinct. Only with such a capacity can humans acquire new habits and practices. The most important feature of Rousseau's natural man is that he lacks reason, in contrast to most of the Western intellectual tradition. Rousseau claims natural man does not possess reason or language (in which reason's generation is rooted) or society‚Äîand these three things are mutually-conditioning, such that none can come into being without the others. Rousseau's natural man significantly differs from, and is a response to, that of Hobbes; Rousseau says as much at various points throughout his work. He thinks that Hobbes conflates human being in the state of nature with human being in civil society. Unlike Hobbes's natural man, Rousseau's is not motivated by fear of death because he cannot conceive of that end; thus fear of death already suggests a movement out of the state of nature. Also, this natural man, unlike Hobbes's, is not in constant state of fear and anxiety. Rousseau's natural man possesses a few qualities that allow him to distinguish himself from the animals over a long period of time. The process by which natural man becomes civilized is uncertain in the Discourse, but it could have had two or three different causes. The most likely causes are environmental, such that humans came into closer proximity and began cohabitation, which in turn facilitated the development of reason and language. Equally, human \\"perfectibility\\" could explain this change in the nature of the human being. Rousseau is not really interested in explaining the development, but acknowledges its complexity. What is important is that with primitive social existence (preceding civil society), humans gain \\"self- esteem\\" (\\"amour propre\\") and most of the rest of Rousseau's account is based on this. Rousseau's critique of civil society is primarily based on psychological features of civil man, with amour propre pushing individuals to compare themselves with others, to gain a sense of self corresponding to this, and to dissolve natural man's natural pity. The beginning of part two dramatically imagines some lone errant soul planting the stakes that first establish private property: \\"The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it into his head to say this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society\\". But Rousseau then clarifies that this moment was presaged by a series of environmental and rational conditions that made it possible. For Rousseau, even the concept of private property required a series of other concepts in order to be formed. Dedication The work is dedicated to the state of Geneva, Rousseau's birthplace. On the face of the dedication, he praises Geneva as a good, if not perfect, republic. The qualities he picks out for praise include the stability of its laws and institutions, the community spirit of its inhabitants, and its good relations with neighboring states, neither threatening them nor threatened by them, and the well-behaved women of Geneva. However, this is not how Geneva truly was. This is the type of regime Rousseau wished for. The epistle dedicatory is a highly ironic and idealized version of the Geneva Rousseau really wanted. Also, his description is in great contrast with Paris, where he had spent many years previous to writing this discourse, and which he had left bitterly. Thus, his description of Geneva is in part a statement against Paris. Citations External links * Full text of the 1913 G.D.H.

A Letter Concerning Toleration by John Locke was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in Latin, though it was immediately translated into other languages. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer. This \\"letter\\" is addressed to an anonymous \\"Honored Sir\\": this was actually Locke's close friend Philipp van Limborch, who published it without Locke's knowledge.A Letter Concerning Toleration by Locke, John; Tully, James H. Background In the wake of discovery of the Rye House Plot and Charles II's persecution of the Whigs, Locke fled England to Amsterdam, Holland in September 1683.Raymond Klibansky, 'Preface', in Klibansky and J. W. Gough (eds.), Espitola de Tolerantia/A Letter on Toleration (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. vii.Maurice Cranston, John Locke: A Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 227-230. Throughout his life, Locke had taken an interest in the debate about religious toleration. The question was much debated in Holland during Locke's stay and in October 1685 Louis XIV of France Revoked the Edict of Nantes that had guaranteed religious toleration for French Protestants.Klibansky, p. x, pp. xvi-xvii. In Holland, Locke met Philipp van Limborch, a Professor of Divinity, and it was to be a discussion with Limborch that persuaded Locke to temporarily put aside his work on An Essay Concerning Human Understanding and put forth his ideas on toleration. Locke wrote the Letter during the winter of 1685-86.Klibansky, pp. viii-ix, p. x, pp. xvi-xvii. Argument of the Letter One of the founders of Empiricism, Locke develops a philosophy that is contrary to the one expressed by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan, in supporting toleration for various Christian denominations. Hobbes did allow for individuals to maintain their own religious beliefs as long as they outwardly expressed those of the state, however, and it has been argued that Locke's rejection of Catholic Imperialism was the ultimate basis for his rejection of government's interest in spiritual salvation.E. C. Graf, 2007: Cervantes and Modernity: Four Essays on Modernity, Bucknell University Press, pp. 141-55. Unlike Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. Locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. Locke's primary goal is to \\"distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion.\\" He seeks to persuade the reader that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. The two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions. For Locke, the only way a church can gain genuine converts is through persuasion and not through violence. This relates to his central conclusion, namely, that the government should not involve itself in care of souls. In support of this argument he presents three main reasons: (1) individuals, according to Locke, cannot divest control over their souls to secular forces, as God does not appoint the magistrate; (2) force cannot create the change necessary for salvation, because while it can coerce obedience, it cannot change one's beliefs; and (3) even if coercion could persuade someone of a notion, it would not help with ensuring salvation, because there is no reason to believe that magistrates are reliable judges of religious truth. Locke argued that those who believed that \\"faith need not be kept with heretics\\" and that \\"kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms\\" had \\"no right to be tolerated by the magistrate\\". Neither did \\"those who refuse to teach that dissenters from their own religion should be tolerated\\". This was because those who believed such doctrines would, given the opportunity, attack the laws and the liberty and property of the citizens. These people, Locke argued, sought religious toleration \\"only until they have supplies and forces enough to make the attempt\\" on liberty.Klibansky and Gough, pp. 131-33. The doctrines that \\"faith need not be kept with heretics\\" and that \\"kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms\\" were commonly held to be Catholic beliefs by Protestants.John Marshall, John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 690-91.Klibansky and Gough, pp. 160-61.Mark Goldie (ed.), A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2010), p. 50, notes 127 and 128. During his visit to France in 1676, Locke recorded that the belief that \\"faith does not have to be kept with heretics\\" was an important factor in the intolerance shown to the Protestant Huguenots.John Lough (ed.), Locke's Travels in France, 1675-9: As related in his Journals, Correspondence and other papers (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), p. 20.Marshall, p. 36. \\"That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magistrate,\\" Locke argued, \\"which is so constituted that all who enter it ipso facto pass into the allegiance and service of another prince\\".Klibansky and Gough, p. 133. If this were to be tolerated, \\"the magistrate would make room for a foreign jurisdiction in his own territory and...allow for his own people to be enlisted as soldiers against his own government\\".Klibansky and Gough, p. 133. This has been interpreted by historians as a reference to the Catholic Church, with the Pope being the prince to whom Catholics owed allegiance.Cranston, p. 260.Klibansky, p. xxxiv.J. W. Gough, 'Introduction', in Klibansky and Gough, pp. 3-4.J. W. Gough, John Locke's Political Philosophy: Eight Studies (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), p. 197.Scott Sowerby, Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2013), p. 256. However, more recently scholars have challenged the idea that Locke opposed the toleration of Catholics in all circumstances.Marshall, pp. 690-694.Mark Goldie, 'Introduction', in Goldie (ed.), A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings, p. xix.Sowerby, p. 256. Mark Goldie argues that the traditional interpretation of Locke's position on Catholics \\"needs finessing, since he did not, in fact, exclude the theoretical possibility of tolerating Catholics...if Catholics could discard their uncivil beliefs, they could then be tolerated\\".Goldie, p. xix. Goldie asserts that Locke was opposed not to Catholicism as such but antinomianism, the belief that ordinary moral laws are superseded by religious truth.Goldie, p. xix. Scott Sowerby also claims that Locke left open the possibility that Catholics could be tolerated if they adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the Pope.Sowerby, p. 256. John Marshall has argued that a number of passages in the Letter demonstrate that Locke believed that Catholics \\"in their terms of worship and religious speculative beliefs...deserved their worship to be free\\".Marshall, p. 691. Marshall also notes that \\"The combination of Locke‚Äôs comments in the Letter suggest that during [its] composition ... Locke was once again struggling over how to discriminate between the series of associated political principles which for him made Catholics intolerable, and the religious worship and other religious beliefs of Catholics which deserved toleration.\\"Marshall, p. 692. A confirmation of these positions seems to come from a 2019 discovery of a previously unknown manuscript, dated to 1667-8, titled ', in which Locke makes his earliest arguments for religious toleration.The Guardian, 'Unknown text by John Locke reveals roots of foundational democratic ideas', 3 September 2019. Locke argued that atheists should not be tolerated because \\"Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon or sanctity for an atheist\\".Klibansky and Gough, p. 135. There is, however, a passage added in a later edition of the Essay concerning Human Understanding, where Locke perhaps questioned \\"whether 'atheism' was necessarily inimical to political obedience.\\"Marshall, p. 680. Toleration is central to Locke's political philosophy. Consequently, only churches that teach toleration are to be allowed in his society. Locke‚Äôs view on the difficulty of knowing the one true religion may suggest that religion is not personally important to Locke, but it also may point to the deep uncertainties surrounding religious belief in a time of political and intellectual conflict. In contrast, Locke‚Äôs view on atheism suggests that he was far from considering religion as unimportant. As an empiricist, he took practical considerations into account, such as how the peace of civil society will be affected by religious toleration. A close reading of the text also reveals that Locke relies on Biblical analysis at several key points in his argument. Reception There were immediate responses from the High Church Anglican clergy, published by Thomas Long and Jonas Proast. Long believed the letter was written by an atheistically disguised Jesuit plot for the Roman Catholic Church to gain dominance by bringing chaos and ruin to church and state. Proast attacked the Letter and defended the view that the government has the right to use force to cause dissenters to reflect on the merits of Anglicanism, the True Religion. Locke's reply to Proast developed into an extended, controversial exchange.

They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they had no intention of repaying. LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated. In 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts, indicted LaRouche and 12 associates on credit card fraud and obstruction of justice. The subsequent trial, described as an \\"extravaganza\\", was repeatedly delayed and ended in mistrial. Following the mistrial, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted LaRouche and six associates. After a short trial in 1988, LaRouche was convicted of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and tax evasion, and was sentenced to prison for fifteen years. He entered prison in 1989 and was paroled five years later. At the same trial, his associates received lesser sentences for mail fraud and conspiracy. In separate state trials in Virginia and New York, 13 associates received terms ranging from one month to 77 years. The Virginia state trials were described as the highest-profile cases that the state Attorney General's office had ever prosecuted. Fourteen states issued injunctions against LaRouche-related organizations. Three LaRouche-related organizations were forced into bankruptcy after failing to pay contempt of court fines. Defense lawyers filed numerous unsuccessful appeals that challenged the conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of the search warrants and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the United States court of appeals, and three were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined the defense team for two appeals. Following the convictions, the LaRouche movement mounted failed attempts at exoneration.  Background  Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche formed a variety of political organizations, including the U.S. Labor Party and the National Democratic Policy Committee. These organizations served as the platforms for presidential campaigns by LaRouche starting in 1976, and by his followers in scores of local races. According to one candidate, supporters viewed LaRouche as \\"the greatest political leader and economist of the 20th century, and they're proud to be associated with him. They feel he's leading the battle to save Western civilization.\\" The Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987 called the LaRouche movement one of the two most prominent \\"extremist political groups\\" of 1986.Frankel (1988), p. 202. The movement's greatest electoral success came in 1986 when two supporters, Janice Hart and Mark J. Fairchild, won the Democratic Party nominations for Illinois Secretary of State and Lieutenant Governor. Both lost in the general election. Also in 1986, the \\"Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee\\" (PANIC) got an initiative on the California ballot, Proposition 64 (also known as the \\"LaRouche Initiative\\"), which attracted widespread opposition and was defeated that November.  Investigations  = Early 1980s = According to arguments made by LaRouche's attorneys in later appeals, the government investigations were started under the FBI's COINTELPRO in the 1960s. Edward Spannaus, a defendant in the trials, further notes that there was a memorandum written on January 12, 1983, by former FBI chief William Webster to Oliver \\"Buck\\" Revell, head of the Bureau's General Investigative Division. It requested information on the funding of LaRouche and the U.S. Labor Party, including whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. The LaRouche organization asserts that this formulation was specifically tailored to enable FBI \\"active measures\\" against LaRouche under Executive Order 12333, which permits such measures if a political movement receives foreign funding. The memo was eventually obtained by LaRouche's attorneys and submitted as an exhibit in the 1987 trial of LaRouche and co-defendants in Boston. In August 1982, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sent a memo to Webster requesting an investigation of the LaRouche movement due to their \\"increasingly obnoxious\\" harassment of him, which was raised at a meeting that day of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board by senior member David Abshire.Spannaus (1989), p. 306. Revell replied to Kissinger that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation. The FBI conducted an investigation but did not find evidence of a violation of Kissinger's civil rights. The investigation was closed in late 1983. = Mid-1980s = In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government and eleven states began investigations into alleged financial improprieties by LaRouche groups. A federal grand jury reportedly began investigating \\"an extensive nationwide pattern of credit card fraud\\" by LaRouche organizations in November 1984. That same year a New Jersey bank froze the accounts of LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign due to allegedly fraudulent credit-card charges. In January 1985, the grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts, subpoenaed documents from the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), and three other LaRouche organizations: Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. Seven weeks later, on March 29, 1985, a U.S. District Court Judge A. David Mazzone held them to be in contempt and fined them $45,000 per day. The fines for all the organizations eventually totaled over $20 million. The same grand jury subpoenaed Elliot I. Greenspan, an official of Caucus Distributors Inc., to appear but he pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. He was granted immunity and compelled to testify but only did so after being jailed for contempt for two days. A spokesman for LaRouche called the investigation \\"a political terror operation\\". William Weld in 2008. Investigations by a separate federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, along with state agencies in New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Washington were also underway. The FBI, IRS, FEC and personnel of other federal agencies were conducting separate investigations. The Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of the Fusion Energy Foundation in September 1985, and a year later the State of New York sought to dissolve the corporation, alleging that it used \\"persistently fraudulent and illegal\\" means to solicit donations. U.S. Attorney William Weld announced in January 1986, that he would convene a national conference \\"to coordinate a prosecutive and investigative effort\\" against LaRouche. The conference was held the following month in Boston.Spannaus (1989), p. 236. Three states, Alaska, Indiana and Maryland, banned fund raising by Caucus Distributors Inc. in May 1986, due to the sale of unregistered promissory notes. The Illinois Secretary of State began civil proceedings against Caucus Distributors Inc. in June 1986, seeking an injunction to bar deceptive business practices. Minnesota officials banned \\"Independent Democrats for LaRouche\\" from fund raising, an order that was affirmed on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. LaRouche lawyers filed a series of related civil suits against individuals, agencies and businesses. They sued Weld and former Attorney General William French Smith to try to stop the FBI investigation of the credit card case. They sued the New Jersey bank that had frozen their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued Chemical Bank in a similar suit. Edward Spannaus, a treasurer for LaRouche campaigns, filed complaints with the state bar and the U.S. Justice Department against one of the Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the case.  Raid and indictments  The Wheat Building in Leesburg, Virginia: one of the buildings searched during the 1986 raid. Beginning October 6, 1986, the Leesburg, Virginia, headquarters of the LaRouche organization was searched in a coordinated, two-day raid by hundreds of officers of the FBI, IRS, other federal agencies, and Virginia state authorities, supported by armored cars and a helicopter. The agents also surrounded LaRouche's heavily guarded estate for the duration of the search but did not enter it.\\"Brief for the United States in Opposition\\", National Democratic Policy Committee v. United States, 493 U.S. 918 (1989). While surrounded, LaRouche sent a telegram to President Ronald Reagan saying that an attempt to arrest him \\"would be an attempt to kill me. I will not submit passively to such an arrest, but ... I will defend myself\\". He later assured that he would comply peaceably with any warrant. LaRouche offices in Quincy, Massachusetts, were searched as well. US Attorney Henry E. Hudson held a press conference to say that the searches had recovered subpoenaed materials, including notebooks and index cards. Warren J. Hamerman, Chair of the NDPC, said the searches \\"conducted by Donald Regan's associate William Weld's forces against presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche's headquarters coincides with Don Regan's desperate attempts to maintain the cover-up on AIDS\\". LaRouche later said that the Soviet Premier had ordered the raid as part of an assassination attempt. \\"The man with the mark of the beast on his head, Mikhail Gorbachov, has demanded my elimination\\", said LaRouche. In his 1987 autobiography, he wrote that the raid was ordered by Raisa Gorbachev, whom he described as outranking her husband in the nomenklatura due to her leadership of the Soviet Cultural Fund.LaRouche (1987), p. 309. On the same day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count indictment that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1 million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The National Caucus of Labor Committees was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, \\"we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal\\". Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Meanwhile, the state cases were progressing. On February 16, 1987, the Commonwealth of Virginia indicted 16 LaRouche associates on securities fraud and other felonies. On March 3, 1987, the State of New York indicted 15 LaRouche associates on charges of grand larceny and securities fraud.  Involuntary bankruptcy  Former Fusion Energy Foundation headquarters, photographed in 2008 In early April 1987, the government charged in court that LaRouche organizations may have been trying to sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4 million in contempt of court fines. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a \\"pattern of transferring or commingling substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes\\". The trustees later reported they were only able to locate about $86,000 in assets. The bankruptcy halted the publication of a weekly newspaper, New Solidarity, and a bi-monthly science magazine, Fusion. At least one publication, Fusion, was reborn with a new name but the same editor and material. The attorneys who represented the LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and that members of the Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.\\"Proposed Findings of Fact in cases 87-0795-A,87-0796-A,87-0797-A\\", published in Spannaus (1989). U.S. Supreme Court. During the bankruptcy trial in September 1989, an FBI agent destroyed evidence (credit card receipts, cancelled checks, and FEC filings) immediately after he had promised the court he would preserve them. On October 25, 1989, Judge Martin V.B. Bostetter dismissed the government's involuntary bankruptcy petition, finding that two of the entities involved were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore not subject to involuntary bankruptcy actions. According to the LaRouche movement, Bostetter said the government's actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome. He found that the government's actions and representations in obtaining the bankruptcy had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization, leading to a \\"constructive fraud on the court\\". In 1993, an appeals court decision said that Bostetter had specifically rejected that view, and said that the defendants had \\"greatly distorted the character of much of the evidence\\". Appeals that went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court found that the matter of the involuntary bankruptcy would not change the outcome of LaRouche's conviction. The LaRouche organization asserts that it has proof, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which shows that the purpose of the bankruptcy was simply to shut down the affected entities rather than to collect fines.The FOIA search turned up a memo by James Reynolds of General Litigation and Legal Advice Section of the Department of Justice, in which he writes, \\"Benefit is that a trustee is immediately appointed. They are ordered to shut down the business immediately.\\" The U.S. Attorney said, \\"Essentially the court holds that we did not abuse the bankruptcy filing, just that we should have filed differently.\\" He also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected.  Boston trials  = Trial of Frankhouser = United States District Judge Robert Keeton presided in Boston. Jury selection was completed in September 1987. Before the trial could begin, Keeton granted a motion to sever the case of Roy Frankhouser, whose case was tried first in front of a different jury. Frankhouser had been an informant for the ATF and other law enforcement agencies, in addition to being a neo- Nazi and a former Pennsylvania Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. Frankhouser became a security consultant for LaRouche after convincing him that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies. In U.S. v. Frankhauser,Court records spell the name \\"Frankhauser\\" while most other sources spell it \\"Frankhouser\\". Frankhouser testified that he and LaRouche security employee Forrest Lee Fick had invented a connection to the CIA in order to justify his $700 a week salary. They persuaded a friend to play a former top CIA official (\\"Mr. Ed\\") in meetings with LaRouche associates who, according to LaRouche group lawyers, came to believe that they had a direct line of communication to the White House and Kremlin through Mr. Ed and‚Äîas \\"a national resource in security matters\\"‚Äîwere immune from prosecution. When LaRouche found out about the grand jury investigation, he reportedly told Frankhouser to get the CIA to quash it. Frankhouser told LaRouche that the CIA wanted him to destroy evidence and hide witnesses. Frankhouser claimed that on another occasion LaRouche sent him to Boston to check on the grand jury investigation. Instead of going to Boston he went to a Star Trek convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and called to warn LaRouche that the FBI had wiretapped his phones. LaRouche was called as a defense witness in Frankhouser's trial but he refused to testify, exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Frankhouser was found guilty of obstruction of the federal investigation into credit-card fraud. He was sentenced to three years and a $50,000 fine. After his conviction, he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against LaRouche in the Boston trial. Frankhouser appealed his conviction on April 3, 1989, arguing that his case should not have been severed from the main case, that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare, and that he was not provided with allegedly exculpatory evidence. The appeal was rejected in July. = Trial of LaRouche, et al. = The trial of LaRouche and his six co-defendants, U.S. v. LaRouche Campaign, began on December 17, 1987, with the jury that had been picked in September, before the Frankhouser trial. The 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions. The prosecution argued that pressure to fill fund raising quotas had led to 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case that the prosecution was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the prosecution was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses. During the trial, a search of the personal files of Oliver North was ordered by Judge Keeton to look for evidence that North had led an effort to harass and infiltrate the LaRouche movement, causing an additional delay in the trial. The search produced a May 1986 telex from Iran-Contra defendant General Richard Secord to North, discussing the gathering of information against LaRouche. After this memo surfaced, Judge Keeton ordered a search of Vice President George Bush's office for documents relating to LaRouche. Another delay came when the trial was halted to give time for the FBI to search their files for exculpatory documents. The trial was delayed again when federal agents seized LaRouche properties as part of the involuntary bankruptcy procedure in 1988. Originally expected to last from three to six months, the trial stretched out much longer. One local reporter called the Boston trial a \\"long, complex and costly multidefendant extravaganza\\". After several jurors asked to be excused due to the length of the trial, the defense refused to proceed with fewer than 12 jurors, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial on May 4, 1988. According to one of the jurors, all defendants, including LaRouche, would have been found not guilty. He told a reporter \\"it seemed some of the government's people caused the problem\\", and that people working on behalf of the government \\"may have been involved in some of this fraud to discredit the campaign.\\" At the time of the mistrial, a spokesperson said that the Constitutional Defense Fund, a LaRouche organization, had spent over $2 million on legal and administrative expenses. Defense attorneys said they would appeal if the government sought a new trial. A retrial in Boston was scheduled for January 3, 1989, but the charges were dismissed after the Alexandria convictions; this was over the objections of the LaRouche lawyers who said they were seeking vindication. The Assistant U.S. Attorney who handled both the Boston and Alexandria cases said after the dismissal, \\"It was the Boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence which allowed the indictment and convictions in Alexandria, and I think justice was served by the substantial sentences received.\\" Throughout the trial, three of the indicted individuals were fugitives: Michael Gelber, Charles Park, and Richard Sanders. According to Roy Frankhouser, they had been sent to Europe. They surrendered to the court in 1990 and were sentenced by Judge Keeton to one year each for obstructing the investigation. = Related appeals = On July 3, 1986, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the contempt of court fines from the Boston grand jury. That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which let it stand. The First Circuit Court heard an appeal on September 11, 1987, alleging abuse of the grand jury and denied it six days later. On November 3, 1987, six organizations affiliated with LaRouche argued that their documents were seized improperly during the October 1986 search. The court denied the appeal the following January. Jeffrey Steinberg said on December 11, 1987, that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included in the grand jury subpoena or the search. He lost that appeal the following January. The court heard an appeal from NBC on January 5, 1988, over a lower court subpoena of NBC outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness, Forrest Lee Fick. The lower court ruled the subpoenaed outtakes were to be placed under seal and subject to in camera review only, giving the court discretion whether to release any portion to the defendants. LaRouche had asserted the outtakes could be used to impeach Fick's testimony. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in March. Following the mistrial in Boston, the prosecution moved to schedule a new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.  Alexandria trial  Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. presided over U.S. v. LaRouche in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, where LaRouche resided. That court was known as a \\"rocket docket\\" for its speed in disposing of cases. LaRouche and six associates were indicted on October 14, 1988, on charges of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Trial was scheduled for six weeks after the indictment. Defense lawyers made an unusual appeal asking for a delay, which was rejected. Judge Bryan granted a prosecution motion in limine, ruling that the defense would not be permitted to discuss, or even allude to, the fact that the indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy. It also excluded claims of vindictive prosecution and political harassment by the government.Government's Motion in Limine, United States v. LaRouche, Criminal No. 88-00243-A (E.D. Va. 1988). Reprinted in Spannaus (1989). Bryan wrote, \\"the court will not allow a delving into any details of alleged infiltration ... for the reason that ... this would divert the jury from the issues raised in the indictment.\\" Federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, presented evidence that LaRouche and his staff solicited US$34 million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed \\"reckless disregard for the truth\\". In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, \\"Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, and to a lesser extent, what they did with that money when they got it ... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true.\\"Transcript of Record, United States v. LaRouche, Criminal No. 88-00243-A (E.D. Va. 1988). Reprinted in Spannaus (1989). The most important evidence was the testimony of lenders, many of them elderly retirees, who had loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the \\"war on drugs\\" but only received $10,000 in repayment. One of the prosecutors, John Markham, said those loans represented \\"just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing\\". Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4 million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5 million had been repaid out of $30 million in non-campaign loans. LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000 but, according to testimony at trial, the amount owed by 1987 topped $25 million. Several witnesses were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser testified that he was told, \\"No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says he has got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money.\\" None of the defendants testified. Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them \\"an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force,\\" and said that the federal government was trying to kill him. \\"The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It's to kill me,\\" LaRouche said. \\"In prison it's fairly easy to kill me ... If this sentence goes through, I'm dead.\\" = Income tax = One of the charges against LaRouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax, not having filed a return in ten years. LaRouche claimed to have had no income. LaRouche lived on a 172-acre (700,000 m2) estate near Leesburg, Virginia, with a pond and horse ring. It was purchased for his use by Oklahoma oilman David Nick Anderson for $1.3 million, with LaRouche organizations paying rent to cover the $9,605 mortgage. LaRouche had named the property, otherwise known as Ellwood, \\"Ibykus Farm\\" after a work by Friedrich Schiller. His wife, Helga LaRouche, is reported to have overseen hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovations to the property. In all, the LaRouche group spent over US$4 million on Virginia real estate during this period, according to trial testimony. The LaRouche defense argued that Ibykus Farm was a \\"safehouse\\" needed for the security of LaRouche and others.Spannaus (1989), p. 47. The government argued that security expenditures were \\"misplaced priorities.\\"Spannaus (1989), p. 51. In 1985, a judge in a separate case had described LaRouche's testimony about being almost penniless as \\"completely lacking in credibility\\". In 1986, in the same case, LaRouche said that he did not know who had paid the rent on the estate, or for his food, lodging, clothing, transportation, bodyguards, or lawyers since 1973. The judge fined him for failing to answer. = Conviction and imprisonment = On December 16, 1988, LaRouche was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than $30 million in defaulted loans; 11 counts of actual mail fraud involving $294,000 in defaulted loans; and one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The judge said that the claim of a vendetta was \\"arrant nonsense\\", and that, \\"the idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosecution to silence them just defies human experience.\\" Jury foreman Buster Horton told The Washington Post that it was the failure of LaRouche aides to repay loans which swayed the jury in the Virginia case. He said that the jury \\"all agreed [LaRouche] was not on trial for his political beliefs. We did not convict him for that. He was convicted for those 13 counts he was on trial for.\\" As part of the trial in Alexandria, six of LaRouche's associates were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts. LaRouche's legal adviser and treasurer, Edward Spannaus, along with fund raising operatives Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg, Michael Billington, and Joyce Rubinstein, were convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Wertz and Spannaus were sentenced to five years imprisonment each, with Spannaus serving a total of two and a half years until his release from custody. Both were fined $1,000. The others received three-year terms and various fines. While in prison LaRouche released claims that he was tortured as part of an assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia's 10th Congressional District in 1990 and for U.S. President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota was televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, I Was Wrong, to his experience with LaRouche.Bakker & Abraham (1996) Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and on more than one occasion LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, \\"to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak.\\"Bakker (1996), p. 250 LaRouche also befriended Richard Miller, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that \\"... in effect, George H. W. Bush put me in the jug, and Bill Clinton got me out\\". = Appeal of convictions = Ramsey Clark in 2007. The defendants in the Alexandria trial appealed their convictions to Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 6, 1989. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined the defense team, which contended that there were six faults in the trial. In the words of the Circuit Court's opinion, the alleged errors were: # The district court erred in denying their motion for a continuance of the trial date. # The district court erroneously denied their discovery request for exculpatory material. # The district court made numerous evidentiary rulings, in limine and at trial, that unconstitutionally restricted their ability to defend against the charges. # The trial judge failed to conduct a voir dire sufficient to impanel an unbiased jury and improperly failed to excuse several jurors for cause. # The mail fraud counts were improperly joined with the tax conspiracy count. # The sentence imposed on LaRouche was excessive. # The district court erroneously instructed the jury on the tax count. # The district court erred in allowing the introduction of illegally seized evidence. Seventeen amicus curiae (\\"friend of the court\\") briefs were filed in the appeal. One, by Albert Bleckmann, director of the Institute for Public Law and Political Sciences at the University of M√ºnster, objected to the lack of voir dire, the exclusion of evidence under the motion in limine, the fact that the government did not approach LaRouche about his tax situation before indicting him for tax violations, and concerns about double jeopardy because of the nearly identical charges in the Boston and Alexandria trials.United States v. LaRouche, Brief of Prof. Dr. Albert Bleckmann, Amicus Curiae, No. 89-5518, published in Spannaus (1989). A brief by a French lawyer said that, \\"a crime of thought seems to have been camouflaged as a common law crime.\\"United States v. LaRouche, Brief of Maitre Jacques Stul, Amicus Curiae, No. 89-5518, published in Spannaus (1989). Stul is a French attorney who specializes in political causes. Notable submitters of amicus briefs included: James Robert Mann, Charles E. Rice, Jay Alan Sekulow and George P. Monaghan. The three-judge panel reviewed and rejected each item, affirming the defendants' convictions and sentences unanimously on January 22, 1990. Five months later the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.  State trials  Law offices of the LaRouche movement during the state trials (photographed in 2008). The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche organizations on charges of securities fraud relating to $30 million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, a decision by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations‚ÄîFusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.‚Äîto stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling. Six of LaRouche's associates were convicted and two pleaded guilty. Rochelle Ascher, a fundraiser, was sentenced in Leesburg to 86 years (reduced to 10 years) for six charges of fraudulently selling securities and one count each of selling an unregistered security with intent to defraud, selling a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud, and conspiracy to commit security fraud. In two Roanoke trials, four other associates were found guilty of securities fraud charges: Donald Phau, Lawrence Hecht, Paul Gallagher and Anita Gallagher. Richard Welsh and Martha M. Quinde pleaded guilty and received 12 month and one month terms, respectively. Michael Billington was charged in a Roanoke court with having knowingly solicited 131 loans that would never be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24 million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington's competence and told the court that he believed LaRouche was making the decisions in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination that was to be conducted by an expert on cults. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. Billington was convicted on nine counts of \\"conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker\\". Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved \\"willful and massive fraud that has caused a lot of people to suffer\\". A trial in New York state courts on charges of scheming to defraud resulted in the conviction of Robert Primack, Marielle Kronberg and Lynne Speed.  Reactions from LaRouche and supporters  \\"My imprisonment is the American Dreyfus case\\", LaRouche said in a January 1989 interview from prison. The prosecutor denied claims of a conspiracy, describing the theory as an \\"Orwellian fantasy ... that we are hiding some supersecret spy plot which, if exposed, would exonerate them\\". LaRouche supporters insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs. LaRouche also alleged systematic government misconduct: > The record shows, that for nearly thirty years, elements of the U.S. > Department of Justice have been engaged in world-wide political targeting of > me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in > conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State > Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. > officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of > the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment > of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated > targeting. LaRouche and his lawyers asserted that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) sought to destroy his organization, and that the prosecution was the result of a conspiracy between the ADL, the government and the media. This claim stemmed from a series of meetings that LaRouche publications refer to as the John Train \\"Salon\\". In testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated Schiller Institute claimed that \\"[t]he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [sic] was the consequence of an unprecedented involuntary bankruptcy proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an ex parte, in camera proceeding\\". Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte, a professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Mainz in Germany, compared the LaRouche trial to the Dreyfus affair, which he called \\"a classical example of a political trial\\". He wrote, \\"Just as LaRouche was, the French Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was deprived by the structure of the trial procedures, of any opportunity to prove his innocence, and facts critical for his defense were excluded from the trial.\\"This paragraph is excerpted from a longer essay by von der Heydte, which appeared as a full page ad, sponsored by the LaRouche-affiliated Commission to investigate Human Rights Violations, in The Washington Times on March 1, 1990, in Loudoun Times-Mirror of Loudon County, Virginia, on March 2, and as a half-page ad in The Washington Post on March 3. Re-printed in Spannaus (1989). On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d'Almeida Ribeiro, the Special Rapporteur for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, filed a request to the U.S. Government based on a complaint that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under the laws of the United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.  Exoneration attempts  Ramsey Clark wrote a letter in 1995 to then-Attorney General Janet Reno in which he said that the case involved \\"a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge\\". He asserted that, \\"The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts.\\" He called the convictions \\"a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice\\". The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the Mann-Chestnut hearings. On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the New Federalist, a LaRouche publication, as well as The Washington Post and Roll Call. Entitled \\"Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration\\", its signatories included Arturo Frondizi, former President of Argentina; figures from the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement such as Amelia Boynton Robinson (a leader of the Larouche- affiliated Schiller Institute), James Bevel (a Larouche movement participant) and Rosa Parks; former Minnesota Senator and Democratic Presidential Candidate Eugene McCarthy; Mervyn M. Dymally, who chaired the Congressional Black Caucus; and artists such as classical vocalist William Warfield and violinist Norbert Brainin, former 1st Violin of the Amadeus Quartet. LaRouche's Schiller Institute paid for the advertisement. Amelia Boynton Robinson was at that time a board member of the Institute. James Bevel and William Warfield had been active in various LaRouche organizations.  Later developments  In 2009, Molly Kronberg, widow of Kenneth Kronberg, sued LaRouche in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging that he and his associates libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction.

Since the late 19th century, many of them have come to countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. The rest were forcibly relocated, so that very few of their descendants now live at the location of the original colonies. Russian Mennonites are traditionally multilingual with Plautdietsch (Mennonite Low German) as their first language and lingua franca. In 2014 there are several hundred thousand Russian Mennonites: about 200,000 in Germany, 100,000 in Mexico, 70,000 in Bolivia, 40,000 in Paraguay, 10,000 in Belize and tens of thousands in Canada and the US and a few thousand in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. The term \\"Russian Mennonite\\" refers to the country where they resided before their immigration to the Americas and not to their ethnic heritage. The term \\"Low-German Mennonites\\" is also used in order to avoid this conflation.  Origins in the Vistula Delta  New River, Belize In the early-to-mid 16th century, Mennonites began to flee to the Vistula delta region in order to avoid persecution in the Low Countries, especially Friesland and Flanders, seeking religious freedom and exemption from military service. They gradually replaced their Dutch and Frisian languages with the Low German language spoken in the area, blending into it elements of their native tongues to create a distinct dialect known as Plautdietsch. Today Plautdietsch is the distinct Mennonite language which developed over a period of 300 years in the Vistula delta region and south Russia. The Mennonites of Dutch origin were joined by Mennonites from other parts of Europe, including the German-speaking parts of the Swiss Confederacy. Some Poles also became Mennonites and were assimilated into the Vistula delta Mennonites. In 1772, most of the West-Prussian Mennonites' land in the Vistula area became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in the first of the Partitions of Poland. Frederick William II of Prussia ascended the throne in 1786 and imposed heavy fees on the Mennonites in exchange for continued military exemption.  Migration to Russia  Catherine the Great of Russia issued a manifesto in 1763 inviting all Europeans to come and settle various pieces of land within New Russia and especially in the Volga region. For a variety of reasons, Germans responded to this in large numbers. Mennonites from the Vistula delta region of Prussia later sent delegates to negotiate an extension of this manifesto and, in 1789, Crown Prince Paul signed a new agreement with them. The Mennonite migration to Russia from Prussia was led by Jacob Hoeppner and Johann Bartsch. Their settlement territory was northwest of the Sea of Azov, and had just been acquired from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768‚Äì1774. Many of the Mennonites in Prussia accepted this invitation, establishing Chortitza on the Dnieper River as their first colony in 1789. A second larger colony, Molotschna, was founded in 1803. Mennonites lived alongside Nogais‚Äîsemi- nomadic pastoralists‚Äîin the Molochna region of southern Ukraine starting from 1803, when Mennonites first arrived, until 1860, when the Nogai Tatars departed. Mennonites provided agricultural jobs to Nogais and rented pasture from them. Nogai raids on Mennonite herds were a constant problem in the first two decades of settlement. Two Mennonite settlements on the Vistula near Warsaw, Deutsch-Kazun and Deutsch-Wymysle, came under Russian control when the border was readjusted at the Congress of Vienna. Some of these families emigrated to the Molotschna settlement after it was established. Deutsch- Michalin near Machnovka was founded in 1787.Goertz, Adalbert, Deutsch-Michalin Mennonites Many families from this settlement moved to nearby Volhynia in 1802. Swiss Mennonites of Amish descent from Galicia settled near Dubno, Volhynia province in 1815. Other Galician Mennonites lived near Lviv. When the Prussian government eliminated exemption from military service on religious grounds, the remaining Mennonites were eager to emigrate to Russia. They were offered land along the Volga River in Samara Governorate and exemption from military service for twenty years, after which they could pay a special exemption tax.Smith, C. Henry, Smith's Story of the Mennonites (1981), p. 260. Two settlements, Trakt and Alt-Samara (to distinguish it from Neu Samara Colony), were founded in 1853 and 1861 respectively. By 1870 about 9000 individuals had immigrated to Russia, mostly to the Chortitza and Molotschna settlements which, with population increase, numbered about 45,000. Forty daughter colonies were established by 1914, occupying nearly , with a total population of 100,000.Smith, C. Henry, p. 261.  Economy  The colonists formed villages of fifteen to thirty families, each with 70 ha (175 acres) of land. The settlements retained some communal land and a common granary for use by the poor in lean years. Income from communal property provided funding for large projects, such as forming daughter colonies for the growing population. Insurance was also organized separately and outside of the control of the Russian government. Initially the settlers raised cattle, sheep and general crops to provide for their household. The barren steppes were much drier than their Vistula delta homeland and it took years to work out the proper dry-land farming practices. They grew mulberries for the silk industry, produced honey, flax and tobacco, and marketed fruits and vegetables for city markets. By the 1830s wheat became the dominant crop.Smith, p. 263. Expanding population and the associated pressure for more farmland became a problem by 1860. The terms of the settlement agreement prevented farms from being divided; they were required to pass intact from one generation to the next. Since agriculture was the main economic activity, an expanding class of discontented, landless poor arose. Their problems tended to be ignored by the village assembly, which consisted of voting landowners. By the early 1860s the problem became so acute that the landless organized a party that petitioned the Russian government for relief. A combination of factors relieved their plight. The Russian government permitted farms to be divided in half or quarters and ordered release of the village's communal land. The colonies themselves purchased land and formed daughter colonies on the eastern frontier extending into Siberia and Turkestan. These new colonies included Bergtal, Neu Samara Colony and the Mennonite settlements of Altai.Smith, p. 265-7. As wheat farming expanded, the demand for mills and farm equipment grew. The first large foundry was established in Chortitza in 1860 and other firms followed. By 1911 the eight largest Mennonite-owned factories produced 6% of the total Russian output (over 3 million rubles), shipped machinery to all parts of the empire and employed 1744 workers.Smith, p. 305. The annual output of Lepp and Wallman of Sch√∂nwiese was 50,000 mowers, 3000 threshing machines, thousands of gangplows in addition to other farm equipment. Flour and feed mills were originally wind-powered, a skill transplanted from Prussia. These were eventually replaced with motor- and steam-driven mills. Milling and its supporting industries grew to dominate the industrial economy of the colonies and nearby communities.  Local government  Mennonite colonies were self-governing with little intervention from the Russian authorities. The village, the basic unit of government, was headed by an elected magistrate who oversaw village affairs. Each village controlled its own school, roads and cared for the poor. Male landowners decided local matters at village assemblies. Villages were grouped into districts. All of the Chortitza villages formed one district; Molotschna was divided into two districts: Halbstadt and Gnadenfeld. A district superintendent headed a regional bureau that could administer corporal punishment and handle other matters affecting the villages in common. Insurance and fire protection were handled at the regional level, as well as dealing with delinquents and other social problems. The Mennonite colonies functioned as a democratic state, enjoying freedoms beyond those of ordinary Russian peasants.Smith, p. 268. In addition to village schools, the Mennonite colonies established their own hospitals, a mental hospital and a school for the deaf. They cared for orphans and elderly and provided an insurance program. By being largely self-sufficient in these local matters, they were able to minimize their burden on and contact with the Russian government. Mennonites stayed out of Russian politics and social movements that preceded the Russian revolution. After the Russian Revolution of 1905 they did exercise their right to vote. Most aligned themselves with the Octobrist Party because of its guarantee of religious freedoms and freedom of the press for minority groups. Hermann Bergmann was an Octobrist member of the Third and Fourth State Dumas; Peter Schr√∂der, a Constitutional Democratic party member from Crimea, was a member of the fourth Duma.Smith, p. 302.  Education  At a time when compulsory education was unknown in Europe, the Mennonite colonies formed an elementary school in each village. Students learned practical skills such as reading and writing German and arithmetic. Religion was included as was singing in many schools. The teacher was typically a craftsperson or herder, untrained in teaching, who fit class time around his occupation. In 1820 the Molotschna colony started a secondary school at Ohrloff, bringing a trained teacher from Prussia. The Central School was started in Chortitza in 1842. Over three thousand pupils attended the Central School with up to 8% of the colonists receiving a secondary education.Smith, p. 270. A school of commerce was started in Halbstadt employing a faculty with full graduate education. Those who wanted to pursue post-secondary education attended universities in Switzerland, Germany as well as Russia.  Religious life  Typically each village or group of villages organized an independent congregation. Cultural and traditional differences between Frisian, Flemish and West Prussian Mennonites were also reflected in those of their churches. They all agreed on fundamental Mennonite beliefs such as believer's baptism, nonresistance and avoidance of oaths. Pastors of Flemish congregations read sermons from a book while seated at a table. Frisian pastors stood while delivering the sermon.Smith, p. 273. Pastors were untrained and chosen from within the congregation. Unpaid pastors were selected from among the wealthier members‚Äîlarge landowners, sometimes teachers‚Äîallowing them to make a living while serving the congregation. The combined effect of respect for their position and material wealth gave them substantial influence over the community. The religious and secular leadership within a village often colluded against the poorer members. Church discipline was exercised in the form of excommunication against those committing gross sins. The most conservative congregations practiced \\"avoidance\\", which entailed cutting all business and social ties with an unrepentant member.Smith, p. 274. Because being part of a Mennonite congregation was required to enjoy the special benefits the Russian government provided to colonists, excommunication had broader implications. This was softened by the various internal factions, which allowed a person banned from one congregation to join another. = Kleine Gemeinde = Klaas Reimer and a group of eighteen followers broke from the main group and formed the Kleine Gemeinde. Reimer's main complaint was that Mennonite leaders were straying from their traditional nonresistant stance when they turned lawbreakers over to the government for punishment while at the same time church leaders were lax in enforcing spiritual discipline. In 1860 a portion of this group moved to Crimea, adopted baptism by immersion and became known as the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren. Today, the largest group of Kleine Gemeinde are located in Mexico. = Mennonite Brethren = Pietistic influences, introduced earlier among the West Prussian Mennonites, were transplanted to the Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard W√ºst, reinforced this pietism. W√ºst was a revivalist who stressed repentance and Christ as a personal savior, influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann. In 1859, Joseph H√∂ttmann, a former associate of W√ºst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in closed communion with church members who were unholy or not converted and baptism of adults by immersion. The Mennonite Brethren Church formally broke with the main church on January 6, 1860 when this growing group of dissenters presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated \\"that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it\\" and fear the \\"approach of an unavoidable judgment of God.\\"Smith, p. 280. The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonites groups to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.Smith, p. 281-282. = General Conference = The main body of Mennonites continued to be congregational in organization until 1882 when the General Conference of Mennonite Congregations in Russia was formed. Cooperation among Mennonite congregations throughout the empire became necessary for dealing with common interests such as publishing a hymnal, adopting a confession of faith, preserving the German language, education and running the forestry service, an alternative to military service. The conference adopted the motto Unity in essentials, tolerance in non-essentials, moderation in all things.Smith, p. 301. The Russianization program of Stolypin required the conference to publish its proceedings in Russian, certify all delegates with the imperial government and allow a government representative to attend all sessions. The conference found itself devoting more time to dealing with changing government policies and protecting the special privileges of Mennonites. An important task was to convince the government that Mennonitism was an established religion and not a sect, a label applied to small religious groups who were regularly mistreated within the Russian empire. The group that immigrated to North America called itself the General Conference Mennonite Church. Today, the main branches of the former General Conference Mennonite Church has split into the Mennonite Church Canada (since 2000) and the Mennonite Church USA (since 2002).  First wave of emigration  As nationalism grew in central Europe, the Russian government could no longer justify the special status of its German colonists. In 1870 they announced a Russification plan that would end all special privileges by 1880. Mennonites were particularly alarmed at the possibility of losing their exemption from military service and their right for schools to use the German language, which they believed was necessary to maintain their cultural and religious life. Delegates were sent to Petersburg in 1871 to meet with the czar and appeal for relief on religious grounds. They met with high officials, but failed to present the czar with their petition. A similar attempt the next year was also unsuccessful, but were assured by the Tsar's brother Grand Duke Konstantin that the new law would provide a way to address the concerns of the Mennonites in the form of noncombatant military service.Smith, p. 285. The most conscientious Mennonites could not accept any form of service that supported making war, prompting their community leaders to seek immigration options. In 1873 a delegation of twelve explored North America, seeking large tracts of fertile farmland. This group consisted of Leonhard Sudermann and Jacob Buller of the Alexanderwohl congregation representing the Molotschna settlement; Tobias Unruh from Volhynia settlements; Andreas Schrag of the Swiss Volhynia congregations; Heinrich Wiebe, Jacob Peters and Cornelius Buhr from the Bergthal Colony; William Ewert from West Prussia; Cornelius Toews and David Klassen of the Kleine Gemeinde and Paul and Lorenz Tschetter representing the Hutterites.Kaufman p. 78. This group returned with positive reports of good land available in Manitoba, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas. The more conservative groups‚Äîthose from Kleine Gemeinde, Bergthal and Chortitza‚Äîchose Canada, which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia and a large tract of land to reestablish colonies in Manitoba (East Reserve and West Reserve). The more liberal groups‚Äîthose from Molotschna‚Äîand the Hutterites chose the United States. Entire communities such as Alexanderwohl and Bergtal prepared to move as a unit as well as many individual families from among the other Mennonite villages. They sold their property, often at reduced prices and worked through the red tape and high fees of procuring passports. Realizing that 40,000 of Russia's most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent Eduard Totleben to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, he exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and offered an alternative national service that would not be connected in any way to the military. His intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay.Smith, p. 291. Between 1874 and 1880, of the approximately 45,000 Mennonites in South Russia, ten thousand departed for the United States and eight thousand for Manitoba. The settlement of Mennonites, primarily in the central United States, where available cropland had similarity to that in the Crimean Peninsula, coincided with the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Others looked east, and in one of the strangest chapters of Mennonite history, Claas Epp, Jr., Abraham Peters and other leaders led hundreds of Mennonites to Central Asia in the 1880s, where they expected Christ's imminent return. They settled in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and in the Khanate of Khiva.Ratliff, Walter Pilgrims On The Silk Road p.??, For those who remained in Russia, the military service question was resolved by 1880 with a substitute four-year forestry service program for men of military age.  World War I  During the period of the 'Great War', the Mennonites in Russia were well advanced socially and economically. Many large agricultural estates and business entities were controlled by Mennonite interests. They had a reputation for outstanding efficiency and quality and were noted across Russia for their agricultural and organizational abilities. The precedent of non-resistant national service had been established years before and the Mennonites therefore had a system to handle military service requests at the outbreak of war. During World War I, 5000 Mennonite men served in both forestry and hospital units and transported wounded from the battlefield to Moscow and Ekaterinoslav hospitals.Smith, p. 311. The Mennonite congregations were responsible for funding these forms of alternative service, as well as supporting the men's families during their absence, a burden of 3.5 million rubles annually. During this time there was a progressive breakdown in the autonomy of the Mennonite colonies and social and financial pressure began to take their effect on the Mennonite people and their institutions. Property and possessions began to be confiscated for the war effort and certain industrial complexes turned to military production (some voluntary). Much of the Mennonite hope at that time was based on the preservation of the existing Russian Provisional Government. However, as the war progressed, the social tide turned against the existing power structure and Russia began a march toward structural discord. The chaos that followed the collapse of the Russian Provisional Government was devastating to much of Ukraine, including the Mennonite colonies. The Red and White armies moved through the region, confiscating food and livestock. Nestor Makhno's anarchist army generally targeted Mennonites because they were thought of as \\"Kulaks\\" and an entity generally more advanced and wealthy than the surrounding Ukrainian peasants. The Mennonites' Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution. It is also rumored that Makhno himself had served on a Mennonite estate in childhood and harbored negative feelings based on treatment he received while employed there. Hundreds of Mennonites were murdered, robbed, imprisoned and raped during this period, and villages including (and around) Chortitza, Zagradovka and Nikolaipol were damaged and destroyed. Many more lives were lost to typhus, cholera and sexually transmitted diseases, spread by the anarchist army warring throughout the colonies.Smith, p. 314-315.The Makhnos of Memory: Mennonite and Makhnovist Narratives of the Civil War in Ukraine, 1917-1921 by Sean David Patterson pages 4-5University of Alberta THE FATE OF MENNONIT ES IN UKRAINE AND THE CRIMEA DURING SOVIET COLLECTIVIZATION AND THE FAMINE (1930-1933) COLIN PETER NEUFELDT œÉŒµŒª 13-4Historian Mennonite] A PUBLICATION OF THE MENNONITE HERITAGE CENTRE and THE CENTRE FOR MB STUDIES IN CANADA, Eichenfeld Massacre Revisited by Sean Patterson page 2 Based on the tragedy unfolding around them, some of the avowed pacifist Mennonites turned to self-defense and established militia units (Selbstschutz) to ward off raiding forces with the help of the German Army. While generally regarded as a failure of spiritual commitment by many within the community (currently and at the time), the forces initially achieved some military success in defending Mennonite colonies and families while the communities tried to escape and/or relocate. Ultimately the self- defence militia was overwhelmed once Makhno's anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army early in 1919. While the resistance certainly helped defend Mennonite communities against initial attacks, it may also have served to inflame some of the atrocities that followed. After this period, many Mennonites were dispossessed and ultimately their remaining properties and possessions were nationalized (collectivization) by the Soviet authorities.Smith, p. 316. The impacts of the trauma experienced during World War I and the Russian Revolution had lasting impacts on Russian Mennonites. Even though Mennonites who emigrated to North America experienced drastically less violence and the privilege of land ownership, many still showed very high levels of psychological distress. First through third generation Mennonites in North America were found to have high levels of depression, hysteria, psychasthenia, post traumatic stress disorder, ego strength, anxiety, repression, and over-controlled hostility.  Famine  Mennonites of Molotschna sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to coordinate aid. The new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in Istanbul. The Istanbul group, mainly Goshen College graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing Russian Civil War. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt in the Molotschna settlement just as General Wrangel of the White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while Clayton Kratz, who remained in Halbstadt as it was overrun by the Red Army, was never heard from again. A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine (see Russian famine of 1921). Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty Fordson tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. The cost of this relief effort was $1.2 million.Smith, p. 320.  Second wave of emigration  As conditions improved, Mennonites turned their attention from survival to emigration. Though the New Economic Policy appeared to be less radical than previous Soviet reforms, thousands of Mennonites saw no future under the communists. After years of negotiation with foreign governments and Moscow, arrangements were made for emigration to Canada, Paraguay and Argentina. Because Canada had not recognized the Soviet government, Moscow would not deal with them directly. Emigrants bound for Canada were processed through Riga. Those who could not pass the medical exam‚Äîusually because of trachoma‚Äîwere allowed to stay in Germany and Southampton in England until they were healthy. By 1930, 21,000 Mennonites had arrived in Canada, most on credit provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway.Smith, p. 324. A group of Mennonites from western Siberia who subsequently settled along the Amur in unrealized hopes of better living conditions, escaped over the frozen river to Harbin, China. A few hundred were allowed entry into California and Washington. The majority remained as refugees until the Nansen International Office for Refugees of the League of Nations intervened and arranged resettlement in Paraguay and Brazil in 1932.Smith, p. 335-336. Those that remained in their home villages were subject to exile to Siberia and other remote regions east of the Urals. From 1929 to 1940, one in eight men were removed, usually under the pretext of political accusations, to labor camps from which few ever returned or were heard from again.Smith, p. 336.  Collectivization  With the onset of economic and agricultural reforms, large estates and the communal land of the Mennonite colonies were confiscated. The next step was to reduce the model farms by 60% and then another 50% percent‚Äîan insufficient size to support a family. The confiscated land was given to peasants from outside the Mennonite communities, often communist party members. These new villagers soon controlled the local government, further confiscating land and rights from the Mennonite majority by labeling landowners and leaders kulaks and sending them into exile. The government taxed the remaining landowners so heavily that they could not possibly produce enough to meet the obligation and their land was confiscated as payment. As collectivization proceeded, there was some hope that Mennonites could run their own collective farms, but with the introduction of Stalin's first five-year plan there was no hope that such a scheme would be allowed. Starting in 1918 religious freedoms were restricted. Churches and congregations had to be registered with the government. Ministers were disenfranchised and lost their rights as citizens. Ministers could not be teachers, which was the livelihood of many Mennonite pastors. They and their family members could not join cooperatives or craft guilds. Because of these restrictions, ministers had a strong incentive to emigrate, and few were willing to replace them. Congregations could no longer do charitable work of any kind, which destroyed the well developed social institutions with the Mennonite colonies. Villages lost control of their schools; all religious content was prohibited. Sunday was abolished as a holiday. During World War I the Russians had permitted Mennonites to serve in non-combat capacities in the military. This practice was not continued. Following the Russian withdrawal from World War I, the Russian Civil War ensued, with an ultimate Red victory. The Russian Mennonites, many of whom were also known as being part of the one million or so Volga Germans living in their own established communities, were approached by the Soviet authorities and issued new standards and expectations. Education was to be controlled according to these new directives by the State, and families were eventually to be separated, with children sent to various live-in schools, while parents were to be assigned according to State needs. These directives were described by a Volga German teacher, Henry Wieler, who attended these State meetings and related the events in his detailed Journal, Tagabook, which today is partially translated but available in the published book, The Quiet in the Land, by Henry Wieler.  World War II to the Stalin era  In 1937 and 1938 the NKVD carried out ethnically motivated purges of German descendants and German language speakers, including Mennonites. As Stalin fomented cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church in World War II, Mennonites and Protestants were seen as more dangerous. During the Holodomor in Ukraine, there was active persecution of German-speaking people as a potential threat to the state, and a ban on organized religion. The hostilities of World War I had increased tensions with ethnic Ukrainians, and Mennonites with family members living abroad were targeted during the Great Purge. Having suffered persecution by the Stalinist regime, many Mennonites came to identify with Adolf Hitler, who opposed Stalin, and subscribed to conspiracy theories blaming the Jews for Communist crimes. As pacifists within an increasingly military regime under Stalin and then (after invasion of Ukraine and parts of Russia by Hitler) the Nazis, and as \\"Volga Germans\\" whose abuse Hitler had used as pretense to invade, Mennonites were subject to special pressure to join military units. Mennonites played a central role in exploiting slave labor at Stutthof concentration camp, and some, recruited into SS units, served as guards at concentration camps or perpetrated massacres. Other Mennonites were conscripted by force into German units as support and shock troops and some participated in exterminating or deporting families. Most history of this period is anecdotal and based on family memoirs and letters from the Gulags. Peter Letkemann of University of Winnipeg characterizes the casualties and abuses of this period as \\"victims of terror and repression in the Soviet Union during the 40-year period from 1917-1956.\\" This would overlap somewhat with the \\"Siberian Germans\\" deported to that region who have lost touch entirely with the Mennonite mainstream worldwide.  North America  After 1870 about 18,000 Russian Mennonites, fearing conscription into military service and state influence on their education systems, emigrated to the Plains States of the US and the Western Provinces of Canada. The more liberal went in general to the US where the majority over a period of several decades assimilated more or less into the mainstream society. Alexanderwohl Mennonite Church near Goessel, Kansas Russian Mennonites settled much of South Central Kansas, which owes its reputation as a wheat-producing state in large measure to its early Mennonite settlers. Winter wheat was introduced to Kansas in 1873. The following year the Mennonites, who had experience with dry land farming in Russia, quickly took advantage of its characteristics, resulting in rapid expansion of the milling industry in the state.Origins of winter wheat in Kansas (Kansas State Historical Society) It is planted in the fall and harvested in June and July of the following summer, and is therefore ideally suited to cold winters and the hot, dry Kansas summers. Kansas remains a top producer of wheat in America to this day. The more conservative Old Colony, Bergthal Mennonites and Kleine Gemeinde went to Canada which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia (no conscription into military service and German language private schools) and a large tract of land divided into two \\"Reserves\\". The Mennonites settled mostly in Manitoba in areas east and west of the Red River, called East Reserve and West Reserve. They brought with them many of their institutions and practices, especially their traditional settling pattern which meant that they settled in vast exclusively Mennonite areas where they formed villages with German names such as Blumenort, Steinbach and Gr√ºnthal. The more conservative faction of the Manitoba Mennonites decided to leave Canada after the World War I and moved to Mexico mostly in the years 1922-1927 and to Paraguay in 1927. The main reason for that was compulsory attendance of public schools and anti-German sentiments because of the war. Some latercomers went to Mexico in 1948.Maxico at GAMEO.Paraguay at GAMEO. After the more conservative fraction had left for Mexico, most the remaining Mennonites quickly assimilated into the mainstream society. Descendants of Manitoba Mennonites today form the majority of Conservative Mennonites in Latin America, counting more than 200,000. Because many of these Mennonites from Canada still hold Canadian passports-there was and still is a steady flow back to Canada fed by the high birth rates of conservative Mennonites. These emigrants strengthen the Russian Mennonite element in the Canadian Mennonite churches. With the Russian Mennonites came separate denominations previously unseen in North America, such as the Mennonite Brethren. A second wave of Russian Mennonites came out of Russia after the bloody strife following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and a third wave in the aftermath of World War I. These people, having lost everything they had known, found their way to settlements in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and Ontario and in many regions of the United States. Some joined with previous Mennonite groups, while others formed their own.  Latin America  Mennonite children in San Ignacio, Paraguay Mennonite children selling peanuts to tourists near Lamanai, Belize The emigration from Canada to Mexico and Paraguay in the 1920s was a reaction to the introduction of universal, secular compulsory education in 1917 requiring the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community. The first colony in a Latin American country was established by Mennonites from Canada between 1922 and 1925 in Mexico in the state of Chihuahua near the city of Cuauht√©moc. The next country was Paraguay, where Menno Colony was formed 1927 by Mennonites from Canada, whereas Fernheim and Friesland Colonies were formed in the 1930s by Mennonites from the Soviet Union who were fleeing starvation (Holodomor), persecution of religion and Collectivization under Stalin. Neuland and Volendam Colonies were founded 1947 by Mennonites who fled the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. All other Mennonite colonies in Latin America were formed by Mennonites who settled in North America since 1870, partly via Mexico and Belize. Beginning in 1954 conservative Mennonites settled in East-Bolivia, in the Santa Cruz Department. Bolivia soon became the refuge for Mennonites who wanted to flee the influences of modern society. In 2006 there were 41 Mennonite colonies in Bolivia. Old Colony Mennonites went from Mexico to Belize in 1959 and to Argentina in 1986. * 100,000 in Mexico * 70,000 in Bolivia * 40,000 in Paraguay * 10,000 in Belize * 10,000 in Brazil * 2,000 in Argentina * 1,000 Uruguay * 900 in Peru * 500 in El Salvador As of 2017, the population of Mennonites living in Mexico has declined sharply, according to some estimates. Worsening poverty, water shortages and drug- related violence across northern Mexico have provoked large numbers of Mennonites living in the Mexican states of Durango and Chihuahua to relocate abroad in recent years, especially to Canada and other regions of Latin America. Between 2012 and 2017 alone, it is estimated that at least 30,000 Mexican Mennonites emigrated to Canada.

Cheikh Tidiane Gadio (born 16 September 1956Profile at Senegalese Foreign Ministry web site. ) is a Senegalese diplomat who served in the government of Senegal as Minister of Foreign Affairs from April 2000 to October 2009. Diplomatic and political career Gadio was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs when Abdoulaye Wade took office as President in April 2000. He was promoted to the rank of Minister of State, while retaining the foreign affairs portfolio, in November 2002. At the African Union summit in Accra, Ghana in early July 2007, where leaders discussed whether a United States of Africa should be created immediately or gradually, Gadio expressed Senegal's stance in favor of immediate creation,\\"Union africaine: deux blocs s'affrontent sur la cr√©ation du gouvernement de l'UA\\", Agence France-Presse, 2 June 2007 . saying that \\"We are ready to abandon partially or totally our sovereignty to join a unity government in Africa.\\" He mentioned the possibility that Senegal could join a smaller union of willing states if the rest of Africa was not ready.\\"Leaders split over African unity\\", BBC News Online, 3 July 2007. As Foreign Minister, Gadio played a prominent role in African diplomacy, and President Wade praised him as \\"the best foreign minister in Africa\\". After more than nine years as Foreign Minister, Gadio was replaced by Madick√© Niang in the government named on 1 October 2009. No reason was given, although in the Senegalese press it was reported that Gadio had a poor relationship with Karim Wade, the President's son, who also served in the government as Minister of State for International Cooperation, Infrastructure, Air Transport, and Public Works.\\"Senegal's foreign minister steps down\\", Agence France-Presse, 1 October 2009. A few months after his dismissal, Gadio emerged as a critic and opponent of President Wade, launching a new political movement, the Citizen Political Movement (Mouvement politique citoyen, MPC), in May 2010. While sharply criticizing Wade, Gadio reaffirmed his support for pan-Africanism in his movement's manifesto and expressed his hope for an \\"African Renaissance\\" in the 21st century. He vowed to combat efforts to eliminate the second round of presidential elections in Senegal; the proposal to reduce elections to a single round was perceived as a change that would work to Wade's benefit.\\"Cheikh Tidiane Gadio et son mouvement politique en vedette\\", Agence de Presse S√©n√©galaise, 8 May 2010 . Gadio stood in the February 2012 presidential election as the candidate of the June 23 Movement (M23), which included his MPC. He placed eighth, receiving 0.98% of the vote.

Speaking at the Bamako Forum in February 2015, he argued in favor of integration between regions as a step towards African unity. He said that some national borders, such as those separating Senegal from Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, lacked justification and should be eliminated.R√©mi Carayol, \\"Mali : l‚Äôavenir de l‚ÄôAfrique au coeur du Forum de Bamako\\", Jeune Afrique, 23 February 2015 . =Bribery case= He and former Secretary for Home Affairs of Hong Kong Patrick Ho were arrested in New York in late November 2017, charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and money laundering. The US Justice Department alleged that the pair offered a US$2 million bribe to the president of Chad for oil rights, and deposited a US$500,000 bribe to an account designated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda on behalf of a Chinese energy conglomerate. The USJD alleges that the million-dollar bribes were dressed as donations. China responded by saying it has always encouraged Chinese businesses to comply with all local laws when doing business abroad. The energy fund also responded by posting a five-point message on its website denying that it had given authorisation to \\"Patrick Ho or any other party ... to engage in such business behaviour\\". In September 2018, the federal charges against Gadio were dismissed. Two months later, Gadio testified in Ho's bribery trial.

At its peak, Highway 7 measured in length, stretching from Highway 40 east of Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario to Highway 17 west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. However, due in part to the construction of Highways 402 and 407, the province transferred the sections of Highway 7 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction. The highway is now long; the western segment begins at Highway 4 north of London and extends to Georgetown, while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends to Highway 417 in Ottawa. Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year. Between 1927 and 1932, the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth, where Highway 15 continued to Ottawa. In the early 1960s, that section of Highway 15 was renumbered as Highway 7\\\\. In that same decade, the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed. During the 1970s and 1980s, many sections of Highway 7 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes. Within part of York Region, the route was upgraded to a limited-access expressway in preparation for the construction of Highway 407\\\\. Soon thereafter, that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway 7 through the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to regional governments. In the west, the construction of Highway 402 between Sarnia and London provided an uninterrupted alternative to Highway 7, resulting in the transfer of the section west of Highway 4\\\\. A third transfer took place in Peterborough, briefly separating the route into three discontinuous segments, but has since been rectified by renumbering a section of Highway 7A. From 2007 to 2012, the section of Highway 7 between Carleton Place and Ottawa has been widened to a divided freeway. In addition, work is underway to extend the Conestoga Parkway to New Hamburg as well as to build a new freeway between Kitchener and Guelph.  Route description  = Western segment = The western segment of Highway 7 travels from Elginfield in Middlesex County in the southwest to the Halton - Peel border at Norval near Brampton; a distance of . A portion of this segment, from Waterloo Regional Road 51 south of Baden to Highway 85 in Kitchener is a freeway, forming part of the Conestoga Parkway. Plans to build a freeway bypass of Highway 7 from Kitchener to Guelph are currently underway. At one point Highway 7 travelled as far west as Sarnia, being the main route to the Blue Water Bridge. Upon entering Sarnia from the east on London Line, drivers encountered a plethora of motels and restaurants, the Sarnia Airport, and attractions such as Hiawatha Racetrack and Waterpark, earning the stretch between Modeland Road and Airport Road the nickname of the \\"Golden Mile\\".http://www.sarnia.ca/documents.asp?DocumentID=74 p. 7 At the interchange with Highway 40, Highway 7 transitioned into the Highway 402 freeway which continued westwards to the Bluewater Bridge at the American border. Highway 402 was completed between Sarnia and Highway 401 in 1982, resulting in the redundancy of Highway 7 west of London as traffic shifted to the high-speed alternate. This work involved the realigning of Highway 402 to a new interchange with Highway 40, just north of the existing Highway 7/Highway 40 interchange where Highway 7 would continue to a redirected Exmouth Street. Nonetheless, Highway 7 remained provincially maintained until the segment west of Highway 4 was transferred to county jurisdiction on January 1, 1998; a process referred to as downloading. The former highway is now known as Lambton County Road 22 (London Line) and Middlesex County Road 7 (Elginfield Road). The current route begins at Highway 4, approximately north of London and immediately southeast of the village of Lucan; the former routing continued west along Elginfield Road through Parkhill and Arkona. Though the highway changes direction several times between Elginfield and Kitchener, it is mostly straight and two lanes wide, except east of New Hamburg where it widens to four lanes. Proceeding east-northeast through farmland, the highway meets the southern terminus of Highway 23 just later. It continues, serving as the boundary between Lucan Biddulph to the north and Middlesex Centre to the south, and later as the boundary between Perth County to the north and Middlesex and Oxford counties, with the tripoint of the three at County Road 120A south of St. Marys. Southeast of St. Marys, Highway 7 curves northeast into Perth County until it reaches downtown Stratford, where it meets Highway 8. The two highways travel east concurrently for , passing through the town of Shakespeare as it travels in a straight line through farmland. Southwest of New Hamburg, the route curves northeast into Waterloo Region, eventually widening into the four-lane Conestoga Parkway east of Nafziger Road. It follows this divided freeway past interchanges at Waterloo Regional Road 51 (Foundry Street) south of Baden, Waterloo Regional Road 12 (Queen Street/Notre Dame Drive) south of Petersburg, and Waterloo Regional Road 70 (Trussler Road) north of Mannheim, where it enters Kitchener and becomes surrounded by residential subdivisions. Within Kitchener, Highway 7 encounters interchanges at Waterloo Regional Road 58 (Fischer-Hallman Road)(at which point it widens to six lanes), Waterloo Regional Road 28 (Homer Watson Boulevard), Waterloo Regional Road 53 (Courtland Avenue), Waterloo Regional Road 15 (King Street)/Highway 8 (at which point it widens to eight lanes), Waterloo Regional Road 14 (Ottawa Street) and Waterloo Regional Road 55 (Victoria Street). The Highway 8 concurrency ends at the King Street interchange, with it diverging southeast onto the Freeport Diversion. Highway 7 exits at Victoria Street (four-lane arterial) while the parkway continues north into Waterloo as Highway 85. Construction began in June 2015 on a future freeway between Kitchener and Guelph that will make use of a reconfigured Wellington Street interchange, just north of Victoria Street, and tie in with the northern end of the Hanlon Expressway. Highway 7 exits Kitchener after crossing the Grand River, where it enters farmland again for the brief journey to Guelph along Victoria Street and Woodlawn Road. Midway between the two cities, the route enters Wellington County. Within Guelph, it meets Highway 6 at the northern end of the Hanlon Expressway. The two routes travel southeast along the expressway to Wellington County Road 124 (Wellington Street, former Highway 24), where Highway 7 branches northeast into downtown Guelph. It exits the city along York Street after crossing the Speed River, travelling parallel to and south of the Goderich‚ÄìExeter Railway. At Rockwood, the highway enters Halton Region and begins to zig-zag through several communities in Halton Hills. These include Acton, where the route intersects former Highway 25, and Georgetown. Just east of Norval, the western section of Highway 7 ends at the Halton‚ÄìPeel boundary. The road continues into Brampton as Peel Regional Road 107 (Bovaird Drive). The former highway then followed Highway 410 south, where it continued east along Queen Street (also Peel Road 107). Highway 7 in Markham in 2008 The western segment was separated from the rest of Highway 7 on June 7, 1997, when the section from Brampton to Markham was downloaded due to the opening of Highway 407. Part of that segment through Vaughan and Richmond Hill was relocated on a new alignment (as a 6 lane at-grade expressway) in 1987 in order to make way for the future toll route (where the two highways were forced to share a narrow corridor due to development) and to eliminate a jog along Bathurst Street; which also resulted in a section from west of Dufferin Street becoming a westerly extension of Centre Street. Highway 7 through York Region, despite being a suburban arterial and no longer a provincial highway, is still officially named \\"Highway 7\\", but otherwise has no street name, and received the number York Regional Road 7, displacing Islington Avenue which was redesignated as Regional Road 17\\\\. Parts of the Markham portion were once called Wellington Street as well as sideroad allowance (before 1925 when Highway 7 reached the area), stub of the old road exists today west of Markham Road that was a result of re-alignment of Highway 7. The Toronto Star ran a series of articles in 2013 depicting the urbanization of the former route. Among the issues was a proposed name change to \\"Avenue 7\\". Highway 407E, opening on June 20, 2016 = Eastern segment = The eastern segment of Highway 7 runs from Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road 48) in Markham to Highway 417 in Ottawa, a length of . Between Brooklin and north of Sunderland, Highway 7 assumes a north‚Äìsouth routing and is concurrent with Highway 12\\\\. The section from Sunderland to the eastern terminus of the highway is designated as part of the Central Ontario Route of the Trans-Canada Highway. Travelling east from Donald Cousens Parkway, Highway 7 exits the urbanized portion of Markham and enters the Greenbelt, a large tract of land north of the GTA restricted from development. It curves north at the community of Locust Hill along an alignment that eliminated a jog, then curves back to the east as it crosses into Durham Region. It travels north of and parallel to Highway 407 to Brougham, curving to cross the former eastern terminus of the freeway near Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1). East of the Highway 407 overpass, Highway 7 widens to four lanes and curves around the community of Greenwood and the hill that it stands on. The route crosses the northern end of Pickering, entering Whitby at Lakeridge Road (Durham Regional Road 23). Between Lakeridge Road and Highway 12, the route was rebuilt for the new Highway 407E and West Durham Link, with an overpass constructed at Cochrane Road. East of that, the route enters Brooklin and meets Highway 12. Highway 7 and Highway 12 travel north concurrently from Brooklin through Durham Region to Sunderland, with Highway 7 eventually departing to the east and entering the City of Kawartha Lakes. Despite its name, the highway passes through a mostly-rural landscape in Kawartha Lakes, bypassing south of Lindsay in the middle of the \\"city\\" along a brief concurrency with Highway 35\\\\. East of Lindsay, the route meanders southeast towards Peterborough, encountering the divided freeway Highway 115 southwest of the city. The two routes travel east concurrently along the southern edge of the city. Highway 115 and the divided freeway end at Lansdowne Street, onto which Highway 7 turns. Omemee, in the City of Kawartha Lakes The segment between Peterborough and Perth was built in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works employment project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that was built in the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway 28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway 14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway 62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway 37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway 41. East of Kaladar, Highway 7 begins to serve cottages along the shores of several large lakes that lie near the highway. It intersects the northern terminus of former Highway 38 near Sharbot Lake and later passes south of Maberly before exiting the Canadian Shield and reentering farmland. On the outskirts of Perth, the route meets former Highway 43 and curves northward. It travels around the western and northern shorelines of Mississippi Lake before passing directly south of Carleton Place. Just east of there, Highway 7 widens into a four lane freeway for the remainder of the distance to Highway 417\\\\. This section, completed by early 2012, was built by \\"twinning\\" the existing two lane highway with a second parallel carriageway to serve as the eastbound lanes. Highway 7 ends at an interchange with Highway 417, where drivers can proceed east to Ottawa or north to Arnprior. Highway 7 in Central Frontenac; this section passes through the sparsely developed terrain of the Opeongo Hills  History  The route which would later become Highway 7 was first assumed by the Department of Highways on February 26, 1920. This route connected Sarnia to Guelph. On April 27, 1921, the route was extended east to the Wellington‚ÄìHalton boundary. Several days later, on May 4, the highway was extended further east to Hurontario Street in Brampton. The Great Northern Highway, as it was known at the time, was numbered as Highway 7 during the summer of 1925. Assumptions on June 22 and July 2, 1927 extended Highway 7 from Brampton to Peterborough. A portion of the original routing of Highway 12 between Sunderland and Lindsay was renumbered in this process and a concurrency established between Brooklin and Sunderland. During the early 1930s, the DHO decided that Highway 7 would ultimately serve as an alternative route between Toronto and Ottawa; at that time the only option was via Highway 2 and Highway 16\\\\. The first step in this undertaking was to extend Highway 7 as far as Madoc along existing settler routes. This section was assumed on September 17, 1930. On November 18, 1931, construction was accelerated between Madoc and Perth as a major depression-relief project when eight contracts were set to build the new route. Over 2700 men blasted rock, dredged muskeg and endured a constant barrage of blood-sucking insects in order to construct this new link. The majority of it followed along a Canadian Pacific right-of-way (now abandoned past the town of Havelock) which had been cleared in 1881, deviating at times to provide a better alignment, avoid large muskeg or to lessen excavation work, most of which was performed by hand. On February 10 and February 17, the route, still incomplete, was surveyed and assumed as an extension of Highway 7\\\\. The new highway was opened to traffic in August, 1932. Between the 1930s and 1960s, Highway 7 connected Sarnia with Perth; Highway 15 continued from Perth to Ottawa. By the mid-1950s, the well established highway network had changed travel characteristics, and the numbering of Highway 15 between Perth and Ottawa was confusing motorists. The Ottawa Board of Trade petitioned the Department of Highways to renumber several highways surrounding the city. The department performed a series of renumberings similar to these recommendations following the extension of Highway 43 on September 8, 1961. Highway 15 was rerouted between Smiths Falls and Carleton Place to travel concurrently with Highway 29; Highway 7 was extended along the former routing from Perth to Carleton Place and signed concurrently with Highway 15 eastward to Ottawa. This brought the highway to its peak length of . = Downloads = In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) downloaded several sections of Highway 7 to the regional or county governments that those sections lay within. There are three separate issues that led to these downloads. Due to budget cuts instituted by the Mike Harris government, many highways deemed to serve a local or regional function were downloaded to local jurisdiction. The sections of Highway 7 west of London were transferred to Lambton County and Middlesex County, largely supplanted by the completion of nearby Highway 402 in 1982. On April 1, 1997, the section from Sarnia to Thedford was transferred to Lambton County. The section from Thedford to Elginfield was transferred to Lambton and Middlesex counties on January 1, 1998. As the construction of Highway 407 progressed across the northern end of the Greater Toronto Area, the MTO transferred sections of Highway 7 to the regions of Peel and York. On June 7, 1997, the section between Highway 410 and Highway 404 was transferred to the regions of Peel and York; the section from Highway 404 to McCowan Road was transferred to York Region on April 1, 1999. Several months later, on September 1, a short section between McCowan Road and Markham Road was transferred. Finally, on January 25, 2007, the section between Markham Road and east of Donald Cousens Parkway, where the highway narrows to two lanes today, was transferred. Within Peel Region, Highway 410 and Highway 7 ran concurrently north‚Äìsouth between Bovaird Drive and Queen Street. The Queen St. portion of the route was numbered Peel Regional Road 21 on July 10, 1997, but renumbered as Peel Regional Road 107 on March 26, 1998. To make the former highway easier to follow through Brampton, the Bovaird Drive portion of the route was subsequently also numbered Regional Road 107, after the highway was transferred to the Region of Peel on July 12, 2002 The non-Highway 7 portions of Queen Street and Bovaird Drive west and east of Highway 410 are designated as Regional Roads 6 and 10 respectively. In the Peterborough area, Highway 7 was rerouted from travelling through the city to bypassing it along Highway 115\\\\. This situation took over six years to set in place. On April 1, 1997, the sections of Highway 7 entering the western edge of Peterborough along North Monaghan Parkway and Sir Sanford Fleming Drive were transferred to the county and city, creating a gap between Springville and the Peterborough Bypass. This situation was rectified on May 1, 2003, when the section of Highway 7A that until then was a continuation of the road south from Springville to Highway 115 was renumbered as Highway 7\\\\. The concurrency with Highway 115 was extended southwest to remove the discontinuity entirely. = Recent work = York Region In 2005, Highway 7 was made the second main arterial for York Region's Viva Rapid Transit service (after Yonge Street), leading to the expansion of the CN MacMillan Bridge and Highway 400 overpass. Highway 7 also became the northern terminus of the western arm of the Toronto Transit Commission's Line 1 Yonge‚ÄìUniversity subway line that opened in December 2017. Carleton Place On August 22, 2006, work officially began on a project to expand Highway 7 between Ottawa and Carleton Place into a freeway through a process known as twinning, in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road and grade-separated interchanges constructed. Plans for this expansion were first conceptualized in 1979 when a planning study was undertaken. However, budgetary constraints forced an early end to this study in 1981. In 1988, the project was reinstated. A study released that year recommended that Highway 7 be widened to five lanes with a centre turning lane south of Carleton Place as an interim measure; this was carried out in 1993.http://www.ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/archives/rmoc/Transportation/18Jun97/Hway7fnl.pdf Full planning on the four-laning of the route began in 1993.http://www.ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/trc/2008/09-03/03%20-%20ACS2008-PWS- INF-0010.htm In mid-2005, the Government of Ontario announced the project to the public. The work was carried out over three contracts: from Highway 417 to Jinkinson Road, from Jinkinson Road to Ashton Station Road, and from Ashton Station Road to Highway 15\\\\. In July 2007, a C$45 million contract was awarded to R.W. Tomlinson for the first phase of the route west from Highway 417. Bot Construction was awarded the $73.2 million contract for the second phase, which included two interchanges, four overpasses and service roads, in early 2008. The first phase was opened to traffic on July 31, 2008 Towards the end of 2009, the $25.8 million contract for the third phase was awarded to Aecon Group.http://www.cnw.ca/fr/story/535541/aecon-awarded-25-million-mto-contract- to-expand-highway-7 The second phase was completed ahead of schedule on December 3, 2008, bypassing south of the former route at Ashton Station Road and merging to two lanes west of Dwyer Hill Road. The third phase was completed in late 2011/early 2012, connecting to Carleton Place.  Future  On March 23, 2007, the Government of Ontario announced the approval of an Environmental Impact Assessment for a four-lane controlled-access highway between Kitchener, and Guelph, as traffic on Highway 401 is growing steadily and approaching capacity, along with the current two-lane alignment of Highway 7\\\\. This would connect to the Conestoga Parkway via an expansion of the existing Wellington Road interchange, the new junction would be a four level interchange; the government's eventual plan is to have a Highway 7 freeway running from Stratford to Guelph. The eastern end of the proposed Highway 7 freeway would terminate at, and interline with, the Hanlon Expressway (Highway 6), which is also scheduled for upgrades to a full freeway beginning in June 2015. In early 2011, Ontario Infrastructure Minister Bob Chiarelli hinted at possible plans to extend the four-laning of Highway 7 west from Carleton Place to Perth. In July 2020, the Ford government announced that it would fund the highway project linking Guelph and Kitchener and building a new bridge for the highway over the Grand River. It is expected to cost 764 million dollars for the 18-kilometre freeway.

Definition  Given a topological space (X, \\\\tau) and a subset S of X, the subspace topology on S is defined by :\\\\tau_S = \\\\lbrace S \\\\cap U \\\\mid U \\\\in \\\\tau \\\\rbrace. That is, a subset of S is open in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of S with an open set in (X, \\\\tau). If S is equipped with the subspace topology then it is a topological space in its own right, and is called a subspace of (X, \\\\tau). Subsets of topological spaces are usually assumed to be equipped with the subspace topology unless otherwise stated. Alternatively we can define the subspace topology for a subset S of X as the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map :\\\\iota: S \\\\hookrightarrow X is continuous. More generally, suppose \\\\iota is an injection from a set S to a topological space X. Then the subspace topology on S is defined as the coarsest topology for which \\\\iota is continuous. The open sets in this topology are precisely the ones of the form \\\\iota^{-1}(U) for U open in X. S is then homeomorphic to its image in X (also with the subspace topology) and \\\\iota is called a topological embedding. A subspace S is called an open subspace if the injection \\\\iota is an open map, i.e., if the forward image of an open set of S is open in X. Likewise it is called a closed subspace if the injection \\\\iota is a closed map.  Terminology  The distinction between a set and a topological space is often blurred notationally, for convenience, which can be a source of confusion when one first encounters these definitions. Thus, whenever S is a subset of X, and (X, \\\\tau) is a topological space, then the unadorned symbols \\"S\\" and \\"X\\" can often be used to refer both to S and X considered as two subsets of X, and also to (S,\\\\tau_S) and (X,\\\\tau) as the topological spaces, related as discussed above. So phrases such as \\"S an open subspace of X\\" are used to mean that (S,\\\\tau_S) is an open subspace of (X,\\\\tau), in the sense used below -- that is that: (i) S\\\\in \\\\tau; and (ii) S is considered to be endowed with the subspace topology.  Examples  In the following, \\\\mathbb{R} represents the real numbers with their usual topology. * The subspace topology of the natural numbers, as a subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}, is the discrete topology. * The rational numbers \\\\mathbb{Q} considered as a subspace of \\\\mathbb{R} do not have the discrete topology ({0} for example is not an open set in \\\\mathbb{Q}). If a and b are rational, then the intervals (a, b) and [a, b] are respectively open and closed, but if a and b are irrational, then the set of all rational x with a < x < b is both open and closed. * The set [0,1] as a subspace of \\\\mathbb{R} is both open and closed, whereas as a subset of \\\\mathbb{R} it is only closed. * As a subspace of \\\\mathbb{R}, [0, 1] ‚à™ [2, 3] is composed of two disjoint open subsets (which happen also to be closed), and is therefore a disconnected space. * Let S = [0, 1) be a subspace of the real line \\\\mathbb{R}. Then [0, ) is open in S but not in \\\\mathbb{R}. Likewise [, 1) is closed in S but not in \\\\mathbb{R}. S is both open and closed as a subset of itself but not as a subset of \\\\mathbb{R}.  Properties  The subspace topology has the following characteristic property. Let Y be a subspace of X and let i : Y \\\\to X be the inclusion map. Then for any topological space Z a map f : Z\\\\to Y is continuous if and only if the composite map i\\\\circ f is continuous. Characteristic property of the subspace topology This property is characteristic in the sense that it can be used to define the subspace topology on Y. We list some further properties of the subspace topology. In the following let S be a subspace of X. * If f:X\\\\to Y is continuous the restriction to S is continuous. * If f:X\\\\to Y is continuous then f:X\\\\to f(X) is continuous. * The closed sets in S are precisely the intersections of S with closed sets in X. * If A is a subspace of S then A is also a subspace of X with the same topology. In other words the subspace topology that A inherits from S is the same as the one it inherits from X. * Suppose S is an open subspace of X (so S\\\\in\\\\tau). Then a subset of S is open in S if and only if it is open in X. * Suppose S is a closed subspace of X (so X\\\\setminus S\\\\in\\\\tau). Then a subset of S is closed in S if and only if it is closed in X. * If B is a basis for X then B_S = \\\\\\\\{U\\\\cap S : U \\\\in B\\\\\\\\} is a basis for S. * The topology induced on a subset of a metric space by restricting the metric to this subset coincides with subspace topology for this subset.  Preservation of topological properties  If a topological space having some topological property implies its subspaces have that property, then we say the property is hereditary. If only closed subspaces must share the property we call it weakly hereditary. * Every open and every closed subspace of a completely metrizable space is completely metrizable. * Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space. * Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact. * Being a Hausdorff space is hereditary. * Being a normal space is weakly hereditary. * Total boundedness is hereditary. * Being totally disconnected is hereditary. * First countability and second countability are hereditary.

He is mainly famous as a composer of frottole; he is principally infamous for murdering his wife. He was born in Verona and died in or near Venice. Life Details of his early life are sketchy, as is common for most composers of the time, but most likely he grew up in Mantua, and he mentions in a letter that he was originally from Verona. Until around 1500 he lived and worked in Mantua, though he made occasional trips to adjacent cities such as Ferrara, Este, Vicenza, Milan, and Pavia, especially when he was in trouble. He fled the city in 1495 for unknown reasons, returning later that same year; in 1499 he murdered his wife when he discovered her in flagrante delicto but, unlike Gesualdo a hundred years later, he may have spared the man (the sources are contradictory on this detail). Curiously, he seems to have been pardoned again and again for his misdeeds, but he left Mantua again \\"without permission, and for despicable reasons\\", as stated in a letter from one of the Gonzaga family, his employers. His skill as a composer probably endeared him to Isabella d'Este, one of the great patrons of the arts of the time; this connection may have assisted him in attaining pardons for his various murders and misdemeanors. From 1502 Tromboncino was employed by the even more infamous Lucrezia Borgia in Ferrara, where he wrote music for the famous intermedi of her opulent court, and most significantly for her wedding to Alfonso d'Este. Sometime before 1521 he moved to Venice, where he most likely spent the remainder of his life, seemingly in rather more placid circumstances. Music and influence In spite of his stormy, erratic, and possibly criminal life, much of his music is in the light current form of the frottola, a predecessor to the madrigal. He was a trombonist, as shown by his name, and sometimes employed in that capacity; however he apparently wrote no strictly instrumental music (or none survives). He also wrote some serious sacred music: seventeen laude, a motet and a setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah. Stylistically, the sacred works are typical of the more conservative music of the early 16th century, using non-imitative polyphony over a cantus firmus, alternating sectionally with more homophonic textures or with unadorned plainsong. His frottolas, by far the largest and most historically significant part of his output (176 in all) are more varied than those of the other famous frottolist, Marchetto Cara, and they also tend to be more polyphonic than is typical for most frottolas of the time; in this way they anticipate the madrigal, the first collections of which began to be published near the very end of Tromboncino's life, and in the city where he lived (for example Verdelot's Primo libro di Madrigali of 1533, published in Venice). The major differences between the late frottolas of Tromboncino and the earliest madrigals were not so much musical as in the structure of the verse they set. The poetry that Tromboncino set tended to be by the most famous writers of the time; he set Petrarch, , Sannazaro, and others; he even set a poem by Michelangelo, Come haro dunque ardire, which was part of a collection Tromboncino published in 1518.

Downe is south west of Orpington and south east of Charing Cross. Downe lies on a hill, and much of the centre of the village is unchanged; the former village school now acts as the village hall. The word Downe originates from the Anglosaxon word d≈´n, latterly down, hence the South and North Downs. In April 1965, it (and the remaining part of Orpington Urban District Council), which was abolished, came within the newly created London Borough of Bromley. The village is in the historic county of Kent. When Charles Darwin moved there in 1842, the village was still known as Down. Its name was changed later in the 1940s to Downe, to avoid confusion with County Down in Ireland. Darwin Charles Darwin lived in Down House for 40 years, from 1842 until he died there in 1882. He became a close friend of Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, who lived nearby at the Lubbock's High Elms estate on the other side of the village. A favourite place of Darwin's was Downe Bank, now a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest, and several members of his family are buried in the graveyard of St Mary's Church. Down House and the surrounding area has been nominated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to become a World Heritage Site. However, this decision has been deferred. Local politics Since 2019, the local Member of Parliament has been Gareth Bacon of the Conservative Party. By a numerical majority of 19,453 votes (38.5%), Orpington is the safest Conservative Parliamentary seat in London. One councillor is elected every four years to Bromley London Borough Council. To date, the Darwin ward has only been represented by representatives from the Conservative Party. Buckston Browne Farm Buckston Browne Farm Downe is the location of Buckston Browne Farm, built in 1931 as a surgical research centre by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). In the 1980s, the farm caused controversy because of its use of vivisection techniques, and in August 1984 it was raided by anti-vivisection activists. The farm has now been made into four houses. Scouting There are two scout campsites in the Downe area: * The Downe Scout Activity Centre consisting of of woodland and open fields is just outside the village. * The Greenwich (one of the Districts of the Greater London South Scout county) District campsite is also nearby. Transport Downe, being in the county of Greater London, is still under Transport for London remit despite being outside the metropolis. It is served by several London Buses bus services from London but overall has limited connections into London. There are no rail links to the village (nearest stations: Orpington, Bromley and Hayes), but it is served by two hourly bus routes: 146 - Bromley North to Downe via Old Hayes and Keston; R8 ‚Äì Biggin Hill to Orpington via Downe and Green Street Green; Notable people *Bill Hunter Christie (1922-1997), lobbyist for the Falkland Islanders *Charles Darwin (1809‚Äì82), biologist, naturalist and geologist *Horace Darwin (1851‚Äì1928), civil engineer and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge * Nigel Farage (born 1964), former leader of UKIP and Member of European Parliament for South East England. *Charles Hayes (1678‚Äì1760), mathematician and chronologist *John Lubock (1803‚Äì65), banker, barrister, mathematician and astronomer *John Lubock (1834‚Äì1913), banker, biologist, archaeologist and Liberal politician *Herbert Newton Casson (1869‚Äì1951), journalist and author, founder of Efficiency magazine *Olive Willis (1877‚Äì1964), founder of Downe House School Nearest places *Cudham *Farnborough *Keston *Orpington References External links *Audio tour of Downe and Down House *Downe Bank Nature Reserve *Darwin at Downe - World Heritage Site nomination *Homepage of Stage Door Theatre Group, Downe Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Bromley Category:Villages in London de:London Borough of Bromley ","title":"Downe"},{"id":"910940","text":"The 4th Duke of Argyll. General John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll KT PC (c. 1693 ‚Äì 9 November 1770), was a British Army officer and Scottish Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1713 and 1761. From 1729 to 1761 he was known as John Campbell of Mamore. Biography The Duke was the son of the Hon. John Campbell of Mamore, the second son of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, and Elizabeth Elphinstone, daughter of John, 8th Lord Elphinstone. Marriage and children Coombe Bank House, now a school In 1720, Campbell married Mary Drummond Ker, daughter of John Drummond Ker, 2nd Lord Bellenden of Broughton. They had the following children:The Peerage, entry for 4th Duke of Argyll * Lady Caroline Campbell (born 12 January 1721, died 17 January 1803) * Field Marshal John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll (born June 1723, died 24 May 1806) * Lord Frederick Campbell (born 20 June 1729, died 8 June 1816)Athol Murray, ‚ÄòCampbell, Lord Frederick (1729‚Äì1816)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 14 Oct 2017 * Lord William Campbell (born 1731, died 1778) He acquired Coombe Bank, near Sevenoaks Kent, where he commissioned Roger Morris to build a country house for him in the second quarter of the 18th century. The house subsequently passed on his death in 1770 to his second son Frederick. Military and parliamentary careers Campbell joined the army in 1710, becoming a Lieutenant Colonel at the age of nineteen. However, he soon entered the world of politics, and at the 1713 general election, he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for the alternating seat of Buteshire. At the 1715 general election, Campbell stood at Elgin Burghs. He was defeated in the poll, in which two rival delegates were allowed to vote, and the chairman, who was the other candidate, used his casting vote in the resulting tie to return himself. Campbell was returned on petition as MP for the Boroughs on 7 April 1715. At the 1722 general election much the same thing happened again with two rival delegates casting their votes. This time the petition was referred to committee and it took two years before Campbell was returned as MP on 23 January 1725. At the 1727 general election, Campbell succeeded his father as MP for Dunbartonshire, where he was returned unopposed in the general elections of 1734, 1741 and 1747. He was returned unopposed again for Dumbartonshire at the 1754 general election, and supported Newcastle's administration and voted in its defence in the division on Minorca in 1757. He was nominated for governor of Dumbarton castle in 1759 but became involved in the Argyll-Bute family quarrel and was appointed governor of Limerick in compensation. He was returned again at the 1761 general election, but succeeded to the Dukedom two days later and had to vacate his seat in the House of Commons. During most of his tenure as MP for Dunbartonshire, he was Groom of the Bedchamber. Additionally, Campbell served in the military during his tenure in Parliament‚Äîhe became Colonel of the 39th Regiment of Foot (1737‚Äì1738) and the 21st Regiment of Foot (1738‚Äì1752), serving with honour in the Battle of Dettingen in 1743. On 12 July 1746 Campbell was the questioner of Jacobite figure Flora MacDonald for her role in aiding Charles Edward Stuart to Skye, and produced a written document of Flora's confessions. He rose quickly up the ranks, becoming a brigadier general in 1743, major general in 1744, and lieutenant general in 1747; he became colonel of the North British Dragoons in 1752, a position he held until his death. Dukedom Upon inheriting the dukedom and other titles upon the death of his cousin Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, he left the House of Commons and became Governor of Limerick and a Scottish representative peer. He became a Privy Councillor in 1762, a general in 1765, and a Knight of the Order of the Thistle in that same year. Death The Duke died on 9 November 1770 and is buried at Kilmun Parish Church. He was succeeded in the dukedom and other titles by his elder son John. His younger son Lord William Campbell was the last British Governor of South Carolina.

Taking its name from its parent company, Lotte Corporation, it currently has franchises in Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. The origin of the name is a combination of corporate names Lotte and Cafeteria. Its menu includes typical fast-food items such as burgers, fried potato, fried chicken, chicken wings and chicken fingers. In 2019, Lotteria pre-released the new menu ÏßÄÌååÏù¥ (gee-pie) in South Korea, which is the Taiwan representative street food. History The company was founded in February 1972 in Tokyo, Japan by Shin Kyuk-ho, a Korean entrepreneur. Its first franchises opened in Nihonbashi, Ueno and Yokohama in September of that year.Lotte Corporate History, 1970-1999 In 1979, the brand was established in Seoul, South Korea. Lotteria later spread throughout East Asia adding locations in China, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam. Businesses by country =Japan= Osaka, Japan. In Japan, Lotteria's most popular menu items are hamburgers, cheeseburgers and teriyaki burgers. It invented its other popular item, the shrimp burger, in 1977, which has since been copied by McDonald's and MOS Burger in Japan. In addition, the menu in Japan also includes fresh sandwiches along with fresh Jerome as well as desserts like crepes, apple pie, shakes and frozen cake-sticks. The premium cheeseburger is the top selling menu item in Japan. In 2005, Genichi Tamatsuka, the former president of Fast Retailing Co. (which operates the Uniqlo brand), was appointed as chairman and CEO during a management restructuring in 2005.\\"Ex-Fast Retailing head named chairman of Lotteria burger chain.\\" Kyodo News International: Tokyo, Japan, 22 January 2006 The appointment was the result of a previous contract undertaken by Revamp Corp, a business revitalization company.

Lotteria South Korea was founded in 1979, as part of an expansion of the Lotte Group which also included Lotte Chilsung Beverages, Lotte Food and Lotte Ham. Lotteria became the number-one fast food restaurant chain in South Korea. The company achieved a 45% market share in 2001 (compared to 20.1 percent for McDonald's). Lotteria's success was achieved in part by introducing lines of Koreanized fast food including its now signature kimchi burger, leading to it being seen by most Koreans as a native version of most Western-style fast-food restaurants. The company tries to imitate the western idea of fast food through \\"cleanliness, bright interior, Western pop music as an audio background,\\" with the idea of trying to create \\"the impression of a 'small piece of America in the middle of Korea'\\". Their business strategy resulted in growth rates of 10 percent in 2006 and 16 percent in 2007; by 2009, Lotteria had 920 outlets across the country. The menu in South Korea includes baked potatoes, yogurt, salads, cheese sticks, squid rings, and a popular shaved iced dessert called pat bing soo (Ìå•ÎπôÏàò). One of the restaurants most popular burgers is the 'Bulgogi Burger' with bulgogi sauce serving as relish. In South Korea too, a specially priced lunchtime menu is offered focusing on less expensive and often reduced items. The timing of the lunch menu differs from store to store but falls within the hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., with prices fluctuating from location to location. There are a few stores which carry weekend lunches but these are relatively rare. In March 2009, Lotteria took full control of the South Korean branch of T.G.I. Friday's. It had previously invested 10 billion won in the chain in 2002. Lotteria also runs Natuur, one of South Korea's major ice cream franchises, itself introduced to South Korea by Lotte in 1998. On February 27, 2010, the 'Hamburger Cafeteria' Experience Center was opened in Seoul, KidZania. In April 2016, it will open a \\"Hamburger Cafeteria\\" experience center in Busan, KidZania, following KidZania Seoul. =China= Lotteria and Angel-in-us Coffee at Yanji Chaoyangchuan International Airport, Jilin, China Lotteria entered the Chinese market in 1994 and mainly centered in Beijing, but it ended operation in 2003 due to a lack of popularity among potential customers. In 2008, Lotteria re-started business in China with new operation strategies that specifically targeting Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, other stores are located in cities like Beijing, Qingdao, Yantai and Shenyang. =Vietnam= The restaurant entered the Vietnamese market in 2004. Its menu there includes regular menu burgers and fried chicken but not side items like baked potatoes and pat bing soo. They also have an ice cream-based dessert (like a McFlurry) called a Tornado. It comes in five flavors: chocolate, cookie, peanut, sprinkles or green tea. They also have Shrimp Burgers and some items that include rice, such as drumsticks with rice. =Indonesia= The chain opened its first Indonesian franchise on October 19, 2011 at Lotte Mart Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta. As of 2015, the chain had 32 outlets in Greater Jakarta, Karawang and Bandung. All outlets in Indonesia were permanently closed on June 29, 2020. =Cambodia= The chain opened its first Cambodian franchise in June 2014 at Aeon Mall, followed by a second store in December 2014 at Soria Mall. =Myanmar= Myanmar's first Lotteria, in Junction Square in Yangon, with English signing. The first Lotteria restaurant in Myanmar was opened in Junction Square in Yangon in April 2013, with plans to open 24 more by 2016 from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw. Along with the regular fare of chicken and burgers, Lotteria is offering dishes tailored to Myanmar consumers, such as chicken rice.Fast food invasion looms in Yangon, Myanmar Times, 01 April 2013 Other business strategies In 2003, Lotteria partnered with KT and Intel to provide Wi-Fi access in its restaurants,Yang, Sung-jim. \\"Wireless Internet service opens at Lotteria eateries.\\" Korea Herald. Seoul, Korea: 9 April 2003 to help attract more customers. This service has also been available in every restaurant in Japan for NTT Docomo and au mobile users since 2006. Lotteria has followed the global fast-food trend of shifting towards health-conscious foods and rebranding its image. In the face of health trends, it eliminated trans fats from its French fries. It also introduced healthier menu items, such as a rye bread burger that totals only 350 calories. From 2008, perhaps as a response to McDonald's strategy to become more upmarket, Lotteria began a campaign to change \\"the image of our stores to create a mood similar to a cafe, geared toward the health-conscious as well as female customers\\". Recycling (South Korea only) In South Korea, waste is separated by category. Since 2003, the South Korean government has required a 50-to-100 Won deposit to be levied against all disposable cups sold in restaurants to ensure that they were returned to be recycled. As such, products (such as drinks and ice cream) to be consumed in-store are served in reusable plastic containers; or if a customer purchases their product in a disposable cup and pays the deposit, they can have their deposit refunded if they return the empty cup to the counter staff. The recycling law yielded recycling rates for cups of 14 percent in 2003, 22 percent in 2004, and 25 percent in 2005. This law has since been repealed. The Seoul city government requires mandatory garbage sorting with food, recyclables and general trash to be separated from each other. Specialized receptacles thus exist (for liquids, paper, uneaten food, plastic, and other general waste) at all Lotteria restaurants. In addition, Lotteria also charges a fee of 50-to-100 Won on bags as is the norm for most Western-style stores and other shopping venues in South Korea.

He was born on in Verkhnedneprovsk, near Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk), former Russian Empire (now Ukraine), and died on 18 March 1970 in Moscow, Russia. He was an offspring of a renowned klezmorim's family. Pulver studied violin since early childhood, at first with his father; later on, he studied with his brother-in- law, a disciple of Czech violinist Otakar Sevcik. Pulver graduated from St. Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied violin and composition under A.K. Lyadov. Initially, he was a violinist and composer in a wandering Ukrainian theatre group. Later on, he was a symphonic concert-master and conductor, a founding member of the Stradivari Quartet. He was the Musical Director of the State Jewish Theatre in Moscow (the GOSET). Pulver was awarded the titles of People's Artist of RSFSR and Distinguished Arts Master of RSFSR.  Compositions  Pulver composed incidental music for works including Shakespeare's King Lear; Sholom Aleichem's 200.000 and The Man of the Air; Adventures of Benjamin the Third after Mendele Mocher Sforim; Abraham Goldfaden's The Sorceress (in collaboration with Joseph Achron); and Zalman Shneyer's Freylekhs (in collaboration with Maximilian Shteynberg). He also composed operettas (Gulliver, Inside the Big Top, What is her name?), movie scores, songs, and Yiddish folk-song arrangements. Some of his tunes have been considered as Jewish folklore. He was one of the important musicians bridging the traditional Eastern European Jewish music with the Western classical music forms.  Artists about Lev Pulver  L.M. Pulver has a sophisticated sense of incidental music's essence./ ... /.Pulver is especially aware of those moments in scenic plots when a direct calling for the music to sound is there. Moreover, this is not surprising: he started playing since nine years of age as a wandering weddings-musician. Thereafter, while being an already accomplished musician, he went on with playing in theaters, first at the orchestra of the Ukrainian Opera, then at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. His theatrical experience left a lasting impression on all of his works. His music is effectively theatrical./Solomon Mikhoels/ ... (My) father started a job at Mikhoels‚Äô Jewish Theatre .That theatre might have been considered as a musical one. In charge of the orchestra and of all the musical life (there) was an energetic gifted man ‚Äì Lev Pulver. All of the music was written by him, and he conducted as well. Their productions reminded of the today's musicals. /Kirill Kondrashin/  Recordings  A few recordings of his music are available featuring the performances of the GOSET orchestra with Solomon Mikhoels and Benjamin Zuskin, as well as by singers Solomon Khromchenko, Misha Alexandrovich, Nekhama Lifshitz, Marina Gordon and actors Emil Gorovets and Boris Landau.

The circle on the right (blue and violet) is H(Y), with the blue being H(YX). The violet is the mutual information I(X;Y).

Under Nectanebo II, Egypt prospered. During his reign, the Egyptian artists developed a specific style that left a distinctive mark on the reliefs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Like his indirect predecessor Nectanebo I, Nectanebo II showed enthusiasm for many of the cults of the gods within ancient Egyptian religion, and more than a hundred Egyptian sites bear evidence of his attentions. Nectanebo II, however, undertook more constructions and restorations than Nectanebo I, commencing in particular the enormous Egyptian temple of Isis (the Iseum). For several years, Nectanebo II was successful in keeping Egypt safe from the Achaemenid Empire. However, betrayed by his former servant, Mentor of Rhodes, Nectanebo II was ultimately defeated by the combined Persian and Greek forces in the Battle of Pelusium (343 BC). The Persians occupied Memphis and then seized the rest of Egypt, incorporating the country into the Achaemenid Empire under Artaxerxes III. Nectanebo fled south and preserved his power for some time; his subsequent fate is unknown. Portraits The greywacke statue of Nectanebo II. Except for the small-scale greywacke statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which shows Nectanebo II standing before the image of Horus, no other annotated portraits of Nectanebo II are known. In the greywacke statue, Nectanebo II is shown in a nemes and uraeus. His bent arm with the sword stands for the hieroglyph nakht, the falcon represents Horus, while the hieroglyph in Nectanebo's right hand stands for heb. Other portraits attributed to Nectanebo II (all featuring the khepresh) include a quartzite head in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, a basalt head in Alexandria, a granite head acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and a damaged quartzite head. Rise to power Isis and Nectanebo II In 525 BC, Egypt was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. Because of internal struggles for the Persian imperial succession, Egypt managed to regain independence in 404 BC. In 389 BC, Pharaoh Hakor negotiated a treaty with Athens and for three years (from 385 to 383 BC) managed to withstand Persian aggression.Grimal, p. 374 However, following the conclusion of the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC between the Achaemenids and the Greek city-states, Egypt and Cyprus became the only obstacles to Persian hegemony in the Mediterranean. At the beginning of 360 BC, Nectanebo's predecessor, Teos, started preparations for war against intruders. In the same year, the Egyptian army set off, traveling along the coast by land and sea. Nectanebo II accompanied his uncle Teos in that campaign and was in charge of the machimoi.Grimal, p. 377 In an attempt to quickly raise finances for the war, Teos imposed taxes on Egyptians and seized temple property. Egyptians, particularly the priests, resented these measures but supported Nectanebo II. Teos asked Spartan military leader Agesilaus and Athenian general Chabrias to support him. Agesilaus, however, said he was sent to aid Egypt and not to wage war against it. Chabrias returned home with his mercenaries. Teos decided to flee to the Achaemenid court, where he ultimately died of natural causes. Nectanebo contended with an unnamed pretender to the throne from the town of Mendes, who proclaimed himself pharaoh. The revolt was probably led by one of the descendants of Nepherites I, whose family had ruled the town before. The claimant sent messengers to Agesilaus in an attempt to persuade Agesilaus to his side. Agesilaus remained loyal to Nectanebo, fearing to become a turncoat. At one of the towns in the Nile Delta, the troops of Nectanebo and Agesilaus were besieged by the usurper, who had gained many sympathisers. Despite the enemy's numerical superiority, Nectanebo and Agesilaus were victorious and the revolt was put down in the fall of 360 BC. Acknowledging Agesilaus, Nectanebo sent him 220 talents of gold. Reign Egyptian gold stater of Nectanebo II. The design on the reverse consists of Egyptian hieroglyphs meaning ‚Äúgood gold‚Äù: pectoral necklace (nub = ‚Äúgold‚Äù) crossing horizontally over a windpipe and heart (nefer = ‚Äúgood‚Äù).\\"It is worth noting that a series of gold staters apparently issued by Tachos' successor, Nectanebo II (361/60-343) bear hieroglyphs meaning \\"good gold\\" (nefer nub)\\" in Religion played an important part in Nectanebo's domestic policy. He began his reign by officiating over the funeral of an Apis bull in Memphis. There, Nectanebo added a relief decoration to the eastern and western temples of Apis.My≈õliwiec, p. 171 Among notable sanctuaries erected under Nectanebo II are a temple of Khnum in Abu and a temple of Amun at Sekhtam. He also dedicated a diorite naos to Anhur-Shu (a fragment of it was found in the temples of Tjebnutjer). Nectanebo II was responsible for the increasing popularity of the Buchis cult. Under Nectanebo II a decree forbidding stone quarrying in the so-called \\"Mysterious Mountains\\" in Abydos was issued. Foreign affairs under Nectanebo II were thwarted by repeated Achaemenid attempts to reoccupy Egypt. Before the accession of Nectanebo II to the throne, the Persians attempted to reclaim Egypt in 385, 383, and 373 BC. Nectanebo used the peace to build up a new army and employed Greek mercenaries, which was a common practice at the time. In about 351 BC, the Achaemenid Empire embarked on a new attempt to reclaim Egypt. After a year of fighting, Nectanebo and his allied generals, and Lamius of Sparta, managed to defeat the Achaemenids. Having scored a resounding victory, Nectanebo II was acclaimed \\"Nectanebo the divine falcon\\" by his people, and cults were set up in his name. In 345/44 BC, Nectanebo supported the Phoenician rebellion against the Achaemenid Empire, led by the king of Sidon, Tennes, and dispatched military aid in the form of 4000 Greek mercenaries, led by Mentor of Rhodes. However, having heard of the approach of the forces of Artaxerxes III, Mentor opened communication with the Persians in collusion with Tennes. Saqqara, Sarcophagus of Nectanebo II, which he never used since he fled to the south. British Museum At the end of 344 BC, ambassadors of Artaxerxes III arrived in Greece, asking for the Greeks' participation in a campaign against Egypt.Dandamaev, p. 309 Athens and Sparta treated the ambassadors with courtesy, but refrained from committing to an alliance against Egypt. Other cities, however, decided to support the Persians: Thebes sent 1000 hoplites and Argos 3000. In the winter of 343 BC, Artaxerxes set off for Egypt. The Egyptian army, headed by Nectanebo, consisted of 60,000 Egyptians, 20,000 Libu, and as many Greek mercenaries.Dandamaev, p. 310 In addition, Nectanebo had a number of flat-bottomed boats intended to prevent an enemy from entering the Nile mouths. The vulnerable points along his Mediterranean sea border and east boundary were protected by strongholds, fortifications and entrenched camps. Persian forces were strengthened by Mentor and his men, well acquainted with the eastern border of Egypt, and by 6000 Ionians. Nectanebo II was ultimately defeated and, in the summer of 342 BC, Artaxerxes entered MemphisBrosius, p. 30 and installed a satrap. Nectanebo fled to Upper Egypt and finally to Nubia, where he was granted asylum. He, however, preserved a degree of power there for some time. With the help of Khabash, Nectanebo made a vain attempt to regain the throne.My≈õliwiec, p. 177 Black siltstone obelisk of Pharaoh Nectanebo II. According to the vertical inscriptions he set up this obelisk at the doorway of the sanctuary of Thoth, the Twice-Great, Lord of Hermopolis. Today, it is located in the British Museum, London. Legacy =Building campaigns= Though placed in an unfortunate period of Egyptian history, and with his legacy perhaps marred by being \\"the last pharaoh\\" to rule an autonomous Egypt, Nectanebo was an extensive builder, likely on a scale that would equal many kings of the glory days of the New Kingdom. References to either Nectanebo II or his grandfather have been found almost ubiquitously at the premier religious centres, and the piety of the two kings matched those of the great kings of the past, attested to by the numerous monuments across Egypt bearing their names. Nectanebo II, specifically, built and improved temples across the country, and he donated extensively to the priesthoods of the plethora of sites which he donated to. Nectanebo's name has been found at Heliopolis, Athribis, and Bubastis in the Nile Delta, among other places, but he built most extensively at Sebennytos, including the modern site of Behbeit El Hagar. The reliefs of the temples at Sebennytos would leave a distinct mark on the art of the later Ptolemaic Kingdom. The religious focus of his building campaigns, however, may not be solely due to sheer piety; because Nectanebo was an usurper, he likely sought to legitimise his rule over Egypt religiously. =Nectanebo and the Alexander Romance= There is an apocryphal tale appearing in the pseudo-historical Alexander romance that details another end for the last native pharaoh. Soon after Alexander the Great's godhood was confirmed by the Libyan Sibyl of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa Oasis, a rumor was begun that Nectanebo II, following defeat in his last battle, did not travel to Nubia but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. There, while Philip was away on campaign, Nectanebo convinced Philip's wife Olympias that Amun was to come to her and that they would father a son. Nectanebo, disguising himself as Amun, slept with Olympias and from this event came Alexander. This myth would hold strong appeal for the Egyptians, who desired continuity and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule. In art of this event, Nectanebo is usually depicted as having dragon-like features, for example in the Speculum Historiale. Papyrus of the Dream of Nectanebo, ca. 160‚Äì150 BC In the early Ptolemaic tale of Nectanebo and Petesis, preserved only in a Greek fragment from the Memphis Serapeum, the pharaoh has a prophetic dream of Isis in which the god Onuris is angry with him because of his unfinished temple in Sebennytos. Nectanebo calls in the best sculptor of the realm, Petesis, to finish the job, but he bungles his assignment when he gets drunk and chases a beautiful girl instead. The narrative ends abruptly here, but this is probably the preface to the fall of Egypt. Al-Biruni's A History of India reproduces the story.

Two of the many drivers looked at on the show include Casey Atwood and David Stremme. The show premiered in February 2004, and was a replacement for the failed Inside NBS, which was cancelled after just one season.  Seasons  Season 1: Featured teams were FitzBradshaw Racing, Braun Racing, and Akins Motorsports (as well as their drivers, including Tim Fedewa, Kasey Kahne, David Stremme, and Casey Atwood). Season 2: The teams remained the same, however Fedewa, Atwood, and Kahne were not featured. Stremme moved from FBR to Braun after previous driver Shane Hmiel's ban from the sport. Jason Leffler, A. J. Foyt IV, and Joel Kauffman were part of the show in the latter part of season 2. Season 3: Attempting to capitalize on the rookie hype for the 2006 season, NBS 24/7 changed its name to NBS 24/7: The Rookies, again traveled with FitzBradshaw Racing and Akins Motorsports, but this time covered their rookies, Kauffman and Foyt. The show also looked at the other 2006 Busch ROTY contenders (including Danny O'Quinn Jr., Todd Kluever, and Burney Lamar). On June 19, 2006, the show aired its final episode.

He was the son of the founder of the dynasty Teti and ascended the throne only after the brief intervening reign of the shadowy Userkare. His mother was Queen Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas, final ruler of the preceding Fifth Dynasty. Pepi I, who had at least six queens, was succeeded by son Merenre Nemtyemsaf I with whom he may have shared power in a coregency at the very end of his reign. In turn, Merenre was succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare, who might also have been a son of Pepi I. Several difficulties accumulated during Pepi's five decades on the throne, starting with the possible murder of his father and the ensuing reign of Userkare. Later, likely after his twentieth year of reign, Pepi faced a harem conspiracy hatched by one of his queens who may have tried to have her son designated heir to the throne, and possibly yet another conspiracy involving his vizier at the end of his reign. Confronted with the protracted decline of pharaonic power at the expense of emerging dynasties of local officials, Pepi reacted with a vast architectural program involving the construction of temples dedicated to local gods and numerous chapels for his own cult throughout Egypt, thereby reinforcing his presence in the provinces. Egypt's prosperity allowed Pepi to become the most prolific builders of the Old Kingdom. At the same time, Pepi favored the rise of small provincial centers and recruited officials from non-noble extraction in order to curtail the influence of powerful local families. Continuing Teti's policy, Pepi largely expanded a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected. Finally, he buttressed his power after the harem conspiracy by forming alliances with Khui, the provincial nomarch of Abydos, marrying two of his daughters Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II and making Khui's wife Nebet and her son Djau both viziers. The Egyptian state's external policy under Pepi comprised military campaigns against Nubia, Sinai and the southern Levant, landing troops on the Levantine coast using Egyptian transport boats. Trade with Byblos, Ebla and the oases of the Western Desert flourished while Pepi launched mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and further afield. Pepi had a pyramid complex built for his funerary cult in Saqqara, next to which he built at least a further six pyramids for his queens. Pepi's pyramid, which originally stood tall, and accompanying high temple followed the standard layout inherited from the late Fifth Dynasty. The walls of Pepi I's burial chamber, antechamber and much of the corridor leading to it are covered with the most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom. For the first time, these texts also appear in some of the queens' pyramids. Excavations revealed a bundle of viscera and a mummy fragment, both presumed to belong to the pharaoh. Pepi's complex, called Pepi Mennefer, remained the focus of his funerary cult well into the Middle Kingdom and ultimately gave its name to the nearby capital of Egypt, Memphis. Pepi's cult stopped early in the Second Intermediate Period. The Sixth Dynasty necropolis at Saqqara was used as a stone quarry from the New Kingdom up until the end of the Late Period with the dismantling of the necropolis' monuments resuming later in the Mamluk era of the Middle Ages when most of Pepi's pyramid complex was destroyed. Family =Parents= Pepi was the son of pharaoh Teti and Queen Iput. The latter parentage is directly attested by a relief on a decree uncovered in Koptos which mentions Iput as Pepi's mother and by inscriptions in her pyramid to the same effect and her mention as being Pepi's mother on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals. In addition, she bore the title of \\"king's mother\\" and her tomb, originally a mastaba, was transformed into a pyramid during Pepi's reign. Iput may have been a daughter of Unas, the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, although this remains uncertain and debated. She seems to have died before Pepi's accession to the throne. The observation that Teti was most likely Pepi's father follows from the location of Iput's tomb, next to Teti's pyramid as was customary for a queen consort. =Consorts= Ankhesenpepi II shown on a relief from her mortuary temple, Imhotep Museum Six consorts of Pepi I have been identified with near certainty by Egyptologists. Pepi's best-attested wives were Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II, who both bore future pharaohs and were daughters of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife Nebet. Further queens are Nubwenet, Inenek-Inti who became a vizier of Pepi, and Mehaa (also called Haaheru). All were buried in pyramids adjacent to that of Pepi. Another consort, Sebwetet, is mentioned on relief fragments from the necropolis surrounding Pepi's pyramid. Two more queens have been proposed for Pepi I based on partial evidence. First is a Queen Nedjeftet, whose name is recorded on blocks excavated in the necropolis adjacent to Pepi's pyramid. The identification of Nedjeftet as Pepi's consort remains uncertain owing to the lack of inscriptions explicitly naming her husband. Given the location of Nedjeftet's blocks in the necropolis, she may be the owner of a pyramid west of Pepi's. Second is another queen, named Behenu, who was buried in the second largest queen pyramid of the necropolis of Pepi, north of his. She could either be one of his consorts or a wife of Pepi II. A final unnamed queen, only referred to by her title \\"Weret-Yamtes\\", is known from the inscriptions uncovered in the tomb of Weni, an official serving Pepi. This queen, whose name is purposefully left unmentioned by Weni, conspired against Pepi and was prosecuted when the conspiracy was discovered. =Children= Pepi fathered at least four sons. Ankhesenpepi I in all likelihood bore him the future pharaoh Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Ankhesenpepi II was the mother of Pepi II Neferkare, who was likely born at the very end of Pepi I's reign given that he was only 6 upon ascending the throne after Merenre's rule. While this hypothesis is favored by the majority of Egyptologists an alternative one holds that Pepi II could be a son of Merenre. Another son of Pepi I was Teti-ankh, meaning \\"Teti lives\\", whose mother is yet to be identified. Teti-ankh is known only from an ink inscription bearing his name discovered in Pepi's pyramid. Buried nearby is Prince Hornetjerkhet, a son of Pepi with Queen Mehaa. At least three daughters of Pepi I have been tentatively identified, all future wives of Pepi II. The first, Meritites IV, was the king's eldest daughter and was buried in the necropolis surrounding her father's pyramid. The second is Neith, whom he fathered with Queen Ankhesenpepi I. She may have been the mother of Pepi II's successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II. The third is Iput II, whose identity as Pepi's daughter remains uncertain because her title of \\"daughter of the king\\" may only be honorary. Chronology = Relative chronology = Pepi I's cartouche reading \\"Meryre\\" on the Abydos King List The relative chronology of Pepi I's reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidence, which agree that he succeeded Userkare and was succeeded by Merenre I Nemtyemsaf. For example, the near-contemporary South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal inscribed during the reign of Pepi II, gives the succession \\"Teti ‚Üí Userkare ‚Üí Pepi I ‚Üí Merenre I\\", making Pepi the third king of the Sixth Dynasty. Two more historical sources agree with this chronology: the Abydos king list, written under Seti I and which gives Pepi I's cartouche on the 36th entry between those of Userkare and Merenre, and the Turin canon, a list of kings on papyrus dating to the reign of Ramses II which records Pepi I on the fourth column, third row. Historical sources against this order of succession include the Aegyptiaca (Œë·º∞Œ≥œÖœÄœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283 ‚Äì 246 BC) by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession \\"Otho√™s ‚Üí Phius ‚Üí Methusuphis\\" at the start of the Sixth Dynasty. Otho√™s, Phius (in Greek, œÜŒπœåœÇ), and Methusuphis are understood to be the Hellenized forms for Teti, Pepi I and Merenre, respectively, which means that the Aegyptiaca omits Userkare. Manetho's reconstruction of the early Sixth Dynasty is in agreement with the Karnak king list written under Thutmosis III. The list gives Pepi's birth name immediately after that of Teti on the second row, 7th entry of the row. Unlike other sources such as the Turin canon, the purpose of the Karnak king list was not to be exhaustive but rather to list a selection of royal ancestors to be honored. Similarly the Saqqara Tablet, written under Ramses II, omits Userkare, with Pepi's name given on the 25th entry after that of Teti. =Length of reign= Alabaster statuette of Pepi I dressed for the Sed Festival, Brooklyn Museum Pepi I's length of reign remains somewhat uncertain, although the consensus is that he ruled over Egypt for around five decades, probably 49 or 50 years. During the Old Kingdom period, the Egyptians counted years since the beginning of the reign of the current king. These years were referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the start of the reign. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This involved counting cattle, oxen and small livestock. During the early Sixth Dynasty, this count was probably biennial, that is occurring every two years. The South Saqqara Stone as well as an inscription in Hatnub both record the 25th cattle count under Pepi I, his highest known date. Accepting a biennial count, this indicates that Pepi reigned 49 years. That a 50th year of reign could have also been recorded on the royal annal cannot be discounted however, due to damaged state of the South Saqqara Stone. Another historical source supporting such a long reign is Africanus' epitome of Manetho's Aegyptiaca, which credits Pepi I with a long reign of 53 years. Archaeological evidence in favor of a long reign for Pepi I include his numerous building projects and many surviving objects made in celebration his first Sed festival. For example, numerous ointment alabaster vessels celebrating Pepi's first Sed festival have been discovered. They bear a standard inscriptions reading \\"The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Meryre, may he be given life for ever. The first occasion of the Sed festival\\". Examples can now be found in museums throughout the world: File:Pepi I.jpgalt=Photograph of a small white vase with black hieroglyphs on itMus√©e du Louvre File:Egyptian - Jubilee Vessel of Pepi I - Walters 4128.jpgalt=Large white vessel inscribed with black hieroglyphsWalters Art Museum File:Ointment jar inscribed with the name of Pepi I MET EG112.jpgalt=White vessel with flat lid inscribed with hieroglyphsMetropolitan Museum of Art File:Vaso con el nombre de Pepi I (39647642763).jpgalt=Large white vessel inscribed with black hieroglyphsBritish Museum The Sed festival was meant to rejuvenate the king and was first celebrated on the 30th year of a king's rule. The festival itself had a considerable importance for the king. Representations of it were part of the typical decorations of temples associated to the ruler during the Old Kingdom, had the king actually celebrated it or not. Further witnessing to the importance of this event, the state administration seems to have had a tendency to mention Pepi's first jubilee repeatedly in the years following its celebration and up until the end of his rule in connection with building activities. For example, Pepi's final 25th cattle count reported on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals is associated with his first Sed festival even though it likely had taken place some 19 years prior. Reign =Political situation= Ascending the throne Kneeling Statuette of Pepi I, Brooklyn Museum Pepi's accession to the throne might have occurred in times of discord, as his father Teti is said by Manetho to have been assassinated by his own bodyguards. The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati has argued in support of Manetho's claim, noting for example that Teti's reign saw a significant increase in the number of guards at the Egyptian court, with these becoming responsible for the everyday care of the king. At the same time, the figures and names of several contemporary palace officials as represented in their tombs have been purposefully erased. This seems to be an attempt at a damnatio memoriae targeting three men in particular: the vizier Hezi, the overseer of weapons Mereri and chief physician Seankhuiptah. These men could therefore be behind the regicide. Pepi may have been too young to be king. In any case, he did not immediately succeed his father who was rather succeeded by king Userkare. Userkare's identity and relation with the royal family remains uncertain. It is possible that he served only as a regent with Pepi's mother Iput as Pepi reached adulthood, occupying the throne in the interregnum until Pepi's coming of age. Such hypotheses are supported by the apparent lack of resistance against Pepi ultimately taking the throne. Against this view however, Kanawati has argued that Userkare's short reign‚Äîlasting perhaps only one year‚Äîcannot be a regency as a regent would not have assumed a full royal titulary as Userkare did nor would he be included in king lists. Rather, Userkare could have been an usurper and a descendant of a lateral branch of the Fifth Dynasty royal family who briefly seized power in a coup, possibly with the support of the priesthood of Re. This hypothesis finds indirect evidence in Userkare's theophoric name which incorporates the name of the sun god Ra, a naming fashion common during the preceding Fifth Dynasty but which had fallen out of use since Unas's rule. Further archeological evidence of Userkare's illegitimacy in the eyes of his successor the absence of mention of Userkare in the tombs and biographies of the many Egyptian officials who served under both Teti and Pepi I. For example, the viziers Inumin and Khentika, who served both Teti and Pepi I, are completely silent about Userkare and none of their activities during Userkare's time on the throne are reported in their tomb. The tomb of Mehi, a guard who lived under Teti, Userkare and Pepi, yielded an inscription showing that the name of Teti was first erased to be replaced by that of another king, whose name was itself erased and replaced again by that of Teti. Kanawati argues that the intervening name was that of Userkare to whom Mehi may have transferred his allegiance. Mehi's attempt to switch back to Teti was seemingly unsuccessful, as there is evidence that work on his tomb stopped abruptly and that he was never buried there. For the Egyptologist Miroslav B√°rta (cs), further troubles might have arisen directly between Pepi and relatives of his father Teti. B√°rta and Baud point to Pepi's apparent decision to dismantle his paternal grandmother Queen Sesheshet's funerary complex, as he reused the blocks for his own mortuary temple. On the other hand, Wilfried Seipel disagrees with this interpretation of the blocks as having being reused by Pepi, he rather thinks the blocks bear witness to Pepi's foundation of a pious memorial to his grandmother. At the same time as he apparently distanced himself from his father's line, Pepi transformed his mother's tomb into a pyramid and posthumously bestowed a new title to her, \\"Daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\", thereby emphasizing his royal lineage as a descendant of Unas, last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Pepi chose the Horus name of Mery-tawy, meaning \\"He who is loved by the two lands\\" or \\"Beloved of the Two Lands\\", which Nicolas Grimal sees as a clear indication that he desired political appeasement in times of troubles. Similarly, Pepi chose the throne name Nefersahor, meaning \\"Perfect is the protection of Horus\\". B√°rta adds that Pepi's writing of his own name \\"Mery-tawy\\" is also highly unusual: he chose to invert the order of the hieroglyphic signs composing it, placing the sign for \\"Beloved\\" before that for \\"Two Lands\\". For B√°rta and Yannis Gourdon, this deliberate choice shows Pepi's deference to the powerful nobility of the country, on which he was dependent. Although there seems not to be a direct relation between Userkare's brief reign and one or more later conspiracies against him, these evidences suggest some form of political instability at the time. Turquoise cylinder seal of an official of Pepi I, \\"Sole companion, lector priest, who does what is ordered [...] privy to the secret(s) of the king\\" Policies and power play In a long trend that started earlier in the Fifth Dynasty, the Old Kingdom Egyptian state was the subject of increasing decentralization and regionalization. Provincial families played an increasingly important role, marrying into the royal family, accessing the highest offices of the state administration and having a strong influence at the court, while also consolidating their hold over regional power bases by creating local dynasties. These processes, well under way during Pepi I's reign, progressively weakened the king's primacy and ascendancy over his own administration and would ultimately result in the princedoms of the First Intermediate Period. Pepi seems to have developed several policies to counteract this, notably with the constructions of royal Ka chapels throughout Egypt, to strengthen the royal presence in the provinces. These expensive policies suggest that Egypt was prosperous during Pepi's reign. Small provincial centers in areas historically associated with the crown became more important, suggesting that pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty tried to diminish the power of regional dynasties by recruiting senior officials that did not belong to them and were loyal to the pharaoh. Some of these new officials have no known background, indicated that they were not of noble extraction. The circulation of high officials in key positions of power occurred at an \\"astonishing\\" pace under Teti and Pepi I according to the Egyptologist Juan Carlos Moreno Garc√≠a, in what might have been a deliberate attempt at curtailing the concentration of power in the hands of a few officials. Teti and Pepi I changed the organization of the territorial administration as well: many provincial governors were nominated, especially in Upper Egypt, while Lower Egypt was possibly under direct royal administration. Agricultural estates affiliated to the crown in the provinces during the preceding dynasty were replaced by novel administrative entities, the ·∏•wt, which were agricultural centers controlling tracts of land, livestock and workers. Together with temples and royal domains, the numerous ·∏•wt represented a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected. This territorial mode of organization disappeared nearly 300 years after Pepi I's reign, at the dawn of the Middle Kingdom period. In parallel with these developments, Pepi decreed tax- exemptions to various institutions. He gave such an exemption to a chapel dedicated to the cult of his mother located in Koptos. Another decree has survived on a stela discovered near the Bent Pyramid in Dashur, whereby in his 21st year of reign, Pepi grants exemptions to the people serving in the two pyramids of Sneferu: The Egyptologist David Warburton sees such perpetual tax exemptions as capitulations by a king confronted with rampant corruption. Whether they were the result of religious or political motives, exemptions created precedents which encouraged other institutions to request similar treatment, weakening the power of the state as they accumulated over time. The Sixth Dynasty royal annals, only a small part of which are still legible, record further activities during Pepi's reign, including the offering of milk and young cows for a feast of Ra, the building of a \\"south chapel\\" on the occasion of the new year and the arrival of messengers at court. Further offerings of lapis-lazuli, cattle, bread and beer are mentioned, for gods including Horus and the Ennead. Conspiracy Weni shown on a lintel from his tomb with Pepi I's pyramid Pepi Men-nefer mentioned on the top row of hieroglyphs, Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum. At some point in his reign, Pepi faced a conspiracy hatched by one of his harem consorts, only known from her queenly tile \\"Weret-Yamtes\\". Although the precise nature of her crime is not reported by Weni who served as a judge during the subsequent trial, this at least shows that the person of the king was not untouchable anymore. If the conspiracy happened early in Pepi's reign as proposed by Wilfried Seipel and Vivienne Callender, the queen concerned could have been Userkare's mother and Teti's wife rather than Pepi's. The majority of scholars however agree with Hans Goedicke's thesis that the conspiracy occurred after more than two decades into Pepi's reign. For Goedicke, the queen could have been the mother of Merenre. Nicolas Grimal and Baud see this as highly unlikely and outright extravagant respectively, as this queen's son would have been punished together with her. Rather, the queen might have unsuccessfully attempted to secure the throne for her son, whose name is now lost. Perhaps in response to these events, Pepi changed his prenomen Nefersahor to Meryre for \\"Beloved of Re\\", even updating the inscriptions inside his pyramid. This late change with Pepi incorporating the sun god Re's name into his own may reflect some agreement with the influential priesthood of Re. Around this time, Pepi married two daughters of Khui, the provincial governor of Abydos. This may also have served to counteract the weakening of the king's authority over Middle and Upper Egypt by securing the allegiance of a powerful family. For Baud and Christopher Eyre, this also demonstrates that by the time of the Sixth Dynasty, the concepts of family and power were still close, that is the bureaucracy had not replaced the family in the business of government. The political importance of these marriages is furthered by the fact that for the first and last time until the 26th Dynasty some 1800 years later, Khui's wife Nebet bore the title of vizier of Upper Egypt. Egyptologists debate whether this title was purely honorific or whether she really assumed the charge of vizier. Later, Khui's and Nebet's son Djau was made vizier as well. Pepi's marriages might be at the origin of a trend, which continued during the later Sixth and Eighth Dynasties, in which the temple of Min in Koptos was the focus of much royal patronage. This is manifested by the Coptos Decrees, which record successive pharaohs granting tax exemptions to the temple as well as official honors bestowed by the kings to the local ruling family while the Old Kingdom society was collapsing. End of reign: coregency The end of Pepi's rule may not have been any less troubled than his early reign, as Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced yet another conspiracy against him, in which his vizier Rawer could have been involved. To support his theory, Kanawati observes that Rawer's image in his tomb has been desecrated, with his name, hands and feet chiselled off, while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepi's reign on stylistic grounds. Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else designated heir to the throne at the expense of Merenre. As a consequence of this failed conspiracy, Pepi I may have taken the drastic step of crowning Merenre during his own reign, thereby creating the earliest documented coregency of the history of Egypt. That such a coregency took place was first proposed by √âtienne Drioton and is indirectly supported by a gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as living kings, and the copper statues of Hierakonpolis, discussed below. Goedicke has further suggested that an inscription mentioning king Merenre's tenth year of reign in Hatnub contradicting Matnetho's seven years reign for this king is evidence that Merenre dated the start of his reign before the end of his father's reign, as a coregency would permit. The coregency remains uncertain however. The Sixth Dynasty Royal annals bear no trace either for or against it, but the shape and size of the stone on which the annals are inscribed makes it more likely that Merenre did not start to count his years of reign until soon after the death of his father. The Hatnub inscription may simply reflect an error on Manetho's part, which would not be surprising as he wrote almost 2000 years after Pepi's reign. Furthermore, William J. Murnane writes that the gold pendant's context is unknown, making its significance with respect to the coregency difficult to appraise. The copper statues are similarly inconclusive as the identity of the smaller one, as well as whether or not they originally formed a group, remains uncertain. =Trade, mining and military activities= Ebla's royal palace, destroyed c. 2300 BC The reign of Pepi I marks the apogee of the Sixth Dynasty foreign policy with flourishing trade, several mining and quarrying expeditions and major military campaigns. Trade and mining Much of the trade with settlements along the Levantine coast which had existed during the earlier Fifth Dynasty not only continued but seems to have peaked under Pepi I and Pepi II. The chief trade partner there might have been Byblos, where dozens of inscriptions on stone vessels showing Pepi's cartouches have been found, as well as a large alabaster vessel bearing Pepi's titulary and commemorating his jubilee from the Temple of Baalat Gebal. The high official Iny served Pepi during several successful expeditions to Byblos for which he was rewarded with the name \\"Inydjefaw\\" by the king, meaning \\"He who brings back provisions\\". Through Byblos, Egypt had indirect contacts with the city of Ebla in modern- day Syria. The latter is established by alabaster vessels bearing Pepi's name found near Ebla's royal palace G, destroyed in the 23rd century BC, possibly by the Akkadian Empire under Sargon. Trading parties departed Egypt for the Levant from a Nile Dela port called Ra-Hat, \\"the first mouth [of the Nile]\\". This trade benefited the nearby city of Mendes, from which one of Pepi's vizier likely originated. Further contacts with Canaan may be inferred from a statue of Pepi, which is said to have been unearthed in Gezer, but has since been lost. Expeditions and mining activities that were already taking place in the Fifth and early Sixth Dynasty continued unabated. These include at least one expedition of workmen and their military escort to the mines of turquoise and copper in Wadi Maghareh, Sinai, around Pepi's 36th year on the throne. In all likelihood, this expedition departed Egypt from the Red Sea coast port of Ayn Soukhna, which was active during Pepi's reign. The same port may also have been the origin of an expedition to the southern Red Sea, possibly to Punt, as witnessed by Ethiopian obsidian discovered on the site. There was also one or more expeditions to Hatnub, where alabaster was extracted at least once in Pepi's 49th year of reign, as well as visits to the Gebel el-Silsila and Sehel Island. A trading expedition fetching lapis-lazuli and lead or tin may also have passed further south through Mirgissa. Greywacke and siltstone for building projects originated from quarries of the Wadi Hammamat, where Pepi I is mentioned in some eighty graffiti. At the same time, an extensive network of caravan routes traversed Egypt's Western Desert, for example from Abydos to the Kharga Oasis and from there to the Dakhla and Selima Oases. Military campaigns Autobiography of Weni, now at the Egyptian Museum Militarily, Pepi I's reign was marked by aggressive expansion into Nubia. This is reported on the walls of the tombs of the contemporary nomarchs of Elephantine, by alabaster vessels bearing Pepi's cartouche found in Kerma and by inscriptions in Tumas. This is also directly attested by the Sixth Dynasty royal annals, which recount at least one campaign into Nubia. Although the campaign narrative is now largely illegible, according to the Egyptologists Baud and Dobrev it comprised three phases: first, messengers were sent to Nubia for negotiation and surveillance purposes; then the military campaign took place and finally a booty of men and goods was brought back to Egypt to be presented to the pharaoh. To the north-east of Egypt, Pepi launched at least five military expeditions against the \\"sand dwellers\\" of Sinai and southern Canaan. These campaigns are recounted on the walls of the tomb of Weni, then officially a palace superintendent but given tasks befitting a general. Weni tells how he ordered nomarchs in Upper Egypt and the Nile Delta region to \\"call up the levies of their own subordinates, and these in turn summoned their subordinates down through every level of the local administration\\". Meanwhile, Nubian mercenaries were also recruited and endowed with the power to enrol men and seize goods, so that in total tens of thousands of men were at Weni's disposal. This is the only text relating the raising of an Egyptian army during the Old Kingdom, and it also indirectly reveals the absence of a permanent, standing army at the time. The goal of this army was either to repulse and push-back rebelling Bedouins and Semitic people or to seize their properties and conquer their land in southern Canaan, an action possibly motivated by the intense commercial activities between Egypt and this region. In any case the Egyptians did invade their opponents up to what was probably Mount Carmel or Ras Kouroun, landing troops on the coast thanks to Egyptian transport boats. Weni reports the destruction of walled towns, cutting down fig-trees and grape vines and setting fire to local shrines. Building activities Ruins of Pepi I's Ka-chapel in Bubastis Pepi I built extensively throughout Egypt, so much so that in 1900 the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie stated \\"this king has left more monuments, large and small, than any other ruler before the Twelfth Dynasty\\". A similar conclusion was reached in 1999 by the Egyptologist Jean Leclant who sees Pepi's rule as marking the apogee of the Old Kingdom owing to the flurry of building activities, administrative reforms, trade and military campaigns at the time. Pepi's building efforts were mostly devoted to local cults and royal Ka chapels, seemingly with the objective of affirming the king's stature and presence in the provinces. =Ka chapels= Ka-chapels were small cult buildings comprising one or more chambers for the bringing of offerings dedicated to the cult of the Ka of a deceased or, in this case, the king. Such chapels dedicated to Pepi I were uncovered or are known from contemporary sources to have stood in Hierakonpolis, in Abydos, and in the central Nile Delta region, in Memphis, Zawyet el-Meytin, Assiut, Qus and beyond the Nile Valley in Balat, a settlement of the Dakhla Oasis. In addition, two chapels were built in Bubastis and likely more than one stood in Dendera,. Finally, yet another chapel is conjectured to have existed in Elkab, where rock inscriptions refer to his funerary cult. All of these buildings were likely peripheral to or inside larger temples hosting extensive cult activities. For example, the chapel at Abydos was likely next to the temple of Khenti-Amentiu. For the Egyptologist Juan Moreno Garc√≠a, this proximity demonstrates the direct power that the king still held over the temples' economic activities and internal affairs during the Sixth Dynasty. The smaller copper statue from Hierakonpolis, representing Merenre or a young Pepi I In an underground store beneath the floor of Hierakonpolis Ka-chapel of Pepi, the Egyptologist James Quibell uncovered a statue of king Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty, a terracota lion cub made during the Thinite era, a golden mask representing Horus and two copper statues. Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base, these statues had been disassembled, placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I \\"on the first day of the Heb Sed\\" feast. The two statues were symbolically \\"trampling underfoot the Nine bows\\"‚Äîthe enemies of Egypt‚Äîa stylized representation of Egypt's conquered foreign subjects. While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved. The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre: \\"who was publicly associated as his father's successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Heb Sed feast]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.\\" Alternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have proposed that the smaller statue may represent \\"a more youthful Pepy I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies.\\" =Temples= The close association between Ka-chapels and temples might have spurred building activities for the latter as well. For example, the Bubastis ensemble of Pepi I comprised a enclosure wall with, near its north corner, a small rectangular Ka-chapel housing 8 pillars. This ensemble was peripheral to the main Old Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess Bastet. In Dendera, where a fragmentary statue of a seated Pepi I has been uncovered, Pepi restored the temple complex to the goddess Hathor, with whom he seems to have particularly desired to be associated, using the epithet \\"son of Hathor of Dendera\\" on numerous vessels found throughout Egypt and abroad. In Abydos, he built a small rock cut chapel dedicated to the local god Khenti-Amentiu, where he is again referred to as \\"Pepi, son of Hathor of Dendera\\". Pepi also referred to himself as the son of Atum of Heliopolis, direct evidence for the consolidation of the Heliopolitan cults at the time. At the southern border of Egypt, in Elephantine, several faience plaques bearing Pepi's cartouche have been uncovered in the temple of Satet. These may suggest royal interest in the local cult. An alabaster statue of an ape with its offspring bearing Pepi I's cartouche was also uncovered in the same location, but it was rather probably a gift of the king to a high official who then dedicated it to Satet. In this temple Pepi built a red granite naos, destined either to house the goddess's statue, or a statue of Pepi I himself making the naos into yet another Ka-chapel. The naos, which stands high is inscribed with Pepi I's cartouche and the epithet \\"beloved of Satet\\". Pepi seems to have undertaken wider works in the temple, possibly reorganizing its layout by adding walls and an altar. In this context, the faience tablets bearing his cartouche may be foundation offerings made at the start of the works, although this has been contested. For the Egyptologist David Warburton, the reigns of Pepi I and II mark the first period during which small stone temples dedicated to local gods were built in Egypt. =Other projects= Further building activities may be inferred from the inscriptions in the tomb of Nekhebu, a high official belonging to the family of Senedjemib Inti, a vizier during the late Fifth Dynasty. Nekhebu reports overseeing the excavations of canals in Lower Egypt and at Cusae in Middle Egypt.  Pyramid complex and surrounding necropolis Calcite-alabaster jar mentioning the cartouches of Pepi I, the name of his pyramid complex and his first Seb festival, Neues Museum, Berlin. Pepi I had a pyramid complex built for himself in South Saqqara, which he named Men-nefer-Pepi variously translated as \\"Pepi's splendor is enduring\\", \\"The perfection of Pepi is established\\", \\"The beauty of Pepi endures\\", or \\"The perfection of Pepi endures\\". The diminutive name Mennefer for the pyramid complex progressively became the name of the nearby capital of Ancient Egypt‚Äîwhich had originally been called Ineb-hedj. In particular, the Egyptian Mennefer ultimately gave Memphis in Greek, a name which is still in use for this ancient city. Pepi I's mortuary complex was surrounded on its south-west corner by a necropolis built during his own reign and those of Merenre and Pepi II. The necropolis housed the pyramids of Pepi I's queens and their dedicated funerary temples. The tombs of Meritites and Ankhsenpepi III, both built after Pepi's reign, as well as tombs from later periods of Egyptian history in the necropolis are not discussed here. =Pyramid complex= Main pyramid Pepi's main pyramid was constructed in the same fashion since Djedkare Isesi: a core built six steps high from small roughly dressed blocks of limestone bound together using clay mortar encased with fine limestone blocks. The pyramid, now destroyed, had a base length of converging to the apex at ~ 53¬∞ and once stood tall. Its remains now form a meagre mound of , containing a pit in its centre dug by stone thieves. The substructure of the pyramid was accessed from the north chapel which has since disappeared. From the entrance, a descending corridor gives way to a vestibule leading into the horizontal passage. Halfway along the passage three granite portcullises guard the chambers. As in preceding pyramids, the substructure contains three chambers: an antechamber on the pyramids vertical axis, a serdab with three recesses to its east, and a burial chamber containing the king's sarcophagus to the west. Extraordinarily, the pink granite canopic chest that is sunk into the floor at the foot of the sarcophagus has remained undisturbed. Discovered alongside it was a bundle of viscera presumed to belong to the pharaoh. The provenance of a mummy fragment and fine linen wrappings discovered in the burial chamber are unknown, but are hypothesized to belong to Pepi I. The walls of Pepi I's antechamber, burial chamber, and much of the corridor are covered in vertical columns of inscribed hieroglyphic text, painted green with ground malachite and gum arabic, a color symbolizing renewal. His sarcophagus is also inscribed on its east side with the king's titles and names, as part of a larger set of spells that includes texts at the bottom of the north and south walls opposite the sarcophagus, and in a line running across the top of the north, west, and south walls of the chamber. The writing comprises 2,263 columns and lines of text from 651 spells of which 82 are unique to Pepi's pyramid. This is the most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom. The tradition of inscribing texts inside the pyramid was begun by Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, but originally discovered in Pepi I's pyramid in 1880. Their function, in congruence with all funerary literature, was to enable the reunion of the ruler's ba and ka leading to the transformation into an akh, and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky. Mortuary temple Fragments of the pyramid texts from Pepi I's pyramid in South Saqqara, now in the Petrie Museum Pepi's pyramid was part of a wider funerary complex comprising a small cult pyramid and mortuary temple surrounded by an enclosure wall. The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear as while it had a burial chamber, it was never used as such and must have been a purely symbolic structure. It may have hosted the pharaoh's ka, or a miniature statue of the king, and could have been used for ritual performances centering around the burial and resurrection of the ka spirit during the Sed festival. Excavations of the small cult pyramid yielded statue fragments, pieces of stelae and offering tables which indicate the continuation of Pepi's funerary cult into the Middle Kingdom. A valley temple located by the Nile and causeway leading from this temple up to the pyramid on the desert plateau completed the overall construction. The high temple, next to the pyramid, was laid out according to a standard plan, making it nearly the same as the temples of Djedkare Isesi, Unas, and Teti. The temple had an entrance hall some high, now almost completely destroyed, leading into an open columned courtyard. The hall was flanked by storage rooms to the north and south. The inner temple contained a chapel with five statue niches, an offering hall and other core chambers. Either the mortuary temple or the causeway, now both heavily damaged by the activity of lime makers, might have been lined with statues of kneeling bound captives representing Egypt's traditional enemies. The original location of the statues remains uncertain as they had been displaced, ready to be thrown into a lime furnace. =Necropolis= Pepi's mortuary complex was the center of a wider necropolis which comprised the tombs of the royal family and, further afield, those of the high officials of the state administration including a tomb for Weni. Pepi had pyramids built for his wives to the south and south-west of his pyramid. These were all located outside of the complex' enclosure wall but inside of an area delimited by a street to the west. Three of the main queens' pyramids were built in a row on an east‚Äìwest axis, each with a base side dimension of about . The owners of these pyramids were referred to by the Ancient Egyptians as the 'Queen of the East', 'Queen of the Centre' and 'Queen of the West'. alt=Map of the necropolis of pyramids, primarily the Queens pyramids Pyramid of Nebwenet The pyramid of the queen of the east belonged to Nebwenet, whose name, image and titles were preserved on a fallen jamb uncovered in the attached mortuary temple. The pyramid had a base of , making it similar in size to the other pyramids of the necropolis. On its northern face was a small mudbrick chapel, which hosted a limestone altar, now broken. The pyramid's substructures were accessed from a descending passageway leading first to an antechamber and, from there, to the burial chamber slightly to the south of the pyramid apex. This chamber yielded fragments of pink granite sarcophagus and pieces of inscribed alabaster. To the east was a serdab and the scant remnants of funerary equipment. Pyramid of Inenek-Inti Immediately west of the pyramid of the queen of the east was the pyramid of the queen of the center. The name, image and titles of this queen were inscribed on jambs and two high red-painted obelisks on either side of the gateway to the mortuary temple, establishing that Inenek-Inti was buried there. With a base of , the pyramid size and layout is similar to that of Nebwenet, with the exception that the burial chamber is located precisely beneath the pyramid apex. Fragments of a greywacke sarcophagus and pieces of stone vessels were uncovered there. Contrary to Ankhsenpepi II's burial chamber, that of Inenek-Inti had no inscriptions on its walls. Inenek's mortuary temple was much larger than Nebwenet's, surrounding her pyramid on its eastern, northern and southern sides. Inenek's complex also comprised a small cult pyramid, at the base, located on the south-east corner of the mortuary temple. Queen of the West West of Inenek's pyramid is that of the queen of the west. The identity of this pyramid's owner is preserved on an obelisk in front of her pyramid only as \\"the eldest daughter of the king\\". The pyramid had a base length of around , similar to those of Inenek and Nebwenet, and now stand tall. Entry into the substructure is gained on the north face. The burial chamber is located under the vertical axis of the pyramid. The location of the serdab is unusual, being to the south of the burial chamber instead of east. Substantial remains of funerary equipment were found inside, but none bore their owner's name: wooden weights and ostrich feathers, copper fish hooks, and fired-clay vessels. It has a hastily built mortuary temple, with an offering hall and a room with two statue niches. Relief fragments discovered depict scenes of processions and estates, along with an incomplete cartouche of Pepi I's name. Pyramid of Ankhsenpepi II View of the pyramids and temples of Ankhsenpepi II and III in the necropolis of Pepi I The pyramid of Ankhsenpepi II occupies the south-western extremity of the necropolis of Pepi I. With a base of , the pyramid once reached high making it the largest of the queens' pyramids. The funerary complex of Ankhsenpepi II was also the largest in the necropolis except for that of Pepi himself, covering an area of . It comprised a mortuary temple to the north of the pyramid as well as 20 storage rooms for offerings. The funerary complex of the queen had a monumental entrance with a granite frame, its lintel bearing the queen's name and titles being more than wide and weighing over 17 tons. A small chapel stood on the pyramid northern face, at the entrance of the substructures. The accompanying funerary temple was adorned with painted reliefs of which only scant remains have been found including a small scene depicting the queen and a princess on a boat among papyrus plants. The burial chamber housed a black basalt sarcophagus and its walls were inscribed with spells from the pyramid texts, until then the preserve of kings. Pyramid of Behenu With a base of , Queen Behenu's pyramid was of similar size and layout as the other queens' pyramids of the necropolis. Located on the western end of the necropolis, immediately north-west of Mehaa's tomb on which it intrudes, Behenu's mortuary temple was on the pyramid southern face with a cult pyramid on its south-east corner. The entrance of the temple, flanked with two granite obelisks, led to several rooms which once housed statues and offering altars, while a further 10 rooms served for storage. The burial chamber measured , its walls were inscribed with numerous spells of the pyramid texts. The head of a wooden statue of the queen as well as her opened basalt sarcophagus were unearthed there. Pyramid of Mehaa Pepi's consort Mehaa was buried in a pyramid on the south-west corner of Pepi's enclosure wall Directly adjacent to Mehaa's pyramid eastern face was her motruary temple, where a relief bearing the name and image of Prince Hornetjerykhet, her son, was uncovered. Mehaa's pyramid in intruded upon by the pyramid of Behenu, establishing that Mehaa was a consort of Pepi I early in his reign while Behenu lived in the later part of his rule. Legacy Steatite cylinder seal belonging to a land tenant serving in Pepi's pyramid complex =Old Kingdom= Pepi I was the object of a funerary cult after his death with ritual activities taking place in his funerary complex. Archaeological evidence show that these activities continued in the necropolis throughout the end of the third millennium BC until the Middle Kingdom period. This means that Pepi's cult continued during the First Intermediate Period, a period during which the Egyptian state likely collapsed, with limited, ponctual interruptions at times of important instability. As members of the royal family and high officials had continued to be buried in the necropolis next to Pepi's pyramid during the reigns of Merenre and Pepi II, including Queens Ankhsenpepi II and III as well as Pepi's daughter Meritites, Pepi's necropolis had grown and had attracted burials from the highest officials such as vizier Weni. Starting with the reign of Pepi II and subsequently, the necropolis also attracted burials from private individuals as well as popular devotion to him and his queens. This is primarily witnessed by the deposit of numerous offering tables throughout the site. =Middle Kingdom= The conquest of Egypt under Mentuhotep II seems to have interrupted all activities in the necropolis. These resumed towards the end of the Eleventh Dynasty, when the state-sponsored funerary cult of Pepi was renewed, albeit in a more limited form than earlier. At this time, private cultic activities seem to cease in the wider necropolis of Pepi, rather concentrating in Pepi's own mortuary temple, mainly around his statues, then accessible to important officials participating in the pharaoh's cult. Meanwhile, the abandonment of certain parts of the mortuary temple and of the queens' necropolis led to the installation of novel tombs. The most prominent of these was that of the high official Reheryshefnakht, who had a small pyramid complex built for himself directly in the midst of the tombs of the Sixth Dynasty royal family. The royal cult of Pepi I seems to have been terminated with the onset of the Second Intermediate Period. =New Kingdom= Head of Khaemweset, Altes Museum The New Kingdom period witnessed renewed private burials in the necropolis of Pepi, including in several rooms of his mortuary temple which were used as a catacomb at the time Yet no such tomb was found in the main room hosting the royal funerary cult suggesting continued use. The individuals buried in the necropolis belong to the lower ranks of Egyptian society as shown by the simplicity if not absence of funerary equipment, while those using the catacombs were richer. In parallel with these developments, the consequences of the long lasting cults of Old Kingdom pharaohs during the New Kingdom period is apparent in the Karnak king list. It was composed during the reign of Thutmosis III with the purpose of honoring a selection of royal ancestors. Several pharaohs of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty including Nyuserre Ini, Djedkare Isesi, Teti and Pepi I are mentioned on the list by their birth name, rather than throne name. For the Egyptologist Antonio Morales, this is because of popular cults for these kings which existed well into the New Kingdom and which referred to these kings using their birth name. Later, during the reign of Ramses II, some sort of restoration works of the Old Kingdom monuments took place in the Memphite area under the direction of Prince Khaemweset. Pepi's pyramid complex was among those restored, as shown by inscriptions left on- site by Khaemweset, even though it was actively being used for private burials at the time. Pepi I's necropolis was therefore probably in a ruined state at this point, the area with the queens' pyramids serving as a stone quarry, Khaemweset stating that he had found the pyramid \\"abandoned\\" and \\"recalled his proprietor for posterity\\". Progressively, the accumulation of burials in the passages leading up to the temple cult rooms blocked all access to it, demonstrating that Pepi's funerary cult had ceased. =Late Period= The stone quarrying activities, which during the New Kingdom period were limited to Pepi's necropolis and spared his mortuary temple, became widespread during the Late Period of Egypt with intermittent burials continuing nonetheless. Both the stone robbing and funerary activities stopped at some during the period and the necropolis was completely abandoned until the Mamluk period when the intense stone quarrying resumed.

XII, p.175 in Staffordshire, was an English nobleman and notable soldier during the Hundred Years War against France. Early life and family Ralph was born on 24 September 1301, the son of Edmund de Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford and Margaret Basset. Having lost his father at the age of seven, Ralph grew up in the midlands with his mother's relatives, including her second husband Thomas Pipe. He had his first experience of royal service, along with his brothers and stepfather, when he joined the retinue of Ralph, 2nd Lord Basset.Ralph Stafford, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Career Stafford was made a Knight banneret in 1327 and was fighting the Scots shortly afterwards. He supported the plot to free Edward III of England from the control of Roger Mortimer, which earned the king's gratitude. By the summer of 1332, he was a commissioner of the peace in Staffordshire and had served abroad on royal business, accompanying Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester. He was also still fighting the Scots, commanding archers at the Battle of Dupplin Moor on 11 Aug 1332 and on three further Scottish campaigns. He was first summoned to Parliament by writ as Lord Stafford on 29 November 1336 and continued to attend until 1350. His military career continued, accompanying King Edward to France in 1338 as an advisor and being present at the naval battle of Sluys on 24 June 1340. He also fought at the relief of Brest and the siege of Morlaix. He was captured at Vannes but was exchanged in time to negotiate a truce at Malestroit. On 6 January 1341, he was made Steward of the Royal Household but resigned that post on 29 March 1345 having assumed the office of Seneschal of Aquitaine, an English possession in France, where he stayed for about a year. He took part in the Gascon campaign of 1345 including the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, the siege of Aiguillon, from where he escaped prior to its lifting, a raid on Barfleur and the English victory at the Battle of Crecy, on 26 August 1346. He became one of the twenty-six founding members and the fifth knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. In November 1347, his wife's father died; they were able to take possession of his estates without paying the king's homage, an indication of the relationship between them. Ralph was now a very wealthy man, from his estates and from the many prizes from the French war. Edward III created a number of new peerage titles to honour his war captains and to mark his jubilee year. Ralph was created the 1st Earl of Stafford on 5 March 1350, with an annuity of 1000 marks. He now replaced Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster as the king's lieutenant in Gascony. He committed to serve with 200 men at his own expense with the expectation of this being doubled in March 1353 at the king's expense. The campaigns provided several captives that were ransomed, but were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the appointment of Edward, Prince of Wales to command. Even at the age of sixty, Stafford continued to command troops and act as a royal envoy, both in France and in Ireland in 1361, accompanying Lionel of Antwerp to try and restore English control. Marriages and children Around 1326, Stafford married his first wife, Katherine de Hastang. Katherine was the daughter of Sir John de Hastang, Knight, of Chebsey, Staffordshire. Ralph and Katherine had two daughters: *Margaret Stafford, married Sir John de Stafford, Knight, of \\"Broomshull\\" (Bramshall near Uttoxeter, StaffordshireWars of the Roses A Gazetteer- 2 By Michael Ryan JonesBranselle (Bramshall) is listed in the Domesday Book as a possession of Robert of Stafford (as tenant-in-chief) whose own tenant was \\"Bagot\\" (https://opendomesday.org/place/SK0633/bramshall/)Bramshall seems to have remained in another branch of the Bagot family as the estate of Sir John Bagot (c.1358-c.1437), MP, of Blithfield and Bagots Bromley, Staffs., centred upon Blymhill, Bramshall and Bagots Bromley (History of Parliament biog\\"The Erdeswyks had for many years been mesne tenants of Stafford family property in Bramshall\\" (biog.

Her parents filed a complaint with King Edward III of England, but the King supported Stafford's actions. In compensation, the King appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh the 1st Earl of Gloucester. Margaret de Audley and Stafford married before 6 July 1336 and they subsequently had two sons and four daughters: * Ralph de Stafford (d. 1347), married Maud of Lancaster, daughter of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Isabel de Beaumont in 1344.

While it has been supplemented by more technologically advanced methods of flight tracking since its introduction, it is still used in modern ATC as a quick way to annotate a flight, to keep a legal record of the instructions that were issued, to allow other controllers to see instantly what is happening and to pass this information to other controllers who go on to control the flight. The strip is mounted in a plastic boot called a 'strip holder' and placed with other strips in a 'strip board' which is then used as a representation of all flights in a particular sector of airspace or on an airport. The color of the strip holder itself often has a meaning. The strip board has vertical rails that constrain the strips in several stacks ('bays'). The position of the strip in the board is a significant part of the information of the strip board: approach and area controllers typically keep their strips in level/altitude order, whereas tower controllers use the bays to represent the ground, the runway and the air. Each bay might be further sub-divided using 'designator strips' and metal bars to allow even more information to be portrayed by the position of a flight progress strip. Other special strips can be used to indicate special airspace statuses, or to represent the presence of physical obstructions or vehicles on the ground. They may even be used to provide a quick reminder to the controller of other pertinent information, e.g. the time when night begins or ends. In some countries, flight progress strips have been replaced by computer displays. This is not always a problem-free transition, since physical strips have many characteristics that a computer system cannot replicate. In fact, the term \\"handoff,\\" which is used today to denote the computerized transfer of control of an aircraft from one sector to another, comes from the older technique of physically handing off the flight progress strip to the next controller to denote the transfer of responsibility. This technique is still used today within some control towers; for example, the ground controller may physically hand the strip to the local controller as the aircraft reaches the runway, or the local controller will drop the strip and strip holder down a chute to the departure radar controller in the room below, once the aircraft has been cleared for takeoff. A blank and a filled-out example of a US en-route flight progress strip There are many styles of progress strip layouts, but minor differences aside, a strip contains at least: *Aircraft identification (e.g. aircraft registration or a flight number) *Aircraft type as the relevant 4-letter ICAO designator (e.g. B744 for a Boeing 747-400) *Level (assigned altitude) *Departure and destination *At least one time in four figures (other times can be shortened to minutes only). Other information may be added as required. In addition a strip may be \\"cocked out\\", or offset, from normal alignment to highlight potential issues. This can be used either as a personal reminder or as a form of communication between controllers. For filed flight plans, strips are initially printed from a computer and often contain more information than this. Further information is then added by controllers and assistants in various colored pens to show the role of person making the annotation. For 'free-calling' aircraft (generally smaller aircraft transiting airspace), strips must be fully hand-written by the controller or assistant from information passed by radio. In some countries, strips have been replaced by electronic equivalents. These generally use touch-screens to show the flight information, while still trying to keep some of the physical aspects of paper strips and strip racks.

His nomen, theophorically referring to Nemty, was formerly read as Antyemsaf, a reading now known to be incorrect.  Biography  Merenre was a son of Pepi I and Ankhesenpepi I, and grandson of the female vizier Nebet and her spouse Khui. While Merenre Nemtyemsaf was once believed to have served as a brief co-regent to his father Pepi I Meryre before ruling in his own right, the publication of the South Saqqara Stone annal document in 1995 by Vassil Dobrev and Michel Baud shows that Merenre directly succeeded his father in power with no interregnum or coregency. The badly damaged document preserves the record of Pepi I's final year‚Äîhis 25th Count and proceeds immediately to the first year count of MerenreMichel Baud, Vassil Dobrev, De nouvelles annales de l'Ancien Empire √©gyptien. Une \\"Pierre de Palerme\\" pour la VIe dynastie, BIFAO 95 (1995), pp.23-92 Merenre shared his father's fascination with Nubia and continued to explore deep into the region. He also began a process of royal consolidation, appointing Weni as the first governor of all of Upper Egypt and expanding the power of several other governors. While he was once assumed to have died at an early age, recent archaeological discoveries discount this theory. Two contemporary objects suggests that Merenre's reign lasted slightly more than a decade. The South Saqqara Stone Annals preserves his Year after the 2nd CountBaud & Dobrev, BIFAO 95 (1995), pp.23-92 whereas Merenre's Year after the 5th Count (Year 10 if the count was biennial) is attested in a quarry inscription from Hatnub Inscription No.6, according to Anthony Spalinger.Anthony Spalinger, Dated Texts of the Old Kingdom, SAK 21 (1994), p.307 The same South Saqqara Stone - which was created during Pepi II's reign - credits Merenre with a minimum reign of 11 to 13 years, however (based on a strictly biennial count), which would increase Merenre's reign length from the more traditional figure of 5 to 6 years.Baud & Dobrev, BIFAO 95 (1995), pp.23-92 The British Egyptologists Ian Shaw and Paul Nicholson in a 1995 book raised Merenre I's reign from the traditional 6 year figure to 9 years.Ian Shaw and Paul Nicholson, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, London, 1995, p.220 However, they were unaware of the contents of the South Saqqara Stone which was published in the same year by Baud & Dobrev and shows that Merenre had a minimum reign of 11 years with no co-regency with his father, Pepi I. One must note that cattle counts were not always biennial; for example, 18 had been performed by the 30th year of Pepi I's reign. It is therefore entirely possible that Merenre ruled for fewer than 11 years. Sixth dynasty royal seals and stone blocks found at Saqqara demonstrate that Merenre's aunt, Queen Ankhesenpepi II, was the wife of both Pepi I and then Merenre himself. Since the South Saqqara Stone shows Merenre's reign intervened between Pepi I and Pepi II and lasted for a minimum of slightly over a decade, this indirectly indicates that Merenre I was actually Pepi II's father, rather than Pepi I as was traditionally assumed. Merenre's daughter was Ankhesenpepi III, the future wife of Pepi II.

It is a manual procedure that is recommended by national guidelines for breech presentation of a pregnancy with a single baby, in order to enable vaginal delivery. It is usually performed late in pregnancy, that is, after 36 gestational weeks, but preferably 37 weeks, and can even be performed in early labour. ECV is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) as a mode to avoid the risks associated with a vaginal breech or cesarean delivery for singleton breech presentation. ECV can be contrasted with \\"internal cephalic version\\", which involves a hand inserted through the cervix. Medical use ECV is one option of intervention should a breech position of a baby be found after 36 weeks gestation. Other options include a planned caesarian section or planned vaginal delivery. = Success rates = ECV has an average success rate of around 58%, between 40 and 64% depending on whether it is the mother's first child or not. (40 % for first-time mothers and closer to 60% for women who have had previous children. Various factors can alter the success rates of ECV. Practitioner experience, maternal weight, obstetric factors such as uterine relaxation, a palpable fetal head, a non-engaged breech, non-anterior placenta, and an amniotic fluid index above 7‚Äì10 cm, are all factors which can be associated with higher success rates. In addition, the effect of neuraxial blockade on ECV success rates have been conflicting, although ECV appears easier to perform under epidural block. Following successful ECV, with the baby turned to head first, there is a less than 5% chance of the baby turning spontaneously to breech again. Contra-indications Some situations exist where ECV is not indicated or may cause harm. These include recent antepartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, abnormal fetal monitoring, ruptured membranes, multiple pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, reduced amniotic fluid and some other abnormalities of the uterus or baby. Risks As with any procedure there can be complications most of which can be greatly decreased by having an experienced professional on the birth team. An ultrasound to estimate a sufficient amount of amniotic fluid and monitoring of the fetus immediately after the procedure can also help minimize risks. Evidence of complications of ECV from clinical trials is limited, but ECV does reduce the chance of breech presentation at birth and caesarian section. The 2015 Cochrane review concluded that \\"large observational studies suggest that complications are rare\\". Typical risks include umbilical cord entanglement, abruption of placenta, preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and severe maternal discomfort. Overall complication rates have ranged from about 1 to 2 percent since 1979. While somewhat out of favour between 1970 and 1980, the procedure has seen an increase in use due to its relative safety. Successful ECV significantly decreases the rate of cesarean section, however, women are still at an increased risk of instrumental delivery (ventouse and forceps delivery) and cesarean section compared to women with spontaneous cephalic presentation (head first). Technique The procedure is undertaken by either one or two physicians and where emergency facilities to undertake instrumental delivery and caesarian section are at hand. Blood is also taken for cross- matching should a complication arise. Prior to performing ECV, an ultrasound of the abdomen is performed to confirm the breech position and the mother's blood pressure and pulse are taken. A cardiotocography (CTG) is also performed to monitor the baby's heart. The procedure usually lasts a few minutes and is monitored intermittently with CTG. With a covering of ultrasonic gel on the abdomen to reduce friction, the physician's hands are placed on the mother's abdomen around the baby. Then, by applying firm pressure to manoeuvre the baby up and away from the pelvis and to gently turn in several steps from breech, to a sideways position, the final manipulation results in a head first presentation. The procedure is discontinued if maternal distress, repeated failure or fetal compromise on monitoring occurs. ECV performed before term may decrease the rate of breech presentation compared to ECV at term, but may increase the risk of preterm delivery. There is some evidence to support the use of tocolytic drugs in ECV. Given by injection, tocolytics relax the uterus muscle and may improve the chance of turning the baby successfully. This is considered safe for the mother and baby, but can cause the mother to experience facial flushing and a feeling of a fast heart rate. Use of intravenous nitroglycerin has been proposed. Following the procedure, a repeat CTG is performed and a repeat ultrasound will confirm a successful turn. Should this first attempt fail, a second attempt on another day can be considered. In addition, to prevent Rh disease after the procedure, all rhesus D negative pregnant women are offered an intramuscular injection of anti-Rh antibodies (Rho(D) immune globulin). History ECV has existed since 384‚Äì322 B.C., the time of Aristotle. Around 100 A.D., Soranus of Ephesus included guidance on ECV as a way to reduce complications of vaginal breech birth. 17th century French obstetrician, Fran√ßois Mauriceau, is alleged to have described ECV as \\"a little more difficult than turning an omelette in a frying pan\\". Justus Heinrich Wigand published an account of ECV in 1807 and the procedure was increasingly accepted following Adolphe Pinard's demonstration of it in France. In 1901, British obstetrician, Herbert R. Spencer, advocated ECV in his publication on breech birth. In 1927, obstetrician George Frederick Gibberd, reviewed 9,000 consecutive births around Guy's Hospital, London. Following his study, he recommended ECV, even if it failed and needed to be repeated and even it required anaesthesia. ECV's safety has continued to be a longstanding controversy. Following a protocol developed in Berlin, ECV did increase in popularity in the United States in the 1980s. The procedure has been increasingly considered as low risk of complications and its improvement in safety as a result of the routine use of electronic fetal monitoring, waiting until closer to term and the replacement of anaesthesia by tocolysis, has seen a recent resurgence.

The actual location of Endor is disputed. Endor (  Ω√änd≈çr, En Dor in the NKJV) was a Canaanite city, which is listed in the Book of Joshua () as one of the cities the Israelites didn't manage to dispossess, neither the city nor its dependencies.Schmidt, 1994, p. 208. It was located between the Hill of Moreh and Mount Tabor in the Jezreel Valley. It is mentioned twice more in the Hebrew Bible, in 1 Samuel and in Psalm 83. Etymology The original meaning of \\"Endor\\" is unknown and its spelling in Hebrew varies.Freedman, et al., 2000, p. 406. It may be connected with the words ein meaning \\"eye\\" and dor, meaning \\"generation\\". In the Bible Saul consults the witch of Endor, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld Endor was first mentioned in , when Endor fell within the tribal allotments of Manasseh. In , Saul consulted a medium or witch at Endor (),Walton, et al., 2000, p. 318. who lived in the village, on the evening before the Battle of Gilboa, in which he perished. According to , it was the scene of the rout of Jabin and Sisera after being defeated by Barak and Deborah in . Location The location of the ancient site of Endor is widely debated and many locations have been suggested. From the biblical accounts, an Endor that is located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley seems to fit best. The tribal allotments of Manasseh, Saul's journey to Endor and the defeat of Sisera's army all fit well with a location that is on this side of the valley, somewhere between Ibleam and Ta'anach. However, there are difficulties with this location. From the origin of the name, a spring must also be located somewhere near, and archaeological evidence from the time of Joshua, Judges, and Saul is required. Many suggested sites are located on the north side of the Jezreel Valley, near or on the Hill of Moreh. The main reasons for this placement are due to tradition and name preservation. The major difficulty in a northern location for Endor is that it does not seem to fit the biblical accounts well. The city lists in Joshua 17:11 and would be mentioning Endor out of logical order. In spite of this, a supporting factor for a northern site is that Saul had to be disguised as he traveled to the witch at Endor. This is usually attributed to the fact that Endor was behind enemy lines since the Philistines were camped at Shunem, just southwest of the most accepted Endor site. Those who hold to a southern site location explain the disguise as necessary not to transverse any enemy lines but to hide Saul's identity from the medium. Both explanations are possible. The following sites have been suggested: * Khirbet Jadurah: This site is located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley, but with no spring the site has been deemed incorrect. * Tell Qedesh / Tell abu Qudeis; This tell is a much better site than Khirbet Jadurah and it is located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley. It has two springs nearby, remains from the right time periods, and a walled city area. Proponents for a southern Endor usually hold to this as the correct site for ancient Endor. * Tell el-Ajjul / el-Ajyul / Agol (): This tell is located on the north side of the Jezreel Valley east of Nain, on the right of the road to Tamra. The small hill, on the east side of the Hill of Moreh, is 211 meters high. Archaeologists have uncovered tombs and a spring inside a cave. The spring was named Fountain of Dor after it was believed to be the ancient site of Endor. This site is distinct from Tell el-Ajjul in the Gaza Strip and the ancient village of Ajjul north of Jerusalem. * Indur, Endur, En-dor (): The Palestinian Arab town of Indur, depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, preserved the name of the ancient site.Negev and Gibson, 2005, p. 166. Excavations were carried out on Indur, but with no remains found at the site it was largely ruled out as being ancient Endor. * Khirbet Safsafeh / Es- Safsafa (): Many believe Khirbet Safsafeh to be the site of ancient En-dor, as reflected as being the site most normally marked on maps. This site is located northeast of modern Sulam/Shunem, south of Mount Tabor. Two wadis drain from this location, one to the northeast and the other to the northwest. During the Roman Period, there was a large population on the site. It was later inhabited by Arabs until they abandoned it in 1948 due to the war. After the war, Israelis settled it and named it Ein Dor. Tradition seems to be the best support for Khirbet Safsafeh. Since the 4th century CE, Endor has been recognized by early Christian pilgrims and by the Crusaders as Biblical Endor. During the Crusader Period it was mentioned by Brocardus, a 14th-century German priest. When Edward Robinson came upon the site, he described it as an ordinary village. C. Conder and H. Kitchener also recognized the site and described it as a small village. Name preservation also supports Khirbet Safsafeh as being ancient Endor for although the site itself does not preserve the ancient name, its nearby neighbor to the northeast, Indur, did. The modern village could have easily moved from the ancient site, taking the name with it.

History The word levee (from French, noun use of infinitive lever, \\"rising\\", from Latin levƒÅre, \\"to raise\\")\\"levee\\". Dictionary.com. Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. Accessed January 10, 2013. originated in the lev√©e du soleil (rising of the sun) of King Louis XIV (1643‚Äì1715). It was his custom to receive his male subjects in his bedchamber just after arising, a practice that subsequently spread throughout Europe. In the 18th century the levee in Great Britain and Ireland became a formal court reception given by the sovereign or his/her representative in the forenoon or early afternoon. In the New World colonies the levee was held by the governor acting on behalf of the monarch. Only men were received at these events. Women were presented in the evening at court. It was in Canada that the levee became associated with New Year's Day. The fur traders had the tradition of paying their respects to the master of the fort (their government representative) on New Year's Day. This custom was adopted by the governor general and lieutenant governors for their levees. The first recorded levee in Canada was held on January 1, 1646, in the Chateau St. Louis by Charles Huault de Montmagny, Governor of New France from 1636 to 1648. In addition to wishing a happy new year to the citizens the governor informed guests of significant events in France as well as the state of affairs within the colony. In turn, the settlers were expected to renew their pledges of allegiance to the Crown. The levee tradition was continued by British colonial governors in Canada and subsequently by both the governor general and lieutenant governors. It continues to the present day. As mentioned, the levee was historically a male preserve but during World War II levees were attended by female officers of the armed forces. Since then levees have been open to both women and men. Present day Rob Ford with Toronto Civic Employees War Veterans Honour Guard at the Mayor of Toronto's New Year's levee in 2011. Over the years, New Year's levees have become almost solely a Canadian observance, although kinds of levees still exist in other countries. Today, levees are the receptions (usually, but not necessarily, on New Year's Day) held by the governor-general, the lieutenant governors of the provinces, the military and others, to mark the start of another year and to provide an opportunity for the public to pay their respects. Most levees may be attended by any citizen, including children.Legislative Assembly of Alberta: New Year's LeveeRukavina, Peter: I Went to the Levee, 2004 Attending the lieutenant governor's levee is an annual ritual for some families. Today the levee has evolved from the earlier, more boisterous party into a more sedate and informal one. It is an occasion to call upon representatives of the monarch, military and municipal governments and to exchange New Year's greetings and best wishes for the new year, to renew old acquaintances and to meet new friends. It is also an opportunity to reflect upon the events of the past year and to welcome the opportunities of the New Year. The province of Prince Edward Island maintains a more historical approach to celebrating levee day. On New Year's Day, all Legions and bars are opened and offer moose milk (egg nog and rum) from the early morning until the late night. Though there are still the formal receptions held at Government House and Province House, levee day is not only a formal event. It is something that attracts a large number of Islanders, which is quite unusual in comparison to the other provinces where it has gradually become more subdued. Prince Edward Island levees begin at 8 a.m.2017 Charlottetown Levee Schedule The historic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake (the first capital of Upper Canada) holds a levee complete with firing of a cannon at Navy Hall (a historic building close to Fort George) The levee is well attended by townspeople and visitors. Toasts are made to the Queen, \\"our beloved Canada\\", the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans, \\"our fallen comrades\\", as well as \\"our American friends and neighbors\\" (this final toast would not have been made two centuries ago when the town was founded). Greetings are brought from all levels of government and it is a great community event. Some religious leaders, such as the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Ontario, hold a levee on New Year's Day. =Refreshments= As has the levee itself, refreshments served at levees have undergone changes (both in importance and variety) over the years. In colonial times, when the formalities of the levee had been completed, guests were treated to wine and cheeses from the homeland. Wines did not travel well during the long ocean voyage to Canada. To make the cloudy and somewhat sour wine more palatable it was heated with alcohol and spices. The concoction came to be known as le sang du caribou (\\"caribou blood\\"). Under British colonial rule, the wine in le sang du caribou was replaced with whisky (which traveled better). This was then mixed with goat's milk and flavoured with nutmeg and cinnamon to produce an Anglicized version called \\"Moose Milk\\". Today's versions of Moose Milk, in addition to whiskey (or rum) and spices may use a combination of eggnog and ice cream, as well as other alcoholic supplements. The exact recipes used by specific groups may be jealously guarded secrets. q.v. External links. Refreshments were clearly an important element in the New Year's festivities. A report of the New Year's levee held in Brandon House in Manitoba in 1797 indicated that \\"... in the morning the Canadians (men of the North West Company) make the House and Yard ring with saluting (the firing of rifles). The House then filled with them when they all got a dram each.\\" Simpson's Athabasca Journal reports that on January 1, 1821, \\" the Festivities of the New Year commenced at four o'clock this morning when the people honored me with a salute of firearms, and in half an hour afterward the whole Inmates of our Garrison assembled in the hall dressed out in their best clothes, and were regaled in a suitable manner with a few flagon's Rum and some Cakes. A full allowance of Buffaloe meat was served out to them and a pint of spirits for each man; the Women were also entertained to the utmost of our ability.'\\" When residents called upon the governor to pay their respects they expected a party.

Established during the late 1970s specifically to produce the AMX, the company initially comprised Italian aircraft manufacturers Alenia and Aermacchi. During the early 1980s, the Brazilian aviation company Embraer became a member of AMX International after Brazil's government opted to become involved in the project. The company's headquarters were located in Rome. The first Italian-assembled prototype performed its maiden flight on 15 May 1984; the first Brazilian- assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. Deliveries of production commenced during 1988; the final aircraft was assembled during 1999. History AMX International can trace its routes back to a decision taken during the late 1970s by two rival Italian aircraft manufacturers Alenia and Aermacchi to mutually cooperate in the development of a new ground attack aircraft. This enterprise had been stimulated by the release of a requirement by the Italian Air Force for 187 new-build strike fighters, primarily to replace its existing inventory of Aeritalia G.91s in the close air support and reconnaissance missions.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 289. Prior to their agreement to collaborate, both firms had already independently considered developing a similar class of combat aircraft. During April 1978, development work on the joint venture formally commenced.Braybrook 1989, p. 267. During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program in order to provide a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements for the aircraft; shortly thereafter, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks).Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 289.Gunston 2005, p. 27. There was no duplication of work, each component of the aircraft was built at one source only. The planned requirements were 187 aircraft for Italy and 100 for Brazil.Warwick 1981, p. 1544. A pair of AMXs in flight, 2010 A total of seven flight-capable prototypes were produced for the test program, three by Aeritalia, two by Aermacchi, and two by Embraer, as well as two static airframes. The first prototype, assembled in Italy, made its maiden flight on 15 May 1984. This first aircraft was lost on its fifth flight in an accident, resulting in the death of its pilot.Braybrook 1989, p. 275. Aside from this early loss, testing progressed smoothly and without further incident.Meitus 1992, pp. 223‚Äì224. The first Brazilian-assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. On 11 May 1988, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Deliveries of production aircraft to Italy began in 1988, the first examples were delivered to the Brazilian Air Force during the following year.Lambert 1993, p. 126. On 14 March 1990, the prototype two-seat AMX made its first flight.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 291. Despite the pooling of manufacturing work, Brazilian and Italian aircraft differ considerably in their avionics; Italian AMXs are equipped with various NATO systems which were considered redundant in the South American theatre.Warwick 1981, p. 1544. Furthermore, AMXs in Brazilian service are typically fitted with one of three pallet-mounted sensor packages, which contain various vertical, oblique, and forward-facing cameras, for performing the aircraft's secondary aerial reconnaissance role. A simple ranging radar is equipped for targeting purposes, however the specific radar also differs between both operators.Gunston and Gilchrist 1993, p. 290. While Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon on the port side of the lower fuselage, the United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30 mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.Lambert 1993, pp. 129‚Äì131.Jackson 1991, p. 135.

Drawn by one or two horses, a phaeton typically featured a minimal very lightly sprung body atop four extravagantly large wheels. With open seating, it was both fast and dangerous, giving rise to its name, drawn from the mythical Pha√´ton, son of Helios, who nearly set the Earth on fire while attempting to drive the chariot of the Sun. With the advent of the automobile, the term was adopted to refer to open touring cars, which were in consequence referred to as phaeton-bodied. Types Hooper Spider Phaeton (1860) The most impressive but dangerous phaeton was the four- wheeled 'high-flyer', the body of which consisted of a light seat perched above two sets of springs.Encyclopedia Britannica It was from one of these that the rising poet Thomas Warwick was thrown to his death near the fashionable town of Bath during the 1780s. Richard Polwhele, Biographical Sketches in Cornwall, Truro 1831, vol.1, p. p.44 There was also the heavier mail phaeton used chiefly to carry passengers with luggage and named for its construction, using \\"mail\\" springs originally designed for use on mail coaches. The spider phaeton, of American origin and made for gentlemen drivers, was a high and lightly constructed carriage with a covered seat in front and a footman's seat behind. Fashionable phaetons used at horse shows included the Stanhope, typically having a high seat and closed back,Science Museum, London and the Tilbury, a two-wheeled carriage with an elaborate spring suspension system, with or without a top. A variation of this type of a carriage is called a Victoria, with a retractable cover over the rear passenger compartment. Use Trooping the Colour in 2009 Queen Victoria was particularly associated with the phaeton and there are prints and photos of her driving in them both beforeCTG Publishing and throughout her reign. Its openness put her in danger and there were assassination attempts made on her life while in one by Edward Oxford in 1840 and by Henry Holford in 1846.Victorian Web In her later years she enjoyed travelling in a phaeton drawn by a single donkey or mule, and there are examples of this type in the Royal Collection.The Carriage Foundation Another was put to use by Queen Elizabeth II each June from 1978 to 2011 during the official Queen's Birthday celebrations, when she traveled to and from Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade in an ivory-mounted phaeton carriage made in 1842 for her great- great-grandmother, Queen Victoria.\\"Trooping the Colour (The Queen's Birthday Parade)\\" , The British Army official website A social statement of a different kind was made during the 1880s by Valerie, Lady Meux, who defied London Society by driving herself in a high phaeton drawn by zebras.

A bajadere was a temple dancer in the European vision of legendary India being popularized by the first translations of Indian classic literature into European languages. The European view melded all the world east of Suez into an exotic locale. The themes of \\"Die Bajadere\\" were drawn from the score of Strauss's first operetta, Indigo und die vierzig R√§uber (\\"Indigo and the Forty Thieves\\"), loosely based on the Arabian Nights, which premiered in 1871 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna. 'Die Bajadere' begins in the key of A major and has two complete sections in the same key before a brief Intrada heralds the Trio section of the work. The Trio section, in D major is heavily accented in the 1st part but is more lyrical in the second. After a general repeat of the same A major 1st part and its successive 2nd one, the polka proceeds into a frenzy, heavily-chorded phrase with an abrupt conclusion, all in the home key. The work has been performed at the Neujahrskonzert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra as recently as for the 2005 edition conducted by Lorin Maazel.

The party has campaigned against Pine Gap, Australian anti-terrorism legislation and the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005, Mandatory Detention and the Pacific Solution. The party also denies the existence of Anthropogenic climate change Craig Isherwood is the founder and leader of the CEC.Election 2013 - Craig Isherwood - SENATE  History  The original CEC was established in 1988 by local residents of the Kingaroy region of Queensland. CEC candidate Trevor Perrett won the 1988 Barambah state by- election in Queensland, after former Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke- Petersen resigned from State Parliament in 1987. However, Perrett switched to the National Party in December 1988. Members of the Australian League of Rights, an extreme right-wing group led by Eric Butler, tried unsuccessful to take over the new party. Its purpose was to lobby for binding voter-initiated referenda. By 1989, the CEC leadership was under the influence of the Lyndon LaRouche movement. By 1992, the CEC identified itself as the Australian branch of the broad international LaRouche movement. National Secretary Craig Isherwood moved the headquarters from rural Queensland to a Melbourne suburb, with direct communications links to LaRouche's US headquarters established. In 1996, then-Liberal Party MP Ken Aldred, was disendorsed by the Liberal Party after using parliamentary privilege to make allegations of involvement in espionage and drug trafficking against a prominent Jewish lawyer and a senior foreign affairs official, using documents that were later found to be forged, supplied to him by the CEC.Anitesmetic claims in parliament (including HANSARD transcript):  In the mid-2000s, the party found support from Muslim groups opposed to the detention of suspected terrorists by the United States at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2004, the CEC received the largest contribution of any political party, $862,000 from a central Queensland cattle farmer and former CEC candidate named Ray Gillham.\\"Fed: Latham gone but the money flowed to ALP, AAP General News Wire.

CEC was registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission on 27 June 1997 and deregistered on 27 December 2006.https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/ceca.htm The party was re-registered on 4 September 2017. The NSW Division of CEC was registered on 5 August 2004 and deregistered on 27 December 2006.Citizens Electoral Council of Australia (NSW Division)  Platform  The CEC has lobbied for \\"the establishment of a National Bank and State Banks for provide loans at 2% or less to agriculture (family farms), industry and for infrastructure development\\", launching a petition in 2002 to drive support with a full page advertisement in The Australian newspaper. In early 2008 the CEC started campaigning for a \\"Bank Homeowners Protection Bill of 2008\\", calling for legislation in the spirit of the Australian moratorium laws enacted in the 1920s and 1930s. The party follows the LaRouche line of climate change denial towards the theory of anthropogenic global warming, referring to fears of global warming as \\"Hitler-Nazi race science\\". The party espouses the claim that the Port Arthur massacre, in which Martin Bryant murdered 35 people and injured 37 others, was instigated by mental health institute the Tavistock Institute on the orders of the British Royal Family. and that the Australian Liberal party was founded by pro-Hitler Fascists. The CEC's policies have included introducing a national Glass-Steagall Act to \\"break up the banks\\", establishing a national bank, introducing a moratorium on home & farm foreclosures, constructing high speed rail and the Bradfield Scheme, joining China's Belt and Road Initiative, shutting down Pine Gap and opposing the existence of climate change among others.  Criticism  The Anti-Defamation Commission of the Australian branch of B'nai B'rith (an international Jewish organisation) has published a Briefing Paper with details of the CEC's alleged antisemitic, anti-gay, anti-Aboriginal and racist underpinnings. The document cites CEC publications and quotes former CEC members. The CEC in turn has published a response to the ADC's accusations and described the ADC \\"as a front for Queen Elizabeth's Privy Council, the ruling body of the British Commonwealth\\". This allegation, that there is a link between the ADC and the alleged power of the Privy Council, has been attributed to the fact that Sir Zelman Cowen, a former Governor-General of Australia and a member of the Privy Council, was a member of the ADC's board of advisors. Former members of the CEC and families of current members have accused the group of \\"brainwashing\\" members and engaging in campaigns involving \\"dirty tricks\\".Families fight back, Martin Daly, The Age, 30 January 1996; Dark side of the loons, Terry Sweetman, Courier Mail, 8 June 2001; Parents say candidate brainwashed, Adam Cooper, Australian Associated Press, 19 June 2001; and For example, former CEC staffer Donald Veitch has claimed that new recruits undergo \\"deprogramming sessions\\" and that recruits are probed for sexual peccadilloes. Veitch has stated: \\"The mind control operations commenced by Lyndon LaRouche in the USA in the mid-1970s are still being practised today within his movement in Australia\\".Veitch, Don, Beyond Common Sense ‚Äì Psycho-Politics in Australia, 1996  Electoral results  CEC members demonstrate outside an election meeting organised by the Australian Jewish News in Melbourne, September 2004. Aaron Isherwood (second from right) was the CEC candidate in the seat of Melbourne Ports at the 2004 federal election. Despite running in \\"almost every election of the past two decades\\" in no election has the CEC ever garnered more than 2% of the vote. At the 2007 federal election, the CEC's previous form continued. Its first preference votes in the lower house was 27,879 (0.22%), and 8,677 (0.07%) in the upper house, both results were 0.14% down from 2004. At the 2016 federal election, CEC fielded senate candidates in every state and the Northern Territory and seven candidates for seats in the House of Representatives.

The team's composition is a reflection of the New South Africa racial integration policies Racial integration, or simply integration, includes desegregation (the process of ending systematic racial segregation). In addition to desegregation, integration includes goals such as leveling barriers to association, creating equal opportunity regardless of race, and the development of a culture that draws on diverse traditions, rather than merely bringing a racial minority into the majority culture. Desegregation is largely a legal matter, integration largely a social one. Distinguishing integration from desegregation A white child and black child together at a parade in North College Hill, Ohio, USA Morris J.

Woods writing on the need for precision in journalistic language writes, \\"Integration happens when a monolith is changed, like when a black family moves into an all-white neighborhood. Integration happens even without a mandate from the law. Desegregation,\\" on the other hand, \\"was the legal remedy to segregation.\\"Keith M. Woods, Disentangling Desegregation Discourse , Poynter Online, February 3, 2004. Accessed March 26, 2006. Making almost the same point, Henry Organ, identifying himself as \\"a participant in the Civil Rights Movement on the (San Francisco) Peninsula in the '60s ... and ... an African American,\\" wrote in 1997, \\"The term 'desegregation' is normally reserved to the legal/legislative domain, and it was the legalization of discrimination in public institutions based on race that many fought against in the 1960s. The term 'integration,' on the other hand, pertains to a social domain; it does and should refer to individuals of different background who opt to interact.\\"Henry Organ, The true definition of integration, Palo Alto Weekly, August 13, 1997.

Peckham (November 8, 1838 ‚Äì October 24, 1909) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1895 until 1909. He was known for his strong use of substantive due process to invalidate regulations of business and property. Peckham's namesake father was also a lawyer and judge, and a representative. His older brother, Wheeler Hazard Peckham (1833‚Äì1905), was one of the lawyers who prosecuted Boss Tweed and a failed nominee to the Supreme Court. His other brother, Joseph Henry, died at 17.  Biography  Peckham was born in Albany, New York, to Rufus Wheeler Peckham and Isabella Adeline Lacey;National Cyclopaedia The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Volume 11; James. T. White and Company; New York, NY, USA; 1909, p. 410. his mother died when he was only nine. Following his graduation from The Albany Academy, he followed in his father's footsteps as a lawyer, being admitted to the bar in Albany in 1859 after teaching himself law by studying in his father's office. After a decade of private practice, Peckham served as the Albany district attorney from 1869 from 1872. Peckham then returned to private legal practice and served as counsel to the City of Albany, until being elected as a trial judge on the New York Supreme Court in 1883. In 1886, Peckham was elected to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. While sitting as an associate judge on the Court of Appeals, Peckham also served as a member of the Albany Law School Board of Trustees. His appointment to the New York Court of Appeals was the third position that Peckham had held after his father, who had also served as the Albany D.A., on the New York Supreme Court, and finally on the Court of Appeals until his death in the 1873 Ville du Havre sinking. Peckham was active in local Democratic politics, and served as a New York delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention. He was also a confidant to such tycoons as J. Pierpont Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John D. Rockefeller. Many believed these relationships predisposed Peckham to favor business interests while on the Supreme Court. Peckham's Supreme Court nomination Rufus Peckham's brother Wheeler was a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Grover Cleveland, in 1894. However, this nomination was caught in the middle of a political tug- of-war between Cleveland and New York Senator David Hill, and Wheeler was the second nominee of Cleveland's that Hill managed to block; Senator Edward Douglass White was instead confirmed to the Court. By the time another seat on the Court was vacant after the death of Howell Edmunds Jackson in 1895, Hill was weakened politically and Cleveland turned to Rufus Peckham, who was confirmed within six days on December of that year (by a Republican-controlled Senate) and took his oath of office in January 1896. Peckham remains the last Supreme Court Justice seated by a Democratic President when the Senate had a Republican majority. Peckham's stint on the Court has been called by many scholars the height of \\"laissez-faire\\" constitutionalism, during which the Court regularly struck down efforts to regulate labor standards and relations. Peckham's most famous opinion was in Lochner v. New York (1905), in which the Court invalidated a limitation on bakers' working hours to sixty per week as being contrary to the individual right to freely contract, and as being unnecessary to protect health or safety. In the same opinion, Peckham upheld other workplace regulations relating to baker's facilities that he did believe justified limitations on the freedom of contract. Peckham's grave at Albany Rural Cemetery Beyond Lochner, Peckham is perhaps best known for his expansive interpretation of the Sherman antitrust law, in which he saw the goal of protecting consumer welfare. His opinions on civil rights for African Americans are remarkable only for the abandonment of his usual antistatism in voting to uphold Jim Crow laws‚Äîthe most notable being Plessy v. Ferguson (1896), in which he silently joined the majority. On the other hand, he and Justice David Josiah Brewer were far more likely than any of their colleagues to vote in favor of Chinese litigants in the many immigration cases that came before the Court. Justice Peckham authored the landmark decision in Ex parte Young (1908), which held that a federal court may issue an injunction against a State officer to prevent the enforcement of an invalid State law. Peckham served on the Court until his death on October 24, 1909, at age 70, writing 303 opinions and dissenting only nine times.  Family and burial  He was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York, later to be joined by his wife, Harriette Maria Arnold (December 13, 1839 - July 25, 1917). They both outlived both of their sons: Henry Arnold (August 6, 1868 ‚Äì February 16, 1907) and Rufus W. Jr. (January 28, 1870 ‚Äì September 16, 1899). Mrs. Peckham was also the paternal aunt of heiress Dorothy Arnold, whose disappearance on December 12, 1910 was referenced, in 1928, as \\"the great search of the age\\" by United Press Associations (now UPI).UPI \\"Mrs. Arnold Dies With 18-Year Vigil In Vain\\"; The United Press, United Press Associations; The Pittsburgh Press; 31 Dec. 1928.

While Helprin's fictional works straddle a number of disparate genres and styles, he has stated that he \\"belongs to no literary school, movement, tendency, or trend\\".http://markhelprin.com/about Biography Helprin was born in Manhattan, New York in 1947. His father, Morris Helprin, worked in the film industry, eventually becoming president of London Films. His mother was actress Eleanor Lynn, who starred in several Broadway productions in the 1930s and 40s. In 1953 the family left New York City for the prosperous Hudson River valley suburb of Ossining, New York. He was raised on the Hudson River and was educated at the Scarborough School, graduating in 1965. He later lived in the British West Indies. Helprin holds degrees from Harvard University (B.A. 1969), and Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (M.A. 1972). Helprin's postgraduate study was at Princeton University and Magdalen College, Oxford, University of Oxford, 1976‚Äì77. He is Jewish-American, and he became an Israeli citizen during the late 1970s. He served in the Israeli infantry and the Israeli Air Force. Helprin is married to Lisa (Kennedy) Helprin. They have two daughters, Alexandra and Olivia. They live on a 56-acre farm in Earlysville, Virginia, and like his father and grandfather who had farms before him, Helprin does much of the work on his land. Novels, short stories and periodicals Helprin states that his literary creation \\"always starts with something very small\\". \\"I can sit down to write a story just by thinking of the first two words of a Scott Fitzgerald story: 'This Jonquil'‚Äîit's a woman's name. This always gets me in the mood to write. We create nothing new‚Äîno one has ever imagined a new color‚Äîso what you are doing is revitalizing. You are remembering, then combining, altering. Artists who think they're creating new worlds are simply creating tiny versions of this world.\\" His inspirations include Dante, Shakespeare, Melville and Mark Twain. His first novel, published in 1977, was Refiner's Fire: The Life and Adventures of Marshall Pearl, a Foundling. The 1983 novel Winter's Tale is a sometimes fantastic tale of early 20th century life in New York City. He published A Soldier of the Great War in 1991. Memoir from Antproof Case, published in 1995, includes long comic diatribes against the effects of coffee. Helprin published Freddy and Fredericka, a satire based on Prince Charles and Princess Diana, in 2005. In Sunlight and In Shadow was released in 2012, and has been described as an extended love song to New York City.interview with Mark Helprin by Scott Simon on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition Paris In The Present Tense was published in 2017. Helprin has published three books of short stories: A Dove of the East & Other Stories (1975), Ellis Island & Other Stories (1981), and The Pacific and Other Stories (2004). He has written three children's books, all of which are illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg: Swan Lake, A City in Winter, and The Veil of Snows. His works have been translated into more than a dozen languages. Helprin's writing has appeared in The New Yorker for two decades. He writes essays and a column for the Claremont Review of Books. His writings, including political op-eds, have appeared in The Wall Street Journal (for which he was a contributing editor until 2006), The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic Monthly, The New Criterion, National Review, American Heritage, and other publications. Controversy A 16 October 1992 article in the Wall Street Journal by Helprin is entitled \\"I Dodged the Draft and I was Wrong\\". Adapted from a speech he had given at West Point, he said his poor eyesight made him ineligible for service in the US military, but was no impediment to fighting in the Israeli Defense Force. Helprin wrote an op-ed published in the May 20, 2007 issue of The New York Times, in which he argued that intellectual property rights should be assigned to an author or artist as far as Congress could practically extend them. The overwhelmingly negative response to his position on the blogosphere and elsewhere was reported on The New York Timess blog the next day. Helprin was said to be shocked by the response. In April 2009, HarperCollins published Helprin's \\"writer's manifesto\\", Digital Barbarism. In May, Lawrence Lessig penned a review of the book entitled \\"The Solipsist and the Internet\\" in which he described the book as a response to the \\"digital putdown\\" heaped upon Helprin's New York Times op-ed. Lessig called Helprin's writing \\"insanely sloppy\\" and also criticized HarperCollins for publishing a book \\"riddled with the most basic errors of fact.\\" In response to such criticisms, Helprin wrote a long defense of his book in the September 21, 2009 edition of National Review, which concluded: \\"Digital Barbarism is not as much a defense of copyright as it is an attack upon a distortion of culture that has become a false savior in an age of many false saviors. Despite its lack of mechanical perfections, humanity, as stumbling and awkward as it is, is far superior to the machine. It always has been and always will be, and this conviction must never be surrendered. But surrender these days is incremental, seems painless, and comes so quietly that warnings are drowned in silence.\\" In May 2010, Helprin wrote an article which stated that China's military is \\"on the cusp\\" of being able to dominate Taiwan and the rest of the Far East.\\"Farewell to the China Station \\" Spring 2010 issue of the Claremont Review of Books Honors and accomplishments A Fellow of the American Academy in Rome and a former Guggenheim Fellow, Helprin has been awarded the National Jewish Book Award for Ellis Island and Other Stories and the Prix de Rome from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He is also a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy. In 1996 he served as a foreign policy advisor and speechwriter to presidential candidate Bob Dole. In May 2006, the New York Times Book Review published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to a short letter [from the NYT Book Review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages that asked them to identify the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years. Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin's Winter's Tale. In 2006 Helprin received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. This award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust. On November 8, 2010, in New York City, Helprin was awarded the 2010 Salvatori Prize in the American Founding by the Claremont Institute.

The medical center is a part of the Stony Brook Medicine Health System and is made up of four hospitals that include the Stony Brook University Hospital, Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook Southampton Hospital, and Stony Brook Eastern Long Island Hospital. SBUH is affiliated with the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Long Island's only tertiary care and a Level 1 Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center, the hospital is ranked as the 12th best in New York and 10th in the New York metropolitan area by U.S. News and World Report. The hospital campus also includes a rooftop helipad to better serve critical cases.  History  In November 2008, SBUH and Southampton Hospital announced that the State of New York approved a comprehensive alliance between the two health care facilities to bring new and strengthened clinical services to the South Fork of Suffolk County. Southampton Hospital was the third East End hospital (in addition to Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport) to affiliate with SBUH. As of January 2015, Stony Brook University Hospital and Southampton Hospital can move forward with a proposed affiliation agreement following a unanimous vote at the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees meeting in Albany. The two hospitals have been formally affiliated since 2008, as recommended by the Berger Commission Report issued by New York State Department of Health in 2006. In June 2020, Stony Brook University Hospital was the site of a bomb threat when 33-year-old Robert Roden walked into the emergency room armed with three explosive devices, a pellet gun and a hatchet; an FBI search of his house discovered Roden's bedroom was booby-trapped with explosives and contained numerous AR-15s. Roden was charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, second-degree criminal contempt, and two counts of third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance.

He was active as a producer from 1976 to 1999, and is considered one of the best of his era. His most successful productions are Slippery When Wet and New Jersey by Bon Jovi, Permanent Vacation, Pump, and Get a Grip by Aerosmith, The Razors Edge by AC/DC, and Balance by Van Halen, each of which sold at least five million copies. He was originally a trumpet player, then started a career as a record producer for Canadian rock band Prism. Fairbairn won the Canadian music industry Producer of the Year Juno Award three times. He produced albums for many well-known international artists such as Loverboy, Blue √ñyster Cult, Bon Jovi, Poison, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Scorpions, Van Halen, Chicago, The Cranberries, INXS, Kiss and Yes. His style was notable for introducing dynamic horn arrangements into rock music productions. Fairbairn died suddenly on May 17, 1999 due to unknown causes. Career =Early life and Prism= Fairbairn played the trumpet since the age of 5, as well as studying piano. Until the age of 16, he was a trumpetist in community groups. While in the 10th grade at Vancouver's Prince of Wales Secondary School, Fairbairn founded his first band The Spectres, managed by Bruce Allen, who would remain with Fairbairn through his career. In the early 1970s, Fairbairn started producing while he was part of the Vancouver jazz-rock group Sunshyne, in which he played both trumpet and horn. There he met bandmate Jim Vallance, who would go on to become one of the most successful songwriters in the music industry and an important music associate. After Vallance left Sunshyne in 1973, Fairbairn changed Sunshyne's format to blues-rock-pop. Fairbairn recruited guitarist Lindsay Mitchell, from Vancouver band Seeds of Time, as singer-songwriter and frontman. Fairbairn worked through 1974 to land a recording contract for Sunshyne, using demos of two songs written by Mitchell. By mid-1975, when Fairbairn could not close a record deal for Sunshyne, he approached Vallance for assistance. Vallance reworked the arrangements on the Mitchell songs and supplied three of his own at Fairbairn's request. One of the Vallance songs, \\"Open Soul Surgery\\" impressed an executive at record label GRT, who signed Fairbairn's group to a recording contract in 1976. Over the next year, Fairbairn produced an album using musicians from both Sunshyne and Seeds of Time (including himself). The newly-renamed band Prism released its debut album in 1977. The album reached platinum status in Canada, with sales in excess of 100,000 albums by 1978.1 Fairbairn himself, however, elected not to be a member of Prism, and is credited only as producer and as a session musician on the album, and he did not play with Prism in any live performances. Fairbairn produced Prism's next three albums, all of which went platinum or double platinum in Canada. In 1980, Fairbairn won his first of three Canadian music industry Producer of the Year Juno Awards for Prism's third album, Armageddon. =Loverboy= In 1980, while still working with Prism, Fairbairn started production work on the debut album for Canadian rock band Loverboy. The self-titled album Loverboy would be the first Fairbairn production to break through in the lucrative US market and launch Fairbairn's international success. Fairbairn's productions attracted a growing list of international artists to Vancouver's Little Mountain Sound Studios to work with him and his prot√©g√© Bob Rock. Over the next 5 years, Fairbairn's work on Blue √ñyster Cult's 1983 album The Rev√∂lution by Night, Krokus' 1984 album The Blitz, and Canadian band Honeymoon Suite's arena rock 1985 album The Big Prize continued Fairbairn's string of international hits. =Slippery When Wet= Fairbairn's biggest commercial success is Bon Jovi's Slippery When Wet (1986), which made him a top-rate international producer. The album has sold over 28 million copies worldwide. \\"Bruce Fairbairn was a trumpet player,\\" noted Jon Bon Jovi in 2007. \\"You couldn't get him on a guitar. And, for the first time, we were allowed to be us in the studio.\\" \\"I've been lucky enough to work with so many different talents,\\" Fairbairn noted, \\"but Bon Jovi may be the finest. There was record company pressure to deliver the hits, but they were a joy. People seem to concentrate so much on their success that they lose sight of how good these guys are.\\" =Permanent Vacation= His next major production, Aerosmith's 1987 album Permanent Vacation, was another international success and generated a series of hits including \\"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"Rag Doll\\". Steven Tyler said that Fairbairn was instrumental in the creation of the album and \\"helped relight the fire under Aerosmith\\". =Continued international success= In 1988, Fairbairn produced the Bon Jovi album New Jersey, which holds the record for the hard rock/glam metal album to spawn the most Top 10 singles, with five singles charting in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, selling over seven million copies in the United States. Fairbain also produced Aerosmith's follow-up, 1989's Pump, which had sales in excess of seven million and was widely acclaimed by critics, and won him another \\"Producer of the Year\\" Juno Award. In the 1990s, Fairbairn worked with a string of internationally influential hard rock acts. In 1990 he produced AC/DC's The Razors Edge, and Poison's Flesh and Blood. In 1993, he produced another Aerosmith commercial hit, Get a Grip, which racked up sales of seven million and solidified the band's growing representation as international media stars. Next, Fairbairn produced the Scorpions' Face the Heat and in 1995 Van Halen's Balance. Also in 1995, Fairbairn went to Vallance's Armoury Studios in Vancouver to work on Chicago's Night and Day: Big Band, and liked the studio so much he bought it from Vallance the following year.Fairbairn Lends Golden Touch to Kiss' 'Psycho Circus', Billboard. In late 1996, and through early 1997, Fairbairn produced INXS' 'comeback' album Elegantly Wasted which, while garnering mixed reviews, obtained sales that were higher than INXS' previous albums. Also, Fairbairn produced The Cranberries' To the Faithful Departed, and Kiss' reunion-album Psycho Circus. His last fully completed project was the Atomic Fireballs' Torch This Place for Atlantic Records in 1998, which Fairbairn described as \\"a return to my brass roots\\". Death and legacy During the mixing sessions for Yes' The Ladder, on May 17, 1999, Fairbairn was found dead by Yes singer Jon Anderson and Armoury manager Sheryl Preston in his Vancouver home. He was survived by his wife, Julie, with whom he had three sons: Scott, Kevin, and Brent. Bob Rock explained that, on the week Fairbairn died, the two were to travel to New York to meet Bon Jovi for another album together. A memorial, \\"A Celebration of the Life of Bruce Earl Fairbairn\\", held at the Vancouver Chan Centre, was attended by more than 300 people. Highlighted by reminiscences from close friends, the event included musical performances from Jon Anderson and Steve Howe performing the song \\"Nine Voices\\" from Yes' The Ladder sessions, as well as Tom Keenlyside, guitarist David Sinclair and finally, \\"Taps\\" played on Bruce's trumpet by son Brent.BRUCE FAIRBAIRN REMEMBERED In March 2000, Fairbairn was posthumously awarded the Canadian Music Hall of Fame Juno Award for his work. In his interviews concerning The Ladder, Fairbairn can be seen in short sections in the bonus material on Yes' Live at the House of Blues DVD.

Primarily organized by the Organisation of African Unity and the heads of state in the African Great Lakes region, the talks began on 12 July 1992, and ended on 4 August 1993, when the accords were finally signed. The Arusha Accords envisioned the establishment of a Broad- Based Transitional Government (BBTG),. which would include the insurgent RPF and the five political parties that had composed a temporary government since April 1992 in anticipation of general elections. The Accords included other points considered necessary for lasting peace: the rule of law, repatriation of refugees both from fighting and from power sharing agreements, and the merging of government and rebel armies. Agreements Of twenty-one cabinet posts in the transitional government, the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the former ruling party, was given five, including the Defence portfolio. The Rwandan Patriotic Front got the same number, including the portfolio of the Interior and the role of Vice-Prime Minister. The major opposition party, the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), was given four posts, including the office of Prime Minister, assigned to Faustin Twagiramungu. The Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party were each given three portfolios, while the Christian Democratic Party was given one. The Broad Based Transitional Government never materialized. Juv√©nal Habyarimana and the MRND stalled the negotiations. The Rwandan Patriotic Front was granted participation in the national assembly. It was agreed upon by both parties that RPF troops would not only be allowed to join the national Rwandan army, but make up at least half of the officer positions. The Accords also provided for establishment of a military composed of sixty percent government troops and forty percent from the Rwandan Patriotic Front. It was agreed that the transitional government and national assembly would be established no more than thirty-seven days after the signing of the Accords. The transitional period was limited to twenty-two months, after which general elections would be held. The delegations signed the protocol on 3 August 1993, and President Habyarimana and RPF president Alexis Kanyarengwe signed the following day. Impact Intended as a negotiation for the sharing of power between the rebels and the Rwandan government, the talks produced an agreement that favored the Rwandan Patriotic Front because of disagreements within the government. The government delegation was led by the opposition Foreign Minister, Boniface Ngulinzira (MDR), until President Habyarimana replaced him with Defense Minister James Gasana (MRND) in January 1993. The Arusha Accords stripped many powers from the office of the President, transferring them to the transitional government. In a speech on 15 November 1992, Habyarimana referred to the Arusha Accords as \\"scraps of paper\\" and ridiculed his opponents for shunning elections. According to Andr√© Guichaoua. this did not reflect opposition to the peace accords as such: The agreement moreover unsettled numerous soldiers who feared an overall demobilization as a consequence of the army merger provision in the agreement. This is a contributory factor in explaining the ensuing genocide the year after.D. Keen (2002) \\"Greed & grievance in civil wars\\", International Affairs, 88:4, pp. 762. On 5 October 1993, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 872, which established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). Its objective was assistance in and supervision of implementation of the Arusha Accords. The initial UN presence was 2,548 military personnel, the biggest national contingent being 440 Belgian soldiers. The head of the mission was Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh. On 6 April 1994, the airplane of Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira (also a Hutu) was shot down as it flew towards the Kigali airport. Responsibility for the attack is a matter of contention, with both the Hutu extremists and the RPF under suspicion. The assassination was a catalyst for the Rwandan genocide. It was one of several assassinations that occurred with similar political motives as moderates were targeted by the CDR, the hardline faction once part of the MRND. Soldiers of UNAMIR were present before, during, and after the violence. The limitations of the UN, due to national sovereignty and the need to remain impartial when conducting Chapter 6 peacekeeping operations, led to the impotence of UNAMIR to do anything more than bear witness to the genocide. After 10 Belgian soldiers were killed in April 1994, the Belgian contingent was removed from Rwanda and the size of the mission reduced to around 270 personnel. International powers such as France, the UK and the US did not have the political motivation to send troops or financial support for UNAMIR, although many of these countries were able to remove their foreign nationals from danger.

E. van Vogt, as well as the name of the fictional race of superbeings featured in the novel. The novel was originally serialized in the magazine Astounding Science Fiction (September‚ÄìDecember 1940). It was subsequently published in hardcover in 1946 by Arkham House, in an edition of 4,051 copies. In 2016, Slan was awarded the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1941.\\"1941 Retro-Hugo Awards\\" at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved October 2, 2016.  Plot  Slans are evolved humans, named after their alleged creator, Samuel Lann. They have the psychic abilities to read minds and are super-intelligent. They possess near limitless stamina, \\"nerves of steel,\\" and superior strength and speed. When Slans are ill or seriously injured, they retreat into a healing trance. There are two kinds of Slans. One type has tendrils on their heads and can read the minds of ordinary humans and telepathically communicate with other Slans. The tendrils are golden colored, making it easy to spot a Slan. These Slans are hunted to near extinction. The other type is tendrilless, still super intelligent but without psychic abilities, except the ability to hide their thoughts from the first type of Slan. The human dictator Kier Gray leads a campaign to exterminate the Slans. As the novel begins, nine-year-old Jommy Cross (a telepathic Slan of the first type) travels with his mother to the capital, Centropolis. They are discovered and Jommy's mother is killed, while Jommy flees. Jommy Cross is not only the heir to the brilliant inventions of his father, but he represents the last hope of the Slan race to save it from genocide. In fulfilling his mission, he seeks to destroy Kier Gray, and in their final confrontation discovers an astonishing secret. Reception Groff Conklin, reviewing a 1951 edition, described Slan as \\"a little overblown, considerably melodramatic, but still [a] really gripping adventure story.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, April 1952, p.120 P. Schuyler Miller called Slan \\"van Vogt's first and most famous novel, perhaps his best.\\"\\"The Reference Library\\", Astounding Science Fiction, July 1952, pp.159 In a back-cover blurb in the 1998 Orb edition, Charles de Lint says this: \\"Over fifty years on from when it first saw print, van Vogt's Slan is still one of the quintessential classics in the field that other SF novels will inevitably be measured against.\\" R. D. Mullen reported Slan to be \\"perhaps the most widely read, and perhaps the best of [van Vogt's] novels.\\" He described the situation of the Slan minority in the imagined society as \\"obviously intended\\" as analogous to \\"the position of the Jews in the Third Reich\\", though in the novel \\"there actually is a secret world-wide conspiracy, and the Slans actually do control the world in much the same way as is imagined about the Jews by students of The Protocols of Zion.\\"\\"Reviews: November 1975\\", Science Fiction Studies, November 1975  \\"Fans are slans\\"  In American science fiction fandom, the slogan \\"Fans are slans\\"Laney, F.

Although some regard the usage as a sign of fandom's elitism, along with the related term \\"mundane\\" for non-fans, others regard it as a natural reaction to the disapproval of science fiction fans by the broader culture. The related term \\"slan shack\\" came to be used in fanspeak for a home occupied primarily by fans.

The party's objective was to elect blacks to the legislature and local offices in counties with black majority populations. The party ran candidates in 1970 and 1972; as a result in 1970 the first three black candidates were elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives since Reconstruction. In South Carolina, as in New York and unlike most other states, a single candidate may be nominated by two or more legally separate political parties. This practice is called electoral fusion. In the past, several South Carolina state legislators, who concurrently served as Democrats, were cross-endorsed by the United Citizens Party. Other political parties that have practiced fusion include the New York Conservative Party, the Working Families Party of New York and the Liberal Party of New York. The American Labor Party was a historically important party in New York State which both practiced fusion and elected candidates independently. Since the opening up of the state Democratic Party to black candidates, the party has mainly served as a means for various third party candidates to appear on the South Carolina Presidential ballot. For a period of time in the 1990s the party used the name Patriot Party before returning to its original and current name.https://web.archive.org/web/20020820004727/http://ballot- access.org/2000/0901.html#17 History In 1996, Ross Perot was the nominee of both the Reform Party (which yielded 27,464 votes) and the United Citizens Party then known as the Patriot Party (36,913 votes). In 1974, the political scientists Hanes Walton Jr. and William H. Boone cited the UCP up to that point as an example of a successful sub-national African American political party. In the 2000 election, the UCP nominated Ralph Nader for President in South Carolina. He received 20,279 votes or about 1.46% of the total 1,384,253. In the 2002 election for the Second Congressional District in South Carolina, Mark Whittington received 17,189 votes or 10.03% of the total,South Carolina Election Commission, Nov. 5, 2002. after picketing the national headquarters of the Bank of America in Charlotte, N.C. In 2004, the UCP chose to nominate the Socialist Party candidate Walt Brown for President. Brown received 2,124 votes or about 0.13% of the total 1,617,730. Ralph Nader appeared on the South Carolina ballot as an independent, receiving 5520 votes or 0.34%. David Cobb appeared on the new South Carolina Green Party ballot line and received 1488 votes or 0.09% of the statewide total. In 2006, the Party endorsed John \\"JC\\" Nellums for State House District 79 (Kershaw, Richland),search  SCVotes.org and did not cross-endorse candidates of any other party.

Clarke. It is the third book in the four-book Rama series: Rendezvous with Rama, Rama II, The Garden of Rama, and Rama Revealed, and follows on from where Rama II left off. Plot summary The book picks up the story nine months after the end of Rama II. The book follows the story of three astronauts from the expedition in Rama II who were trapped aboard the cylindrical alien spacecraft, Rama II, heading out towards deep space. Along the journey, five children were born. Simone Tiasso Wakefield, Catharine Colin Wakefield, Eleanor Joan Wakefield, Benjamin Ryan O'Toole and Patrick Erin O'Toole, were born by Nicole des Jardins from her relationships with Richard Wakefield and Michael O'Toole. These children later become major characters in Rama Revealed. After a twelve- year journey, they arrive in the vicinity of the star Sirius, where all eight rendezvous with a Raman Node. At the Node they are subjected to physiological tests for a year while Rama is refurbished, and they are eventually sent back to the solar system, this time to collect two thousand more representatives of humanity. An Earth agency, known as the ISA, receives the message from Rama requesting two thousand humans. Upon its reception, the message is kept secret and, under the guise of a new Martian colony, the ISA starts acquiring its payload. The ISA selects a handful of their own representatives; meanwhile, they selectively gather convicts and promise them freedom if they are chosen to be a colonist. The payload is subdivided into three ships: the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria (names based on Christopher Columbus's ships Ni√±a, Pinta, and Santa Mar√≠a) that arrive sequentially at Rama. At this point the colonists believe everything is a hoax (despite the colossal size of Rama) created by the ISA. With that discontent as the tone upon their arrival, Rama III heads back to deep space with its new payload. Soon an aggressive group of humans, led by a mob boss, seizes control of the human colony and begins a war of annihilation and propaganda against one of the other races occupying the massive spacecraft. The original astronauts and their children find themselves powerless to prevent the genocide. However, the aggressive behavior of the human species does not go unnoticed: Another species, unknown to the humans, observe their behavior and start considering a possible counterattack. Meanwhile, Rama III determines that total escalation of the conflict is imminent and transmits an emergency signal to its ancient constructors. The book ends with a cliffhanger, on the eve of the execution of one of the original astronauts.

Family Duff was the only son of Sir Robert George Vivian Duff, 2nd Baronet, of Vaynol (d.1914), and his wife, Lady Juliet Lowther (1881-1965), only child of the 4th Earl of Lonsdale by his wife, Constance Robinson, Marchioness of Ripon. His maternal grandmother was a sister of the 13th and 14th Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, and a daughter of the Rt. Hon. Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, the half-Russian younger son of the 10th Earl of Pembroke, and a good friend to Florence Nightingale. He had one sibling, Victoria Maud Veronica Duff (1904‚Äî1967, married John Edward Tennant). His stepfather, from 1919 until 1926, was Major Keith Trevor. He was a godson of Mary of Teck (queen of King George V). Handsome and good-mannered, he was famed as a host and raconteur. He inherited the Welsh estate of Vaynol (also known by its Welsh spelling 'Faenol'), the slate of which was the principal source of the family's wealth. Surrounded by the estate's seven-mile-long stone wall, the Duffs lived in Vaynol New Hall, which had been built in 1800. The medieval Vaynol Old Hall, also on the estate, was occupied by the farm manager and later the estate manager. In 1928, Sir Michael assumed the additional surname of Assheton- Smith, only to renounce it in 1945. He served as High Sheriff of Anglesey for 1950. He then served as Mayor of Caernarvon, High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire (1932) and Lord Lieutenant of both Caernarvonshire and of Gwynedd. He was a practical joker, one of his favourite pranks being to dress up as Queen Mary and pay surprise visits to friends - until he bumped into the Queen herself in a neighbour's hall.Duncan Fallowell & April Ashley, April Ashley's Odyssey, Jonathan Cape, London (1982) He also wrote a light novel, The Power Of A Parasol. Marriages Sir Michael Duff-Assheton-Smith, as he then was, married first, on 5 March 1935, Hon Millicent Joan Marjoribanks (born 1906), daughter of the 3rd and last Baron Tweedmouth. They divorced in July 1936, and the marriage was annulled 1937. Sir Michael Duff, as he then was, married as his second wife, on 14 July 1949, Lady (Alexandra Mary Cecilia) Caroline Paget (1913-73), the eldest daughter of Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey, and his wife, Lady Marjorie Manners, the eldest daughter of the Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland. They adopted a son, Charles David Duff (b. 1950), who became a theatre historian. A documentary screened on BBC Two Wales in 2005 ('Faenol: Secrets Behind the Wall') featured Charles Duff discussing his childhood, the bisexuality of his adoptive parents, their marriage of convenience, and the details of his parentage. He did not inherit the estate, and when it was sold all the records were burnt, so compounding the mystery. In another interview for the BBC (Wall Of Silence, BBC Wales website) Charles said of Vaynol: \\"It was a place of great conviviality and energy and joy.\\" However, by the time Charles was in his teens, Sir Michael had come to believe that his second marriage and the adoption of his son had been grave errors, and according to Charles Duff, \\"he started to demonise both my mother and myself.\\" Although appearances were maintained, neither could then do much right in Sir Michael's opinion. By this time the house and estate were also in decline. (Before the Second World War there had been 17 gardeners.) The Duff Estate The Vaynol estate, in northern Wales, close to the Anglesey estate at Plas Newydd, passed out of Duff family hands, the last main portion including the demesne within the walls being sold off in 1984. This came into the family via Mary Assheton- Smith, niece and heiress of the famous squire Assheton-Smith, the celebrated foxhunter.

He studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and later attended Acad√©mie Julian, Paris. After early figure-painting and illustration, he became prominent as a landscape painter. He was one of the Ten American Painters who in 1897 seceded from the Society of American Artists. For some years he was an instructor in the Women's Art School, Cooper Union, New York, and in the Art Students League, New York. In 1893 he became a member of the American Watercolor Society, New York. Generally associated with American Impressionism, he is also remembered for his New England landscapes and involvement with the Old Lyme Art Colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut and his influential years at the Cornish Art Colony. Early years Born into a working-class family, Metcalf began painting in 1874. In 1876 he opened a studio in Boston, and received a scholarship at the Boston Museum school, where he studied until 1878. In 1882 he held an exhibition at the J. Eastman Chase Gallery in Boston, the sales from which financed a study trip abroad.Hiesinger, pages 240-1. Metcalf left for Europe in September 1883, and did not return to the United States until late 1888. During that time he traveled and painted, studying first in Paris with Gustave Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, subsequently going to England and Pont-Aven, Brittany. In the winter of 1884 he apparently met John Twachtman in Paris, and painted at Grez-sur-Loing alongside other American artists, including Theodore Robinson. His landscapes at this time were traditional renditions of peasant scenes, in the manner of Jean Millet.Hiesinger, page 241. By 1886 Metcalf was painting in Giverny, evidently the first American painter to visit there. Soon thereafter he traveled to Algeria and Tunisia, returning to Giverny in the summers of 1887 and 1888, in the company of other American painters. Cornish Hills, 1911, oil on canvas Return to America On the Suffolk Coast, 1885 Upon his return to the United States Metcalf had a solo exhibition at the St. Botolph Club in Boston. After living briefly in Philadelphia, in 1890 he opened a studio in New York, working for several years as a portrait painter, illustrator, and teacher. In 1895 he painted at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and ceased to work as an illustrator. In the late 1890s he appears to have painted little, and his contributions to the first few exhibitions of The Ten were disappointing. At the time Metcalf led a lavish social life that included heavy drinking.Chambers, page 28; Hiesinger, page 241. In 1899 Metcalf joined his friends Robert Reid and Edward Simmons in painting murals for a New York courthouse; in this genre he was no more successful than he had been as an illustrator and portraitist.Chambers, page 28. Metcalf's model for the murals was Marguerite Beaufort Hail√©, a stage performer twenty years his junior, whom the artist would marry in 1903. Maturity The Ten Cent Breakfast May Night, 1906, oil on canvas, Corcoran Gallery of Art In preparation for a mural commissioned by a tobacco company, Metcalf traveled to Havana, Cuba in 1902, to make painted studies. That year he also produced a series of notable landscapes, including The Boat Landing and Battery Park-Spring. These works were characterized by a new freshness of execution and lightness of palette.Chambers, page 32. In 1904 he resided and painted steadily in Clark's Cove, Maine. By 1905, at the encouragement of his friend Childe Hassam, he began summering in Old Lyme, working as both painter and teacher, and held successful exhibitions in New York and again at the St. Botolph Club. His expertly handled, subtle views of the New England landscape met with steady critical and financial success. In 1907 May Night (Corcoran Gallery of Art) won the Corcoran gold medal, was honored with the top purchase prize of $3,000, and was the first contemporary American painting to be bought by that institution.Chambers, page 14. It remains one of best works and is now in the collections of the National Gallery of Art. In the same year his marriage to Marguerite dissolved when she eloped from Old Lyme with one of Metcalf's male students.Chambers, page 63. = Cornish Art Colony = Metcalf frequently visited the Cornish Art Colony, centered in the villages of Plainfield and Cornish, New Hampshire between 1909 and 1921, often during the quiet winter seasons when many of the colony's residents had returned to the city. The colony stretched over gentle, open hills along the Connecticut River with views of Mount Ascutney in Vermont, a landscape which garnered it comparisons to Tuscany and a crop of Italianate summer homes. In 1909, Louis Shipman, a playwright and husband of landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman, invited Metcalf to join him for a winter in Plainfield, at his estate there, Brook Place. My Wife and Daughter, Willard Metcalf, 1917 Metcalf would return faithfully for many winters, and at least one summer after that. He was good friends with colonist Charles Platt, on whose Cornish estate he honeymooned, with his second wife, Henriette Alice McCrea-Metcalf in 1911. Varying year to year, he stayed with the Shipmans, or a converted grist mill close to the village of Plainfield. His frequent Cornish muse was Blow-me-down Brook, a small creek which runs through the area, and passed along his residence. Other works depict the hills, the Shipman residence or other country buildings. His production in Cornish exemplified and elevated his reputation for painting modest and intimate scenery of the changing seasons, elements which are represented in his work from the time. The pieces he produced in the Cornish area brought an unusual time of social, critical and commercial success in his life, so often filled with personal tumult. His paintings were compared with the poetry of Robert Frost, Walt Whitman, and other writers, earning him a reputation, in the words of one critic, as the \\"poet laureate of the New England hills.\\" While at the colony he painted around 35 landscapes, including Blow-Me-Down (1911), The Village-September Morning (1911) and The White Veil (1909) and the lovely, masterful \\"Cornish Hills\\" (1911). The heading of Willard Metcalf's obituary, published in the New York Times after his 1925 death, recognizes his rag to riches story as typifying \\"the romance of American Life.\\" = Later works, death, and legacy = Metcalf continued to hold one-man shows in New York and Boston. During the 1910s he traveled incessantly in search of painting sites. In 1913 he spent nine months painting in Paris, Norway, England, and Italy; in the U.S., in addition to Cornish and Plainfield, New Hampshire, Metcalf lived and painted in Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine, where in 1920 he painted Benediction (now lost), a nocturne. In 1923 the painting sold for $13,000, then a record price for the work of a living American artist. His familial strife continued when, after having two children, he and Henrietta divorced in 1920, which spurred a period of drinking and decreased productivity. However, he rebounded and painted for a number of years in Vermont, possibly returning briefly to Cornish. The Corcoran Gallery held a large exhibition of Metcalf's work in 1925, during which the artist died of a heart attack in New York City, on March 6. He was 66. The Florence Griswold House, where Metcalf visited and stayed in Old Lyme between 1905 and 1907, now houses the largest public collection of Metcalf's paintings and personal artifacts in the world. Florence Griswold Museum Additionally, his work is on display in many American museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Freer Gallery of Art, and recently the Seattle Art Museum. Pieces also appear in some international collections, such as Madrid's Thyssen-Bornemisza. His ashes were scattered in Cornish, New Hampshire, by his longtime friend Charles Platt.

Founded in 1994, JW has primarily targeted Democrats, in particular the Presidency of Bill Clinton, the Presidency of Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. The organization has described climate science as \\"fraud science\\" and has filed lawsuits against government climate scientists. JW has made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims that have been picked up by right-wing news outlets and promoted by conservative figures. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited false claims by Judicial Watch about voter fraud. Courts have dismissed the vast majority of its lawsuits. History Judicial Watch was founded in 1994 by attorney and right-wing activist Larry Klayman. Before leaving the organization in 2003, Klayman hired Tom Fitton, who became president of the organization. In October 2016, The New York Times wrote: \\"Judicial Watch's strategy is simple: Carpet-bomb the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.\\" As of 2016, the organization had nearly fifty employees. Judicial Watch calls itself a nonpartisan educational foundation as well as a media organization. According to the Times, \\"the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public.\\" Critics accuse JW of \\"weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes.\\" =Clinton Administration= Judicial Watch came to public attention after filing eighteen lawsuits against the administration of Democratic U.S. President Bill Clinton and other figures in the Clinton administration. An early lawsuit was filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of the Western Center for Journalism (WCJ) in 1998. The lawsuit alleged a retaliatory audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The WCJ was investigating the death of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster at the time. The organization received considerable financial support from prominent Clinton critics, including $7.74 million from conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. This led Clinton administration officials to accuse Judicial Watch of \\"abusing the judicial system for partisan ends\\". =Bush administration= In July 2003 Judicial Watch joined the environmental organization Sierra Club in suing the George W. Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney's Energy Task Force.Bill Moyers Interview with Larry Klayman, Public Broadcasting Service, July 11, 2003. Judicial Watch was involved in a similar legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that \\"when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton's share price.\\" As reported by the Wall Street Journal the court filing claims the oil-field- services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001. =Obama administration= Judicial Watch filed over twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails. A federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016 that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests. =Trump administration= In 2020 Judicial Watch pursued emails related to the Steele Dossier, obtaining copies through a FOIA lawsuit. In the months prior to the 2020 election, Judicial watch filed or threatened lawsuits against several states related to alleged inaccuracy of their voter rolls, demanding that nearly two million names be purged. Also in 2020, the group sued the state of California, claiming a law requiring corporations doing business in the state to have directors from sexual or racial minorities is unconstitutional. Activities and controversies Judicial Watch‚Äôs main targets have been Democrats, particularly Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration. =Commerce Department trade mission scandal= In 1995, Judicial Watch, Inc. filed an action in the District Court under the FOIA, seeking information from the Department of Commerce (DOC) regarding DOC's selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch's FOIA requests, DOC produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of DOC's search, and Judicial Watch charged that some DOC officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents. In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search. During the investigation, Nolanda B. Hill, a business partner of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified that Brown had told her that first lady Hillary Clinton was the driving force behind the efforts to raise as much money as possible for President Clinton's reelection and the DNC. And further that, \\"...companies were being solicited to donate large sums of money in exchange for their selection to participate on trade missions of the Commerce Department.\\" =Vince Foster conspiracy= Judicial Watch helped promote the conspiracy theory that Vince Foster was murdered by the Clintons. =White House visitor logs= August 10, 2009 Judicial Watch sent a FOIA request to the US Secret Service asking that official White House visitor logs be made public. In August 2011, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ordered the agency to process the group's data request. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia partially affirmed the decision, holding that the Secret Service did not have to produce records of visitors to the president's office. =False Nancy Pelosi claims= In 2010, Judicial Watch made inaccurate claims about air travel spending by Nancy Pelosi's congressional delegation; Judicial Watch's claims were picked up by the conservative conspiracy site WorldNetDaily. Judicial Watch also made false claims about Pelosi's air travel in 2008. =Operation Neptune Spear= Osama bin Laden, leader of the terror group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 1, 2011 in a joint operation by the United States Navy SEALs and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This operation was code-named Operation Neptune Spear. On May 2, 2011 Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request with the Department of Defense and the CIA for photographs and videos of bin Laden taken during or after the operation. The government failed to produce any records within the required twenty days. In order to force compliance, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the DOD and CIA on June 8, 2011. On January 31, 2014, after legal wrangling, the Pentagon released Operation Neptune Spear documents to Judicial Watch. One email had the subject line OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear and is proof that days after the original FOIA request U.S. Special Operations Commander, Admiral William McRaven ordered his subordinates to immediately destroy any Osama bin Laden photos they may have had. =Kennedy assassination records= Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to obtain the records from Robert F. Kennedy's time as the Attorney General. The records covered sensitive intelligence operations conducted during the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations. =Hillary Clinton email lawsuits= Judicial Watch has currently filed twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's emails. On February 8, 2016, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The Bureau was forced to formally acknowledge the investigation due to an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. FBI director James Comey had previously referenced the investigation, although the FBI had declined to confirm or deny it in court filings. A federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016 that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch's motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests. In May 2016 U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù to Judicial Watch into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email system. This ruling allowed Judicial Watch to question two close Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, under oath. In a separate FOIA lawsuit concerning Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi terrorist attack, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled Judicial Watch can conduct discovery into the email practices of Clinton and her top aides. In a separate case, on March 29, 2016 U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth granted Judicial Watch limited discovery, citing potential bad faith by the government in responding to requests for documents related to talking points provided to Susan Rice in response to the Benghazi attack. A FOIA lawsuit by Judicial Watch led to the release of 2,800 e-mails from Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were found on the laptop computer of Anthony Weiner, Abedin's estranged husband. Five of the e-mails were classified. =False claims about George Zimmermann protests= In 2013, Judicial Watch claimed that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration organized protests against George Zimmermann after the Trayvon Martin shooting; PolitiFact said that this was \\"mostly false\\" and that while Justice Department employees were sent to Florida, they \\"were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence.\\" =ISIS in Mexico scares= In 2014 and 2015, Judicial Watch falsely claimed that ISIS had set up camp in Mexico; Judicial Watch's claims were picked up by several right-wing news outlets. =Collaboration with Steve Bannon and Breitbart News= In 2013, Judicial Watch collaborated with Steve Bannon, executive chairman of the alt-right website Breitbart, on the film \\"District of Corruption\\", which critiqued the Obama administration. Judicial Watch paid Bannon's group Victory Film Project $382,143 for the film. Politico described the film as an \\"infomercial for the work of Judicial Watch\\". Judicial Watch has advertised on Breitbart for a number of years. Judicial Watch's president Tom Fitton said \\"Liberal activists want to destroy Breitbart, but we won‚Äôt be cowed\\". =Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theory= In 2017, Judicial Watch requested documents related to the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich; Seth Rich's death led to debunked rightwing conspiracy theories which alleged that Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party had him killed. =False voter fraud claims= In August 2017, Judicial Watch falsely alleged that 11 California counties had more registered voters than their estimated populations of citizens eligible to vote; the claims were picked up by outlets such as Breitbart News and Russian propaganda network RT (Russia Today). Judicial Watch counted \\"inactive voters\\" in its tally, which is a list of people that California maintains of people who have been removed from active rolls after a mail ballot, voter guide or other official document was returned as undeliverable; California keeps such a list as a fail-safe in case eligible voters have been erroneously categorized as \\"inactive\\". California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Judicial Watch's claims were \\"baseless\\", and \\"bad math and dubious methodology\\". When the Los Angeles Times asked Judicial Watch to share its analysis of voter registration in California, Judicial Watch declined. Judicial Watch's voter fraud claims came in the wake of President Donald Trump's false claims of extensive voter fraud in California during the 2016 presidential election. Trump has subsequently repeatedly promoted Judicial Watch's false claims about voter fraud. On 3 February 2020, the day of the Iowa caucuses in the Democratic presidential primary, JW president Tom Fitton suggested that voter fraud was afoot in Iowa by falsely claiming that \\"eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than citizens old enough to register.\\" The false assertion went viral on social media.Birnbaum, Emily (February 3, 2020). \\"Iowa Secretary of State Disputes Viral Misinformation about Voter Registration.\\" The Hill. Retrieved March 17, 2020.Romm, Tony, and Isaac Stanley-Becker (February 3, 2020). \\"Conservatives Spread False Claims on Twitter about Electoral Fraud as Iowans Prepare to Caucus.\\" The Washington Post. Retrieved March 20, 2020. Iowa's Secretary of State, Paul Pate, a member of the Republican Party, debunked Fitton's claim by linking to official voter registration data. Fitton has made alarmist claims about voter fraud, saying \\"We have all heard about voter fraud and the attempts by liberal media organs like the New York Times and Ivory Tower academics to dismiss it as a nonexistent problem. But is it real, widespread, and substantial to the point that it can decide elections.\\" =False claims about Trump Nazi billboard= In 2017, Judicial Watch falsely claimed that taxpayer money went into a billboard which depicted President Donald Trump as a Nazi. =Lawsuits against climate scientists= Judicial Watch, which has claimed that climate science is \\"fraud science\\", has filed lawsuits seeking to force the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to release the correspondence of climate scientists who published a 2015 study in the journal Science. The study had debunked one of the common claims made by those who reject the scientific consensus on climate change, namely that there existed global warming \\"hiatus\\" between 1998-2012. The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF), American Meteorological Society and Union of Concerned Scientists condemned Judicial Watch, saying that the disclosure of private communications between scientists \\"would harm (or halt altogether) government scientists' ability to collaborate with colleagues, damage the government's ability to recruit or retain top scientists, and deter critically important research into politically charged fields like climate change\\". The Judicial Watch lawsuit was inspired by Rep. Lamar Smith, a climate change denier who had accused the authors of the study of \\"alter[ing] data\\" to \\"get the politically correct results they want.\\" =Mueller and FBI investigations into Russian interference= In 2017, Judicial Watch helped to stoke Republican attacks against Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton has called for the Special Counsel investigation to be shut down, arguing that prosecutors in the probe were too biased against President Trump to conduct a credible investigation, a claim rejected by Republican Senators Tom Tillis and Bob Corker. Fitton furthermore called for shutting down the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) based on the false claim that the Obama administration had turned it into a \\"KGB-type operation.\\" =Accusations against the Clinton Foundation= In January 2018, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton repeated accusations against the Clinton Foundation that it had funneled money intended for charity work in Haiti to pay for Chelsea Clinton's wedding. The Washington Post fact-checked the claim a year earlier and found that it was \\"lacking any evidence\\". = George Soros smears = In October 2018, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch stirred controversy when he appeared on Lou Dobbs' Fox Business show and used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was \\"Soros-occupied\\" territory. The remark echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a \\"Zionist-occupied government\\" to refer to Jewish control of the U.S. government. After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that Farrell would no longer be booked. Farrell promoted the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that a migrant caravan traveling through Central America towards the United States was being directed or funded by the \\"Soros-occupied State Department\\". Judicial Watch had been engaged in what NPR described as a \\"full-throated campaign against Soros\\". Among other things, Judicial Watch raised money by running ads with a call to action: \\"Expose Soros!\\" =Senator's letters to IRS= According to Media Matters for America, in 2015, Judicial Watch claimed that three newly-obtained letters sent by Democatic senator Carl Levin to the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service \\"discuss how to target conservative groups the senator claimed were 'engaged in political activities'.\\" Judicial Watch provided a link to the documents on its site, but failed to note that one Levin letter did not mention conservatives, while the other two mentioned an equal number of liberal/Democrat and conservative/Republican entities. The Judicial Watch deception was amplified by several conservative media outlets. = Statue removal = Judicial Watch has sought to remove a statue of Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa from downtown Tucson. Judicial Watch said the statue \\"needs to go\\" because \\"Pancho Villa did great harm to people.\\" = 2020 election voter suppression = In 2020, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton urged attendees of an event organized by the Council for National Policy to prevent mail-in ballots from being sent to voters, saying \\"We need to stop those ballots from going out, and I want the lawyers here to tell us what to do.\\" Larry Klayman lawsuits In 2003, Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman left the organization to run for the United States Senate from Florida.Pensacola News Journal: \\"Senate candidate Klayman to visit area\\". February 23, 2004. In 2006, Klayman sued Judicial Watch and its president, Tom Fitton. Judicial Watch asserted several claims against Klayman as well. In 2019, Judicial Watch obtained a $2.8 million verdict against Klayman on its claims of breaches of the severance agreement and trademark infringement. In 2012, a Judicial Watch employee falsely told Orly Taitz that Klayman had been convicted of not paying child support (Klayman had been indicted, but the charges were later dismissed). Taitz then published the employee's comment on her website. Klayman sued Judicial Watch for defamation, and in 2014, a federal jury awarded Klayman $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages. In 2017, Freedom Watch (Klayman's successor organization to Judicial Watch) unsuccessfully sued Judicial Watch and the American Conservative Union (ACU), alleging they violated the Sherman Act by colluding to prevent Freedom Watch from participating at the ACU's Conservative Political Action Conference. Klayman had represented three individuals who sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but he failed to obtain Judicial Watch's consent to waive his conflict of interest. Klayman maintained that the D.C. Bar had \\"recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain\\". In 2020, however, the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended Klayman's license for 90 days and ordered him to complete a class on legal ethics. Peter Paul lawsuit In 2007 former donor Peter F. Paul sued Judicial Watch, accusing it of using his name to raise more than $15 million to support his lawsuit against Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton while doing little to advance his case.Kristen Lombardi, Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy Rides Again; Hillary haters go wild over campaign finance case, Village Voice, May 17, 2005.\\"Former Donor To Clinton Sues Judicial Watch\\", Josh Gerstein, New York Sun, February 8, 2007, p.5 All of Paul's claims were dismissed.Paul v. Judicial Watch, Inc., Civil Action No. 07-00279 (RCL) (D.D.C. February 2, 2009) (memorandum and order granting dismissal with prejudice). Funding As of 2016, Judicial Watch has an annual budget of about $35 million. Between 1997 and 2002 Judicial Watch received $7,069,500 in 19 grants from a handful of foundations. The bulk of this funding came from three foundations: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, a funder of politically conservative causes; The Carthage Foundation, which merged into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014; and the John M. Olin Foundation, Inc. As of 2010, the Sarah Scaife Foundation was the group's largest contributor.

","title":"Judicial Watch"},{"id":"911229","text":"Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a highly sensitive optical spectroscopic technique that enables measurement of absolute optical extinction by samples that scatter and absorb light. It has been widely used to study gaseous samples which absorb light at specific wavelengths, and in turn to determine mole fractions down to the parts per trillion level. The technique is also known as cavity ring-down laser absorption spectroscopy (CRLAS). A typical CRDS setup consists of a laser that is used to illuminate a high-finesse optical cavity, which in its simplest form consists of two highly reflective mirrors. When the laser is in resonance with a cavity mode, intensity builds up in the cavity due to constructive interference. The laser is then turned off in order to allow the measurement of the exponentially decaying light intensity leaking from the cavity. During this decay, light is reflected back and forth thousands of times between the mirrors giving an effective path length for the extinction on the order of a few kilometers. If a light-absorbing material is now placed in the cavity, the mean lifetime decreases as fewer bounces through the medium are required before the light is fully absorbed, or absorbed to some fraction of its initial intensity. A CRDS setup measures how long it takes for the light to decay to 1/e of its initial intensity, and this \\"ringdown time\\" can be used to calculate the concentration of the absorbing substance in the gas mixture in the cavity. Detailed description Cavity ring-down spectroscopy is a form of laser absorption spectroscopy. In CRDS, a laser pulse is trapped in a highly reflective (typically R > 99.9%) detection cavity. The intensity of the trapped pulse will decrease by a fixed percentage during each round trip within the cell due to absorption , scattering by the medium within the cell, and reflectivity losses. The intensity of light within the cavity is then determined as an exponential function of time. :I(t) = I_0 \\\\exp \\\\left (- t / \\\\tau \\\\right) The principle of operation is based on the measurement of a decay rate rather than an absolute absorbance. This is one reason for the increased sensitivity over traditional absorption spectroscopy, as the technique is then immune to shot- to-shot laser fluctuations. The decay constant, œÑ, which is the time taken for the intensity of light to fall to 1/e of the initial intensity, is called the ring-down time and is dependent on the loss mechanism(s) within the cavity. For an empty cavity, the decay constant is dependent on mirror loss and various optical phenomena like scattering and refraction: :\\\\tau_0 = \\\\frac{n}{c} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{l}{1-R+X} where n is the index of refraction within the cavity, c is the speed of light in vacuum, l is the cavity length, R is the mirror reflectivity, and X takes into account other miscellaneous optical losses. This equation uses the approximation that ln(1+x) ‚âà x for x close to zero, which is the case under cavity ring-down conditions. Often, the miscellaneous losses are factored into an effective mirror loss for simplicity. An absorbing species in the cavity will increase losses according to the Beer-Lambert law. Assuming the sample fills the entire cavity, :\\\\tau = \\\\frac{n}{c} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{l}{1-R+X+ \\\\alpha l } where Œ± is the absorption coefficient for a specific analyte concentration at the cavity's resonance wavelength. The decadic absorbance, A, due to the analyte can be determined from both ring-down times. :A = \\\\frac{n}{c} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{l}{2.303} \\\\cdot \\\\left ( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau} - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\tau_0} \\\\right) Alternatively, the molar absorptivity, Œµ, and analyte concentration, C, can be determined from the ratio of both ring-down times. If X can be neglected, one obtains :\\\\frac{\\\\tau_0}{\\\\tau} =1+ \\\\frac{ \\\\alpha l }{1-R} = 1+\\\\frac{2.303 \\\\epsilon l C}{(1-R)} When a ratio of species' concentrations is the analytical objective, as for example in carbon-13 to carbon-12 measurements in carbon dioxide, the ratio of ring-down times measured for the same sample at the relevant absorption frequencies can be used directly with extreme accuracy and precision. Advantages of CRDS There are two main advantages to CRDS over other absorption methods: First, it is not affected by fluctuations in the laser intensity. In most absorption measurements, the light source must be assumed to remain steady between blank (no analyte), standard (known amount of analyte), and sample (unknown amount of analyte). Any drift (change in the light source) between measurements will introduce errors. In CRDS, the ringdown time does not depend on the intensity of the laser, so fluctuations of this type are not a problem. Independency from laser intensity makes CRDS needless to any calibration and comparison with standards. Second, it is very sensitive due to its long pathlength. In absorption measurements, the smallest amount that can be detected is proportional to the length that the light travels through a sample. Since the light reflects many times between the mirrors, it ends up traveling long distances. For example, a laser pulse making 500 round trips through a 1-meter cavity will effectively have traveled through 1 kilometer of sample. Thus, the advantages include: *High sensitivity due to the multipass nature (i.e. long pathlength) of the detection cell. *Immunity to shot variations in laser intensity due to the measurement of a rate constant. *Wide range of use for a given set of mirrors; typically, ¬±5% of the center wavelength. *High throughput, individual ring down events occur on the millisecond time scale. *No need for a fluorophore, which makes it more attractive than laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) for some (e.g. rapidly predissociating) systems. Disadvantages of CRDS *Spectra cannot be acquired quickly due to the monochromatic laser source which is used. Having said this, some groups are now beginning to develop the use of broadband LED or supercontinuum sources for CRDS, the light of which can then be dispersed by a grating onto a CCD, or Fourier transformed spectrometer (mainly in broadband analogues of CRDS). Perhaps more importantly, the development of ICOS based techniques have now been demonstrated over the range from the near UV to the mid-infrared. In addition, the frequency-agile rapid scanning (FARS) CRDS technique has been developed to overcome the mechanical or thermal frequency tuning which typically limits CRDS acquisition rates. The FARS method utilizes an electro- optic modulator to step a probe laser side band to successive cavity modes, eliminating tuning time between data points and allowing for acquisition rates about 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional thermal tuning. *Analytes are limited both by the availability of tunable laser light at the appropriate wavelength and also the availability of high reflectance mirrors at those wavelengths. *Expense: the requirement for laser systems and high reflectivity mirrors often makes CRDS orders of magnitude more expensive than some alternative spectroscopic techniques.

It is the administrative headquarters of Dhar District. Before gaining independence, it was the capital of the Dhar princely state.  Location  Dhar is situated between 21¬∞57' and 23¬∞15' north, and 74¬∞37' and 75¬∞37' east. The city is bordered in the north by Ratlam; east by parts of Indore; on the south by Barwani, and on the west by Jhabua and Alirajpur. The town is located west of Mhow and is above sea level. It is picturesquely situated among lakes and trees surrounded by barren hills, and possesses, besides its old ramparts, many interesting buildings, some of them containing records of cultural, historical and national importance.  Historic places and monuments  One of few remaining portions of the ParamƒÅra-period ramparts at DhƒÅr Plan of the historic parts of DhƒÅr showing disposition of the ramparts and moat The most visible ancient parts of DhƒÅr are the massive earthen ramparts which are best preserved on the western and southern sides of the town. These were probably built at beginning of the 9th century and show that the city was circular in plan and surrounded by a series of tanks and moats. The layout is similar to the circular city of Warangal in the Deccan. The circular ramparts of DhƒÅr, unique in north India and an important legacy of the ParamƒÅras, is being destroyed by brick-makers and others using the material for construction purposes. On the north-east side of the town, the ramparts and moats have disappeared beneath modern homes and other buildings. =Fort= Dhar Fort The historic parts of the town are dominated by an impressive sandstone fortress on a small hill. It is thought to have been built by Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi, probably on the site of the ancient DhƒÅrƒÅgiri mentioned in early sources.K. K. Lele, in Dikshit, PƒÅrijƒÅtama√±jarƒ´, p. xxi, n. 1, One of the gateways, added at a later time, dates to 1684-85 in the time of 'ƒÄlamgƒ´r.Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy (1971-72): 81, no. D. 72. Inside the fort there is a deep rock-cut cistern of great age, and a later palace of the MahƒÅrƒÅja of DhƒÅr that incorporates an elegant pillared porch from the Mughal period that probably belongs to the mid-17th century. The palace area houses an outdoor museum with a small collection of temple fragments and images dating to medieval times. =Museum= Inside the fort, a large number of sculptures and antiquities from DhƒÅr and its neighbourhood are kept in the utilitarian buildings constructed there in the late 19th century. Some pieces from the collection have been moved to Mandu where the Department of Archaeology, Museums and Archives has created a museum with a range of displays in the 'Barnes Koti', a Sultanate-period building used by Captain Ernest Barnes, the political agent of the Bhopawar agency. =Tomb of Shaykh ChangƒÅl= On the overgrown ramparts of the medieval city overlooking the old moat, is the tomb of Shaykh ‚ÄòAbdullah ShƒÅh ChangƒÅl, a warrior saint. The tomb has been rebuilt, but the inscription, now incorporated into the compound gate, is written in Persian and is dated to 1455. As a record of historical interest, it recounts the Shaykh's arrival in DhƒÅr and his conversion of Bhoja to IslƒÅm after the local people had committed an atrocity against the small community of Muslims who had settled in the city in the earliest days of Islam.G. H. Yazdani, ‚ÄòThe Inscription on the Tomb of ‚ÄòAbdullah ShƒÅh ChangƒÅl at DhƒÅr‚Äô Epigraphica Indo-Moslemica (1909-10): 1-5; now translated and reinterpreted in The story does not so much refer to the celebrated Bhoja but to a rising interest in Bhoja's biography in the 15th century and the attempts made at that time to appropriate his legacy in Sanskrit and Persian literary sources.The point made in =Pillar Mosque= LƒÅ·π≠ Masjid, interior, built in 1405. The Lat Masjid or 'Pillar Mosque', located to the south of the town like the tomb of Shaykh ChangƒÅl, was built as the Jami' Mosque by Dilawar Khan in 1405.Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy (1971-72): 81, no. D. 73 It derives its name from the iron pillar of Dhar (\\"lƒÅ·π≠\\" in Hindi), which is believed to have been set up in the 11th century. The pillar, which was nearly 13.2 m high according to the most recent assessment, is fallen and broken; the three surviving parts are displayed on a small platform outside the mosque. It carries a later inscription recording a visit of the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1598 while on a campaign towards the Deccan. The pillar's original stone footing is also displayed nearby. =KamƒÅl MaulƒÅ Campus= The KamƒÅl MaulƒÅ is a spacious enclosure containing four tombs, the most notable being that of Shaykh KamƒÅl Maulavi or KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n (circa 1238-1330). He was a follower of Farƒ´d al-Dƒ´n Ga·πÖj-i Shakar (circa 1173-1266, see Fariduddin Ganjshakar) and the Chishti saint Nizamuddin Auliya (1238‚Äì1325). Some details about KamƒÅl al- Dƒ´n are recorded in Mu·∏•ammad Ghauthi's Azkar-i Abrar, a reliable hagiography of Sufi saints composed in 1613.Mu·∏•ammad Ghauthi Mandawi, Azkar-i abrar, Urdu Tarjuma-i Gulzar-i Abrar, trans. Fazl Ahmad Jewari [Urdu lithograph] (Agra: Matba\`-i Mufid-i \`Amm, 1326/1908, reprint ed., Lahore: Islamic Book Foundation, 1395/1975): 581. The cloak presented to KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n by Nizam al- Dƒ´n is still displayed inside the tomb. The custodians of KamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n's tomb have served in an unbroken lineage for 700 years and are still residents.The key modern works in RƒÅm Sevak Garg, Hazrat maulƒÅnƒÅ kamƒÅluddƒ´n ci≈õtƒ´ rah. aur unkƒÅ yug (BhopƒÅl, 2005). =Bhoj Shala= The hypostyle hall immediately next the tomb of KamƒÅl Maula is made of re-cycled temple columns and other architectural parts except for the Mihrab and Minbar which were purpose-built for the monument. It is similar to the LƒÅ·π≠ Masjid though earlier in date as an inscription of A.H. 795/C.E. 1392 found nearby records repairs by DilƒÅwar KhƒÅn.Luard, Dhar and Mandu (Bombay, 1916): 9; U. N. Day, Medieval Malwa (Delhi, 1969): 15, n. 2. A Sanskrit and Prakrit inscription from the time of Arjunavarman (circa 1210-15) was found in the walls of the building in 1903 by K. K. Lele, Superintendent of Education in the Princely State of DhƒÅr. The engraved inscription is displayed inside the entrance. The text includes parts of a drama called Vijaya≈õrƒ´nƒÅ·π≠ikƒÅ composed by Madana, the king's preceptor who also bore the title 'BƒÅlasarasvatƒ´'.S. K. Dikshit, ed., PƒÅrijƒÅtama√±jarƒ´ alias Vijaya≈õrƒ´ by RƒÅja-Guru Madana alias BƒÅla-Sarasvatƒ´ (Bhopal, 1968). The other inscribed tablets noted by Lele included a large tablet inscribed with the K≈´rma≈õataka‚Äîverses in praise of the K≈´rma incarnation of Vi·π£·πáu‚Äîand a serpentine inscription giving grammatical rules of the Sanskrit language. The finds, particularly the grammatical inscription, prompted Lele to describe the building as the Bhoj Shala or 'Hall of Bhoja' because King Bhoja (circa 1000-55) was the author of several works on poetics and grammar, among them the Sarasvatƒ´ka·πá·π≠hƒÅbhara·πáa or 'Necklace of Sarasvatƒ´'.R.

The term 'Bhoj Shala' was first published by Luard in 1908.C. E. Luard, Western States (MƒÅlwƒÅ). Gazetteer, 2 parts. The Central India State Gazetteer Series, vol. 5 (Bombay, 1908): part A, pp. 494-500; also Luard, Dhar and Mandu, p. 9 The subsequent controversy surrounding the building and its identity is discussed under Bhoj Shala. City Palace, built in 1875 =Cenotaphs and Old City Palace= Goddess AmbikƒÅ found on the site of the Old City Palace and now in the British Museum The old city palace of the Puar (Pawar) clan, a branch of the Marathas, is now used as a school. It is a modest building put up in the late 19th century around 1875. A marble statue of the Jain goddess AmbikƒÅ, found in 1875 on the site of the palace, is now in the British Museum.Kirit Mankodi, ‚ÄòA ParamƒÅra Sculpture in the British Museum: VƒÅgdevƒ´ or Yakshƒ´ AmbikƒÅ?‚Äô, Sambodhi 9 (1980-81): 96-103. Of the same period as the palace are a collection of domed cenotaphs of the Powar rulers on the edge of the large tank known as Mu√±j Talab. The name of the tank probably derives from VƒÅkpati Mu√±ja, the 10th- century ParamƒÅra king who first entered MƒÅlwa and made Ujjain his main seat.H. V. Trivedi, Inscriptions of the ParamƒÅras, Chandellas, KachchhapaghƒÅtas and Two Minor Dynasties, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, volume 7 (New Delhi, 1978-91): 9. Agency House in 2010 =Agency House= Another colonial building at DhƒÅr, located outside the old town on the road to Indore, is the Agency House. It was built by the Public Works Department and was the center of the administration of Dhar State and the Central India Agency.The only documentation is here: Agency House The building has been abandoned and is now in ruins. =Jheera Bagh= Jheera Bagh Palace, renovated 1940s Outside the town off the road to MƒÅ·πá·∏ç≈´, the Powars, built a palace at Hazƒ´ra BƒÅgh from the 1860s. Known as the Jheera BƒÅgh Palace and now run as a heritage hotel, the complex was renovated by MahƒÅrƒÅja Anand Rao Pawar IV in the 1940s. Graciously designed in an unpretentious art deco style, it is one of the most elegant and forward-looking examples of early modern architecture in North India.  Political history  The town of DhƒÅr, the name of which is usually derived from DhƒÅrƒÅ Nagara ('city of sword blades'), is of considerable antiquity, the first reference to it appearing in an inscription from Jaunpur belonging to the Maukhari dynasty.J. F. Fleet, Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their Successors, Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, vol. 3 (Calcutta, 1888): 228 (line 6). Hans T. Bakker, 'The So-Called Jaunpur Inscription of ƒ™≈õvaravarman', Indo-Iran Journal 2009; 50: 207-16 shows that inscription belongs not to ƒ™≈õvaravarman but to ƒ™≈õƒÅnavarman or one of his successors. Online abstract: http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/001972409x12525778274224 Despite this sixth century reference, DhƒÅr only rose to historical prominence when it was made the seat of the Paramara chiefs of Malwa by Vairisi·πÉha (circa 920-45 CE). He appears to have transferred his headquarters hither from Ujjain. During the rule of the ParamƒÅras, DhƒÅr became famous throughout India as a centre of culture and learning, especially under king Bhoja (circa 1000-1055). The wealth and splendor of DhƒÅr drew the attention of competing dynasties during the 11th century. The CƒÅ·∏∑ukyas of KalyƒÅ·πáa under Some≈õvara I (circa CE 1042-68) captured and burnt the city, also occupying MƒÅ·πá·∏ç≈´ (ancient MƒÅ·πá·∏çava).G. Yazdani, ed., The Early History of the Deccan, 2 vols. (London, 1960) 1: 331 according to the Nander inscription (dated CE 1047) and NƒÅgai inscription (dated CE 1058). Slightly later DhƒÅr was sacked by the CƒÅ·∏∑ukyas of GujarƒÅt under SiddharƒÅja.A. K. Majumdar, Chalukyas of Gujarat (Bombay, 1956): 72-3. The devastation and political fragmentation caused by these wars meant that no significant opposition was offered when Ala ud din Khilji, SultƒÅn of Delhi, dispatched an army to MƒÅlwa in the early 14th century. The region was annexed to Delhi and DhƒÅr made the capital of the province under 'Ayn al-Mulk M≈´ltƒÅnƒ´. He served as governor until 1313.Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui, Authority and Kingship under the Sultans of Delhi (Delhi, 2006): 283-84. The events that occurred during the following seventy years are unclear, but some time in A.H. 793/C.E. 1390-91 Dilawar Khan was appointed muq·π≠i' of DhƒÅr (and so the governor of MƒÅlwa) by Sul·π≠ƒÅn Mu·∏•ammad ShƒÅh.Day, Medieval Malwa, p. 13. DilƒÅwar KhƒÅn took the title 'Amƒ´d ShƒÅh DƒÅ'≈´d' and caused the khutba to be read in his name in A.H. 804/C.E. 1401-02, thereby establishing himself as an independent sul·π≠ƒÅn.Day, Medieval Malwa, p. 21. On his death in 1406, his son Hoshang Shah became king with his capital at MƒÅ·πá·∏ç≈´. Subsequently, in the time of Akbar, DhƒÅr fell under the dominion of the Mughals, in whose hands it remained until 1730 when it was conquered by the Marathas. In late 1723, Bajirao, at the head of a large army and accompanied by his trusted lieutenants, Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji Shinde (Scindia) and Udaji Rao Pawar, swept through Malwa. A few years earlier the Mughal Emperor had been forced to give the Marathas the right to collect Chauth taxes in Malwa and Gujarat. This levy added much value to the Marathas, as both the king Shahu and his Peshwa, Bajirao, were ear-deep in debt. The revenues they collected from their own lands were not sufficient to run the administration of the state and finance their large military expenditure. The Marathas lived by the sword and trade was alien to them. Agriculture in the Deccan depended heavily on the timeliness and sufficiency of the monsoons. The most important source of money was, therefore, the Chauth (a 25% tax on produce) and Sardeshmukhi (a ten per cent surcharge) exacted by the Marathas. The Maratha armies defeated the Mughal governor and attacked the capital Ujjain. Bajirao established military outposts in the country as far north as Bundelkhand. Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early part of the 19th century, the state was subject to a series of spoliations by Scindia of Gwalior and Holkar of Indore, (descendants of Ranoji Scindia and Malharao Holkar). It was only preserved from annihilation by the talents and courage of the adoptive mother of the fifth raja. =Dhar State= After the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1818, Dhar fell under the British rule. Dhar State became a princely state of British India, in the Bhopawar Agency of the Central India Agency. It included many Rajput and Bhil feudatories and had an area of . The state was confiscated by the British in the Revolt of 1857, but in 1860 was restored to Raja Anand Rao III Pawar, then a minor, with the exception of the detached district of Bairusia, which was granted to the Begum of Bhopal. Anand Rao, who received the personal title Maharaja and the KCSI in 1877, died in 1898; he was succeeded by Udaji Rao II Pawar. = Dhar Thikanas = A separate department to superintend Thakurs and Bhumias, entitled \\"Department of Thakurans, Bhumian and Thikanejat\\", was established in 1921, at which time there were 22 such estates in Dhar State. The nobles of Dhar holding jagir lands (feudatory estates), all of whom paid tribute to the Darbar, were divided between Thakurs and Bhumias. The Thakurs, with one exception, were Rajput landholders whose estates were located in the north of the state. Locally, the Thakurs were styled Talukdars and their holdings called kothari. By caste, there were 8 Rathor Rajputs, one Pawar and one Kayasth. The Bhumias or \\"Allodial\\" Chiefs were all Bhilalas, a clan claiming to be of mixed tribal Bhil people and Rajput (Chauhan) descent. Their grants were originally obtained from the Darbar on the understanding that they kept the peace among the Bhils and other wild hill tribes. They paid yearly tribute to the Darbar, while some received cash allowances (Bhet-Ghugri), an ancient feudal custom which has its origins in blackmail.abc = Political Representation and Royal Legacy = Bhartiya Janata Party politician Neena Vikram Verma serves as a Member of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly for Dhar Vidhan Sabha Constituency. In 2019 Chattar Singh Darbar of Bharatiya Janata Party had been elected as the Member of Parliament from Dhar constituency.

HH Maharaja Shrimant Hemendra Singh Rao Pawar of Dhar State seated on the 'Gadi' of the Kshatriya Maratha-Rajput Pawar (Puar/Parmar) Clan. The coronation of the 12th Maharaja of Dhar State was solemnised on 15 January 2015 at the 'Rajwada' (Old Palace) of Dhar.  Demographics  As of 2001 India census, Dhar had a population of 75,472. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Dhar has an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 76% and, female literacy is 63%. In Dhar, 14% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Postal information  In 1897 primitive stamps with entirely native text were issued.

Some of his better- known works were written in conjunction with the composers Franz Leh√°r, Emmerich K√°lm√°n, Oscar Straus, Paul Abraham, and Robert Stolz. After the Anschluss the family emigrated to the United States in 1940 via France. During World War II he was employed for a time with the Office of War Information translating American songs for transmission by radio to Germany. Alfred Gr√ºnwald worked for a theatrical agency before turning to libretto writing. A number of Gr√ºnwald's librettos were produced on Broadway. These included Countess Maritza (1926), The Yankee Princess (1922), The Circus Princess (1927), and The Duchess of Chicago (1929). He also wrote a number of comedies, including Dancing Partner (1930), written in collaboration with Alexander Engel and produced on Broadway by David Belasco. Besides writing over 40 operetta librettos, Alfred Gr√ºnwald also wrote non-musical plays, short stories, and newspaper articles, and was the theater critic for the Neue Wiener Journal. He was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. His son Henry Grunwald was a journalist and diplomat (US ambassador to Austria from 1988 to 1990).

He was the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kinross and Western Perthshire from October 1974 to 1983, and then for Perth and Kinross until his death in 1995. He was Solicitor General for Scotland from 1979 to 1982. Early life Nicholas Fairbairn was born on 24 December 1933, the third child and second son of Mary Ann More-Gordon and Ronald Fairbairn, the psychoanalyst. According to Fairbairn's autobiography A Life is Too Short (1987), his father adopted the maternal role after his mother rejected him at birth. Fairbairn describes their relationship from when he could converse with his father, for the next 20 years until old age affected his father, like that of twins with his father treating him as \\"his equal and confidant\\". Fairbairn credited this relationship as enabling him to \\"withstand the trauma and rejection I felt... enabled me to feel secure for the rest of my life against any rejection or misfortune... made me profoundly in awe of father figures and left me with a consistent feeling... that I am still a child.\\" Fairbairn also said he was named after Saint Nicholas as he was born on Christmas Eve. He was educated at Loretto School and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with an MA and an LLB. At the age of 23, he was called to the Scots Bar. In 1962 he married into the Scottish aristocracy--his wife, Hon. Elizabeth Mackay, was the daughter of the 13th Lord Reay. They divorced in 1979. He began in Conservative politics by standing in the Edinburgh Central seat (which had been a Labour-held marginal seat during the 1950s) in 1964 and 1966. Political career Fairbairn's career took off in the early 1970s. In 1972 he was appointed a Scottish Queen's Counsel (QC). After the former Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home announced his retirement from Parliament between the 1974 elections, Fairbairn was selected to succeed him. He won the seat in October 1974 with a majority of just 53 votes over the Scottish National Party. His right-wing views endeared him to Margaret Thatcher, and when she formed her Government after winning the 1979 general election she appointed him Solicitor-General for Scotland. On one occasion he wrote that the functions of this office were \\"to form a second pair of hands and often a first brain for the Lord Advocate\\". When the Conservatives were elected Fairbairn was the only Scottish QC in the Scottish Parliamentary Conservative Party, and it is thought that as a senior advocate of some considerable achievement in the criminal courts, he fully expected to be appointed Lord Advocate. However, his colourful opinions and reputation are thought to have impelled the then Lord Justice General, Lord Emslie, to tell Thatcher that the Scottish judiciary and legal profession were deeply opposed to having such a man as the senior law officer in Scotland. That led Thatcher to offer Fairbairn the secondary post of Solicitor-General for Scotland, and give the post of Lord Advocate to the then Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, J P H Mackay QC, who was then not even a member of the Conservative Party. Fairbairn was known at Parliament for his flamboyant Scottish baronial tartan dress. He always carried a silver miniature, working revolver on a chain attached to his belt. He was reputedly the only MP to use the House of Commons Parliamentary snuff box. He had a mistress, Pamela Milne, who attempted suicide at his London home in 1981. Just as it seemed he had managed to survive, a major controversy emerged in Glasgow. A prosecution was dropped in a case involving the gang rape and mutilation of a young woman after doctors determined she was too traumatized to serve as a credible witness. One journalist telephoned the Solicitor-General to ask why, and Fairbairn told him. This was a major breach of protocol, and Fairbairn had to resign. After a media campaign, a private prosecution was brought by the victim in 1982 under ancient Scottish law. It was known as the Carol X case. All three of the perpetrators were convicted, with one sentenced to 12 years in prison. In 1983, Fairbairn was elected an honorary Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, and he became a Trustee of the Royal Museums of Scotland in 1987. He was also President of the Society for the Preservation of Duddingston Village (an eastern suburb of Edinburgh). He called members of Throbbing Gristle \\"wreckers of civilisation\\" in 1976 in a row over public funding of the arts. He also criticised Scottish performers Simple Minds and Annie Lennox for taking part in the 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert in Wembley Stadium, describing them as \\"left-wing scum\\". Fairbairn was quoted: \\"These so-called stars like Annie Lennox and Jim Kerr are just out to line their own pockets.... and what Annie Lennox and Jim Kerr said at Wembley came out of no love for Nelson Mandela. It came from a desire to make money.\\" Fairbairn was knighted in 1988. Opinions He fiercely opposed capital punishment, after having himself appeared in 17 capital cases. He explained, \\"As the defending counsel, I am put on trial because, if I make a mistake, ask the wrong question or appear in the wrong way, the man may go to the trap\\". He was proud of obtaining two royal pardons for wrongful convictions of murder. In October 1994, along with Alan Clark and Edwina Currie, he immediately told Neil Hamilton to stand down when the cash for questions scandal broke. Hamilton refused to do so at first and resigned only when forced, five days after the scandal broke. During debates in 1994 regarding equality of age of consent for same and mixed-gender couples in the House of Commons, Fairbairn was called to order after starting a description of anal sex. (amending the Sexual Offences Act 1967 and the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980) He voted against equalising the age of consent in 1994 although earlier in his career had been a supporter of the Scottish Minorities Group. Outside Parliament, Fairbairn was a keen painter, and was occasionally spotted drawing cartoons of other MPs during Committee sessions. He was also a gifted landscape gardener, and renovated the crumbling Fordell Castle into a family home. Final years In 1983 he married Suzanne Mary Wheeler (1942-2002), known as Lady Sam Fairbairn, who was for 14 years the chatelaine of the 13th century Fordell Castle in Fife. She was born in British India in 1942, the daughter of a professional soldier, and spent her formative years in Kenya. Whilst still married to her first husband she first encountered Fairbairn in Edinburgh. She nursed Fairbairn during his illness with cirrhosis of the liver. He died in Dunfermline in 1995, aged 61. Soon after Fairbairn's death she learned that he had an illegitimate son, conceived during the early days of their marriage. \\"It makes mourning easier\\", she claimed at the time. She subsequently sold Fordell Castle, talked of reverting to her maiden name, and burnt Fairbairn's wardrobe of clothes. Later she was in dispute with Fairbairn's three daughters from an earlier marriage, whom, on his deathbed, he had cut out of his will. Her response was to give the children, including the \\"love-child\\", ¬£10,000 apiece and their pick of the castle's contents - and then disappear into hiding. In November 2007 Fordell Castle was sold for ¬£3,850,000. Fairbairn had stated that he would stand down as an MP at the next general election (which was eventually held in 1997), but the years of heavy drinking had finally had taken their toll and he died in office in 1995, aged 61. This triggered a by-election and his seat was gained by Roseanna Cunningham of the Scottish National Party. Posthumous allegations of child abuse and sexual assaults Though he was never charged with any offence, allegations of child molestation against Fairbairn emerged after his death. He was also posthumously accused of sexual assault against an adult female. It was also alleged that his name was included on a list of 'VIPs' who frequented a 'paedophile-friendly' guest house in London, however these specific claims are widely regarded as a hoax.

Earlier days  Leblanc was born in Ivoy le Pr√©, Cher, France on December 6 1742. His father, a minor official at an iron works, died in 1751. Leblanc was sent to Bourges to live with Dr. Bien, a close family friend. Under the influence of his guardian, Leblanc developed an interest in medicine. When Bien died in 1759, Leblanc enrolled at the √âcole de Chirurgie (College of Surgeons) in Paris to study medicine. Graduating with a master's degree in surgery, Leblanc opened a medical practice. He married in 1776, and the couple's first child followed three years later. Unable to provide adequately for his family on the medical fees he obtained from his patients, Leblanc in 1780 accepted a position as the private physician to the household of the Louis Philip II, Duke of Orl√©ans.  The Leblanc process  In 1775, the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize for a process whereby soda ash could be produced from salt. The French Academy wanted to promote the production of much-needed sodium carbonate from inexpensive sodium chloride. By 1791, Nicolas Leblanc had succeeded in producing sodium carbonate from salt by a 2-step process. In the first step, sodium chloride is mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatures of 800-900 ¬∞C; hydrogen chloride gas is evolved, leaving solid sodium sulfate. In the second step, the sodium sulfate is crushed, mixed with charcoal and limestone and again heated in a furnace. The prize was awarded to Nicolas Leblanc for a process which used sea salt and sulfuric acid as the raw materials. Later a plant (of his own) was in operation producing 320 tons of soda ash per year. The process, however, is now obsolete and is superseded by the extremely profitable and convenient Solvay process.  Final days  Two years later the plant was confiscated by the French revolutionary government, which refused to pay him the prize money he had earned ten years earlier. In 1802 Napoleon returned the plant (but not the prize) to him, but by then Leblanc could not afford to run it. He committed suicide by a gunshot to the head in 1806.  Legacy  William Losh visited Paris to study Leblanc's process. In 1807, Losh, Wilson and Bell opened the first alkali works in England that used the Leblanc process, at Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne.Grace's Guide: Walker Ironworks  Sources  * Novelguide  Bibliography  * *  References  Leblanc, Nicholas Leblanc, Nicholas Leblanc, Nicholas Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:Scientists who committed suicide Category:Suicides by firearm in France ","title":"Nicolas Leblanc"},{"id":"911252","text":"USS Virginia (SP-274) was a yacht in the United States Navy.

To avoid the confusion of having several ships of the same name, the Navy discarded her name and referred to her simply as SP-274, though references to her as Virginia (SP-274) in the Navy Register for 1918 indicate that she probably retained her name informally. Commissioned on 10 August 1917, SP-274 was assigned to the 9th Naval District section patrol; and, although the records are unclear, she probably operated out of Detroit, conducting patrols on Lake Michigan. She served until 12 August 1919, at which time her name was struck from the Navy Register; and, by 18 March 1920, she had sunk at the Detroit Dock. Here again, the records are unclear with regard to whether she sank before or after being struck. In any event, her sunken hulk was sold to J. A.

It has the largest newspaper circulation of all newspapers in New Zealand, peaking at over 200,000 copies in 2006, although circulation of the daily Herald had declined to 115,213 copies on average by December 2017. Its main circulation area is the Auckland region. It is also delivered to much of the north of the North Island including Northland, Waikato and King Country.  History  The New Zealand Herald was founded by William Chisholm Wilson, and first published on 13 November 1863. Wilson had been a partner with John Williamson in the New Zealander, but left to start a rival daily newspaper as he saw a business opportunity with Auckland's rapidly growing population. He had also split with Williamson because Wilson supported the war against the MƒÅori (which the Herald termed \\"the native rebellion\\") while Williamson opposed it. The Herald also promoted a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands. After the New Zealander closed in 1866 The Daily Southern Cross provided competition, particularly after Julius Vogel took a majority shareholding in 1868. The Daily Southern Cross was first published in 1843 by William Brown as The Southern Cross and had been a daily since 1862. Vogel sold out of the paper in 1873 and Alfred Horton bought it in 1876. In 1876 the Wilson family and Horton joined in partnership and The New Zealand Herald absorbed The Daily Southern Cross. In 1879 the United Press Association was formed so that the main daily papers could share news stories. The organisation became the New Zealand Press Association in 1942.Mark Derby. 'Newspapers - Growth and expansion, 1860‚Äì1900', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 13-Aug-14 URL: http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/newspapers/page-2 In 1892, the New Zealand Herald, Otago Daily Times, and Press agreed to share the costs of a London correspondent and advertising salesman. The New Zealand Press Association closed in 2011. The Wilson and Horton families were both represented in the company, known as Wilson & Horton, until 1996 when Tony O'Reilly's Independent News & Media Group of Dublin purchased the Horton family's interest in the company. The Herald is now owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment. That company is owned by Sydney-based APN News & Media and the Radio Network, owned by the Australian Radio Network. = Notable contributors = * Dita de Boni was a columnist for the newspaper, writing her first columns for the NZ Herald in 1995.

The broadsheet format was retained for the Saturday edition. = Organisational restructuring = In April 2007, APN NZ announced it was outsourcing the bulk of the Herald's copy editing to an Australian-owned company, Pagemasters. In November 2012, two months after the launch of its new compact format, APN News and Media announced it would be restructuring its workforce, cutting eight senior roles from across the Herald's range of titles.  Political stance and editorial opinion  The Herald is traditionally a centre-right newspaper, and was given the nickname \\"Granny Herald\\" into the 1990s. This changed with the acquisition of the paper by Independent News & Media in 1996, and today, despite remaining free enterprise oriented on economic matters such as trade and foreign investment, the Herald is generally editorially progressive on international geopolitics, diplomacy, and military matters, printing material from British newspapers such as The Independent and The Observer, and more recently, conservative newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph. The Herald stance on the Middle East is supportive of Israel, as seen most clearly in its 2003 censorship and dismissal of cartoonist Malcolm Evans following his submission of cartoons critical of Israel. In 2007, an editorial strongly disapproved of some legislation introduced by the Labour-led government, the Electoral Finance Act, to the point of overtly campaigning against the legislation.  Ethics incident  In July 2015, the New Zealand Press Council ruled that Herald columnist Rachel Glucina had failed to properly represent herself as a journalist when seeking comment from Amanda Bailey on a complaint she had made about Prime Minister John Key repeatedly pulling her hair when he was a customer at the cafe in which she worked. The Herald published Bailey's name, photo, and comments after she had retracted permission for Glucina to do so. The council said there was an \\"element of subterfuge\\" in Glucina's actions and that there was not enough public interest to justify her behaviour. In its ruling the council said that, \\"The NZ Herald has fallen sadly short of those standards in this case.\\" The Herald's editor denied the accusations of subterfuge. Glucina subsequently resigned from the newspaper.Australian Associated Press. \\"New Zealand Herald Used 'subterfuge' to Interview Woman Who Had Hair Pulled by John Key.\\" The Guardian.

It won Newspaper of the Year for the calendar years 2007 and 2009 and is New Zealand's second-highest-circulating weekly newspaper after the more established and conservative broadsheet, The Sunday Star-Times. In 2010, the Herald on Sunday started a campaign to reduce the legal blood alcohol limit for driving in New Zealand, called the \\"Two Drinks Max\\" campaign. The paper set up a campaign Facebook page, a Twitter account, and encouraged readers to sign up to the campaign on its own website.

Biography Peckham was born in Rensselaerville, New York in Albany County on December 20, 1809 to Peleg Benjamin (1762‚Äì1828) and Desire (Watson) Peckham (1767‚Äì1852). He graduated from Union College at Schenectady in 1827, where he was an early member of The Kappa Alpha Society, and after studying law was admitted to the bar in 1830. He served as the district attorney of Albany County from 1838 to 1841. Peckham was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from New York's 14th District, serving in the Thirty-third Congress from March 4, 1853, until March 3, 1855. During his term, he was the chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Revolutionary Claims. Peckham afterwards returned to legal practice in a partnership with Judge Lyman Tremain, until he was elected to serve as a justice of the New York Supreme Court for the Third Judicial District, from 1861 until 1869. He then sat as an associate judge on the New York Court of Appeals from July 4, 1870, until his death. It is believed that he was under consideration for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court at the time of his death. Peckham had three sons by his first wife, Isabella Adoline Lacey, who died on April 4, 1848 at the age of 35. Rufus Wheeler Peckham (1838-1909) followed in his namesake father's footsteps as a lawyer and in three of the positions that his father had held in New York: as the Albany district attorney (1869-1872), as a New York Supreme Court judge (1883-1886), and as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals (1886-1895). He remarried to Mary Elizabeth Foote (1830‚Äì1873). Sinking of the SS Ville du Havre The younger Peckham never went into Congress, however, but served on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1895 until his death. Peckham's oldest son, Wheeler Hazard Peckham (1833-1905), was also a lawyer who practiced in New York City. Wheeler was also nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court but the Senate failed to confirm him. Peckham had another son named Joseph Henry, who died at the age of 17 on April 2, 1852. Peckham and his second wife, Mary, were among 226 passengers and crew of the steamer SS Ville du Havre lost at sea, while the couple were en route to southern France to improve his failing health. The ship sank after colliding with the Scottish vessel Loch Earn in the north Atlantic Ocean on November 22, 1873; Peckham's last words were reported to be, \\"Wife, we have to die, let us die bravely.\\" His remains were never recovered, and a cenotaph was erected at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

In 1876, Robert published the first edition of his manual of parliamentary procedure, Robert's Rules of Order, which remains today the most common parliamentary authority in the United States. Life and career Robert was born in Robertville, South Carolina, and raised in Ohio, where his father moved the family because of his strong opposition to slavery. Robert's father, Reverend Joseph Thomas Robert, later became the first president of Morehouse College where there is a dormitory on the campus named after him. Robert was nominated to West Point from Ohio, and graduated fourth in his class in 1857. He became a military engineer. Under command of Silas Casey during the Pig War he built the fortifications on San Juan Island. In the American Civil War, he was assigned to the Corps of Engineers and worked on the defenses of Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and several New England ports. Robert served as Engineer of the Army's Division of the Pacific from 1867 to 1871. He then spent two years improving rivers in Oregon and Washington and six years developing the harbors of Green Bay and other northern Wisconsin and Michigan ports. He subsequently improved the harbors of Oswego, New York, Philadelphia, and Long Island Sound and constructed locks and dams on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. From 1890 to 1891 he served as a member of the Board of Commissioners for the District of Columbia. As Southwest Division Engineer from 1897 to 1901, Robert studied how to deepen the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. Robert was president of the Board of Engineers from 1895 to 1901. He received a tombstone promotion to brigadier general on April 30, 1901, and was appointed Chief of Engineers. He served until May 2, 1901, when he retired from the Army. Following his retirement, he chaired a board of engineers that designed the Galveston, Texas seawall following the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. He died in Hornell, New York, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He is most famous for his Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies (later known as \\"Robert's Rules of Order\\") ‚Äîa collection of rules regarding parliamentary procedure, published in 1876. He wrote the manual in response to his poor performance in leading a church meeting that erupted into open conflict because of concerns about local defense at the First Baptist Church, 149 William Street in New Bedford, Massachusetts. He resolved that he would learn about parliamentary procedure before attending another meeting. The rules are loosely based on procedures used in the United States House of Representatives, but the rule book was not intended for use in national and state legislatures.

Early life Peckham was born in Albany, New York, on New Year's Day, 1833 to Rufus Wheeler Peckham and Isabella Adoline; his mother died when he was 15. He was educated at The Albany Academy and at his father's alma mater, Union College, where he joined The Kappa Alpha Society before leaving early due to poor health. Peckham studied law at his father's partnership with Lyman Tremain and was also among the first students to attend Albany Law School. Peckham then left New York to practice in the northwestern United States, where he became what the New York Times called \\"one of the best known attorneys in that part of the country.\\"Wheeler H. Peckham's Career: An Upright and Able Lawyer Who Has Served the Public Well. New York Times, January 23, 1894. Legal practice Poor health caused him to return to New York City in 1867, where he established the firm of Miller & Peckham and gained fame first as a constitutional lawyer, and later as a special prosecutor for the State. He was involved in the unsuccessful prosecution of Mayor A. Oakey Hall in 1872, and also prosecuted former Tammany Hall leader \\"Boss\\" Tweed with Tremain in 1873. Peckham again represented the State against Tweed in 1876, when he won a $6 million verdict in a civil fraud suit. Championed by his brother and businessman Daniel Manning, Peckham was appointed by Governor Grover Cleveland as New York County District Attorney on November 30, 1883, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John McKeon, despite pressure from a barrage of applicants. However, Peckham tendered his resignation a mere eight days after taking the oath of office, citing ill health. He then returned to private practice in the Wall Street offices of Miller, Peckham & Dixon, where he focused primarily on civil practice. Peckham also served as the President of the New York City Bar Association from 1892 to 1894. Nomination to U.S. Supreme Court In 1894, Cleveland, who was then in his nonconsecutive second term as President, nominated Peckham to replace Samuel Blatchford on the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the nomination was caught in the middle of a political tug-of-war between Cleveland and New York Senator David B. Hill, and Wheeler became the second nominee of Cleveland that Hill managed to block, by a vote of 41-32 on February 16, 1894. Senator Edward Douglass White was instead confirmed to the Court. By the time another seat on the Court was vacant after the death of Howell E. Jackson in 1895, Hill had been weakened politically, and Cleveland turned to Wheeler's brother, Rufus, who was confirmed within six days. Social role Peckham was one of the most famed New York City lawyers of his time, and an active participant in New York City politics and society. He presided over social events as a member and president of the City Club, and he advocated for reform of \\"municipal degradation:\\" > The issue is simply one of men. You cannot remedy matters by law nor by > system, you have got to remedy it by the simple expedient of turning out the > maladministrators and putting in their places men who are honest and > capable.

Acting Constructor William A. Graves, CSN, was the superintendent in charge of her construction. In order to conserve scarce iron plating, he ordered the ship's armored casemate shortened from the specifications given in John L. Porter's original building plans; in addition, the ship's iron-plating, while six inches thick on the casemate's forward face, was reduced to five inches on her port, starboard, and aft faces. Due to the shortening of her casemate, the number of her cannon were reduced to a single 11\\" smoothbore, a single 8\\" rifle, and two 6.4\\" rifles. The Virginia II was named after the more famous Confederate ironclad, CSS Virginia, also called the Merrimack because of the ship's origins as a Union frigate. The original Virginia's success at the Battle of Hampton Roads caused \\"gunboat associations\\" to emerge around the South, mainly driven by women; their efforts helped with the construction of the Virginia II.Coski, Capital Navy, 82. Construction Money to help with the construction of this ironclad was largely contributed by the Richmond chapter of the \\"Ladies Aid and Defense Society\\" (called the \\"National Defense Association\\"), which adopted the ironclad in early April 1862 for the defense of Richmond. The chairman was Maria Gaitskell Clopton. It is estimated that the society contributed more than $30,000 towards Virginia IIs construction.Coski, Capital Navy, 82‚Äì85 By November 1862, John Mercer Brooke was able to report that she was \\"pretty well advanced, frames up, clamps in, etc...She will be a strong and fine vessel.\\" However, after this promising start, significant delays plagued the new ironclad. It was not until more than a year after she was laid down that Virginia II was finally launched without incident on June 29, 1863. \\"She glided into the water 'like a thing of life' amid the prolonged cheers of the spectators.\\"Coski, Capital Navy, 86 However, she suffered from further fitting-out delays and was not fully commissioned until May 18, 1864, almost a year later; she was made the flagship of the James River Squadron (replacing CSS Richmond in this role).Coski, Capital Navy, 153,156 Career Virginia II went into action on June 21, 1864 as the flagship of Commodore John K. Mitchell, CSN, during the engagement between the Confederate James River Squadron and Federal ships in Trent's Reach. But the ironclad developed mechanical problems when an errant chain from the nearby CSS Richmond became entangled in her propeller, and she could no longer participate in the battle.Coski, Capital Navy, 165‚Äì166 On August 13, the Virginia II participated in the attack on the Union forces at Dutch Gap. The Canonicus-class monitor, USS Saugus, and her gunboats joined in the battle, but could not effectively train their guns, though they did manage to fire two shots that hit Virginia II.Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, 735 On August 17, she participated in the capture of Signal Hill, shelling the Union defenses from 3 p.m. until 9 p.m. before finally ceasing fire.Coski, Capital Navy, 167 From September 29 through October 1, the Virginia II and the rest of the squadron attacked New Market Heights and Fort Harrison in conjunction with the Confederate Army; it was the largest operation north of the James River since Cold Harbor and would remain so until the end of the war. Once again, though, the Virginia II suffered difficulty, delaying her entrance into the battle. She had just received a new cannon, and in the rush to leave the dock, the supply ship Gallego became entangled in her anchor chain, causing the Gallego to sink.Coski, Capital Navy, 168 In their routine patrol of the James River, the squadron was surprised to discover, on the morning of October 22, that the Union Army had finished fortifying Cox Hill. To cover the retreat of the Confederate wooden vessels, Virginia II approached the battery, followed by two ironclads, and effected a retreat upstream to Chaffin's Bluff.Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, 736‚Äì737 During this, the Virginia IIs smokestack was riddled by shells.Coski, Capital Navy, 171 Though caught by surprise, this small action helped determine the effectiveness of the ironclads' armored casemates against close rifled cannon fire, and in the case of the Virginia II, the results were favorable: her casemate withstood 7 direct hits by 100-pound conical iron \\"bolts,\\" which barely dented her plating. On December 7 Virginia II, along with the Fredericksburg and Richmond, steamed down to Fort Brady near Trent's Reach and near sunset exchanged cannon fire with the fort until darkness fell.Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, 738 =Battle of Trent's Reach= Site of the sinking of Virginia II and other ships in the James River. The part showing above water is from CSS Jamestown. (Photograph by Mathew Brady) Her final action took place on January 23‚Äì24, 1865 when the Confederate squadron in the James River, including ironclads CSS Richmond, and CSS Fredericksburg, with five smaller vessels, made a second unsuccessful attempt to circumvent obstructions in Trent's Reach. A reliable report indicated there was a passage through, as a result of a freshet of melting ice. To avoid the risk of collision, the gunboats and tenders were lashed to the starboard sides of the ironclads; Virginia II accreted to her bulk the gunboats Nansemond and Torpedo, with the torpedo boat Scorpion in tow. After passing the Union batteries at Fort Brady sometime after 8 p.m., the Virginia II accidentally beached Torpedo by cutting too close to the shore. The captain of Nansemond untied his ship from Virginia II in an attempt to free Torpedo. The fleet continued on and reached the obstructions at Trent's Reach.Coski, Capital Navy, 198‚Äì207Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, 740‚Äì742 Again Virginia II ran into trouble, this time running aground; the smaller ships tried to free her for three hours. Only two ships made it through, the rest were either running aground or helping the ones that had already run aground. Dawn came with most of the squadron in full view of the Union fortifications at Battery Parsons, and they had to suffer fire until the water rose high enough to allow them to finally retreat. In late morning, just as the water was high enough to re-float Virginia II, the Union fleet arrived and added its firepower. This time it was much more deadly: the double-turreted monitor USS Onondaga was able to pierce her armor with its shot. Virginia II and the rest of the squadron retreated upstream until they were safely under the cover of Confederate Battery Dantzler. They attempted to run past again that night, but Union soldiers had erected a huge light illuminating the obstructions; this, combined with several other factors, forced the attempt to be abandoned. While leaving, Hampton managed to entangle her screw propeller in Virginia II's anchor chain. They suffered more heavy fire on their return upriver from Fort Brady, and Virginia II ran aground again before making it to the safety of Chaffin's Bluff. Virginia II had at least 6 killed and more than a half dozen wounded from the action; she also suffered heavy battle damage which required extensive repairs.Scharf, History of the Confederate States Navy, 741 Her smokestack was destroyed, the engines became faulty, and her iron armor and underlying wooden framework were damaged. Destruction of Virginia II Her repairs had just been completed when Virginia II and the other Confederate warships of the James River Squadron were ordered destroyed by squadron commander Admiral Raphael Semmes to prevent their capture by rapidly advancing Union forces during the evacuation and fall of Richmond on April 3, 1865. Following the war's end, most of the wreck of Virginia II was raised for salvage.

He spent time with the Taliban and the Northern Alliance pre 9/11, the CIA during the hunt for Bin Laden and also with both insurgents and Blackwater security contractors during the war in Iraq Pelton's regularly published survival and political guide The World's Most Dangerous Places, provides practical and survival information for people who work and travel in high-risk zones, and is a New York Times bestseller. With the book's bestseller status, Pelton became an expert on work and travel in \\"high-risk\\" environments and he routinely provides survival advice on high-risk regions and political \\"analysis\\" of the conflicts he has visited. He was also host of the Discovery Travel Channel series entitled Robert Young Pelton's The World's Most Dangerous Places from 1998 to 2003. Now residing in Los Angeles, Pelton currently writes books, and produces documentaries on conflict-related subjects and documentaries. Pelton is also a frequent television and magazine interview subject, appearing as a raconteur of his various adventures and safety tips on venues as diverse as Oprah, Conan O'Brien, CNN, Fox, BBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, and others. Pelton is a regular commentator on Fox News, Coast to Coast, and other in-depth programs, providing insight and background on breaking news. Early life Pelton was born July 25, 1955, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At age 10, he attended Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School in Selkirk, Manitoba. Career At age 17, Pelton began in the Toronto mailroom of the ad agency BBDO before being promoted to copywriter. He then worked for various multimedia companies that did product launches, which led to him working for Apple Inc., where he worked on the Lisa and later the Macintosh launch. His first break as a writer came in 1991, when he reported on the Camel Trophy, an annual competition by Land Rover across difficult terrain in Africa. Pelton competed for the U.S. team and published his account in Soldier of Fortune. In 1993, Pelton purchased the name to the Fielding's Travel Guide from William Morrow and Company and published some traditional guides that were refocused toward younger, independent travelers. Pelton licensed databased travel content to companies such as Microsoft and IBM, selling his businesses to turn full-time to conflict coverage in the mid 1990s. He began with a two-book deal from Random House (The Adventurist and Come Back Alive), a television series from Discovery called Robert Young Pelton's The World's Most Dangerous Places, and a major web event with ABC News called Dangerous Places. Pelton created the concept of \\"solo\\" or \\"solo journalist\\". someone who provides text, video, photos, and audio from remote regions without support. He founded the website Dangerous Magazine at which he published his own and other writers' articles about adventure travel. In January 2003, Pelton was on assignment for National Geographic Adventure in the Dari√©n Gap when two 22-year-old travelers and he were abducted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. The trio was held in the jungle for 10 days before being released. Pelton contributed to National Geographic Adventure as both a contributing editor and a columnist from January 2001 to 2007. In December 2007, he released an article on Blackwater Worldwide. He was involved in negotiations with the President of Equatorial Guinea regarding the early release of coup plotters Simon Mann and Nick du Toit, who had worked for Executive Outcomes in the mid-1990s. The story was documented in the May 2008 Men's Journal article \\"How to Stage a Coup\\". In 2006, Pelton teamed up with Eason Jordan, former head of international news for CNN, and several others to launch Iraq Slogger, a clearinghouse of news and information coming out of Iraq during the Iraq War. The site was intended to aggregate articles by both foreign correspondents and Iraqi journalists, as well as nonprofessionals. According to Pelton, the site had insufficient income and ceased operations in 2009. In December 2008, Pelton travelled the Horn of Africa with both pirates and an antipiracy crew researching the piracy and antipiracy industry. In January 2009, Pelton resumed immersion-style coverage by going inside the U.S. Army's controversial Human Terrain System. Around that time, he also spent a year as an advisor to NATO's Afghanistan commander. In 2008, Pelton and Jordan founded AfPax Insider, a newsgathering and research service in Afghanistan and Pakistan modeled on Iraq Slogger. The venture provided free content on its website and was partially funded by the U.S. military. Controversy arose when a Defense Department official who was operating an unauthorized spy ring allegedly diverted funds that were intended to pay AfPax. According to Jordan, the venture never had a \\"full-fledged launch\\" into offering a premium subscription service to private clients, and due to insufficient funding, remained a free website until it became inactive in August 2009. ;Somalia Report In 2011, Pelton created Somalia Report. With assistance from around 140 locals and western editors, Pelton provided ground coverage of al-Shabaab, pirates, governments, contractors, intelligence groups, and regular people on a 24/7 information website. ;Migrant Report In June 2015, Pelton started publishing the Migrant Report to track the movement of refugees and migrants. The venture was sponsored by a non-profit organization in Malta. and provided in depth coverage from Libya, Myanmar and Bangladesh. =Books= ;The World's Most Dangerous Places Pelton's first major writing project was his self- published guide to conflict The World's Most Dangerous Places. At over 1,000 pages, the book was written in the style of a travel guide, with a humorous tone. The first edition was written in 1993; it currently is in its fifth edition from Harper Resource. ;The Adventurist The Adventurist is Pelton's autobiography that covers his childhood and an assortment of later travel experiences around the world up until 1999. ;Come Back Alive A real-world survival guide, it is written in a humorous style. ;Hunter, Hammer and Heaven, Three Worlds Gone Mad A 2002 book on Pelton's journey into three wars in three tiny countries Chechnya, Sierra Leone and Bougainville, which were examples of a jihad against the Russians, a mercenary war for resources, and an ecowar to preserve a native lifestyle. ;Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror Pelton has written about contemporary private military contractors (Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror), as well as his experiences with US Special Forces in the opening weeks in the War on Terror. Of Licensed to Kill, one reviewer summarized: \\"His is a journalistic story- quilt of characters engaged as private security contractors and mercenaries in a variety of settings from Afghanistan to Equatorial Guinea.... The pages turn... because Pelton's stories are intrinsically interesting.\\"Peter J. Woolley, \\"Soldiers of Fortune,\\" in The Common Review (Spring 2007), pp. 46‚Äì8; or http://www.thecommonreview.org/fileadmin/template/tcr/pdf/TCR54.pdf Retrieved December 27, 2011. The book was reviewed by author and filmmaker Sebastian Junger (\\"An incredible look into the murky and virtually impenetrable world of private military contractors . . . Pelton may well have seen the future.\\") and terrorism expert Peter Bergen (\\"A rollicking read that takes the reader inside the murky world of military contractors‚Äîfrom the craggy passes of the Afghan-Pakistan border, to the extreme danger of Baghdad's airport road, to the diamond fields of Africa. Licensed to Kill is not only a great travelogue, [but] it also has some important things to say about the brave new world of privatized violence\\"). ;Raven Raven, Pelton's only novel, is a fictionalized account of his early life interwoven with experiences in the Pacific Northwest. ;Civilian Warriors In July 2013, Pelton stated in an interview with Spy Talk's Jeff Stein that Erik Prince had come to him to fix a ghostwritten autobiography that Prince had been unsuccessfully trying to publish since February 2008 with Regnery and again in 2010 with Simon & Schuster. According to the interview, Pelton rewrote Prince's book, hired a fact checker to remove numerous plagiarized passages from the previous writers and dissuaded Prince from self-publishing, getting Prince a US$1 million advance from Adrian Zackheim at Penguin Publishing. According to the Washington Post, Prince tried to block Pelton's ownership and copyright by suing Pelton in Federal court, initially alleging Pelton had stolen his book and then filed urgent papers, demanding that the federal court in Virginia, under presiding Judge Leonie Brinkema, dismiss Prince's case before it was brought to a jury trial. Pelton then sued Prince in Loudon County with a court case scheduled for December 2017. =Magazines= In late 2001, Pelton began writing feature stories for National Geographic Adventure and then continued writing a column until 2009 entitled, \\"Pelton's World\\" for National Geographic Adventure. His feature stories for National Geographic covered his journeys into Afghanistan, Iraq and Colombia. Pelton has been profiled in numerous magazines including The World's Most Dangerous Friend by Tim_Cahill_(writer) in Men's Journal covering topics such as Blackwater, the U.S. military Human Terrain System, South African mercenaries, and American military volunteers in rebel-held Burma. He also has written about his time with Somali pirates and maritime antipiracy security teams for Bloomberg Businessweek and security contractors in Iraq for Popular Mechanics. Saving South Sudan In May 2014, Vice magazine released a multimedia event which featured Pelton traveling with photographer Tim Freccia and with a former Lost Boy, Machot Lap Thiep, to South Sudan at the height of the fighting. It was the first time in Vice's 21-year history that a single author and single photographer created an entire issue on one topic. The 130-page, 50,000-word article was also released online and in conjunction with a three-part, 40-minute documentary. A documentary film entitled Saving South Sudan accompanied the article. =Graphic novels= Artist Billy Tucci illustrated and wrote a 64-page illustrated novel entitled Roll Hard based on one of Pelton's chapters in Licensed to Kill. The book documents the true story of a team of Blackwater misfits who must travel up and down the most dangerous road in Iraq. Pelton rode every mission with the team for a month, which routinely came under attack. After Pelton left the team, they were hit by an IED with one fatality and a number wounded. Wired magazine described it as \\"At a time when comics are still dominated by busty babes, zombies and superheroes wearing tights, Pelton and Tucci's gritty, journalistic portrayal of America's fighters-for-hire is a profound departure.\\" Publishers Weekly described the book: \\"While that's a prime setup for endless scenes of action-movie carnage, the narrative instead focuses on the men as professionals and what makes them put their lives on the line for a daily payout around $600. It's that spotlight on the humanity of the contractors that makes this an engaging read, and artist Tucci (Sgt. Rock: The Lost Battalion) turns in understated, realistic artwork that is among the finest of his career. While the role of contractors in the Iraq conflict is controversial, this gives it a human face.\\" =Interviews= One of the cornerstones of Pelton's quests has been to track down, meet with, and interview some of the world's most dangerous and wanted men. A partial list of Pelton's interviews: * John Walker Lindh \\"The American Taliban\\" (Captured by Northern Alliance forces and rescued by Pelton) * Al Qaeda, in both Europe and Afghanistan, documented in his book Hunter, Hammer and Heaven and his TV special on Afghanistan * Taliban leadership in Afghanistan in their first television interview (including Mullah Omar, who would only allow his voice to be recorded) * Ahmed Shah Massoud and the Northern Alliance leadership in the Panjshir Valley * Abdul Rashid Dostum * Erik Prince, former owner of Blackwater USA * \\"Mono Jojoy\\", Manuel Marulanda, Alfonso Cano, and the top FARC leadership in Colombia * Hashim Salamat leader of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in the Southern Philippines * Aleksey Galkin of the Russian GRU (captured and tortured by Chechen rebels and implicated Russia in the bombing of apartment buildings that led to the second war in Chechnya) * Imprisoned South African mercenary Nick du toit and President Obiang of Equatorial Guinea during his attempts to free Nick from a 33-year prison sentence for attempting to overthrow the country * The leadership of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, t he right-wing death squads of Colombia * The Chechen, Georgian, and Turkish mafia * Francis Ona, the self- proclaimed \\"King of Meekamui\\" on the island of Bougainville * Leadership of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy in Liberia * Kamajors in Sierra Leone * President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea * The SPLA in Southern Sudan * Drug organizations in Colombia and Peru * Leadership of Communist rebels in the Philippines * General Bo Mya of the Karen 5th Brigade of Kawthoolei, Burma * \\"Tha-U-Wa-A-Pa\\" or the \\"Father of the White Monkey\\", the director of Free Burma Rangers, Burma * Asad Abdullahi (Farah Hirsi Kulan \\"Booyah\\") -one of the original three pirate \\"kings\\", Somalia * Abdirahman Mohamud Farole, President of Puntland * SSNA leader Riek Machar and Odorah Choul, the leader of the White Army during the taking of Malakal, South Sudan: According to Humanosphere, Pelton interviewed Machar in his bush headquarters and was present at the fall of Malakal with Tim Freccia = Rebel, Jihadi and Insurgent Groups = In order to gain access, Pelton has spent an unusual amount of time living with, traveling with and documenting some of the world's best known insurgent groups. Some of the groups Pelton has lived with and interviewed include, the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the LURD in Liberia, MILF in the Southern Philippines, Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Southern Sudan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the FARC and AUC in Colombia, the Chechen rebels and the Karen National Liberation Army, the Karen National Union and the Free Burma Rangers in Burma His access and interviews initially were to create The World's Most Dangerous Places. His unusual and death-defying efforts to get this access soon then morphed into his TV series and then into a series of other books and film projects. Pelton has shown how he gets access and world exclusive interviews in his TV series The World's Most Dangerous Places for the Discovery Channel, investigating and reporting from the inside the drug business in Colombia and Peru, the mafia in Georgia and Turkey, and bounty hunting in Mexico. =Television series= Pelton executive produced and hosted seven one-hour specials for Discovery (these aired on The Travel Channel which at the time was owned by Discovery Communications) from 1998 until 2003. According to the site The World's Most Dangerous Places (which has video clips and a timeline), this was the line up of Pelton's series: 1) \\"The Crescent and the Cross\\" ‚Äì first footage of a new communist rebel group on the island of Negros (New People's Army), the MILF, pirates, a Crucifixion and Pelton tracks down the most wanted man in the Philippines, the man who killed Special Forces legend Nick Rowe 2) \\"The Lion of the Panjshir\\" ‚Äì Pelton enters Afghanistan to find Ahmed Shah Massoud and then he enters the war on both sides. First with the Northern Alliance and then the feared Taliban 3) \\"Home of the Brave\\" ‚Äì A journey through America on a motorcycle to find rebels, revolutionaries and militias. Pelton visits with country & western singer Willie Nelson, Native American activist Russell Means, motorcycle icon Peter Fonda and finds an American jihadi Aukai Collins who trained in terrorist training camps run by Osama bin Laden 4) \\"Inside Afghanistan\\" ‚Äì In his first post 9/11 show Pelton re-enters Afghanistan, this time he is only outside witness to war with a Special Forces team that fights on horseback with a brutal warlord, General Rashid Dostum. He is in the battle of Qali Jangi and finds an American jihadi named John Walker Lindh, introducing the world to the first American al Qaeda member ever interviewed on the battlefield 5) \\"Inside Liberia\\" ‚Äì Pelton enters a little-known war in which he is surrounded by armed child soldiers in a brutal fight to the death. The rag tag LURD rebels and Pelton's group is surrounded by the violent forces of Charles Taylor. Pelton becomes close to the Small Boys Unit, a group of child soldiers, and we meet \\"Survival\\", a 5-year-old gun-toting killer who befriends Pelton. 6) \\"Inside Colombia\\" ‚Äì Pelton is the first outside to interview and meets with the leaders Manuel Marulanda, Ra√∫l Reyes, Mono Jojoy, Alfonso Cano of the deadly left wing FARC rebel group. Barely escaping being kidnapped by Mono Jojoy at a drunken party, Pelton then switches sides and searches for the right wing AUC death squads. While waiting he provides a rare inside view on the cocaine trade from growing to picking to processing the final product 7) \\"Kidnapped\\" ‚Äì Pelton intended to be back from vacation to film a show about 9/11 in America but was kidnapped. His footage of the brutal kidnap is interwoven with previous trips to Grozny, Chechnya where he interviews a captured Russian spy Aleksey Galkin, then to Uganda, where a bomb explodes under the table where Pelton had been sitting an hour earlier. Pelton then spends a long bloody night in Kampala, Uganda at other bomb sites trying to save shattered victims before heading to meet the SPLA in Southern Sudan and finally Peru in which Pelton's journey inside the drug war is cut short when he is hit and seriously injured by a car while riding his motorcycle on a mountain road Although the WMDP series under Discovery's Steve Cheskin was renewed for another 8 shows, Pelton's series of specials was cancelled by Discovery after Pelton left for Iraq. =Documentaries= Pelton produced \\"House of War\\" with award-winning documentary director Paul Yule to document the largest and most bloody battle in Operation Enduring Freedom, the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi. Pelton went to Iraq to cover the war for ABC Investigative and then led a search for a find of chemical tipped rockets for CBS's 60 Minutes. Pelton eventually chose to stay along the Syrian border with insurgents and later document evidence of mass graves around the country, traveling in a red Bentley previously owned by Uday Hussein. Pelton would return to Iraq in late 2004 to live with a Blackwater USA security team running Route Irish in Baghdad while researching his book Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror. National Geographic TV hired Pelton to go inside the world of private security contractors for the film Iraq: Guns For Hire. His documentary for Vice was the first time the White Army had been filmed in combat and the first interview with Riek Machar and his wife after they fled to the bush. The film was part of a web event that was released with an entire issue on South Sudan and Pelton's trip published by Vice. Pelton continues to be featured in a number of upcoming documentaries on a diverse variety of subjects that range from mercenaries, child soldiers, Private military company and conflict. They are a diverse selection including \\"Iraq for Sale\\" by Robert Greenwald, Shadow Company by Nick Bicanic, \\"Weapons of Mass Deception\\" by Danny Schechter, \\"Children at War\\" and \\"Bounty Hunting\\" by Bobby Williams as well as news documentaries and interviews by Al Jazeera, CNN, Dan Rather and many others. He currently is directing and editing a 90-minute film shot at sea focusing on the rescue of migrants at sea by the Migrant Offshore Aid Station. =Joseph Kony expedition= In 2013, Pelton launched a crowd funded campaign to raise money for an expedition to locate Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, but the effort failed after only about $10,000 was raised. =Migrant Offshore Aid Station= As of 2014, Pelton has been a strategic advisor to Christopher and Regina Catrambone, the founders of the Search and Rescue NGO Migrant Offshore Aid Station or MOAS. In addition to advising the charity, Pelton arranged feature profile articles in Sunday Times, New York Times, Time, The Guardian, Bloomberg Businessweek, Outside and global TV coverage on board the Phoenix and Responder. Pelton also provided on the ground research on migrant conditions in camps, prisons along with in depth interviews with smugglers and mapped human trafficking networks in Libya, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Thailand and Europe.

Kass is best known as a proponent of liberal education via the \\"Great Books,\\" as a critic of human cloning, life extension, euthanasia and embryo research, and for his tenure as chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005. Although Kass is often referred to as a bioethicist,\\"Leon Kass,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2009. he eschews the term and refers to himself as \\"an old- fashioned humanist. A humanist is concerned broadly with all aspects of human life, not just the ethical.\\"Leon Kass, interviewed by Francis Wilkinson, Discover, February 2008. Kass is currently the Addie Clark Harding Professor Emeritus in the College and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago and the Hertog Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. His books include Toward A More Natural Science: Biology and Human Affairs; The Hungry Soul: Eating and the Perfecting of our Nature; Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics; The Beginning of Wisdom: Reading Genesis; and What So Proudly We Hail: The American Soul in Story, Speech, and Song. \\"For his students and readers,\\" Yuval Levin summarizes, \\"Leon Kass has laid out a path of inquiry showing that those questions that bedevil us most today have been with us for countless generations, and have to do not with the latest modern excess, but with man‚Äôs unchanging nature, wants, needs, and potential. It is a path...that opens with a question: How does man thrive?\\"Yuval Levin, quoted in \\"A Guide to the Work of Leon Kass,\\" Great Thinkers, Early life and education Kass was born in Chicago to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He described his family as \\"Yiddish speaking, secular, socialist.\\"NOW with Bill Moyers. Transcript. Bill Moyers Talks with Leon Kass. 7.25.03  PBS Although his upbringing was not religious, it was moralist: \\"Morality, not Judaism, was the religion of our home, morality colored progressively pink with socialism, less on grounds of Marxist theory, more out of zeal for social justice and human dignity.\\"Quoted in Harvey Flaumenhaft, \\"The Career of Leon Kass,\\" Journal of Contemporary Health Law and Policy 20 (2003). He would not begin to explore his religious heritage until later in his career Kass enrolled in the University of Chicago at age 15, graduating from the College with a degree in biology in 1958. The College was well known for its extensive core curriculum, and Kass studied the \\"great books\\" then prescribed by Chicago's core. \\"I became a devotee of liberal education . . . with a special fondness for the Greeks.\\" He graduated from the University of Chicago's medical school in 1962 and, following an internship in medicine at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, completed a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Harvard University in 1967, working in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Konrad Bloch.\\"Kass, Leon R.,\\" Current Biography (August 2002). Around this time Kass began to develop an interest in morality in medicine and in bio medical ethics, instigated partly as a result of reading Rousseau's Discourse on the Arts and Sciences. In 1961, Kass married the former Amy Apfel, a fellow graduate of the College of the University of Chicago. As instructors in the College in later years, they would frequently teach seminars together.Mary Ruth Yoe, \\"Popping the Question: Is There Love at First Sight?\\" University of Chicago Magazine 92, no. 4 (April 2000). Their scholarly collaborations include several articles on marriage and courtship and a reader on the subject. In 2011, they published a joint project, What So Proudly We Hail, that uses literature to examine the American soul. Amy Kass died of complications from ovarian cancer and leukemia on August 19, 2015. Leon and Amy Kass went to Holmes County, Mississippi, during the summer of 1965 to do civil rights work. Working with the Medical Community for Human Rights and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), the Kasses \\"lived with a farmer couple in the Mount Olive community, in a house with no telephone, hot water, or indoor toilet. They visited many families in the community, participated in their activities, and helped with voter registration and other efforts to encourage the people to organize themselves in defense of their rights.\\" Later that fall, Kass wrote a letter to his family and friends detailing his and his wife's experiences and appealing to them to donate to the Civil Rights Movement. The character of the rural, poor, and uneducated African Americans with whom they lived and worked contrasted with his colleagues at Harvard and other elite universities. It was this experience, he later said, that > caused me to shed my enlightenment faith and ultimately begin a journey in > which Jewish thought would ultimately come to play a more prominent part. > Why, I wondered then, was there more honor, decency, and dignity among the > impoverished and ignorant but church-going black farmers with whom we had > lived than among my privileged and educated fellow graduate students at > Harvard, whose progressive opinions I shared but whose self-absorption and > self-indulgence put me off. If poverty and superstition were the cause of > bad character, how to explain this? First forays into bioethics After completing his doctorate, Kass conducted molecular biology research for the National Institutes of Health, authoring several scientific papersCurriculum vitae, John M. Olin Center for Inquiry into the Theory and Practice of Democracy, University of Chicago, 1999. while serving in the U.S. Public Health Service. His early interest in bioethics was stimulated by Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and C. S. Lewis's The Abolition of Man, both of which he read at the suggestion of Harvey Flaumenhaft. In these books, Kass saw examples of \\"how the scientific project to master nature could, if we are not careful, lead to our dehumanization, via eugenics, drug- induced contentment, and other transformations of human nature, possibilities already foreseeable in the new biology. . . . Will man remain a creature made in the image of God, aspiring to align himself with the divine, or will he become an artifact created by man in the image of God-knows-what, fulfilling the aspirations only of human will? . . . I soon shifted my career from doing science to thinking about its human meaning.\\" In 1967, Kass read an article by Joshua Lederberg in the Washington Post suggesting that humans could one day be cloned, permitting the perpetuation of the genotypes of geniuses.Joshua Lederberg, \\"Unpredictable Variety Still Rules Human Reproduction,\\" Washington Post, September 30, 1967. In a letter to the editor, Kass made a moral case against cloning and suggested that \\"the programmed reproduction of man will, in fact, dehumanize him.\\" Thus began a second career of writing on bioethics, including essays on organ transplantation, genetic screening, in vitro fertilization, cloning, the conquest of aging, assisted suicide, medical ethics, and biotechnology. Kass was also involved in founding the Hastings Center. In 1970, he left the laboratory at NIH to become the executive director of the Committee on Life Sciences and Social Policy at the National Research Council of the National Academy of Science, which produced the first public document that tried to assess the ethical and social consequences of the coming advances in biotechnology.National Research Council, Assessing Biomedical Technology: An Inquiry into the Nature of the Problem (Washington: National Academy of Science, 1975).  Teaching experience  As he moved from biology to bioethics, Kass also moved from full-time research into teaching, first at St. John's College from 1972 to 1976, Georgetown University from 1974 to 1976, and at Chicago from 1976 onward. At St. John's, Kass taught in the Great Books program as well as in-depth studies of Aristotle's De Anima and Nicomachean Ethics and Darwin's On the Origin of Species. At the University of Chicago, Kass taught courses across the humanities and sciences, including both undergraduate and graduate seminars in the Nicomachean Ethics, Plato's Symposium and Meno, Lucretius, human passions, science and society, Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, Genesis, Darwinism, Descartes's Discourse on the Method, classical geometry, Tolstoy's War and Peace, marriage and courtship, Exodus, and biotechnology. Along with his wife and other colleagues, Kass cofounded in 1977 the \\"Human Being and Citizen\\" common core course at Chicago, today the most popular humanities core course at Chicago, devoted to exploring the conflicts between conceptions of what constitutes a good human being/individual versus the demands that society or the State tries to impose upon us. The College of the University of Chicago, Courses and Programs of Study 2002‚Äì2004. In 1983, he, Allan Bloom, and James M. Redfield founded the \\"Fundamentals: Issues and Texts\\" program. Kass taught in and chaired this program for eighteen years. He won the University of Chicago's Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1983 and the Amoco Foundation Award for Distinguished Contributions to Undergraduate Teaching in 1993. Views on women In his 1992 article \\"Regarding Daughters and Sisters,\\" Kass writes that \\"rape is a capital offense, a crime worse even than murder. For the rapist, says the book of Deuteronomy, 'death by stoning.' It has never seemed to me too cruel or excessive a punishment.\\" However, he criticizes the modern conception of rape \\"as a violation of the will, not a violation of womanliness.\\" Womanliness, for Kass, requires modesty rather than power. He concludes: > Many lonely women, more than can safely admit it, secretly hope to meet a > gentleman; but the vast majority steadfastly refuse to be ladies‚Äîindeed, no > longer know what it means.

Bush had to decide whether to allow federal funding for research on stem cells derived from embryos. Many scientists were advocating the removal of limits on embryonic stem cell research, but critics expressed concern about what they characterized as the wanton destruction of human life. In an August 2001 speech, Bush announced that he would support funding research on stem cell lines already created‚Äî\\"where the life and death decision has already been made\\"‚Äîbut not on lines created by the further destruction of embryos. And because \\"[e]mbryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards,\\" Bush said, he would create the President's Council on Bioethics, to be led by Kass and with a mandate to \\"monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations, and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation.\\"George W. Bush, Speech on stem cell research, August 9, 2001. As the council was appointed and prepared to begin meeting in early 2002, Kass received a great deal of media attention, especially due to his reputation for pessimism and concern about the moral implications of scientific progress with respect to health and life issues. Calling him \\"the president's philosopher,\\" U.S. News and World Report noted that \\"he tends to dwell on the dark side of modern medicine. . . . Kass has tried to raise the public's consciousness of emerging technology's risks to values that humanity holds dear.\\"Nell Boyce, \\"The President's Philosopher,\\" U.S. News and World Report, February 11, 2002. The Council from its inception was charged by Bush to consider these larger questions, well beyond the domain of stem cell research. The first specific task of the Council, according to the executive order creating it, was \\"to undertake fundamental inquiry into the human and moral significance of developments in biomedical and behavioral science and technology.\\"Executive Order no. 13,237 , \\"Creation of the President's Council on Bioethics,\\" November 28, 2001. The composition of the Council was also subject to controversy. Kass was accused of \\"stacking the deck\\" with philosophers, scientists, and public intellectuals likely to oppose \\"unfettered medical research in the area of stem cells, therapeutic cloning, and reproductive cloning. Given that fact, researchers had better worry a lot about what the Council is likely to recommend to the president.\\"Ronald Bailey, \\"Tallying the New Bioethics Council,\\" Reason Online, January 23, 2002. Critics also charged that Kass eliminated those who disagreed with him, such as Elizabeth Blackburn and William May, and replacing them with opponents of cloning.Timothy Noah, \\"Leon Kass, You Silly Ass! Please stop denying you tilted the bioethics panel,\\" Slate, March 8, 2004.Jeffrey Brainard, \\"A New Kind of Bioethics,\\" Chronicle of Higher Education, May 21, 2004. Kass replied to these criticisms by saying that the Council was more intellectually diverse than prior bioethics commissions precisely because it included opponents of abortion. (Previous commissions had \\"excluded representatives of the right to life movement.\\"Carl Mitcham, \\"In Qualified Praise of the Leon Kass Council on Bioethics,\\" Techne 10, no. 1 (Fall 2006).) Also, the council members Robert George, Francis Fukuyama and James Q. Wilson debated with stark disagreement their opposing points of view on the biological status of the human embryo and came to no agreed conclusions. Since Bush had deliberately created the Council to debate and clarify the issues without necessarily reaching consensus, Kass said that he welcomed disagreement within the Council: \\"This council is easily the most intellectually and ethically diverse of the bioethics commissions to date. We have worked with mutual respect while not papering over our differences. No one who has attended any of our meetings or read the transcripts can believe that we do anything but serious and careful work, without regard to ideology, partisan politics or religious beliefs.\\"Leon Kass, \\"We Don't Play Politics with Science,\\" Washington Post, March 3, 2004. The Council has been renewed by executive order every two years since 2001, and the subjects it considered ranged beyond the stem cell battles during which it was established. Kass sought throughout to develop a \\"richer\\" bioethics, attentive to larger human and philosophical questions at the root of bioethical dilemmas, and he lamented that the Council was pigeonholed: \\"The Council came into existence identified as the 'stem cell council,' and people on all sides of the embryo research debate seem to care more about the Council's views on this subject than about anything else. Not by our choice‚Äîand certainly not by mine‚Äîthe Council was born smack in the middle of 'embryoville,' and it has never been able to leave this highly political field.\\"Leon Kass, \\"Reflections on Public Bioethics: A View from the Trenches,\\" Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal 15, no. 3 (September 2005). Despite the public's narrow conception of its work, during Kass's chairmanship, the Council produced five book-length reports, a white paper, and a humanistic reader on ten topics generally neglected in the bioethics literature.See Human Cloning and Human Dignity: An Ethical Inquiry (July 2002), Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness (October 2003), Monitoring Stem Cell Research (January 2004), Reproduction and Responsibility: The Regulation of New Biotechnologies (March 2004), Alternative Sources of Pluripotent Stem Cells (May 2005), Taking Care: Ethical Caregiving in Our Aging Society (September 2005), and Being Human: Readings from the President's Council on Bioethics (December 2003). Available at . Kass described the Council's work as \\"public bioethics,\\" rejecting previous approaches that favored government by self-appointed \\"experts\\"‚Äîscientific or bioethical‚Äîand presenting the issues in terms accessible to the broader public and its political representatives. He sought a \\"richer\\" inquiry that debates \\"ends as well as means,\\" and the Council's reports addressed larger human questions, \\"not merely administrative or regulatory ones.\\" He said that it presented all sides of ethical issues in order to create a more substantive moral discourse. \\"A proper bioethics must lead public reflection on the ways in which new biotechnologies may affect those things that matter most regarding how human lives are lived,\\" Kass wrote. \\"This means beginning by reflecting upon the highest human goods and understanding the latest technological advances in this light.\\" Eschewing much of the language and theoretical framework of academic bioethics, Kass drew on literary, philosophical, and theological sources to inform the Council's discussion. At the Council's first meeting, he led a discussion of \\"The Birth- Mark,\\" a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Kass stepped down as chairman of the Council in October 2005 and remained a member of the Council until 2007.Jen Glickel, \\"Kass Leaves Post as Bush's Bioethics Chair ,\\" Chicago Maroon, February 12, 2005. He returned to positions at the American Enterprise Institute and the University of Chicago. Views on bioethics =Biotechnology and medical enhancement= While welcoming biotechnology for its therapeutic promise‚Äîto cure disease, relieve suffering, and to restore health and wholeness‚ÄîKass worries about its uses for enhancement (boosting capability beyond what is given naturally and even altering human nature). While biotechnology offers great promise for health care, it has applications for \\"many other ends, good ones and bad.\\" Biotechnology can be employed to produce \\"better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, and happy souls.\\" Kass argues that biotechnology may eventually be used as a substitute for virtue, hard work, study, or love in order to \\"fulfill our deepest human desires,\\" but in the end lowering the reach of those desires only to those objects that can be realized technologically.Leon R. Kass, Foreword to Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness (Washington: President's Council on Bioethics, 2003). His worries about biotechnology stem from what he calls \\"the technological disposition,\\" which transforms the meaning and character of human life by believing that \\"all aspects of life can be rationally mastered through technique.\\"Leon Kass, interviewed by Adam Wolfson, The American Enterprise, July 2006. =Stem cell research= Kass has been a consistent critic of embryo research, including embryonic stem cell research, because of its \\"exploitation\\" and \\"destruction\\" of nascent human life. Although he claims to be agnostic about the moral standing of an early human embryo, he worries about treating human life, at whatever stage, merely as a natural resource. \\"There is something deeply repugnant and fundamentally transgressive about such a utilitarian treatment of prospective human life,\\" he writes.Leon R. Kass, \\"The Wisdom of Repugnance,\\" The New Republic, June 2, 1997. But because he recognized the potential of such cells for medical research, he led the President's Council on Bioethics to examine alternative avenues of obtaining pluripotent stem cells: \\"Pluripotent cells might be obtainable from already dead (not just unwanted or doomed but actually dead) embryos, some of whose individual cells might nonetheless still be viable; from living embryos by nondestructive biopsy; from bioengineered, embryo-like artifacts; and from reprogrammed body cells, taken from children or adults, that are induced to return to the undifferentiated state of pluripotency. . . . We should be hopeful that a technological solution to our moral dilemma might soon be found and that this divisive piece of our recent political history will soon come to an end.\\"Leon R. Kass, \\"A Way Forward on Stem Cells,\\" Washington Post, July 12, 2005. In 2007, in two separate studies, research teams led by James Thomson and Shinya Yamanaka created induced pluripotent stem cells from adult cells, meaning that the destruction of embryos for stem cells might no longer be necessary. In 2009, the reprogramming technique was further improved, as skin cells were returned to pluripotency by the transfer of a few exogeneous genes and without the use of foreign viruses as vectors.Erika Check Hayden and Monya Baker, \\"Virus-Free Pluripotency for Human Cells,\\" Nature 458, no. 19 (March 1, 2009). Robert P. George praised Kass as the driving intellectual force against embryo-killing and in favor of finding alternative methods of obtaining pluripotent stem cells: \\"All along, it was Dr. Kass who said that reprogramming methods would, if pursued vigorously, enable us to realize the full benefits of stem cell science while respecting human dignity.\\"Ryan Anderson, \\"The End of the Stem-Cell Wars,\\" The Weekly Standard, December 3, 2007. =Human cloning= Kass supports a universal ban on the cloning of humans on the grounds that cloning is an affront to morality and human dignity. In a 1997 article in The New Republic entitled \\"The Wisdom of Repugnance,\\" Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. \\"In crucial cases,\\" he writes, \\"repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it.\\" Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands: > Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human > willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound. > Indeed, in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as > it is freely done, in which our given human nature no longer commands > respect, in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our > autonomous rational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks > up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that > have forgotten how to shudder. A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, \\"has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable. A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will.\\"Leon R. Kass and James Q. Wilson, The Ethics of Human Cloning (Washington: AEI Press, 1998). In response to Kass, other ethicists have argued that reactions of repugnance or disgust are not a valid basis for banning cloning because such feelings are subjective, dictated by cultural norms, and change over time.Fritz Allhoff, Telomeres and the Ethics of Human Cloning (American Journal of Bioethics, 2004 Spring;4(2):W29-31). Fritz Allhoff of the American Medical Association Division of Bioethics contends that \\"racial integration once elicited the same sentiments of repugnance that Kass claims that cloning elicits now; surely public sentiment should not be taken as a moral guide.\\" Martha Nussbaum has advanced a broader argument against using feelings of disgust as a basis for policymaking, writing that \\"laws and social rules\\" should be based on \\"substantive harm, rather than on the symbolic relationship an object bears to our anxieties.\\" Martha Nussbaum, ‚ÄúDanger to human dignity: The revival of disgust and shame in the law,‚Äù The Chronicle of Higher Education, 50(48): B6 In addition to opposing cloning on the grounds of repugnance, Kass has also argued that cloning constitutes an \\"unethical experiment upon the resulting child-to-be\\"; creates confusions of identity and individuality; \\"turns begetting into making\\"; and, by giving parents control over a child's genetic make-up, exacerbates the \\"dangerous\\" idea of parental control over children's lives and prospects. \\"One must never forget that these are human beings upon whom our eugenic or merely playful fantasies are to be enacted,\\" he writes. =A concern for \\"the natural\\"= Although he appreciates that human beings are always modifying what is naturally given, Kass worries about the lack of standards for human life in a world in which human nature is treated as utterly malleable and in which the boundaries of human life are all eroded. Kass places \\"special value on the natural human cycle of birth, procreation and death\\" and views death as a \\"necessary and desirable end\\" and the human and human aspirations that are derived from it. He views human mortality as a blessing in disguise, and he has opposed deliberate efforts to increase maximum human life expectancy in pursuit of biological immortality. Kass was an early critic of the widespread use of reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization, partly because he was concerned that their use obscures truths about the essence of human life and society that are embedded in the natural reproductive process. (He later endorsed the marital use of in vitro after Louise Brown was born in 1978.) Kass sees human cloning as a natural progression from the decoupling of sex and procreation, begun with in vitro fertilization: \\"Cloning turns out to be the perfect embodiment of the ruling opinions of our new age. Thanks to the sexual revolution, we are able to deny in practice, and increasingly in thought, the inherent procreative teleology of sexuality itself. But, if sex has no intrinsic connection to generating babies, babies need have no necessary connection to sex. . . . For that new dispensation, the clone is the ideal emblem: the ultimate 'single-parent child.'\\" As in his other writings, Kass emphasizes the connection of reproduction to marriage and family life: \\"No child conceived with the aid of assisted reproductive technologies should be denied the lineage and biological ties to two parents that all children born 'naturally' have. No child should have to say, 'An embryo was my father.'\\"  Philosophical studies  For much of his career, Kass's scholarship moved away from the practical issues of bioethics to issues of human nature and human good, and nearly all of his teaching at Chicago has been about these topics. Yet despite his stated interest in \\"the natural,\\" Kass does not hold to any traditional teaching of \\"natural law,\\" and he does not derive any moral rules from nature. Rather, he sees human nature as offering, at most, intimations and \\"pointings\\" toward human flourishing and human fulfillment, but pointings in need of both cultural encouragement and cultural restraint if humans are to become the upright animal advertised in his special posture.  Biblical studies  In addition to his studies in natural philosophy and philosophical anthropology, Kass has in recent years been teaching and writing about the Hebrew Bible, especially the book of Genesis. Kass's interest in the Bible began with weekly invitational readings of Genesis that he and his wife, Amy, had organized for students while teaching at the University of Chicago. In his 2009 Jefferson Lecture, Kass said that he found in the Bible \\"an account of human life that can more than hold its own with the anthropological and ethical teachings offered by the great poets and philosophers,\\" with \\"teachings of righteousness, humaneness, and human dignity . . . that were undreamt of in my prior philosophizing.\\"Leon Kass, \\"Looking for an Honest Man: Reflections of an Unlicensed Humanist‚Äù , text of 2009 Jefferson lecture at NEH website (retrieved May 22, 2009). Kass reads the text philosophically, not theologically, in the belief that this text, thoughtfully read, has much to teach everyone‚Äîbelievers and non- believers alike‚Äîabout the human condition and how it may be improved. His full lengthy commentary on Genesis, based on his teaching of the text over twenty years, is addressed primarily to the \\"children of skeptics\\" (such as himself). He concludes: > Long dwelling with the book of Genesis, and ever marveling at its beauty, > its profundity, and, above all, its power to illuminate and lift the soul, > this exhilarated reader of Genesis stands before it on his intellectual > knees, filled with awe and gratitude for a text that makes such insights > possible. I dare to hope that, with my book as a companion, other wisdom- > seeking readers may enjoy a similar experience. Philosophical influences * Aldous Huxley * Hans Jonas * Jacob Klein * C. S.

Kass's lecture, delivered at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C. on May 21, 2009. was entitled \\"Looking for an Honest Man: Reflections of an Unlicensed Humanist\\". In his lecture, he expressed the view that science has become separated from its humanistic origins and the humanities have lost their connection to metaphysical and theological concerns.Serena Golden, \\"Tough Love for the Humanities\\", Inside Higher Ed, May 22, 2009 (retrieved May 22, 2009). In addition to his teaching awards from the University of Chicago, Kass also received the Harvard Centennial Medal and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute's Gerhard Niemeyer Award in 2003 and the inaugural Bradley Prize from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in 2004. He has been given honorary degrees by the University of Dallas (1997), the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies (2001), Carthage College (2002), and Yeshiva University (2003). Kass is a fellow of the Hastings Center. Family In 2015 his wife Amy Kass died. He has two married daughters and four granddaughters; they reside in Chicago and Jerusalem.

He was also the last of the kings of the Quilombo dos Palmares, a settlement of Afro- Brazilian people who had liberated themselves from enslavement in that same settlement, in the present-day state of Alagoas, Brazil. Zumbi today is revered in Afro-Brazilian culture as a powerful symbol of resistance against the enslavement of Africans in the colony of Brazil. He was married to the queen and also great warrior Dandara. Quilombos Quilombos were communities in Brazil founded by individuals of African descent who escaped slavery (these escaped slaves are commonly referred to as MaroonsPrice, R. ed., 1996. Maroon societies: Rebel slave communities in the Americas. JHU Press.). Members of quilombos often returned to plantations or towns to encourage their former fellow Africans to flee and join the quilombos. If necessary, they brought others by force and sabotaged plantations. Anyone who came to quilombos on their own were considered free, but those who were captured and brought by force were considered slaves and continued to be so in the new settlements. They could be considered free if they were to bring another captive to the settlement. Women were also targets of capture, including black, white, Indian and mulatas (women of mixed African and European ancestry), who were forcibly relocated to Palmares. Some women, however, fled voluntarily to Palmares to escape abusive spouses and/or masters. Since small in numbers, men were also recruited to join Palmares and even Portuguese soldiers fleeing forced recruitment were sought out. Palmares was established around 1605 by 40 enslaved central Africans who fled to the heavily forested hills that parallel the northern coast of Brazil. Portuguese authorities called this area Palmares, due to its many palm trees, and were locked in deadly clashes with it for much of the 17th century. Quilombo dos Palmares was a self-sustaining kingdom of Maroons escaped from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, \\"a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Pernambuco\\".Braudel (1984), p. 390. At its height, Palmares had a population of more than 30,000. Palmares developed into a confederation of 11 towns, spanning rugged mountainous terrain in frontier zones across the present day states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Palmares was an autonomous state based on African political and religious customs that supported itself though means of agriculture, fishing, hunting, gathering, trading, and raiding nearby Brazilian plantations and settlements. Origins Zumbi's mother Sabina was a sister of Ganga Zumba, who is said to have been the son of princess Aqualtune, daughter of an unknown King of Kongo. It is unknown if Zumbi's mother was also daughter of the princess, but this still makes him related to the Kongo nobility. Zumbi and his relatives are of Central African descent. They were brought to the Americas after the Battle of Mbwila. The Portuguese won the battle eventually, killing 5,000 men, and captured the king, his two sons, his two nephews, four governors, various court officials, 95 title holders and 400 other nobles who were put on ships and sold as slaves in the Americas. It is very probable that Ganga and Sabina were among these nobles. The whereabouts of the rest of the individuals captured after the Battle of Mbwila is unknown. Some are believed to have been sent to Spanish America, but Ganga Zumba, his brother Zona and Sabina were made slaves at the plantation of Santa Rita in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in what is now northeast Brazil. From there, they escaped to Palmares. Early life Zumbi was born free in Palmares in 1655, believed to be descended from the Congo.Rodriguez (2006), p. 587. He was captured by the Portuguese and given to a missionary, Father Ant√≥nio Melo, when he was approximately six years old. Father Ant√≥nio Melo baptized Zumbi and gave him the name of Francisco. Zumbi was taught the sacraments, learned Portuguese and Latin and succeeded in the End of building a Kongo kingdom in Palmares. Despite attempts to subjugate him, Zumbi escaped in 1670 and, at the age of 15, returned to his birthplace. Zumbi became known for his physical prowess and cunning in battle and he was a respected military strategist by the time he was in his early twenties. Capoeira or the Dance of War by Johann Moritz Rugendas, 1835 King of the Quilombo dos Palmares By 1678, the governor of the captaincy of Pernambuco, Pedro Almeida, weary of the longstanding conflict with Palmares, approached its king Ganga Zumba with an olive branch. Almeida offered freedom for all runaway slaves if Palmares would submit to Portuguese authority, a proposal which Ganga Zumba favored. But Zumbi ‚Äì who became the commander-in-chief of the Kingdom's forces in 1675 - was distrustful of the Portuguese. Further, he refused to accept freedom for the people of Palmares while other Africans remained enslaved. He rejected Almeida's overture and challenged Ganga Zumba's kingship. In 1678 Zumbi killed his uncle Ganga Zumba. Zumbi sought to implement a far more aggressive stance against the Portuguese Vowing to continue the resistance to Portuguese oppression, Zumbi became the new king of Palmares. Zumbi's determination and heroic efforts to fight for Palmares' independence increased his prestige. Predictably, when Zumbi gained authority, tensions with the Portuguese quickly escalated. In 1694, fifteen years after Zumbi assumed kingship of Palmares, the Portuguese colonists under the military commanders Domingos Jorge Velho and Bernardo Vieira de Melo launched an assault on the Palmares. They made use of artillery as well as a fierce force of Brazilian Indian fighters, which took 42 days to defeat the kingdom. On February 6, 1694, after 67 years of ceaseless conflict with the cafuzos, or Maroons, of Palmares, the Portuguese succeeded in destroying Cerca do Macaco, the kingdom's central settlement. Some resistance continued, but on November 20, 1695 Zumbi was killed and decapitated, his head displayed on a pike to dispel any legends of his immortality. Although it was eventually crushed, the success of Palmares through most of the 17th century greatly challenged colonial authority and would stand as a beacon of slave resistance in the times to come. Importance today Zumbi (1927) by Ant√¥nio Parreiras November 20 is celebrated, chiefly in Brazil, as a day of Afro-Brazilian consciousness. The day has special meaning for those Brazilians of African descent who honour Zumbi as a hero, freedom fighter, and symbol of freedom. Zumbi has become a hero of the 20th-century Afro-Brazilian political movement, as well as a national hero in Brazil. Today, Zumbi is considered a hero of great magnitude amongst Afro-Brazilians who celebrate his courage, leadership qualities, and heroic resistance to Portuguese colonial rule.

He was known as a soloist and an ensemble player, including his occasional performances with Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. Biography ≈†evƒç√≠k was born in Hora≈æƒèovice, Bohemia, Austrian Empire. His father was the local village schoolmaster. Although he received his first music lessons from his father, he studied under Anton√≠n Bennewitz at the Prague Conservatory (1866‚Äì1870) during which period a disease caused him to have his left eye enucleated. He was also taught by Hans Sitt. He began his career in 1870 as concertmaster of the Mozarteum concerts in Salzburg, where he also taught. After 1873, he was concertmaster at the Prague Interim (Provisional) Theatre and the Komische Opera at the Ring Theatre in Vienna. From 1875-92 he was professor of violin at the music school of the Russian Music Society in Kiev, at the same time appearing frequently as soloist. In 1892 he became head of the violin department at the Prague Conservatory, where he remained until 1906. He then taught privately in P√≠sek. In 1909, he became director of the Violin Department at the Vienna Music Academy, until 1918, when at the end of World War I his nationality forced him to leave his position. He returned to the Prague Conservatory, where he stayed until 1921. After that he travelled in the United States and Great Britain as a well known teacher.

A liberal, he currently presides over a network of progressive-oriented sites that operate under the TPM Media banner and average 400,000-page views every weekday and 750,000 unique visitors every month. Marshall and his work have been profiled by The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, the Financial Times, National Public Radio, The New York Times Magazine, the Columbia Journalism Review, Bill Moyers Journal, and GQ. Hendrik Hertzberg, a senior editor at The New Yorker, compares Marshall to the influential founders of Time magazine. \\"Marshall is in the line of the great light-bulb-over-the-head editors. He‚Äôs like Briton Hadden or Henry Luce. He‚Äôs created something new.\\" Early career Marshall was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He is a graduate of the Webb Schools of California and Princeton University and earned a Ph.D. in American history from Brown University. In the mid-1990s, Marshall designed websites for law firms and published an online news site about Internet law, which included interviews with prominent scholars such as Lawrence Lessig. He began writing freelance articles about Internet free speech for The American Prospect in 1997 and was soon hired as an associate editor. He worked for the Prospect for three years and in 1999 moved to D.C. to become their Washington editor. He often clashed with the top editors at the Prospect, over both ideology and the direction of the website. Talking Points Memo =Reaching a critical mass= Marshall at the Personal Democracy Forum in May 2007 Inspired by political bloggers such as Mickey Kaus and Andrew Sullivan, Marshall started Talking Points Memo during the 2000 Florida election recount. \\"I really liked what seemed to me to be the freedom of expression of this genre of writing,\\" Marshall told the Columbia Journalism Review. \\"And, obviously, given the issues that I had with the Prospect, that appealed to me a lot.\\" He left his job at the Prospect early in 2001 and continued to blog while writing for The Washington Monthly, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Salon.com, and the New York Post. In 2002, Marshall used Talking Points Memo to report on Trent Lott's controversial comments praising Strom Thurmond's 1948 presidential run as a segregationist. According to the Kennedy School of Government, Marshall was instrumental in fueling the ensuing scandal that eventually led to Trent Lott's resignation as Senate Minority Leader. As a result of the Lott story, traffic to Talking Points Memo spiked from 8,000 to 20,000 page views a day. In the fall of 2003, as people focused on the failure to find WMD's in Iraq, there was a new surge of traffic to the site; \\"I remember there being peak days of 60,000-page views, which was really incredible.\\" Marshall started selling ads on his site and by the end of 2004 was earning $10,000 a month, making him one of a handful of what The New York Times Magazine dubbed \\"elite bloggers\\" who earned enough money to make blogging a full-time occupation. During the 2008 US election campaign, many independent news sites and political blogs saw a wave of \\"explosive growth\\". Talking Points Memo experienced the largest surge in traffic, growing from 32,000 unique visitors in September 2007 to 458,000 unique visitors in September 2008, a 1,321% year-to-year increase in the size of its audience. =Launching TPM Media= In 2005, Marshall launched TPMCafe. This site features a collection of blogs about a wide range of domestic and foreign policy issues written by academics, journalists and former public officials among others. Marshall expanded his operation again in 2006, launching TPMmuckraker. The site focuses on political corruption, and was originally staffed by Paul Kiel and Justin Rood. Rood has since moved on to ABC and its blog The Blotter. Kiel has recently been joined by two new staff reporter- bloggers, Laura McGann and Spencer Ackerman. TPMmuckraker has attempted to organize its readers to plow through and read document dumps by governmental entities engaging in cover-ups. TPM Media operates out of an office in Manhattan and currently employs seven reporters, including two in Washington. =U.S. Attorney Scandal= In 2007, Marshall was instrumental in exposing another national scandal, the politically motivated dismissal of U.S. attorneys by the Bush administration. Marshall won The Polk Award for Legal Reporting for his coverage of the story, which \\"led the news media\\" and \\"connected the dots and found a pattern of federal prosecutors being forced from office for failing to do the Bush Administration's bidding.\\" Columbia Journalism Review also credited Marshall's news organization for being \\"almost single-handedly responsible for bringing the story of the fired U.S. Attorneys to a boil.\\" The ensuing scandal resulted in the resignations of several high- level government officials; the Polk award in particular honored Marshall for his \\"tenacious investigative reporting\\" which \\"sparked interest by the traditional news media and led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.\\" After a weekend writer noticed that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas was being replaced with a former adviser to Karl Rove, Marshall discovered that U.S. Attorney Carol Lam was also being asked to resign. Carol Lam successfully prosecuted Republican California Representative Duke Cunningham on bribery charges and was in the middle of an ongoing criminal investigation into a congressional scandal of historic proportions. \\"I was stunned by it,\\" Marshall told the Financial Times. \\"Normally, in a case like that, the prosecutor would be untouchable.\\" National newspapers were slow to pick up the story. Time magazine's Washington bureau chief Jay Carney went so far as to accuse Marshall of \\"seeing broad partisan conspiracies where none likely exist.\\" By the time The New York Times first reported on Lam's firing (on page 17), Marshall and his news sites had already posted 15 articles on the story. Two months after posting his accusatory article, Carney apologized to Marshall. \\"Josh Marshall at TalkingPointsMemo and everyone else out there whose instincts told them there was something deeply wrong and even sinister about the firings... deserve tremendous credit.\\" Carney went on to write, \\"I was wrong. Very nice work, and thanks for holding my feet to the fire.\\" For doggedly pursuing the story, Arianna Huffington nominated Joshua Marshall and the Talking Points Memo team to the Time 100. =Plans= Larger media companies have approached Marshall about buying or investing in his media company. So far, he has decided to maintain his independence. Family Marshall's father was a professor of marine biology. His mother died when he was young. Marshall married Millet Israeli in March 2005, and the couple live in New York City with their sons Sam and Daniel.

Most commonly used in connection with ODBC, DSNs also exist for JDBC and for other data access mechanisms. The term often overlaps with \\"connection string\\". Most systems do not make a distinction between DSNs or connection strings and the term can often be used interchangeably. DSN attributes may include, but are not limited to: * the name of the data source * the location of the data source * the name of a database driver which can access the data source * a user ID for data access (if required) * a user password for data access (if required) The system administrator of a client machine generally creates a separate DSN for each relevant data source. Standardizing DSNs offers a level of indirection; various applications (for example: Apache/PHP and IIS/ASP) can take advantage of this in accessing shared data sources.  Types of data source name  Two kinds of DSN exist: * Machine DSNs ‚Äì stored in collective configuration files (e.g., /etc/odbc.ini, ~/.odbc.ini) and/or system resources (e.g., Windows Registry HKLM\\\\Software\\\\ODBC\\\\odbc.ini) * File DSNs ‚Äì stored in the filesystem with one DSN per file These are further broken down into * System DSNs ‚Äì accessible by any and all processes and users of the system, stored in a centralized location (e.g., /etc/odbc.ini, /etc/odbc_file_dsns/) * User DSNs ‚Äì accessible only by the user who created the DSN, stored in a user-specific location (e.g., ~/.odbc.ini, ~/odbc_file_dsns/)  Example of use  Software (e.g., Crystal Reports, Microsoft Excel, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby) users can submit CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries to a data source by establishing a connection to the DSN. ASP (VBScript) code to open a DSN connection might look like the following: Dim DatabaseObject1 Set DatabaseObject1 = Server.CreateObject(\\"ADODB.Connection\\") DatabaseObject1.Open(\\"DSN=example;\\") In PHP using the PEAR::DB package to open a connection without an external DSN (a \\"DSN-less connection\\", i.e., using a Connection String), the code might resemble the following require_once(\\"DB.php\\"); //$dsn = \\"://:@:/\\"; $dsn = \\"mysql://john:pass@localhost:3306/my_db\\"; $db = DB::connect($dsn); PHP with PDO. $dsn = \\"mysql:host=localhost;dbname=example\\"; $dbh = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password); In Perl, using the Perl DBI module, each driver has its own syntax for the DSN attributes.

He was known as \\"The Guv'nor\\", \\"the King of the Cobbles\\" and \\"the hardest man in Britain\\". McLean's pugilist reputation began in the East End of London in the late 1960s and was sustained through to the late 1980s. He stated in his autobiography that he had been involved in up to 4,000 unlicensed fights. In his prime, the tall McLean weighed over and was considered the \\"unofficial heavyweight champion of Great Britain\\". Along with being an unlicensed boxer, McLean was an enforcer in London's criminal underworld. As a respected and feared figure, he often associated with infamous criminals such as the Kray twins, Ronnie Biggs and Charles Bronson. He was also known in the London nightclub scene as a bouncer, where he often managed security. In his later life, McLean became an actor, and received praise for playing Barry the Baptist in Guy Ritchie's 1998 gangster comedy film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. He died in July 1998, shortly before the film's release. Early life Lenny McLean was born into a large, working-class Irish family in Hoxton in the East End of London. His father, Leonard McLean Sr., had been a Royal Marine during the Second World War, but after being debilitated by a near-fatal disease which he contracted in India, he became a petty criminal and swindler. He died when Lenny was four years old, and was buried in a pauper's grave, as many working- class men of the time were. Lenny's mother, Rose, married again to Jim Irwin, who was also a career petty criminal. Irwin was a violent alcoholic, who physically abused Lenny and his brothers for many years. By the age of ten, McLean had suffered many broken bones. However, when Lenny's infant brother Raymond was beaten brutally with a belt, McLean's great-uncle Jimmy Spinks, a local gangster, attacked Irwin, nearly killing him, and threatened to cut his throat should he ever need to return to protect the children again. McLean admired his great-uncle thereafter and when he became a street fighter he said that he considered every victory to be won on behalf of his vulnerable younger self. He expressed the rage resulting from his abusive childhood with such abandon that often it would take several men to separate him from his defeated opponent, gaining the nickname \\"Ten Men Len\\" because of how many men would be needed to restrain him. McLean's son Jamie later said, \\"My dad wasn't a born fighter. He was uneducated and a product of his upbringing, traumatised by what he‚Äôd been through, and probably had mental health problems as a result of all that. Fighting was all he knew.\\" Unlicensed boxing During his teenage years, McLean mixed with various local criminals. He was arrested for petty crimes and served 18 months in prison. After he was fired from his first legitimate job for beating up his foreman, he worked odd jobs. By the age of fifteen, McLean realised he could earn a living from fighting and pursued it as his main means of income. McLean's first unlicensed boxing match came about as a result of a chance meeting while in his late teens: when his car broke down in the Blackwall Tunnel he abandoned it and went to buy a replacement from an associate known as Kenny Mac, a gypsy used-car salesman in Kingsland Road, Hackney, only to find the replacement quickly failed too. McLean returned later to demand his money back, but instead of refunding McLean, Mac offered to give McLean a new car in exchange for him fighting in one of Mac's unlicensed boxing bouts later that night in Mac's yard. McLean's opponent lasted less than a minute against him, earning McLean ¬£500, a considerable prize at the time. Mac and McLean became friends and on numerous later bouts Mac acted as McLean's boxing manager, with McLean subsequently becoming the best-known bare-knuckle street fighter in Britain. When Frank Warren formed the National Boxing Council in the 1970s, it allowed the toughest underground fighters in Britain to compete legally. McLean, unable to become a licensed boxer due to his violent reputation and lengthy criminal record, entered the world of unlicensed boxing (which, although legal, was not sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control), and he quickly became one of its brightest stars and had a fearsome reputation. McLean had a famous trilogy of unlicensed matches with arch-rival Roy \\"Pretty Boy\\" Shaw. McLean lost to Shaw once via verbal submission, which McLean justified by claiming his gloves had been tampered with, thus reducing their maneuverability. McLean beat Shaw in a rematch with a dramatic first-round knockout in which Shaw was physically knocked out of the ring. In their final bout, McLean ended the feud with a brutal first-round knockout at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London in September 1978. McLean, who in his prime was tall and weighed over , boasted that he could beat anybody, in either a legitimate match or in an unlicensed match with or without gloves, and reputedly sent out challenges to many of the famous boxers of the day, including Muhammad Ali and Mr. T, though neither contest materialised. McLean lost some face as he was challenged by the \\"King of the Gypsies\\" Bartley Gorman but did not accept the fight. He also was offered a fight with professional boxer David \\"Bomber\\" Pearce, the hard- hitting British heavyweight champion from Newport. McLean declined to fight Pearce. Large portions of McLean's career cannot be verified, since his fights were unsanctioned by the boxing authorities. He was known to have lost several fights, although he always maintained that he had never lost a fight \\"on the cobbles\\" or outside the ring. In unlicensed matches, he was twice stopped by Cliff Field, and twice beaten by Johnny \\"Big Bad\\" Waldron. McLean also lost via KO to George \\"Pappy\\" Langley and on points to Kevin Paddock. In his autobiography, McLean claimed to have competed in almost 4,000 fights over three decades, and said he won the large majority of these. Other professions With his fame as an unlicensed boxer, McLean became known as \\"The King of Bouncers\\" around many of the clubs and pubs in London. He also held joint ownership of a public house in the East End of London named the \\"Guv'Nors\\" along with Charlie Kray, elder brother of the Kray twins, reputed to be the \\"most legitimate\\" of the three brothers. McLean was also described as a \\"fixer\\" and a \\"minder\\", meaning a bodyguard, for criminals and celebrities including Mike Reid, Boy George, and the casts of television shows such as EastEnders and The Bill. According to McLean's autobiography, his name was useful for the smooth progress of various criminal dealings, and to warn off members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Mafia. In 1992, McLean released an album of Elvis Presley covers. The album was entitled Lenny Sings.... He claimed \\"The King meets The Guvnor. It's sure to be a winner.\\" His lead single \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\" failed to break into the top 200 and the album was subsequently scrapped. Acting career McLean was featured prominently in a television documentary on nightclub security staff, titled Bounce: Behind The Velvet Rope. He gravitated towards acting after being introduced to an acting agent by his show-business friends Mike Reid and Freddie Starr, for whom he had \\"minded\\". He also made industry connections by \\"minding\\" the casts of television shows such as EastEnders and The Bill. After playing a brief unbilled cameo as a ringside spectator in the drama film The Krays (1990), McLean appeared in such roles as gangster Eddie Davies in ITV's customs drama The Knock and had a small part as a police chief in The Fifth Element (1997). His largest and most famous role was in Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), playing the part of criminal enforcer 'Barry the Baptist'. Personal life Aged twenty, McLean married Valerie. They later had two children, a son named Jamie and a daughter named Kelly. McLean described his family as his \\"rock,\\" whose existence helped him to reject a life solely devoted to crime, and for whom he maintained some self- control during his fights. Kelly, a mother of two, has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and says doctors told her that McLean likely had a version of the disorder himself. Being a famous figure in unlicensed boxing, McLean made fans as well as enemies, such as the supporters of his boxing rivals and disgruntled punters who had lost money betting on McLean's opponents. McLean also had enemies from years of ejecting people from pubs and clubs. He suffered two bullet wounds from separate attacks, and was attacked from behind and stabbed on two occasions. One of the assailants, Barry Dalton, a former bare-knuckle fighter who ran protection rackets across London, had a falling out with McLean and confronted him with a shotgun at his home while his children were in the house. McLean said that he later caught up with Dalton and punished him. Dalton had also made many other enemies, and was found dead with a bullet in his head in 1992, a murder for which McLean asserted his innocence. Separately it has been stated that the murder of Dalton was ordered by a gang of East London gangsters and that McLean was completely uninvolved, though the murder has not been officially solved. =1992 court case= In 1992, McLean was working as the head doorman at the Hippodrome in London's Leicester Square, when he ejected a man named Gary Humphries, who suffered from serious mental health problems and was reportedly on drugs, streaking through the nightclub, urinating on the floor and harassing women. McLean admitted to \\"giving him a backhander.\\" Humphries died later that night and was found to have a broken jaw and severe neck injuries. McLean was arrested for the murder of Humphries by the same policeman who had caught the Kray twins, Superintendent Leonard \\"Nipper\\" Read. McLean immediately protested his innocence, and claimed the police had a vendetta against him because of his association with the Krays. McLean's charge was reduced to manslaughter, of which he was cleared at the Old Bailey when it emerged that Humphries had been in a scuffle with the police after being ejected from the nightclub. Reportedly, the police had forcefully restrained him with a stranglehold. Professor Gresham, a pathologist who had worked on many high-profile murder cases, gave evidence that the stranglehold applied by the police probably caused the neck injuries which led to Humphries' death. However, it was determined that McLean was responsible for Humphries' broken jaw. Charged with, and found guilty of, grievous bodily harm, McLean subsequently served an 18-month prison sentence. =Death= During the filming of Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, McLean was struck ill by what he believed to be the flu. He was subsequently diagnosed with pleurisy, although a further X-ray examination proved he was suffering from lung cancer which had metastasised to his brain. He died shortly afterwards on 28 July 1998, in Bexley, London, a few weeks prior to the release of the film. Director Guy Ritchie dedicated the film to him and had billboards for the film changed to feature McLean in tribute. Biographies McLean's autobiography, titled The Guv'nor, written with Peter Gerrard, was published in August 1998, shortly after McLean's death. It had an initial print run of 3,000 copies, but took off and soon occupied the number one position on the bestsellers' lists. In 2001, Gerrard authored another book about McLean, titled The Guv'nor: A Celebration. McLean's widow, Valerie, co-authored Married To The Guv'nor with Gerrard in 2003, and produced a foreword to the 2007 book about McLean by Anthony Thomas titled The Guv'nor Through The Eyes Of Others. In October 2017, The Guv'nor Revealed ‚Äì The Untold Story of Lenny McLean by Thomas and Lee Wortley was released. In July 2018, McLean's daughter Kelly released the book My Dad: The Guv'nor with ghostwriter Lee Wortley. Film adaptions In his autobiography, McLean recounts that various film studios had expressed an interest in making a film based on his life and career in unlicensed boxing. McLean wanted Craig Fairbrass to portray him as he had known the actor for some time and also considered that Fairbrass resembled himself as a younger man. McLean travelled to Hollywood to discuss the matter with film studio executives, but their preference for Sylvester Stallone for the part caused McLean to discontinue negotiations. One supposed film promoter, later found to have been a conman, took more than a million pounds from McLean and disappeared. The plan fell into hiatus on McLean's death. The Guv'nor, a documentary about McLean's life, as seen through the eyes of his son Jamie, was released in 2016. The drama film My Name Is Lenny was released in 2017, featuring Australian actor Josh Helman in the title role, and Michael Bisping as Roy \\"Pretty Boy\\" Shaw. A reviewer for The Times said Helman was \\"woefully miscast\\" as McLean.

It is a forest- inhabiting species found in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. This species is considered part of a superspecies with the barred eagle-owl (Bubo sumatranus), which looks quite similar but is allopatric in distribution, replacing the larger spot-bellied species in the southern end of the Malay Peninsula and the larger island in Southeast Asia extending down to Borneo. Taxonomy This, like its close relative, the barred eagle-owl, is one of the species that would have to be moved into Ketupa if that genus is to be retained, according to mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data (Olsen et al. 2002). Unlike the \\"fish owls\\" that were also considered to be included in Ketupa, the barred and the spot-bellied species are not closely tied to riparian habitats and piscivorous eating habits. However, all eagle-owls and fish owls (as well as the snowy owl (Bubo scandianus)) have been deemed insufficiently distinct to warrant separate genera and current authors generally treat all within the genus Bubo.Owls of the World: A Photographic Guide by Mikkola, H.

The ear- tufts of the spot-bellied are very long and conspicuously of variable length, giving them a somewhat scraggly appearance at the tips. The ear-tufts of the spot-bellied eagle-owl measure up to in length. Most eagle-owls are well- feathered on both their leg and toes, while the barred eagle-owl is featherless on the toes and feathered on the legs, and the spot-bellied eagle- owl has feathered legs and feet, but the terminal digits of the toes are bare before the talons. The feet and talons as formidable as any eagle-owl, being very large, heavy and powerful for their size. Among standard measurements, this species typically measures in wing chord length, in tail length, in tarsal length and in culmen length.Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl - Bubo nipalensis.

The subspecies of spot-bellied eagle-owl found on Sri Lanka, B. n. blighi, is linearly about 10% smaller than the birds found further north in India but about the same size as owls from the southern tip of India. B. n. blighi has a wing chord length of , a tail length of , a longer tarsus than northern birds at and a culmen length of . One bird from Sri Lanka had a middle talon of , a toe length of and a wingspan of . The reported talon length above is very large relative to the size of this owl, the Eurasian eagle-owls found in Spain (Bubo bubo hispanus), although relatively small compared to other Eurasian eagle-owl races, were shown to have smaller talon lengths than the Sri Lankan spot-bellied eagle-owl. Other than size, the only feature that distinguishes northern birds from Sri Lankan birds is that northern birds possess an ill- defined band of honey-brown colour on the pectorals. A spot-bellied eagle-owl in Sri Lanka, which are similar to mainland birds but smaller. The spot- bellied eagle-owl is overall a stark, grayish brown bird, with dark, coarse brown coloration over the back and upper wings. The throat and underparts are mainly pale fulvous in color with black and white horizontal stripes along the flanks of the body that become broad spots on the abdomen and under tail coverts. On the wings, the primaries are dark brown with lighter brown stripes and the secondaries are more heavily barred with buff-brown coloration. The lores are covered in bristly feathers and the cheeks are brownish-white with black feather shafts. The large ear tufts slant off to the sides. Juveniles birds are distinct from adult birds, being a much paler grayish-cream overall with fairly heavy brownish barring. Distinguishing the spot-bellied eagle-owl is relatively straightforward, since other Indian and southeast Asian eagle owls do not generally dwell in deep forests as does this species. The spot- bellied is the largest of the owls in its range other than the tawny fish owl (Bubo flavipes), which is restricted in both habitat and diet to mountain streams. The brown fish owl (Bubo zeylonensis), which is quite different in colouring if seen reasonably well, is slightly smaller linearly than the spot- bellied eagle owl and is found in more wetland-based (and often somewhat more degraded) habitats. The subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo hemachalana) found in the Himalayas may inhabit higher elevations of the same mountains where the spot-bellied eagle-owl dwells in the lower elevations in the forested foothills but there their ranges barely abut. The Indian eagle- owl (Bubo bengalensis) (typically found in wooded vicinities of rocky areas) is around 10% smaller than the spot-bellied, the dusky eagle-owl (Bubo coromandus) (typically found in woods near wetlands) is around 15% smaller and the brown wood owl, the largest Strix widely found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, is around 35% smaller. Furthermore, the colouring and markings of the spot-bellied eagle-owl is distinctive from all but the barred eagle-owl, which it does not co-exist within the wild. In both the barred and spot-bellied eagle-owls, they are immediately distinctive in the field from other eagle-owls by their pale-looking, sideways slanting ear-tufts, the degree of feathering on the legs and feet. The species pair unlike sympatric eagle-owls has the horizontal rather than vertical underside markings (which congeal somewhat in the barred to barring but appear as almost continuous spotting on the spot-bellied) over a much paler ground colour while the back is slightly grayer looking, lacking any warmer brown or tawny tones. =Voice= This owl is noted for its strange, human-sounding call, and it has been suggested that it is the same as the cryptid known as ulama or \\"Devil Bird\\" in Sri Lanka.Glossary . Cryptozoology. Retrieved on 2012-08-23. A local name is Maha Bakamuna (\\"large horned owl\\"). According to http://www.cryptozoology.com, in July 2001 it was confirmed that ulama description perfectly matches spot-bellied eagle-owl. This call consists of a scream, which rises and then falls in tone. The territorial call of the species, like that of most other eagle-owls, consists of low hoots with two- second intervals between hoos. The voice is booming, deep and carries quite far. It is usual for forest-dwelling owls (and many different kinds of birds) to have an extensive and complex range of vocalizations since vision is more limited than in open or semi-open habitats. However, the spot-bellied eagle owl has relatively small ear openings even for a member of the genus Bubo, suggesting that some territorial behaviour is carried out visually instead of auditorily.Kelso, L. (1940). Variation of the external ear-opening in the Strigidae. The Wilson Bulletin, 24-29. Distribution and habitat An adult Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl seen right after heavy rains in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka. This species is distributed the Lower Himalayas from Kumaon east to Burma, thence to central Laos and central Vietnam. They are found throughout the Indian subcontinent and peninsular Southeast Asia down into the southernmost limits of the range in Sri Lanka and to 12 degrees north in southern Thailand. The spot-bellied eagle-owl dwells mainly in primary or older second growth forests. Potentially, they can come to inhabit nearly all varieties of land- based habitats but prefer those such as dense, evergreen forests or moist deciduous forests within its range, though can range secondarily into tropical valleys, terrai and shola in the lower hills of India. Although often considered uncommon to somewhat rare, recent photographic evidence indicates that they are particularly widely found in different parts of India and may simply avoid detection, so long as appropriate wooded habitat remains.Deshmukh, A. J. (2008). Photographic record of Forest Eagle-Owl Bubo nipalensis from Kanha National Park, Madhya Pradesh, India. Indian Birds, 4(1), 18.Srinivasan, S. (2013). Spot-bellied Eagle Owl Bubo nipalensis in northern Eastern Ghats, Andhra Pradesh, India. Hist. Soc, 29(2), 503-518.Choudhury, A. (2001). Some bird records from Nagaland, north-east India. Forktail, 91-104. They are found in a range of climates from the temperate woodlands of Nepal to the humid, tropical rainforest of Southeast Asia. However. the spot-bellied eagle-owl is mainly a species of tropical and subtropical foothills, mainly being distributed at elevations of , though have been found at anywhere from sea-level to , the latter in the Transhimalayas. Behavior A spot-bellied eagle-owl in the Biligiriranga Hills of south India. The spot-bellied eagle-owl is nocturnal and often spends its day hidden in the dense foliage of large forest trees. However, they have been observed on the move and even hunting during the day, especially in forests with minimal human disturbance. Their activity normally picks up at dusk as they begin to hunt. In larger forest owls, apparently, a partial diurnal behaviour is not uncommon. The bright whitish colouration, overlaid with brownish cross- bars, forming a brow over the eyes to the front of the ear-tufts is theorised to play a primary role in expression of behavioural intent. =Diet= This is a very powerful and bold predatory owl, which is assuredly at the top of the avian food chain in its forested range. However, no extensive study of its dietary habits is known. Even in larger eagle-owls such as the Eurasian eagle- owl, although they can and do prey on a wide range of prey including impressively large prey, most of the diet consists of small mammals, often small rodents such as voles and rats. There is no reason to assume that the spot-bellied eagle-owl does not also take a very large quantity of relatively small prey such as rodents until complete dietary studies are known. However, almost all of the prey thus far reported for this species is very large and impressive, much of it being presumably as heavy or heavier than the eagle- owls themselves. Due to being most widely reported as being chased and eaten by spot-bellied eagle-owls has led some authors to list their primary prey as pheasants. Among these, junglefowl (Gallus sp.) and kalij pheasants (Lophura leucomelanos), both weighing from , are commonly eaten, as well as Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), which can weigh anything from . The spot-bellied eagle-owl pounces on gamebirds while they're asleep on their perches in trees or bamboo clumps, often killing them in seconds with their powerful talons. Cases, where they've followed peafowl to their roosts and then pulled them out at sundown, have been reported. It also consumes an array of mammals, from small rodents to large prey such as apparent adults of golden jackals (Canis aureus), hares (Lepus ssp.), large Indian civets (Viverra zibetha), Indian spotted chevrotains (Moschiola indica), and even young muntjacs (Muntiacus sp.).Nandini, R. 2005 Predation by Forest Eagle-Owl Bubo nipalensis on Mouse Deer Moschiola meminna. Bull. BO C, 47, 121-122. These larger mammals are likely as much as or even more. While most reported prey appear to be largely terrestrial, they are known to capture arboreal prey including Indian giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) and juvenile purple-faced langur (Trachypithecus vetulus). Additionally, they are considered a potential threat to toque monkeys (Macaca sinica), and one apparently caught an Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus) from its tree roost.Kannan, R. (1994). Forest Eagle Owl (Bubo nipalensis Hodgson)‚Äìa predator of the Indian Giant Squirrel (Ratufa indica). Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, 91, 454.Dittus, W. P. (1975). Population dynamics of the toque monkey, Macaca sinica. Socioecology and psychology of primates, 42, 125-151.Roy, O., Chakraborti, T. M., & Chakraborty, R. (2018). Spot-bellied Eagle-Owl Bubo nipalensis feeding on Indian Flying Fox Pteropus giganteus. Indian Birds, Correspondence. Due to the capture of diurnal prey such as giant squirrel, partial daytime foraging habits have been inferred for the spot-bellied eagle owl.Ramanujam, M. E., & Singh, T. (2017). A comparative study of the diet of the Indian Eagle Owl Bubo bengalensis (Franklin, 1831) from two distinct habitats in the Tamil Nadu- Puducherry area, southern India. Journal of Threatened Taxa, 9(3), 9892-9902. They will also opportunistically prey upon snakes, lizards (including large monitor lizards) and fish. Like several of the eagle-owls and fish owls but unlike most owls, the spot-bellied eagle-owl has been recorded as feeding on carrion. Thus far, they've been seen feeding on the carcases of goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and tigers (Panthera tigris). =Breeding= A young spot- bellied eagle-owl, which tend to be paler than adults. This species' nesting season is from December to March, however, an egg has been recorded as late as June in Cachar. Most nesting sites are in large, spacious tree hollows. Alternately, they use abandoned stick nests made by other large birds, in many cases those previously built by eagles, vultures or kites. They've additionally been recorded as nesting in caves and sheltered fissures of rock walls. In this species, only one egg has ever been recorded per clutch and this is only one of three amongst all owl species (besides the buffy fish owl (Bubo flavipes) and the barred eagle-owl) where this is known to be the case. The egg is white and round ovoid shape with a smooth surface, averaging in size and are thus around the same size as the eggs of the largest living owls, the Eurasian eagle-owl and Blakiston's fish owl (Bubo blakistoni). It has been reported that both sexes engage in incubation but this may not be the case (male owls generally do little to no incubating in eagle-owls), with the male more likely temporarily covering the eggs while the female flies off for a short period. Few further details are known of their breeding biology, including the brooding and fledging stages due to this species reportedly being very fierce and aggressive in defence of their nests. Anecdotes have claimed that some rather serious injuries have been incurred in the process of approaching spot-bellied eagle-owl nests, thus caution and distance from active nests is recommended.Hume, R. (1991). Owls of the world. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991.Ramanujam, M. E. (2004). Inter-specific intimidatory behaviour of adult Indian Eagle Owls Bubo bengalensis (Franklin) in defence of their nestlings. Zoos‚Äô Print Journal, 19(2), 1343-1345. Status This species is generally uncommon, likely needing large hunting and breeding territories and thus occurs at low densities. However, it continues to occur over a large range and is not thought to be conservation dependent. Areas where deforestation occurs are likely to be vacated by this species, which is perhaps the only widespread threat faced by this owl.

Acrobatics over Salvador: La Marioneta Gigante by Spanish company Carros de foc Street theatre is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in outdoor public spaces without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including shopping centres, car parks, recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from buskers to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of- spreading-awareness/ Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers. Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street festivals, children's shows or parades, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience. The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple costumes and props, and often there is little or no amplification of sound, with actors depending on their natural vocal and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that physical theatre, including dance, mime and slapstick, is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd. Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or roped off) and a ticketed audience. In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a licence or specific permission through local or state governments in order to perform. Many performers travel internationallyInternational list of performers to certain locations of note. Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious passion plays and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in variety theatres, music halls and in vaudeville, now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include Robin Williams,Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio David Bowie, Jewel and Harry Anderson. Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment. Reasons for staging work on the street Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled Our Daily BreadArchive Video that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of Wonder Bread along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives. Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination. Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as Carnival, commedia dell'arte etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context. Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of Welfare State International argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own. A street play (nukkad natak) in Dharavi slums in Mumbai. Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the guerrilla theatre of San Francisco Mime Troupe, The Living Theatre, the carnivalesque parades of Bread and Puppet Theatre, and the work of Ashesh Malla and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of Nepal. A character- based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a Candid Camera way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen. Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

Eggs may also sometimes be used as an ingredient, with cream of tartar and baking soda added to leaven the dough. Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be either crisp or soft depending on the ingredients used. Snickerdoodles are often referred to as \\"sugar cookies\\". However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon.  Etymology  The Joy of Cooking claims that snickerdoodles are probably German in origin, and that the name is a corruption of the German word Schneckennudel, a Palatine variety of schnecken. It is also possible that the name is simply a nonsense word with no particular meaning, originating from a New England tradition of whimsical cookie names.Herbst, Sharon Tyler (2001) Food Lover's Companion, Barrons Educational Series, New York, NY The Oxford English Dictionary claims the word's origin is \\"uncertain\\", and possibly a portmanteau of the word \\"snicker\\", an \\"imitative\\" English word with Scottish roots that indicates a \\"smothered laugh\\", and \\"doodle\\", a Germanic loanword into English meaning a \\"simple or foolish fellow,\\" originally derived from the Germanic dudeltopf, meaning \\"simpleton, noodle, night-cap\\". The word \\"snicker\\" had appeared in the English language by 1836, while \\"doodle\\" had appeared by the early 17th century. The word \\"snickerdoodle\\" itself, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is first recorded in 1889.  Food trends  The snickerdoodle is a very common cookie in the United States, but is relatively unknown in other countries. The cookie is common to Mennonite and Amish communities and was a favorite treat of the Indiana poet, James Whitcomb Riley. In more recent times, the Snickerdoodle cookie has transformed into a popular flavor of desserts, sweets, drinks, etc. Big brands have taken the simple dessert and turned them into their own original products. For example, General Mills created a Snickerdoodle flavored Chex Mix Muddy Buddies to their snack line.

The Latin word \\"juratus\\", which is typically translated to \\"sworn\\", is intended to mean \\"oathbound\\". The book is one of the oldest existing medieval grimoires, as well as one of the most influential. Historical references Its date of composition is uncertain, but it is possibly mentioned as Liber Sacer in the 13th century, apparently asserting a high medieval date. The first certain historical record is the 1347 trial record of Olivier Pepin from Mende, France.Jan Buhlman, \\"Notice of the Liber juratus in Early Fourteenth- century France\\", Societas Magica Newsletter, Fall 2005, Issue 14, p. 4 Johannes Hartlieb (1456) mentions it as one of the books used in necromancy. The oldest preserved manuscript dates to the 14th century, Sloane MS 3854 (fol 117-144). Sloane MS 313, dating to the late 14th or early 15th century, was once in the possession of John Dee. Content It is supposedly the product of a conference of magicians who decided to condense all of their knowledge into one volume. In 93 chapters, it covers a large variety of topics, from how to save one's soul from purgatory to the catching of thieves or finding of treasures. It has many instructions on how to conjure and command demons, to work other magical operations, and knowledge of what lies in Heaven among other highly sought information. Like many grimoires, it has lengthy dissertations for proper operation and seals to be used.

Force-feeding is the practice of feeding a human or animal against their will. The term gavage (, , ) refers to supplying a nutritional substance by means of a small plastic feeding tube passed through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (orogastric) into the stomach.  Of humans  = In psychiatric settings = Within some countries, in extreme cases, patients with anorexia nervosa who continually refuse significant dietary intake and weight restoration interventions, may be fed by force via nasogastric tube under restraint within specialist psychiatric hospitals. Such a practice may be highly distressing for both anorexia patients and healthcare staff. = In prisons = Some countries force-feed prisoners when they go on hunger strike. It has been prohibited since 1975 by the Declaration of Tokyo of the World Medical Association, provided that the prisoner is \\"capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment.\\" The violation of this prohibition may be carried out in a manner that can be categorised as torture, as it may be extremely painful and result in severe bleeding and spreading of various diseases via the exchanged blood and mucus, especially when conducted with dirty equipment on a prison population.BBC News: \\"UN concern at Guantanamo feeding.\\" Large feeding pipes are traditionally used on hunger striking prisoners whereas thin pipes are preferred in hospitals. United Kingdom Clipping from World Magazine, September 6, 1914 Suffragettes who had been imprisoned while campaigning for votes for women went on hunger strike and were force fed. This lasted until the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act of 1913, better known as the Cat and Mouse Act, whereby debilitated prisoners would be released, allowed to recover, and then re-arrested. Rubber tubes were inserted through the mouth (only occasionally through the nose) and into the stomach, and food poured down; the suffragettes were held down by force while the instruments were inserted into their bodies, an experience which has been likened to rape.Purvis, June; Emmeline Pankhurst, London: Routledge, p 134, In a smuggled letter, Sylvia Pankhurst described how the warders held her down and forced her mouth open with a steel gag. Her gums bled, and she vomited most of the liquid up afterwards.Pugh, Martin; The Pankhursts, UK: Penguin Books, 2001, p 259, Emmeline Pankhurst, founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, was horrified by the screams of women being force-fed in HM Prison Holloway. She wrote: \\"Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office. ‚Ä¶I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during the days when those cries were ringing in my ears.\\" When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst, in order to avoid being force-fed, raised a clay jug over her head and announced: \\"If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell I shall defend myself.\\" In 1911, Wiliam Ball, a male working class supporter who had broken two windows and consequently been sentenced to two months, was given this treatment and then cruelly separated from contact with his family, leading to his transfer secretly to a lunatic asylum. This case was taken up by groups such as WSPU and the Men's League for Women's Suffrage, whose pamphlet on the case had the subtitle Official Brutality on the increase. 1911 Votes for Women poster about William Ball (suffragist) The first woman in Scotland to be force fed was Ethel Moorhead, in Calton Jail, who despite being under medical supervision became seriously ill. The governor, Major William Stewart, argued that her illness was not caused by the feeding regime, but also said: > We must face the fact that artificial feeding is attended with risk and we > must teach them [ suffragette prisoners] that while we appreciate the risks > we are quite prepared to go on and will not be deterred from detaining > people like the prisoner [Moorhead] because there is a risk to their health, > if we take the necessary steps to make sure their detention is > effective.....They have the idea that they can frighten us by pointing out > the risk to health. But the governor also recognised that there was a risk of public opinion considering that prison authorities were 'going too far'. After Moorhead's release the WPSU published a handbill 'Scotland Disgraced and Dishonoured'. Moorhead describing how > 'The tube filled up all my breathing space, I couldn't breathe. The young > man began pouring in the liquid food. I heard the noises I was making of > choking and suffocation - uncouth noises human beings are not intended to > make and which might be made by a vivisected dog. Still he kept on pouring. In 1914, Frances Parker, another Scottish suffragette, was being force-fed by the rectum (a nutrient enema, a standard procedure before the invention of intravenous therapy) and once by the vagina in the Perth prison: Djuna Barnes, the American journalist, agreed to submit to force-feeding for a 1914 New York World magazine article. Barnes wrote, \\"If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits.\\" She concluded, \\"I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex.\\"Mills, Eleanor; with Kira Cochrane (eds.) (2005). Journalistas: 100 Years of the Best Writing and Reporting by Women Journalists. New York: Carroll & Graf. . p 163‚Äì166. The United Kingdom also used forcible feeding techniques against Irish Republicans during their struggle for independence. In 1917 Irish prisoner Thomas Ashe died as a result of complications from such a feeding while incarcerated at Dublin's Mountjoy Jail. The outrage of Ashe's death from the Irish public was so great that force feeding has never been used in Ireland since. United States Ethel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding after she was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917 for her activism in advocating for the legalization of birth control. She subsequently went on a hunger strike and refused to drink water for 185 hours.Guantanamo captives who will not comply with force-feeding have their arms, legs and head restrained in a feeding chair. They remain strapped in the chair until the nutrient is digested, to prevent induced vomiting. Under United States jurisdiction, force-feeding is frequently used in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, prompting in March 2006 an open letter by 250 doctors in The Lancet, warning that, in their opinion, the participation of any doctor is contrary to the rules of the World Medical Association. In the 2009 case Lantz v. Coleman,Lantz v. Coleman, 978 A. 2d 164 (Conn. Super. Ct. 2009) the Connecticut Superior Court authorized the state Department of Correction to force-feed a competent prisoner who had refused to eat voluntarily.Appel, Jacob M. Beyond Guantanamo: Torture Thrives in Connecticut November 17, 2009 In 2009, terrorist Richard Reid, known as the \\"shoe bomber,\\" was force-fed while on a hunger strike at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado. Hundreds of force-feedings have been reported at ADX Florence. Forced feeding has also been used by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement against detained asylum seekers on hunger strike. In February 2019, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed that such treatment of detainees could constitute a breach of the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Associated Press quoted one 22-year old asylum seeker who alleged that \\"he was dragged from his cell three times a day and strapped down on a bed as a group of people poured liquid into tubes inserted into his nose.\\" Soviet Union Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky described how he was force-fed: \\"The unfortunate patients had their mouth clamped shut, had a rubber tube inserted into their mouth or nostril. They keep on pressing it down until it reaches your esophagus. A china funnel is attached to the other end of the tube and a cabbage-like mixture poured down the tube and through to the stomach. This was an unhealthy practice, as the food might have gone into their lungs and caused pneumonia.\\"  United Nations War Crimes Tribunal  On December 6, 2006, the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of force-feeding of Serbian politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj. They decided it was not \\"torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading.\\" Israel In 2015, the Knesset passed a law allowing the force-feeding of prisoners in response to a hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee who had been held for months in administrative detention. Israel doctors refused to feed Mohammad Allan against his will, and he resumed eating after the Supreme Court temporarily released him. Other forms Force-feeding of pernicious substances may be used as a form of torture and/or physical punishment. While in prison in northern Bosnia in 1996, some Serbian prisoners have described being forced to eat paper and soap. Sometimes it has been alleged that prisoners are forced to eat foods forbidden by their religion. The Washington Post has reported that Muslim prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison under the U.S.-led coalition described in sworn statements having been forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, both of which are strictly forbidden in Islam (see Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse). =Of babies= \\"Gavage\\" method of infant feeding used in France, late 19th century According to Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy, a French system of feeding newborn or premature babies who could not suckle was known as 'gavage.' Sadler dates its origin to 1874 and quotes √âtienne St√©phane Tarnier, a pioneer perinatologist, describing the procedure. Nowadays, infants in a neonatal intensive care unit are likely to be fed by nasogastric or sometimes orogastric tubes. =For girls before marriage= Force-feeding used to be practiced in North Africa and still is in Mauritania. Fatness was considered a marriage asset in women; culturally, voluptuous figures were perceived as indicators of wealth. In this tradition, some girls are forced by their mothers or grandmothers to overeat, often accompanied by physical punishment (e.g., pressing a finger between two pieces of wood) should the girl not eat. The intended result is a rapid onset of obesity, and the practice may start at a young age and continue for years. This is still the tradition in the rather undernourished Sahel country Mauritania (where it is called leblouh), where it induces major health risks in the female population; some younger men no longer insist on voluptuous brides, but traditional beauty norms remain part of the culture.\\"Women rethink a big size that is beautiful but brutal\\" Clare Soares 11 July 2006. Christian Science Monitor\\"Gavage in Mauritania\\" [Subalternate Reality] =In slavery= Africans on the Middle Passage journey to slavery in the United States tried to commit suicide by starving themselves, and were force fed with a contraption called the speculum orum. This device forced the slave's mouth open in order to be fed. (M Lamar released a 2013 album with that title, \\"steeped in racial politics and meditations on the history of black bodies and souls in America\\".)  Of domestic animals  Force-feeding has been used to prepare animals for slaughter. In some cases, such as is the case with ducks and geese raised for foie gras and peking duck, it is still practiced today. = In farming = Animal welfare groups object to force-feeding of birds. Here a Mulard duck is being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for foie gras production. Force-feeding is also known as gavage, from a French word meaning \\"to gorge\\". This term specifically refers to force-feeding of ducks or geese in order to fatten their livers in the production of foie gras. Force-feeding of birds is practiced mostly on geese or male Moulard ducks, a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid. Preparation for gavage usually begins four to five months before slaughter. For geese, after an initial free-range period and treatment to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed two to four times a day for two to five weeks, depending on the size of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird's throat to deposit the food into the bird's crop (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent gag reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as chickens. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons. In modern Egypt, the practice of fattening geese and male Muscovy ducks by force-feeding them various grains is present, mostly by individuals, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption of those birds later. It is not widespread on commercial farms however. The term used for such a practice is tazƒ°ƒ´·π≠ (), from the verb zaƒ°ƒ°a·π≠(a) (). Shen Dzu is a similar practice of force-feeding pigs. =In scientific research= Gavage is used in some scientific studies such as those involving the rate of metabolism. It is practiced upon various laboratory animals, such as mice. Liquids such as medicines may be administered to the animals via a tube or syringe.

Although several performance theatre disciplines are often described as \\"physical theatre,\\" the genre's characteristic aspect is a reliance on the performers' physical motion rather than, or combined with, text to convey storytelling. Performers can communicate through various body gestures (including using the body to portray emotions). Common elements Certain institutions suggest that all physical theatre genres share common characteristics, although individual performances do not need to exhibit all such characteristics to be defined as physical theatre. Research into the training or \\"work\\" of physical theatre artists cites an amalgamation of numerous elements adopted as a means to further inform the theatrical research/production. These elements include: Devised origins, rather than originated from * Inter-disciplinary origins, spanning music, dance, visual art, etc., as well as theatre * Challenging the traditional, proscenium arch, and the traditional performer/audience relationship (also known as \\"breaking the fourth wall\\"). * Encouraging audience participation, any interaction that occurs physically throughout the course of a performance. Some practitioners, such as Lloyd Newson, despite being the first company to incorporate the term Physical Theater into his company's title (DV8 Physical Theater), has expressed concern that the expression is now being used as a \\"miscellaneous\\" category, which includes anything that does not fall neatly into literary dramatic theater or contemporary dance. He is also frustrated that many companies and performers who describe what they do as physical theatre lack physical skills, training and/or expertise in movement. As such, contemporary theatre approaches (including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, post-dramatic performance, etc.), while having their own distinct definitions, are often simply labelled \\"physical theatre\\" for no other reason than they are unusual in some way. Dance that is of a theatrical nature can also be problematic. A dance piece may be called \\"physical theatre\\" simply because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative. However, although it is theatrical and physical, it may not necessarily share anything in common with the physical theatre tradition. Modern physical theatre Contemporary dance troupe A modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. Mime and theatrical clowning schools, such as L'√âcole Internationale de Th√©√¢tre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as Steven Berkoff and John Wright received their initial training at such institutions. Contemporary dance has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a certain level of physical control and flexibility. These qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as Commedia dell'arte, and some suggest links to the ancient greek theatre, particularly the theatre of Aristophanes. Another physical theatre tradition started with the French master Etienne Decroux (father of corporeal mime). Decroux's aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor, allowing the creation of a more metaphorical theatre. This tradition has grown, and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools. Daniel Stein, a teacher out of the lineage of Etienne Decroux, has this to say about physical theatre: > 'I think physical theatre is much more visceral and audiences are affected > much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theatre is a > live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I > know of. Live theatre, where real human beings are standing in front of real > human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the > sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, > visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else > that we partake of in our lives. I don‚Äôt think we could do it the same way > if we were doing literary-based theatre.' Interview with Daniel Stein Arguably, the point at which physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when Jean-Louis Barrault (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher's notion that the mime should be silent. If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as \\"Total Theatre\\" and Barrault advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. He viewed each element as equally important, and believed that each should be explored for their possibilities. Barrault was a member of Michel Saint-Denis's company, alongside Antonin Artaud. Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the proscenium arch is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience. Eastern theatre traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese Noh tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of Balinese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, Jacques Copeau and Joan Littlewood have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. Tadashi Suzuki drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through Anne Bogart's collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the Viewpoints method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the Butoh Movement, which originated from Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.) Besides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with Konstantin Stanislavski. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of naturalism, and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work. Contemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with Rudolf von Laban. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the Tanzteater of Pina Bausch and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the postmodern dance movement of the Judson Church Dance also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and somatic training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, Steve Paxton taught theatre students at Dartington College of Arts and other institutions.

It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex and from 1929 was part of the Yiewsley and West Drayton Urban District, which became part of Greater London in 1965. The settlement is near the Colne Valley Regional Park and its centre lies north of Heathrow Airport. Traditionally the Parish of West Drayton covers . In 1901 the population of the civil parish was 984. In the 2011 Census 14,370 people were living in the West Drayton electoral ward. The ward has three councillors in the Hillingdon Borough Council.838 acres. 'Table of population, 1801-1901', in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 2, General ed.

Toponymy In 939 the area was known as Draegtun. Tun/ton is cognate with the later form town, but originally implied any kind of farmstead of more than one family. Dray is cognate with draught (as in draft horse/a dray) implying a portage/slope used for dragging loads, or simply notable use of the dragged plough, quite possibly given about 13 other examples in England simply land under till. It is recorded as Draitone in the 1086 Domesday Book, and as Westdrayton in 1465.Mills, A. D.: A Dictionary of British Place-Names (Oxford University Press, 2003) It is thought that the West may have been added to differentiate the village from Drayton near Ealing. Geography West Drayton lies to the south of the Great Western Main Line which run east‚Äìwest, with Yiewsley lying to the north of the railway line. It lies on the north side of the M4 motorway with the village of Harmondsworth to the south, and is northwest of M4 junction 4 (Heathrow Airport spur). This intersects with the A408 (for Stockley Park and Uxbridge) which forms West Drayton's eastern boundary with Hayes until the Heathrow Express railway line forms this boundary at Prologos Park Heathrow. On the eastern side of West Drayton is the county boundary with Buckinghamshire. West Drayton railway station is served by TfL Rail and Great Western Railway (GWR). TfL Rail operates a stopping service between London Paddington and Reading and GWR operates a stopping service between London Paddington and Didcot Parkway. The community has primary schools,West Drayton primary school and a secondary school, Park Academy West London is on Falling Lane in Colham Green. This physically and in governance replaced Evelyns Community School. The Green West Drayton has at its heart in the west of the parish a conservation area, The Green, along which are many buildings protected under UK law by grade II and II* listing ‚Äì residential and commercial. Demography As of the 2011 census, 57% of the population was White British. Living in the ward were 14,370 people according to the 2011 Census. The decennial censuses between 1801 and 1901 each show a rise in population and a low population density. From 1801 when the population of the almost identically sized ecclesiastical parish (civil parishes were invented later in the 19th century) was 515; to 1901 when the population of the civil parish was 984. Local Government Elections History =The St Paul's Era= The first record of West Drayton is from 939 when √Üthelstan, King of the English, gave the Manor of West Drayton to the Dean and Chapter of Cathedral church of St Pauls, recorded in the Cartularium Saxonicum. In the 1086 Domesday Book, West Drayton was assessed at ten hides with land suitable for six ploughs. The Parish had 17 landowners which indicated a population of less than 100. In 1461 a separate smaller manor, Drayton and Colham Garden Manor was first recorded, lying between Swan road and Colham Mill road. Both manors shared St Martin's Parish Church. Until 1525 West Drayton Manor was managed on behalf of the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's by an appointment known as a Firmarius who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the estate. =The Paget Era= From 1525 St Paul's began leasing West Drayton Manor to tenants. From 1537 the lessee of the manor was William Paget who held high office of state in the court of Henry VIII. On 1 April 1546, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's released the Manor of West Drayton to the Crown and two weeks later Henry granted the manor to the now knighted Sir William Paget. In the same year Henry granted Paget six manors in his native Staffordshire. Henry died in January 1547. Paget was made a peer of the realm as Lord Paget of Beaudesert by Edward VI in 1549. Gatehouse to the former West Drayton Manor House While he was leasing the manor William Paget used the existing building of St Pauls which was situated near St Martin's Parish church. Paget described the building as his \\"cotage at Drayton\\". Once owning the manor he built a new manor house, completed by 1549, which occupied the western end of the churchyard. The Manor grounds contained the Church, ornamental gardens, stables, a dovecote and other outbuildings and was enclosed by a high brick wall and two gatehouses. The wall and one of the gatehouses can still be seen today. The construction of the manor house and grounds resulted in the demolition of villagers' homes on Church Road and building on the graves of generations of West Drayton people in the churchyard. In addition to this, Paget enclosed 150 acres of common land to add to his demesne. In 1550 Paget legalised his position by obtaining a royal pardon for his actions. The loss of the Parish churchyard was compensated for by the granting of an alternative burial site which was near to where Drayton Hall is today. The burial site was used until 1888. After serving as Lord Privy Seal under Mary I, poor health meant William Paget played little part in public life after the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558, although as a Privy Councillor his advice was often sought. He died in West Drayton on 9 June 1563. He was succeeded by his son Henry, who died five years later without male issue. Henry's brother Thomas became the 3rd Baron Paget in 1568. Thomas Paget (1544-1590) and his brother Charles were both devout Roman Catholics, and would not conform to the Protestant religion of Queen Elizabeth I. Aided by Henry Percy, Paget fled to Paris on the uncovering of the Throckmorton Plot in November 1583, joining his brother Charles who had been in exile there since 1581. The failed conspiracy's plan was for an invasion of England by French forces under the command of Henry, Duke of Guise, financed by Philip II of Spain. English Catholics would then rise up and depose Elizabeth, placing Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots on the English throne. After his flight to France Elizabeth issued a proclamation commanding Thomas Paget to return to England. In June 1584 a formal demand for the surrender of Paget was made to the King of France through the English ambassador, which was not carried out. In 1587 he was attainted of treason by act of parliament. Paget received a pension of 180 crowns per month from Philip II and died in Brussels in early 1590. In 1587, with Thomas Paget being attainted, his lands including West Drayton were confiscated by the Crown. Elizabeth granted the manor to her Lord Chancellor, Sir Christopher Hatton for life. Hatton died in 1591 and from 1592 the manor was leased to her Lord Chamberlain, George Carey. Carey became 2nd Baron Hunsdon in 1596 and entertained Elizabeth at the West Drayton Manor House in October 1602. In the next year 1603, both Elizabeth and George Carey died. With Elizabeth's death, James I, son of Mary Queen of Scots acceded to the English throne. In 1604 James restored the Paget family lands and honours to Thomas Paget's son William. William like James I was a Protestant and had taken part in the successful Anglo-Dutch capture of Cadiz (Gades) in 1596 with Admiral Charles Howard, Sir Walter Raleigh and Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. It is believed William Paget received possession of West Drayton Manor in 1610. In 1612 William Paget became an 'Adventurer' (shareholder) and member of the Council of the Virginia Company (London Company) and the Somers Isles Company. The Paget Parish and Paget Island in Bermuda are named after him. He died on 29 August 1629 and is buried in St Martin's Churchyard. William Paget's son, William Paget, 5th Baron Paget, (1609-1678) was among the Peers who petitioned King Charles I on 18 August 1640 to summon a parliament for the redress of grievances. However at the start of the Civil War he did not wish to take up arms against the king and joined him at York in June 1642. He raised a regiment of foot which fought for the King at the battle of Edgehill on 23 Oct 1642. In 1643/44 he was with the King at Oxford. Paget had his estates sequestered by Parliament and was fined ¬£500 for supporting the King. He died in October 1678 and is buried in St Martin's Churchyard. William's son, William Paget, 6th Baron Paget, (1637-1713) was English Ambassador to Vienna (1689-1692) and Ambassador-Extraordinary to Constantinople (1692-1702). He participated in the negotiations which resulted in the Treaty of Karlowitz and was instrumental in the peace between Muscovy, Venice and the Ottomans. In 1714 William's son, Henry Paget the 7th Lord Paget,(1663-1743), was created 1st Earl of Uxbridge by George I. Paget was a member of the Privy Council and The town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts is named in his honour. He died in 1743 and was succeeded by his grandson, Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge (1719-1769). In 1755 Dawley House was acquired and the West Drayton Manor house was demolished around this time. Henry Paget died childless in 1769 and was buried in St Martin's Churchyard. The title of 9th Baron Padget was given to Henry Bayly whose name was change to Henry Paget by Royal Licience in 1770. He was created 1st Earl of Uxbridge in May 1784. On 21 October 1786 Henry Bayly-Paget sold the Manor of West Drayton to Fysh Coppinger of Lincoln's Inn, for ¬£12,000 ending the Paget family's relationship with West Drayton. =St Martin's Church= West Drayton's parish church, dedicated to Martin of Tours, was first mentioned in the 12th century. However, no trace of the original church remains. The present church was first built in the 13th century, of which the base of the tower, the piscina and the north chancel wall are incorporated in the present building, which dates from the 15th century. The church was heavily restored and reordered in 1974, when the altar was resited at the west end. The baptismal font is a splendid example of mid-15th century work, and the parish chest is early 17th century. There are monumental brasses to Richard Roose (1406), Margaret Burnell (1529), her son John Burnell (1551) and Dr James Good (1581, a physician to Mary, Queen of Scots). There is a small memorial tablet to George Carey, 2nd Baron Hunsdon (1547-1603) who was Lord of West Drayton Manor between 1592‚Äì1603. Carey's father was Queen Elizabeth I's cousin. The memorial states how 'bountiful' he was to the poor of the Parish. In his will Hunsdon left the sum of 'one hundred marks for the benefit of the poor of West Drayton for ever.' This is one of the oldest West Drayton Parish charities and its small income is still distributed each New Year's Day. Local economy Drayton Hall, offices of Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Kore Wireless and North South Wines Historically, employment was commonly connected to agriculture, the railway yards and the canal. The former RAF West Drayton hosted a military air traffic control centre co- located with the civil London Terminal Control Centre, residual functions of which were relocated to Swanwick, Hampshire entirely by January 2008. West Drayton has a mixture of tradespeople, airport workers, construction workers and commuters in office professions or public utilities such as schools and hospitals. Its housing hosts people with a range of incomes, with relatively large areas built aesthetically in keeping with existing housing by the local authority.

Skoglar Toste or Skoglar Tosti (there are several variations) is a legendary 10th century chieftain from the Swedish province of West Gothland. His name (skoglar, skauglar or skagul) was reportedly due to his experience in battle. Toste is mentioned in several sagas, most notable in Heimskringla. According to Snorri Sturluson, he was the father of Sigrid the Haughty. For some time he gave refuge to Harald Grenske, who later came back to woo Sigrid, only to be killed by her for his persistence. According to the sagas, Skoglar Toste was also the father of Ulf Tostesson, father of Ragnvald Ulfsson and grandfather of Stenkil who became the King of Sweden in 1060. Toste is said to have collected great riches when he demanded danegeld as he led a Viking army to England in 970. At Vallentuna, near Stockholm, the runestone of Orkesta (U 344) reads: Translation: \\"And Ulf of Borresta (Ulf) has taken three payments in England. That was the first that Toste (tusti) paid.

Most of the Old Norse poetry that survives was preserved in Iceland, but there are also 122 preserved poems in Swedish rune inscriptions, 54 in Norwegian and 12 in Danish. Poetry played an important role in the social and religious world of the Vikings. In Norse mythology, Sk√°ldskaparm√°l (1) tells the story of how Odin brought poetry to Asgard, which is an indicator of the significance of poetry within the contemporary Scandinavian culture. Old Norse poetry is characterised by alliteration, a poetic vocabulary expanded by heiti, and use of kennings. An important source of information about poetic forms in Old Norse is the Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson. Old Norse poetry is conventionally, and somewhat arbitrarily, split into two types‚ÄîEddaic poetry (also sometimes known as Eddic poetry) and skaldic poetry. Eddaic poetry includes the poems of the Codex Regius and a few other similar ones. Skaldic poetry is usually defined as everything else not already mentioned. Metrical forms The Karlevi Runestone inscription is a skaldic Old Norse poem in dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, the \\"courtly metre\\", raised in memory of a Viking chieftain. Old Norse poetry has many metrical forms. They range from the relatively simple fornyr√∞islag to the deeply complex dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, the \\"courtly metre\\". In Eddic poetry, the metric structures are generally simple, and are almost invariably lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr or fornyr√∞islag. Lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr, (known also as the \\"metre of chants\\"), because of its structure, which comprises broken stanzas, lends itself to dialogue and discourse. Fornyr√∞islag, \\"the metre of ancient words\\", is the more commonly used of the two, and is generally used where the poem is largely narrative. It is composed with four or more syllables per line. Other metrical forms include * M√°lah√°ttr is similar to fornyr√∞islag, but with a fixed metrical length of five syllables. * Hrynhenda, a variant of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, which uses all the rules of dr√≥ttkv√¶tt, with the exception that the line comprises four metrical feet rather than three. *Kvi√∞uh√°ttr, another variant of fornyr√∞islag with alternating lines of 3 and 4 syllables *Galdralag, the \\"magic spell metre\\", which contains a fourth line which echoes and varies the third line Eddaic poetry The Eddaic poems have the following characteristics. * The author is always anonymous. * The meter is simple, fornyr√∞islag, m√°lah√°ttr or lj√≥√∞ah√°ttr. * The word order is usually relatively straightforward. * Kennings are used sparingly and opaque ones are rare. Skaldic poetry The skaldic poems have the following characteristics. * The author is usually known. * The meter is ornate, usually dr√≥ttkv√¶tt or a variation thereof. * The syntax is ornate, with sentences commonly interwoven. * Kennings are used frequently.

He is a three-time Olympian and seven-time Olympic medalist (five gold, two silver). As a member of the U.S. national team, he holds the world record in the men's 4√ó100-meter medley relay (long course). Individually, he currently holds the world record in the 200-meter backstroke event (long course). In February 2011, Peirsol announced his retirement, saying, \\"I ended up doing everything I set out to do.\\" Peirsol's successes have earned him the American Swimmer of the Year Award once. He has won a total of thirty-six medals in major international competition, twenty-nine gold, six silver, and one bronze spanning the Olympics, the World, Pan American, and the Pan Pacific Championships. In his Olympic debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics, at the age of 17, Peirsol won a silver medal in the 200-meter backstroke. Four years later, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter and 200-meter backstroke (sweeping the backstroke events) and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In his third Olympics (2008 Summer Olympics), Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. He came short of his success he had in Athens by winning silver in the 200-meter backstroke, finishing behind Ryan Lochte. Personal life Peirsol was born in Newport Beach, California, in 1983, the son of Scott and Wella Peirsol. His father is a captain and his mother is a retired dental hygienist. He has one younger sister, Hayley, who is also a swimmer. Peirsol and his sister are the only sibling duo to medal at the same FINA World Championships (in 2003). He is a 2002 graduate of Newport Harbor High School in Newport Beach, California. Peirsol attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in 2006, majoring in Political Science. He was the 2003 NCAA Swimmer of the Year. After finishing his second year of collegiate eligibility, Peirsol signed with Nike, Inc., thus turning professional. Peirsol trained under the guidance of Eddie Reese and Kris Kubik. Peirsol is also involved in a number of charities. He is an ambassador for the Global Water Foundation and the Surfrider Foundation. He is also a spokesman for Oceana, which is the largest international ocean conservation and advocacy organization. Swimming career =2000‚Äì2002= Peirsol qualified for his first Olympics at the age of seventeen after finishing second to Lenny Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter backstroke, but did not qualify for the event, finishing 4th. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Peirsol finished second to Krayzelburg in the 200-meter backstroke. Afterwards Peirsol said, \\"I think I'm getting to a point where I'm becoming more of a threat to (Lenny) and I think he knows that.\\" At the 2001 National Championships, with Krayzelburg not competing, Peirsol qualified for the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, in the 100-meter backstroke, the 200-meter backstroke, and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. Peirsol's time in the 200-meter backstroke was the second-fastest ever, with only Krayzelburg's world record faster. At the 2001 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a time of 1:57.13, a championship record. Peirsol started off 2002 with the first world record of his career in the 200-meter backstroke, bettering Krayzelburg's mark set in 1999. In his first major competition of 2002, Peirsol won five medals (three gold, one silver, one bronze) at the 2002 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Moscow. In Moscow, he was a part of the American team that broke the world record in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay and he broke the 200-meter backstroke world record. At the 2002 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Yokohama, Japan, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. Combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak, Peirsol set the world record in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay to break the previous record set in 2000. =2003 World Championships= At the 2003 World Aquatics Championships in Barcelona, Spain, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. He also won a silver medal in the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.61, a championship record. His time was just 0.01 s off Lenny Krayzelburg's world record. Peirsol participated in the 4√ó200-meter freestyle relay with Michael Phelps, Nate Dusing, and Klete Keller to win silver behind Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke and won gold in a time of 1:55.92, almost two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Gordan Ko≈æulj of Croatia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In the 50-meter backstroke, Peirsol finished out of medal contention with an 8th-place finish. In his last event, Peirsol competed in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak. The final time of 3:31.54 was a new world record, bettering the old mark from 2002. =2004 Summer Olympics= At the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. Four years after finishing in 4th place at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won the 100-meter backstroke title, beating Lenny Krayzelburg. Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and was just off Krayzelburg's world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a world record time of 1:54.74, bettering his previous record of 1:55.15 set in 2002. He beat his closest competitor, Michael Phelps, by more than a second. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, sweeping the backstroke events, and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 54.06, 0.29 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan of Austria. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in an Olympic record time of 1:54.95 and completed a clean sweep of the backstroke events. Rogan again finished second to Peirsol, 2.40 s back. An initial disqualification alleged that Peirsol had made an illegal turn during the 200-meter backstroke race. Having been improperly entered, the disqualification was eventually overturned. In his last event, the 4√ó100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:30.68, 2.94 s ahead of second- place finisher Germany. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the world record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 53.45, bettering Krayzelburg's time of 53.60 set in 1999. Peirsol caused minor controversy when he accused Kosuke Kitajima of Japan of using an illegal dolphin kick in the 100-meter breaststroke final when compatriot Brendan Hansen lost by 0.17 s. =2004 FINA Short Course World Championships= Shortly after the 2004 Summer Olympics, Peirsol competed at the 2004 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Indianapolis where he won three gold medals. His first gold medal came in the 100-meter backstroke in a time of 50.72, a new championship record. Three days later, Peirsol competed in the 200-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 1:50.52, bettering his old mark of 1:50.64 (set earlier in 2004) and finished 2.02 s ahead of Matt Welsh of Australia. Peirsol then competed in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:25.09, 4.63 s ahead of Australia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention. =2005 World Championships= At the 2005 World Championship Trials, the selection meet for the 2005 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won and broke his own world record with a time of 53.17, bettering his time of 53.45 set in Athens. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol easily won with a time of 1:55.13. At the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Montreal, Quebec, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a time of 53.62, just 0.01 s off his championship record set two years earlier in Barcelona. For his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in dominating fashion. His time of 1:54.66 was a new world record and 1.97 s ahead of second-place finisher Markus Rogan. Peirsol then competed in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.85, 3.23 s ahead of second-place finisher Russia. Peirsol also competed in the 50-meter backstroke but finished out of medal contention. =2006 Pan Pacific Championships= At the 2006 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships and the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke. At the 2006 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Victoria, British Columbia, Peirsol won gold in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a championship record time of 53.32. Peirsol was the only individual in the field to break 54 seconds and beat his closest competitor, Ryan Lochte, by 0.70 s. Peirsol earned his second gold in the 200-meter backstroke with a world record time of 1:54.44, bettering his previous mark of 1:54.66 set last year in Montreal. At the time, Peirsol held nine of the fastest times posted in the event and defeated second-place finisher Michael Phelps by 2.37 s. Peirsol then competed in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay with Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a time of 3:31.79, a new championship record. =2007 World Championships= At the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne, Australia, Peirsol won one gold and one silver medal. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won gold in a world record time of 52.98, bettering his time of 53.17 set in 2005. Peirsol became the first man in the event to go under 53 seconds and beat Ryan Lochte by 0.52 s. At the time, Peirsol held five of the fastest times posted in the event. At one point during the first 50-meters, Peirsol was a full meter behind Ryan Lochte, and at the turn, Peirsol was in third place behind Liam Tancock and Lochte. But Peirsol had a superior finish to over-take both swimmers. After the race, Peirsol thanked Lochte for the fast start, which he attributed to the world record. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Lochte and lost his world record he set in 2006. Throughout the race, Peirsol was in first and at the 150-meter mark, Peirsol was ahead of Lochte 1:24.56 to 1:25.05. But Lochte had a strong finish to over-take Peirsol for the win. For Peirsol, it was his first international loss in the event since the 2000 Summer Olympics. Peirsol did not have a chance to swim in the 4√ó100-meter medley relay final because the United States was disqualified in the heats. =2008 Summer Olympics= At the 2008 U.S. Olympic Team Trials, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100 and 200-meter backstroke, repeating his results from the 2004 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won ahead of Matt Grevers with a world record time of 52.89, lowering his previous mark of 52.98 set last year. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 1:54.32, equalling Ryan Lochte's world record set last year. Lochte finished a close second, just 0.02 s behind Peirsol. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. He also won silver in the 200-meter backstroke. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was the heavy favorite for gold, with him being the world-record holder and the defending Olympic champion. For the final of the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol was swimming in lane two, having qualified fifth in the semi-finals. At the first 50-meters in the 100-meter backstroke final, Peirsol was in second place behind Liam Tancock, who took it out in 25.11. Peirsol was 0.54 s behind Tancock at the turn. However, after the turn, Peirsol overtook Tancock, who eventually placed sixth, and won the gold. Peirsol's final time of 52.54 was a new world record, bettering his previous mark of 52.89 set last month. After the race, Peirsol said, \\"I'm a little bit excited, a little bit relieved, absolutely elated.\\" In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte 1:54.33 to 1:53.94. In winning the gold, Lochte broke the world record tie he and Peirsol shared in the 200-meter backstroke. In his last event, the 4√ó100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Brendan Hansen, Michael Phelps, and Jason Lezak to win gold in a world record time of 3:29.34, lowering the old mark of 3:30.68 set four years ago in Athens. =2009 World Championships= Peirsol (right) after his victory in the 200 m backstroke at the 2009 National Championships At the 2009 National Championships, the selection meet for the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, Peirsol won individual titles in the 100- and 200-meter backstroke. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol won in a time of 51.94, reclaiming the world record from Aschwin Wildeboer. In winning the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol became the first person to swim the event in under 52 seconds and it was the sixth time he set the world record in the event. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol defeated Ryan Lochte and reclaimed the 200-meter backstroke world record he lost in Beijing. Peirsol also competed in the 100-meter butterfly but did not qualify for the event in Rome, finishing in third place. At the 2009 World Aquatics Championships in Rome, Peirsol won two gold medals. In his first event, the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol surprised many after he failed to make the final, which he attributed to a miscalculation of his own position in the semi-finals. Peirsol said, \\"I thought I was going faster. I am very disappointed. I completely misjudged my race. I have to go on, pick myself up and focus on my next events.\\" But Peirsol's world record in the 100-meter backstroke would stay in place after the final. In his second event, the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol won the gold in a time of 1:51.92, breaking his own world record of 1:53.08 by more than a second. Peirsol then competed in the 50-meter backstroke but did not advance past the heats. In his last event, the 4√ó100-meter medley relay, Peirsol combined with Eric Shanteau, Michael Phelps, and David Walters to win gold in a world record time of 3:27.28, lowering the old mark of 3:29.34 set a year ago in Beijing. While leading off the relay, Peirsol broke the championship record in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 52.19, bettering the previous mark of 52.26 set by Junya Koga. =2010= At the 2010 National Championships, Peirsol placed second in both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke. In the 100-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to David Plummer, who touched just 0.03 s ahead. For Peirsol, it was his first loss in the 100-meter backstroke at a national championships since he placed 4th at the 2000 U.S. Olympic Team Trials. In the 200-meter backstroke, Peirsol placed second to Ryan Lochte, who finished 0.70 s ahead. At the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Irvine, California, Peirsol won gold in the 100-meter backstroke and the 4√ó100-meter medley relay. Peirsol's first gold came in the 100-meter backstroke. Initially, Peirsol did not qualify to swim in the medal-awarding final because only a maximum of two swimmers from one country could enter in the finals and David Plummer and Ryan Lochte owned the top two American spots. However, Lochte withdrew from the 100-meter backstroke and as a result, Peirsol advanced to the finals. Peirsol won the gold in a time of 53.31, breaking his own championship record set in 2006. Peirsol then competed in the 200-meter backstroke but did not qualify to swim in the medal- awarding final, with Lochte and Tyler Clary taking the top two American spots. In his final event, the 4√ó100-meter medley relay, Peirsol won gold along with compatriots Mark Gangloff, Michael Phelps, and Nathan Adrian. This would be the last race of his international career. When the competition was over, Peirsol said he put his swimming equipment in a locker and walked away. Retirement Piersol at the 2013 Santa Clara Grand Prix. On February 2, 2011, at the age of twenty-seven, Peirsol announced that he was officially retiring from professional swimming. This ended months of speculation after Peirsol withdrew from his spots in both the 2010 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Dubai and the 2011 World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. Peirsol said he contemplated retirement after the 2008 Summer Olympics. In 2010, he said he had no further goals and found it difficult to swim because he \\"ended up doing everything (he) set out to do.\\" He added, \\"Things outside of the sport started to interest me.\\" Peirsol said it was \\"poetic\\" that he ended his career at the same pool he trained in as a kid at the 2010 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships. Peirsol plans to go to graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin to study political science. Peirsol returned to Newport Beach where he works as a seasonal ocean lifeguard and swim coach at his former school Newport Harbor High School. In November 2015 it was announced that Peirsol would be inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame Class of 2016 alongside fellow Americans Dara Torres and coach Bob Bowman.

Early life Skase was born into a wealthy Melbourne family. His father was Charles Skase, 1948 winner of the Melbourne Sun-Aria, and prominent on-air personality on radio station 3DB, including his role as star of the live-to- air programme, The Happy Gang, in the 1950s. Christopher Skase was educated at Malvern and Caulfield Grammar Schools. Career He began his career as a stockbroker, but soon became a finance journalist instead, working at The Sun News-Pictorial. In 1975 he purchased Qintex, a small Tasmanian company. Skase slowly developed Qintex and, over several years, turned it into one of Australia's larger corporations. By the late 1980s, the Qintex group was worth A$1.5 billion. Skase owned five resorts as well as interests in the Seven television network and the Brisbane Bears football club. On the eve of the 1990 economic recession, his two \\"Mirage\\" resorts in Queensland were among the largest in the country and one of them, the Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas Resort, played a key role in putting the formerly small town of Port Douglas on the international tourist map. Skase became known for his displays of wealth, with a lavish 40th birthday party in 1988, and a company Christmas party that cost $450,000. In one particular incident, he had his private jet fly from Port Douglas to Melbourne to pick up a dress for his wife, Pixie. Downfall By 1989, interest rates had risen, an attempt to buy the MGM film studios fell through, and Skase was forced to sell half of his resorts to Japanese investors. In the months that followed, it became clear that Skase and the Qintex group had overextended themselves. According to a 1998 report by ABC program Four Corners, Skase had begun obtaining and moving money into foreign bank accounts in July 1989. Despite efforts lasting more than a decade, Max Donnelly, the creditors' trustee, was unable to trace much of the missing money. At a meeting in October, Skase began to fall out with the Qintex board. He demanded that the board pay $13.5 million to a private company that he owned. The board refused to ratify the payment, but soon discovered that the payment had already been made. Skase then demanded the board give him a pay rise, and threatened to resign if he did not receive it. The board refused, with several members themselves threatening to resign. One of the directors reported the incident to the Australian Securities Commission. The creditors moved in, and Qintex collapsed. Skase was forced to sell the Seven Network for a tiny portion of what he had paid for it. In the end, Skase was more than $700 million in debt. He began to parcel up his remaining wealth, including more than $900,000 worth of antiques and furniture. Exile to Spain He was charged with improperly using his position to obtain management fees, briefly arrested and spent a night in jail. However, he was subsequently released and allowed to regain his passport. He promptly fled the country. His discovery on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1991 by the Sydney Morning Herald sparked intense media interest. In 1994, the Australian Securities Commission assembled a case against Skase, with the assistance of former Skase associate Lawrence Van der Plaat, and began to chase him in earnest. Throughout the 1990s, successive Australian governments, in combination with Max Donnelly, attempted to have Skase extradited from Spain, with no success. Skase claimed that he was unable to travel due to a life-threatening lung condition. This was disputed by the Australian government, who released a video filmed by some Australian tourists, which featured Skase walking easily on a local beach. During this period, Skase also attempted to build a new business empire, and continued to live in a multimillion-dollar mansion. In one incident, television personality Andrew Denton organised a public subscription to hire a bounty hunter to kidnap Skase. However, after raising $250,000 the idea was called off on legal advice. In May 1998, the Australian government cancelled Skase's passport. Skase was ordered to leave Majorca by 23 July, but lodged an appeal. The extradition process was still tied up in the courts when, the following month, he became a citizen of Dominica. At this point, numerous commentators suggested that the chase was over, and that there was nothing more that could be done to bring Skase back to Australia. Death By 2001, both the Australian government and Donnelly were starting to grow weary of the large costs of continuing the \\"chase for Skase\\". Nevertheless there was renewed speculation in January that Skase would soon be deported from Spainin which case it would have been legally possible to bring him back to Australia, with which Dominica had an extradition treaty. However, he became ill and died of stomach cancer in Majorca on 5 August 2001, before any further proceedings had taken place. In popular culture A satirical 2001 film, Let's Get Skase, is based on an invented plot to kidnap Christopher Skase in Majorca.

A. cardamines is mainly found throughout Europe and temperate Asia (Palearctic) The males feature wings with a signature orange pigmentation, which is the origin of A. cardamines' common name. Males and females of this species occupy different habitats: males mostly frequent the edges of forests whereas females frequent meadows. A. cardamines feeds on most plants found within its habitat but the females selectively oviposit on young inflorescence of crucifers. Mating is usually controlled by females as virgin females found in flight are always pursued by males immediately. Females can signal different meanings to the approaching males by using their abdomen. There is evidence that mated females have an anti-aphrodisiac and that their usage of the abdomen has a closely related function in presenting these pheromones to males. This species has been affected by changing temperatures, and its first appearance has shifted forward 17.3 days in the Spring. Description The common name derives from the bright orange tips of the male's forewings. The males are a common sight in spring, flying along hedgerows and damp meadows in search of the more reclusive female which lacks the orange and is often mistaken for other species of butterfly. The undersides are mottled green and white and create a superb camouflage when settled on flowerheads such as cow parsley and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata).Cott, Hugh (1940). Adaptive Coloration in Animals. pp. 74‚Äì75. Males display a variation in body size, which is attributed to their host plant. Males reared on C. pratensis become the smaller of the two variants, and those reared on A. petiolata become the larger. Distribution and habitat A. cardamines can be found throughout Europe and from temperate Asia to China. The habitats of males and females differ significantly. Males are restricted to edges and clearings of forests for their entire lives. On rare occurrences, males will leave forest edges and enter meadows, but this is only to cross and reach another forest edge. They prefer to fly in bright sunlight and avoid areas of shade in the forest. Females are mainly found in open meadows and dry hillocks for a majority of their lives. Females only spend short period of time in forests before reentering nearby meadows. In Armenia the species inhabits not only forests and woodlands, but also meadows, where males occur together with females. Food resources * Lathyrus montanus * Viola canina * Viola riviniana * Geranium robertianum * Viola tricolor * Capsella bursa-pastoris * Lychnis flos-cuculi Female A. cardamines feed on the flowers listed above, in addition to all species of flowers located in the habitats where their host plants are found. They do not interrupt host plant search to find foraging habitats; instead, they visit available flowers in host plant habitats. Parental care =Oviposition= Females will tend to only deposit eggs on crucifers if they are in bloom. Furthermore, they prefer to oviposit on young inflorescences, and there have been instances of A. cardamines that refuse to deposit eggs on inflorescences that had aged. If the stem of the inflorescence is not strong enough to support the weight of the female A. cardamines, they will cease egg laying. =Egg guarding= Initially, it was believed that the bright orange color of A. cardamines egg deterred further egg laying. However, new studies have discovered another deterrent. To prevent other females from laying eggs on the same flowerhead, female A. cardamines will deposit a pheromone during egg laying. This pheromone will deter other females from also laying an egg on that flower head. Flower heads with more than one egg can still be found because the pheromone is water-soluble and relatively short- lived. =Host plant learning and selection= When choosing host plants, female A. cardamines only lay eggs on host plants growing in the sun. Those in the shade are completely avoided, and plants partially covered in shade are only selected if the female does not have to travel through shaded areas to reach the plant. Females are extremely selective for host plant size, and larger flower heads are preferred to smaller ones. Even when smaller flower heads are overly abundant, female A. cardamines will completely ignore them in search of larger flower heads. Females will also ignore flower heads already containing a conspecific egg. This is because larva from the already laid eggs will hatch first and cannibalize any other present eggs. Life history = Life cycle =  Egg  Eggs of A. cardamines are always deposited on inflorescences of crucifers. When first laid, eggs are a white pigment and eventually change to orange and then brown after a few days. Eggs are also covered with a pheromone that detracts other females from ovipositing on the same crucifer. Larva When hatched, the larva consumes its egg shell before eating host plant and its seed pods. The fully grown larva leaves the food plant after its five larval instars and pupates on lower vegetation. If more than one egg had been laid on the same host plant, then the larva to first hatch will cannibalize its sibling. This is the major reason why Orange tip females avoid eggs laying on the same crucifer. Pupa While the earlier stages of A. cardamines are easy to find since most individuals develop on a single plant, the pupa is very difficult to locate.

From data collected from 1976 to 1998, spring and summer temperatures were found to have increased by approximately 1 degree Celsius. This has affected first appearance of A. cardamines, which has advanced by 17.3 days with the increasing temperature. The increased temperature has also been to connected to increases in duration of flight period of A.cardamines in Britain. Enemies =Predation= Corpses of A. cardamines caterpillars are often found with darkening around a wound near the tail. These injuries are consistent with damage inflicted by spiders, which are their main predators. The host plants of A. cardamines are often grazed by Muntjac deer. The deer favor plants with young flowers, which corresponds to the preferred plants of A. cardamines for egg laying. As a result, Muntjac deer are responsible for consuming up to nineteen percent of A. cardamines young through indirect predation. Mating =Courting= The result of male courting depends heavily on the location of the female when courted. Females found in flight are immediately pursued by males, and the encounter almost always results in acceptance of the male mating attempt. When males encounter females already perched on vegetation, their mating attempts are usually met by a raised abdomen. Both mated and virgin females respond to males with a raised abdomen, but the signals take different meanings. When a male encounters a mated female with a raised abdomen, it is taken as a signal of rejection, and he quickly leaves. When virgin females raise their abdomen, the signal takes on a male detention function instead of rejection. Males will continue to court a perched, virgin female with a raised abdomen until she acquiesces or flees. =Pheromone= While a specific pheromone has not been identified in A. cardamines, since both the rejection signal and detention signal in females are visually identical scientists hypothesize that a chemical signal distinguish the two. Mated females tend to track the males with their abdomens during the courting attempt, and this is behavioral evidence that mated females have an anti-aphrodisiac, and that the raised abdomen presents the pheromone as close as possible to the male.

Early years Roberts was born Josephine Rose Seagrist in Manhattan, New York and first appeared on stage at age 6. She was active in dramatic productions as a student at St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan) High School and gained additional experience in summer stock productions. Career =Radio= Roberts was a regular on The Texaco Summer Theater on CBS July 4 - December 5, 1943. The program was a summer replacement for The Fred Allen Show but was extended when Allen did not return as scheduled. =Stage= Sunny River was Roberts' first Broadway production. She played Madeleine Caresse December 4, 1941 - January 3, 1942. Later in 1942 she played in Hit the Deck with the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera. Roberts initially auditioned for the role of Ado Annie in the original Broadway production of Oklahoma! (which eventually went to Celeste Holm), but the show's librettist Oscar Hammerstein cast her as the female lead, Laurey. At the time of her death she was one of four surviving cast members of the original 1943 opening night production of Oklahoma! and the only one who played a principal role (Celeste Holm died several weeks earlier), along with George S. Irving, Marc Platt, and Bambi Linn. Roberts subsequently starred as Sara Longstreet on Broadway in the musical High Button Shoes. Recently, Ms. Roberts conducted workshops on singing and voice projection. In 2011 she was honored by the University of North Carolina's School of the Arts while attending their replica production of the original Oklahoma! She was in retirement for many years on Long Island, New York, when she appeared as Heidi Schiller in the 2001 Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim's Follies. Over the years she was seen in documentaries about Oscar Hammerstein II, George Abbott and in the film Broadway: The Golden Age, by the Legends Who Were There. =Television= On December 19, 1966, Roberts appeared in a production of Jack and the Beanstalk on CBS-TV. In 1977 on the Series Emergency! S6 E15 ‚ÄúBreakdown‚Äù, she made an appearance as Jane. Personal life Roberts was married to Dr. John J. Donlon, who died in 1965. They had a son, John J. Donlon, Jr. Death On August 13, 2012, Roberts died of congestive heart failure, aged 95, according to her son. Celeste Holm, who played Ado Annie in the same original production of Oklahoma!, had died only a month before, also at age 95.

Rolling blackouts are a last- resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system. Rolling blackouts are a measure of demand response if the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network. Rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network, or they may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents. Rolling blackouts generally result from two causes: insufficient generation capacity or inadequate transmission infrastructure to deliver power to where it is needed. Rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly, such as an extreme weather event.  In developing contexts  Rolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many developing countries where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or infrastructure is poorly managed. In well managed under-capacity systems, blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them, but in most cases they happen without warning, typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the 'safe' limit. These have wide- ranging impacts, and can effect the expectations of communities -- i.e. in Ghana dumsor describes the widespread expectations for intermittent unexpected power outages due to rolling blackouts.  In developed contexts  Rolling blackouts in developed countries sometimes occur due to economic forces at the expense of system reliability (such as in the 2000‚Äì01 California energy crisis), or during natural disasters such as heat waves.  Effects  Intermittent access to electricity causes major economic problems for businesses, who must often either pay for more expensive backup generation, curtail hours, or incur other expenses if refrigeration, lighting, or machinery stops unexpectedly.The Powerlessness Of Nigeria's Tech Startups References Category:Power outages ","title":"Rolling blackout"},{"id":"911519","text":"Free Speech Flag, from the HD DVD AACS case. Freedom of information is freedom of a person or people to publish and consume information. The government of the United Kingdom has theorised it as being an extension of freedom of speech, and a fundamental human right. It is recognized in international law. It is related to freedom of expression, which can apply to any medium, be it oral, writing, print, electronic, or through art forms. This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128 Freedom of information is a separate concept which sometimes comes into conflict with the right to privacy in the content of the Internet and information technology. As with the right to freedom of expression, the right to privacy is a recognized human right and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right. Lastly, freedom of information can include opposition to patents, opposition to copyrights or opposition to intellectual property in general. The international and United States Pirate Party have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.  In law  In June 2006, nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries, the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies. Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years. In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies. = Government bodies = , 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries. = Private bodies = , the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: Antigua and Barbuda, Angola, Armenia, Colombia, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Panama, Poland, Peru, South Africa, Turkey, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors. In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects.  Consumer protection  In 1983, the United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations adopted the United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection stipulating eight consumer rights, including \\"consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs\\". Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.  Investors  Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors. Such legislation was first adopted in Britain in the early 20th century, and later in North America and other countries. Disclosure regimes for the benefit of investors regained attention at the beginning of the 21st century as a number of corporate scandals were linked to accounting fraud and company director secrecy. Starting with Enron, the subsequent scandals involving Worldcom, Tyco, Adelphia and Global Crossing prompted the US Congress to impose new information disclosure obligations on companies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. Internet and information technology Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to freedom of expression with regard to the Internet and information technology. Freedom of information may also concern censorship in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access Web content, without censorship or restrictions. = The Information Society and freedom of expression = The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms democracy and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to freedom of expression for the \\"Information Society\\" in stating: > We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the Information Society, and as > outlined in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that > everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; that this right > includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive > and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of > frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need > and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the > Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to > participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information > Society offers. The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that \\"it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights\\". Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice. = Hacktivismo = The digital rights group Hacktivismo, founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic human right. The group's beliefs are described fully in the \\"Hacktivismo Declaration\\" which calls for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to be applied to the Internet. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to freedom of expression with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information. The Hacktivismo Declaration recognizes \\"the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet\\" and calls upon the hacker community to \\"study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored censorship of the internet\\" and \\"implement technologies to challenge information rights violations\\". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to freedom of expression is subject to limitations, stating \\"we recognized the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized state secrets, child pornography, and matters related to personal privacy and privilege, among other accepted restrictions.\\" However, the Hacktivist Declaration states \\"but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, intellectuals, artists, or religious figures.\\" = Global Network Initiative = On October 29, 2008 the Global Network Initiative (GNI) was founded upon its \\"Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy\\". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for human rights on freedom of expression and privacy set out in the UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).Global Network Initiative, FAQ Participants in the Initiative include the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches Global Network Initiative, Participants According to reports Cisco Systems was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. Harrington Investments, which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI \\"meaningless noise\\" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities. = Internet censorship = Jo Glanville, editor of the Index on Censorship, states that \\"the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech\\". The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the Internet. According to the Reporters without Borders (RSF) \\"internet enemy list\\" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: Cuba, Iran, Maldives, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Syria, Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.List of the 13 Internet enemies RSF, 2006 November A widely publicised example is the so-called \\"Great Firewall of China\\" (in reference both to its role as a network firewall and to the ancient Great Wall of China). The system blocks content by preventing IP addresses from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and proxy servers at the Internet gateways. The system also selectively engages in DNS poisoning when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical. Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, business companies, and organizations.Chinese Laws and Regulations Regarding Internet In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking on behalf of the United States, declared 'we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas'. In her 'Remarks on Internet Freedom' she also draws attention to how 'even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable', while reporting President Barack Obama's pronouncement 'the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become'.

One of the Russian Empire's Baltic German minority, Ungern was an ultraconservative monarchist who aspired to restore the Russian monarchy after the 1917 Russian Revolutions and to revive the Mongol Empire under the rule of the Bogd Khan. His attraction to Vajrayana Buddhism and his eccentric, often violent treatment of enemies and his own men earned him the sobriquet \\"the Mad Baron\\" or \\"the Bloody Baron\\". In February 1921, at the head of the Asiatic Cavalry Division, Ungern expelled Chinese troops from Mongolia and restored the monarchic power of the Bogd Khan. During his five-month occupation of Outer Mongolia, Ungern imposed order on the capital city, Ikh Kh√ºree (now Ulaanbaatar), by fear, intimidation and brutal violence against his opponents, particularly the Bolsheviks. In June 1921, he went on to invade eastern Siberia to support supposed anti-Bolshevik rebellions and to head off a Red Army-Mongolian partisan invasion. That action led to his defeat and capture two months later. He was taken prisoner by the Red Army and, a month later, was put on trial for counter-revolution in Novonikolaevsk. After a six-hour show trial, he was found guilty, and on 15 September 1921, he was executed. Early life Ungern-Sternberg as a child. Robert Nikolaus Maximilian Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg was born in Graz, Austria, on to a noble Baltic German family. The Ungern-Sternberg family had settled in present-day Estonia during the Middle Ages. Ungern-Sternberg's first language was German, but he became fluent in French, Russian, English and Estonian. His mother was a German noblewoman, Sophie Charlotte von Wimpffen, later Sophie Charlotte von Ungern-Sternberg, and his father was Theodor Leonhard Rudolph Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg (1857‚Äì1918). He also had Hungarian roots and claimed descent from Batu Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson, which played a role in his dream of reviving the Mongol Empire. In 1888 his family moved to Reval (Tallinn), the capital of the Governorate of Estonia in the Russian Empire, where his parents divorced in 1891. In 1894 his mother married the Baltic-German nobleman Oskar Anselm Hermann Freiherr von Hoyningen-Huene. Ungern-Sternberg grew up in the Governorate, with his home being the Hoyningen-Huene estate at Jerwakant (modern J√§rvakandi, Estonia), deep in the forests, about 40 miles from Reval. In the summer, Ungern-Sternberg lived on the Baltic island of Dago (now Hiiumaa), which he liked to boast had belonged to his family for over 200 years. The coat of arms of the Baltic noble family von Ungern-Sternberg As a boy, Ungern-Sternberg was noted for being such a ferocious bully that even the other bullies feared him and several parents forbade their children from playing with him, as he was a \\"terror\\". Ungern was well known for his love of torturing animals, and at the age of 12 he tried to strangle to death his cousin's pet owl for no particularly good reason other than his cruelty towards animals. Ungern-Sternberg had extreme pride in his ancient, aristocratic family and later wrote that his family had over the centuries \\"never taken orders from the working classes\\" and it was outrageous that \\"dirty workers who've never had any servants of their own, but still think they can command\\" should have any say in the ruling of the vast Russian Empire. Ungern-Sternberg, although proud of his German origin, identified himself very strongly with the Russian Empire. When asked whether his \\"family had distinguished itself in Russian service\\", Ungern proudly answered: \\"Seventy-two killed in wartime!\\" Ungern-Sternberg believed that return to monarchies in Europe was possible with the aid of \\"cavalry people\\" - meaning Russian Cossacks, Buryats, Tatars, Mongols, Kyrgyz, Kalmyks, etc. In 1893 Ungern-Sternberg surveyed mountain ranges for the Tiflis Geographical Society in Tbilisi. In 1898, his father was briefly imprisoned for fraud and, in 1899, was committed to the local insane asylum. From 1900 to 1902 Ungern attended the Nicholas I Gymnasium in Reval. His school records show that he was an unruly, bad-tempered young man who was constantly in trouble with his teachers because of frequent fights with other cadets and breaking other school rules: smoking in bed, growing long hair, leaving without permission etc., which finally led to the schoolmaster writing a letter in February 1905 to his stepfather and mother to ask them to withdraw him from the school, or he would be expelled. In 1905, he left the school to join the fighting in eastern Russia during the Russo-Japanese War, but it is unclear whether he participated in operations against the Japanese or if all military operations had ceased before his arrival in Manchuria although he was awarded the Russo- Japanese War Medal in 1913. In 1905, Russia exploded into revolution, and Estonian peasants went on a bloody jacquerie against the Baltic-German nobility, which owned most of the land there. Aristocrats were lynched and their estates burned down, one being the one at Jerwakant where Ungern- Sternberg had grown up. The Revolution of 1905 and the destruction of the Jerwakant estate were huge traumas to Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the jacquerie as confirming his belief that the Estonian peasants who worked on his family's lands were all \\"rough, untutored, wild and constantly angry, hating everybody and everything without understanding why\\". R.F. Ungern in the form of the 91st Infantry Dvinsky Regiment In 1906, Ungern was transferred to service in the Pavlovskoe Military School, in St. Petersburg, as a cadet of ordinary rank. As an army cadet, he proved to be a better student than he ever was as a naval cadet, and he actually studied his course material, but in the words of Palmer, he was a \\"mediocre student\\" at best. During the same period, Ungern- Sternberg had become obsessed with the occult and was especially interested in Buddhism. His cousin Count Hermann von Keyserling, who later knew him well, wrote that the baron was very curious from his teenage years onward with \\"Tibetan and Hindu philosophy\\" and often spoke of the mystical powers possessed by \\"geometrical symbols\\". Keyserling called Ungern-Sternberg \\"one of the most metaphysically and occultly gifted men I have ever met\\" and believed that the baron was a clairvoyant, who could read the minds of the people around him. Later, in Mongolia, Ungern became a Buddhist but did not leave the Lutheran faith. There is a widespread view that he was viewed by Mongols as the incarnation of the \\"God of War\\" (the figure of Jamsaran in Tibetan and Mongol folklore). Although many Mongols may have believed him to be a deity or at the very least a re-incarnation of Genghis Khan, Ungern was never officially proclaimed to be any of those incarnations. After graduating, he served as an officer in eastern Siberia in the 1st Argunsky and then in the 1st Amursky Cossack regiments, where he became enthralled with the lifestyle of nomadic peoples, such as the Mongols and Buryats. Ungern had specifically asked to be stationed with a Cossack regiment in Asia, as he wanted to learn more about Asian culture, a request that was granted. Ungern-Sternberg was notorious for his heavy drinking and exceptionally cantankerous moods. In one such brawl, his face was scarred when the officer that he fought struck him with his sword, leaving him with a distinctive facial scar. It has been claimed that the sword blow that caused the scar also caused brain damage that was the root of his insanity. However, a special study revealed that Ungern- Sternberg was not mentally insane although the wound affected his irritability. Those who knew him well described him as very drawn towards \\"Eastern culture\\", as he was fascinated by Asian cultures, especially that of the Mongols and the Buryats. At the same time, Ungern was an excellent horseman, who earned the respect of the Mongols and the Buryats because of his skill at riding and fighting from a horse and for being equally adept at using both a gun and his sword. In 1913, at his request, he transferred to the reserves. Ungern moved to Outer Mongolia to assist the Mongols in their struggle for independence from China, but Russian officials prevented him from fighting on the side of Mongolian troops. He arrived in the town of Khovd, in western Mongolia, and served as an out-of-staff officer in the Cossack guard detachment at the Russian consulate. First World War Ungern-Sternberg On 19 July 1914, Ungern joined frontline forces as part of the second-turn 34th Regiment of Cossack troops stationed on the Austro-Hungarian frontier in Galicia. He took part in the Russian offensive in East Prussia. From 1915 to 1916, he also participated in rear-action raids on German troops by the L.N. Punin Cavalry Special Task Force. Ungern served in the Nerchinsky Regiment. Throughout the war on the Eastern Front, he gained a reputation as an extremely brave but somewhat reckless and mentally unstable officer, with no fear of death and seemed most happy leading cavalry charges or being in the thick of combat. He was decorated with several military awards: orders of St. George of the 4th grade, St. Vladimir of the 4th grade, St. Anna of the 3rd and 4th grades and St. Stanislas of the 3rd grade. Despite his many awards, he was eventually discharged from one of his command positions for attacking another officer and a hall porter during a drunken rage in October 1916, which led to his being court-martialed and sentenced to two months in prison. General Pyotr Wrangel mentions Ungern's determination in his memoirs. After his release from prison in January 1917, Ungern was transferred to the Caucasian Theatre of the conflict, where Russia was fighting against the Ottoman Empire. The February Revolution that ended the rule of the House of Romanov was an extremely bitter blow to the monarchist Ungern-Sternberg, who saw the revolution as the beginning of the end of Russia. In the Caucasus, Ungern-Sternberg first met Cossack Captain Grigory Semyonov, who was later one of most well-known Russian anticommunist warlords in Siberia. In April 1917, near Urmia, Iran, Ungern, together with Semyonov, started to organise a volunteer military unit of local Assyrian Christians. The Ottoman government had waged the Assyrian Genocide in an attempt to exterminate the Assyrian minority, which led to thousands of Assyrians fleeing to the Russian lines. Ungern and Semyonov conceived of a scheme under which the two would organise and lead Assyrian troops to serve as an example for the Russian army, which was being demoralised by the revolutionary mood. Under his command, his Assyrians went on to score some minor victories over the Turks, but their total contribution to Russia's war effort was limited.Ataman Semenov. O sebe. Vospominaniya, Mysli i Vyvody. Moscow: AST Publ., 2002 Afterwards, the Assyrian scheme led Semyonov to the idea of placing Buryat troops in Siberia. The Kerensky government gave its approval to Semyonov's plans, and Ungern- Sternberg soon headed east to join his friend in trying to raise a Buryat regiment. Russian Civil War After the Bolshevik-led October Revolution in 1917, Semyonov and Ungern declared their allegiance to the Romanovs and vowed to fight the revolutionaries. In late 1917, Ungern, Semyonov and five Cossacks peacefully disarmed a group of about 1,500 pro-Red combatants on a railway station in Manchuria on the Far Eastern Railway (FER) in China, near the Russian border. For a time, the station in Manchuria was a stronghold of Semyonov and Ungern in their preparations for war in Transbaikal. They started to enrol troops in a Special Manchurian Regiment, which became a nucleus for anticommunist forces led by Semyonov. After the White troops defeated the Reds on a section of the FER line in Russia, Semyonov appointed Ungern commandant of troops stationed in Dauria, a railway station in a strategic position east- southeast of Lake Baikal. Semyonov and Ungern, though fervently anti- Bolshevik, were not typical of the figures to be found in the leadership of the White movement, as their plans differed from those of the main White leaders. Semyonov refused to recognize the authority of Admiral Alexander Kolchak, the nominal leader of the Whites in Siberia. Instead, he acted independently and was supported by the Japanese with arms and money. For White leaders like Kolchak and Denikin, who believed in a \\"Russia strong and indivisible\\", that represented high treason. Ungern was nominally subordinated to Semyonov but also often acted independently. Kolchak was a conservative but not a monarchist, and he promised that after the victory of the Whites he would reconvene the Constituent Assembly, disbanded by the Bolsheviks in January 1918, which would then decide the future of Russia, including the question of whether or not to restore the monarchy. Ungern, to the contrary, believed that monarchs were accountable only to God, and the monarchy was the political system that God had chosen for Russia and so it was self-evident that it should be restored to the way it had existed before the October Manifesto of 1905. For Ungern, the opinions of the people of Russia were irrelevant, as monarchs were not accountable to the people. Because of his successful military operations in Hailar and Dauria, Ungern received the rank of major-general. Semyonov entrusted him with forming military units to battle Bolshevik forces. They enrolled Buryats and Mongols in their national military units. In Dauria, Ungern formed the volunteer Asiatic Cavalry Division. Ungern reinforced his military station at Dauria, creating a kind of fortress from which his troops launched attacks on Red forces. Under his rule, Dauria became a well-known \\"torture centre\\" filled with the bones of dozens of Ungern's victims, who were executed because of accusations of being Reds or thieves (details in ). Ungern's chief executioner had been a Colonel Laurentz, but in Mongolia, Ungern had him executed because he lost Ungern's trust under unclear circumstances. Like many other White units, Ungern's troops used \\"requisitions\\" as a source of their supply. They examined trains passing through Dauria to Manchuria. The confiscations did not significantly diminish the supplies of Kolchak's forces, but private Russian and Chinese merchants lost considerable property. In 1919, taking advantage of the weakness of Russia's government caused by revolutions and civil war, the Chinese government, established by members of the Anhui military party, sent troops, led by General Xu Shuzheng, to join Outer Mongolia to China and end its autonomy, which violated the terms of a tripartite Russian-Mongolian-Chinese agreement concluded in 1915 that secured the autonomy of Outer Mongolia and did not allow the presence of Chinese troops except for small numbers of consular guards. Although the Anhui party was supported by Japan, indications of Japan-inspired Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia have not yet been confirmed by documents. After the fall of Anhui party rule in China, Chinese soldiers in Mongolia found themselves effectively abandoned. They rebelled against their commanders and plundered and killed Mongols and foreigners. Some of the Chinese troops during the occupation were Tsahar (Chahar) Mongols from Inner Mongolia, who had been a major cause of animosity between Outer Mongols (Khalkhas) and Inner Mongols. As part of his plans, Ungern travelled to Manchuria and China (February to September 1919), where he established contacts with monarchist circles and also made preparations for Semyonov to meet the Manchurian warlord Marshal Zhang Zuolin, the \\"Old Marshal\\". In July 1919, Ungern married the Manchurian princess Ji in an Orthodox ceremony in Harbin. The princess was given the name Elena Pavlovna. She and Ungern communicated in English, their only common language. The marriage had a political aim, as Ji was a princess and a relative of General Zhang Kuiwu, the commander of Chinese troops at the western end of the Chinese-Manchurian Railway and the governor of Hailar. Restoration of independence of Outer Mongolia deel uniform with Russian Order of St. George 4th Class After Kolchak's defeat at the hands of the Red Army and the subsequent decision of Japan to withdraw its expeditionary troops from the Transbaikal, Semyonov, unable to withstand the pressure of Bolshevik forces, planned a retreat to Manchuria. Ungern, however, saw it as an opportunity to implement his monarchist plan. On 7 August 1920, he broke his allegiance to Semyonov and transformed his Asiatic Cavalry Division into a guerrilla detachment. Ungern's troops started to move towards the border of Outer Mongolia, crossed the northern border of Outer Mongolia on 1 October 1920 and moved southwest. Having crossed the Mongolian border, Ungern moved westwards to the Mongolian capital of Urga (officially Niislel Khuree, now Ulaanbaatar). He entered negotiations with Chinese occupying forces. All of his demands, including the disarmament of the Chinese troops, were rejected. On 26‚Äì27 October and again on 2‚Äì4 November 1920, Ungern's troops assaulted Urga but suffered disastrous losses. After the defeat, his forces retreated to the upper currents of the Kherlen River, in Setsen-Khan Aimag, a district ruled by princes with the title Setsen Khan, in eastern Outer Mongolia. He was supported by Mongols who sought independence from Chinese occupation, especially the spiritual and secular leader of Mongols, the Bogd Khan, who secretly sent Ungern his blessing for expelling Chinese from Mongolia. The Chinese had tightened their control of Outer Mongolia by then by strictly regulating Buddhist services in monasteries and imprisoning Russians and Mongols whom they considered \\"separatists\\". According to the memoirs of M. G. Tornovsky, the Asiatic Division numbered 1,460 men, while the Chinese garrison was 7000 strong. The Chinese had the advantage in artillery and machine guns and had built a network of trenches in and around Urga. At his camp, Ungern imposed ferocious discipline on his Russian soldiers to prevent desertion and demoralisation. The Mongolor Building of Urga in which the Chinese made their last stand and Ungern made his headquarters Ungern's troops began moving from their camp to Urga on 31 January. On 2 February, they battled for control of Chinese front lines and secured parts of Urga. His detachment, led by B. P. Rezukhin, captured Chinese front-line fortifications near Small Madachan and Big Madachan settlements in the southeastern vicinities of Urga. During the battle Ungern's special detachment of Tibetans, Mongols, Buryats and Russians rescued the Bogd Khan from house arrest and transported him through the Bogd Uul to Manjushri Monastery. At the same time, another detachment moved to the mountains east of Urga. On 3 February, he gave his soldiers a respite. Borrowing a tactic from Genghis Khan, he ordered his troops to light a large number of campfires in the hills surrounding Urga and to use them as reference points for Rezukhin's detachment. That made the town appear to be surrounded by an overwhelming force. Early on 4 February, Ungern launched an assault on the Chinese White barracks from the east, captured them and divided his forces into two parts. The first launched a major assault on the remaining Chinese positions in the Chinese trade settlement (, Maimaicheng). The second moved westwards towards Consular Settlement. Upon reaching the Maimaicheng, Ungern had his men smash their way in by blasting the gates with explosives and improvised battering rams.Palmer, James The Bloody White Baron: The Extraordinary Story of the Russian Nobleman Who Became the Last Khan of Mongolia, New York: Basic Books, 2009, p. 154. After breaking in, a general slaughter set in, as both sides fought with sabres. After the capture of Maimacheng, Ungern joined his troops attacking Chinese troops at the Consular Settlement. After a Chinese counterattack, Ungern's soldiers retreated a short distance northeast and then launched another attack with the support of another Cossack and Mongolian detachment, which began an attack from the northeast and northwest. Ungern's troops gradually moved westwards in Urga, pursuing retreating Chinese soldiers. The capital city was finally taken on the evening of 4 February. Chinese civilian administrators and military commanders abandoned their soldiers and fled northwards from Urga on 11 cars in the night of 3‚Äì4 February. Chinese troops fled northward on 4 and 5 February. They massacred any Mongolian civilians they encountered along the road from Urga to the Russian border. Russian settlers who supported the Reds moved from Urga, together with the fleeing Chinese troops. During the capture of Urga, the Chinese lost about 1500 men, and Ungern's forces suffered about 60 casualties. After the battle, Ungern's troops began plundering Chinese stores and killing Russian Jews who were living in Urga, as the Cossacks had also been set against the Jews. Ungern himself ordered the Jews to be killed except for those who had notes from him sparing their lives. It has been estimated by surviving archival documents and memoirs that 43‚Äì50 Jews were killed during Ungern's stay in Mongolia, about 5%‚Äì6% of all those executed under his orders. Several days later, the looting by his troops was stopped by Ungern, but his secret police bureau, led by Colonel Leonid Sipailo, continued searching for \\"Reds\\". Between 11 and 13 March, Ungern captured a fortified Chinese base at Choir, between the Otsol Uul and Choiryn Bogd Uul Mountains, south of Urga. Ungern had 900 troops and the Chinese defenders about 1500. After capturing Choir, Ungern returned to Urga. His detachments, consisting of Cossacks and Mongols, moved southward to Zamyn-√ú√ºd, a frontier settlement and another Chinese base. The defending Chinese soldiers abandoned Zamyn-√ú√ºd without a fight. When the remaining Chinese troops, having retreated to northern Mongolia near Kyakhta, attempted to go around Urga to the west to reach China, the Russians and the Mongols feared that they were attempting to recapture Urga. Several hundred Cossack and Mongol troops were dispatched to stop the Chinese forces, which numbered several thousand, in the area of Talyn Ulaankhad Hill near the Urga‚ÄìUliastai road in central Mongolia. After a battle that raged from 30 March to 2 April in which more than 1000 Chinese and approximately 100 Mongols, Russians and Buryats were killed, the Chinese were routed and chased to the southern border of the country. Thus Chinese forces left Outer Mongolia. Kuzmin, S. L., Oyuunchimeg, J. and Bayar, B.

On 22 February, a solemn ceremony took place to restore the Bogd Khan to the throne. As a reward for ousting the Chinese from Urga, the Bogd Khan granted Ungern the high hereditary title darkhan khoshoi chin wang in the degree of khan, and other privileges. Other officers, lamas and princes who had participated in these events also received high titles and awards. For seizing Urga, Ungern received from Semyonov the rank of lieutenant-general. On 22 February 1921, Mongolia was proclaimed an independent monarchy. Supreme power over Mongolia belonged to the Bogd Khan, or the 8th Bogd Gegen Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. According to some eyewitnesses (such as his engineer and officer Kamil Gi≈ºycki, and Polish adventurer and writer Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski), Ungern was the first to institute order in Urga by imposing street cleaning and sanitation, promoting religious life and tolerance in the capital and attempting to reform the economy. Ossendowski, one of the most popular Polish writers in his lifetime (at the time of his death in 1945, his overseas sales were the second-highest of all the writers of Poland), had served as an official in Kolchak's government and, after its collapse, fled to Mongolia. He became one of Ungern's very few friends, and in 1922, published a best-selling book in English, Men, Beasts and Gods, about his adventures in Siberia and Mongolia, which remains the book by which the Ungern story is best known in the English-speaking world. Comparison of Ossendowski's diary with his book and documents on Mongolia revealed that his reports on Mongolia at Ungern are largely true, except for a few stories. Ossendowski was the first to describe Ungern's views in terms of Theosophy, but Ungern himself had never been a Theosophist. Kuzmin, S. L. and Rejt, L. J. Notes by F. A. Ossendowski as a source on the history of Mongolia in Vostok (Oriens) (Moscow), 2008. no 5, pp. 97‚Äì110 Ungern did not interfere in Mongolian affairs and assisted Mongols only in some issues according to orders of the Bogd Khan. Russian colonists, on the other hand, suffered cruelties from Ungern's secret police bureau led by Leonid Sipailo. Many innocent people were tortured and killed by Sipailo and his subordinates. A list of people known to have been killed on Ungern's orders or by others on their pretext, both in Russia and Mongolia, confirms the deaths of 846 people, approximately 100‚Äì120 from Urga, which was about 3%‚Äì8% of the total foreign colony population. Some eyewitnesses considered his Asiatic Cavalry Division as a base for a future Mongolian national army. The division consisted of national detachments, such as the Chinese regiment, Japanese unit, various Cossack regiments, Mongol, Buryat, Tatar and other peoples' units. Ungern said that 16 nationalities served in his division. Dozens of Tibetans also served as part of his troops. They might have been sent by 13th Dalai Lama, with whom Ungern communicated, or the Tibetans may have belonged to the Tibetan colony in Urga. The presence of the Japanese unit in the division is often explained as evidence that Japan stood behind Ungern in his actions in Mongolia. Studies of their interrogations from Japanese archive revealed that they were mercenaries serving on their own, like other nationals in the division, and that Ungern was not managed by Japan. Kuzmin S.L., Batsaikhan, O., Nunami, K. and Tachibana, M. 2009. Baron Ungern and Japan , in Vostok (Oriens) (Moscow), no 5, pp. 115‚Äì133 Defeat, capture and execution Ungern-Sternberg in 1921. The Bolsheviks started infiltrating Mongolia shortly after the October Revolution, long before they took control of the Russian Transbaikal. In 1921, various Red Army units belonging to Soviet Russia and to the Far Eastern Republic invaded the newly independent Mongolia to defeat Ungern. The forces included the Red Mongolian leader Damdin S√ºkhbaatar. Spies and various smaller diversionary units went ahead to spread terror to weaken Ungern's forces. Ungern organised an expedition to meet these forces in Siberia and to support ongoing anti-Bolshevik rebellions. Believing that he had the unwavering popular support of locals in Siberia and Mongolia, Ungern failed to strengthen his troops properly although he was vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the Red forces. However, he did not know that the Reds had successfully crushed uprisings in Siberia and that Soviet economic policies had temporarily softened in Lenin's New Economic Policy. Upon Ungern's arrival in Siberia, few local peasants and Cossacks volunteered to join him. In the spring, the Asiatic Cavalry Division was divided into two brigades: one under the command of Lieutenant General Ungern and the second under Major General Rezukhin. In May, Rezukhin's brigade launched a raid beyond the Russian border, west of the Selenga River. Ungern's brigade left Urga and slowly moved to the Russian town of Troitskosavsk (present-day Kyakhta in Buryatia). Meanwhile, the Reds moved large numbers of troops towards Mongolia from different directions. They had a tremendous advantage in equipment (armoured cars, aeroplanes, rail, gunboats, ammunition, human reserves etc.) and the number of troops. As a result, Ungern was defeated in battles that took place between 11 and 13 June, and he failed to capture Troitskosavsk. Combined Bolshevik and Red Mongol forces entered Urga on 6 July 1921 after a few small skirmishes with Ungern's guard detachments. Ungern- Sternberg before execution Although they had captured Urga, the Red forces failed to defeat the main forces of the Asiatic Division (Ungern's and Rezukhin's brigades). Ungern regrouped and attempted to invade Transbaikal, across the Russo-Mongolian border. To rally his soldiers and local people, he quoted an agreement with Semyonov and pointed to a supposed Japanese offensive that was to support their drive, but neither Semyonov nor the Japanese were eager to assist him. After several days of rest, the Asiatic Division started its raid into Soviet territory on 18 July. The eyewitnesses Kamil Gi≈ºycki and Mikhail Tornovsky gave similar estimates of their numbers: about 3000 men in total. Ungern's troops penetrated deep into Russian territory. The Soviets declared martial law in areas that the Whites were expected, including Verkhneudinsk (now Ulan-Ude, the capital of Buryatia). Ungern's troops captured many settlements, the northernmost being Novoselenginsk, which they occupied on 1 August. By then, Ungern had understood that his offensive was ill-prepared, and he had heard about the approach of large Red forces. On 2 August 1921, he began his retreat to Mongolia, where he declared his determination to fight communism. While Ungern's troops wanted to abandon the war effort, head towards Manchuria and join with other Russian √©migr√©s, it soon became clear that Ungern had other ideas. He wanted to retreat to Tuva and then to Tibet. Troops under both Ungern and Rezukhin effectively mutinied and hatched plots to kill their respective commanders. On 17 August, Rezukhin was murdered. A day later, conspirators attempted to assassinate Ungern. His command then collapsed as his brigade broke apart. On 20 August, Ungern was captured by a Soviet detachment, led by guerrilla commander Petr Efimovich Shchetinkin, who was later a member of the Cheka. After a show trial of 6 hours and 15 minutes on 15 September 1921, prosecuted by Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, Ungern was sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentence was carried out that night in Novonikolaevsk (now Novosibirsk). > When the news on the Baron's execution reached the Living Buddha [the Bogd > Khan], he ordered services to be held in temples throughout Mongolia.

In 1769 he was appointed professor of medicine at the School of Public Health of Strasbourg, then, in 1778, professor of philosophy, before going on, in 1784, to succeed Jacob Reinbold Spielmann as chair of chemistry, natural history and materia medica. In 1794 he became professor of botany and materia medica in the new School of Medicine. He was the author of Tabula affinitatum animalium (1783) and Observationes zoologicae quibus novae complures, published posthumously in 1804. His collections and library of 18,000 volumes formed the basis of the Natural History Museum of Strasbourg, where a reconstruction of his natural history cabinet was opened in 1988 . Hermann was also in charge of Strasbourg's botanical garden, where he was responsible for a large increase in the number of living plant species. The garden was threatened with closure by the city administration during the French Revolution, and was only saved by the efforts of Hermann. His zoological collection, including 200 mammals, 900 birds, more than 200 reptiles, many fish, invertebrates and dried plants, was bought by the city of Strasbourg in 1804 and served as the base for the Strasbourg zoological Museum. His brother, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Hermann (1743‚Äì1820), Professor of Law, was a member of the Lower Rhine and Mayor of Strasbourg. His son, Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Hermann (1768‚Äì1793), would follow in his footsteps both in medicine and in natural history, until his untimely death during the revolutionary wars put an end to his ambitions.

He studied in Stuttgart, Strasbourg, and Paris, and in 1802 was asked by Cuvier (a distant cousin) to help edit his masterpiece on comparative anatomy. From notes and counsel from Cuvier, Duvernoy prepared the last three volumes of Le√ßons d'anatomie compar√©e, writings that involved respiration, circulation, digestive organs, et al. In 1805 he returned to Montb√©liard, where he worked as a practitioner of medicine. In 1827 he was elected professor to the Faculty of Sciences at Strasbourg, and during the next ten years published a number of treatises on anatomical subjects. After the death of Cuvier in 1832, he worked at arranging his papers for publication. In 1837 he became a professor of natural history at the Coll√®ge de France.

A trade and commercial centre, it is Botswana's largest village. Serowe has played an important role in Botswana's history, as capital for the Bamangwato people in the early 20th century and as birthplace of several of Botswana's presidents. More recently it has undergone significant development as the town and Botswana continue to grow. History Serowe has a memorial to Khama III, chief of the Bamangwato people in the late 19th-early 20th century, who in 1903 founded the town as a new capital of the Bamangwato. It is also the birthplace of Seretse Khama, Botswana's first president, and the traditional center of the Bamangwato tribe. Swaneng Hill School was the first of the Brigades Movement schools founded by educationalist Patrick van Rensburg. Geography View from Swaneng Hill east across the Kalahari Serowe is located in a fertile area, well-watered by the Lotsane River. It lies west of the Gaborone‚ÄìFrancistown road, from which it is easily reached. It also marks the beginning of the Serowe-Orapa road, which ends at the diamond mines in Orapa. Construction of this road began in 1986 and was completed several years later. There are two hills at Swaneng, called Rra-Swaneng and Mma- Swaneng ‚Äì Father- and Mother-Swaneng ‚Äì respectively. Notable features of the local area include a Botswana Defence Force (BDF) base on the road to Paje and the Khama Rhino Sanctuary. The Rhino Sanctuary is a charitable game reserve, 25 km north of Serowe, established in 1992 by the local Ballentine and Watson families and Ian Khama (the former President). Its 4,300 hectares of Kalahari sandveld were established as a haven for black and white rhinoceroses. Government Serowe currently serves as capital of the Central District. The first president Sir Seretse Khama (father of the fourth President President Lieutenant General Ian Khama) and the third president Festus Mogae of Botswana were born in Serowe. The Botswana Prison Service (BPS) operates the Serowe New Prison.\\"Prisons and Rehabilitation.\\" (Archive) Government of Botswana. Retrieved on 26 March 2013. Infrastructure Since 2000, Serowe has undergone numerous developments and continues to expand at a steady rate, despite exponential growth from neighbouring Palapye. The Swaneng Senior Secondary School, fondly referred to as Swaneng Hill, has been upgraded by the Botswana government through contract with a Chinese construction company. It now has relatively modern chemistry, physics and biology laboratories, although they lack equipment for in-depth experiments. As a result, student interest in the sciences has grown, with a number of students going overseas to continue their studies. The school's history department regularly takes students on field trips to ancient sites around the country. Debating is highly encouraged, and has led to a number of national championship titles. A major recent upgrade involved the construction of the new state-of-the-art Sekgoma Hospital, which is located 6 km to the south of the main town, replacing the old and derelict hospital of the same name. It now operates as the main medical centre in the district. The hospital was constructed at an estimated cost of P300 million and was opened to the public in late 2007, reducing a heavy burden at the Francistown Hospital, which was subject to overcrowding and unhygienic conditions. Another major recent development is the Serowe Stadium and surrounding sports complex. This project, which cost the Botswana government P30 million, was opened in mid-2003. It currently provides the Central District with its only major sports facility. The town used to be served by Serowe Airport. The airport location was used to build the now completed Sekgoma Memorial Hospital and the adjacent Nursing Institute. Literature Serowe was the adopted hometown of South African- born writer Bessie Head, inspiring her 1974 book Serowe: Village of the Rain Wind. Her importance to the village is remembered in the Bessie Head Room of the Khama III Memorial Museum, established in 2007. People The actor Marang Molosiwa comes from this area.

Private life Sinanoƒülu was born in Bari, Italy on February 25, 1935 to N√ºzhet Ha≈üim and R√ºveyde (Karacabey) Sinanoƒülu. His father was a consular official under the Consul General Atƒ±f Kor in the Bari Consulate of Turkey, and a writer. He wrote a book on Greek and Roman Mythology, and another one titled \\"Petrarca\\", published in 1931, stating in its preface: \\"The best way (for Turkey) is adopting the Western culture.\\" Following his father's recall to Turkey in July 1938, the family returned to Turkey before the start of World War II. He had a sister, Esin Af≈üar (1936-2011), who became a well-known singer and actress. Sinanoƒülu graduated from TED Ankara Koleji in 1951. He went to the United States in 1953, where he studied in University of California, Berkeley graduating with a BSc degree with highest honors in 1956. The following year, he completed his MSc at MIT (1957), and was awarded Sloan Research Fellowship. He completed his predoctoral fellowship (1958-1959) and earned his PhD in physical chemistry (1959-1960) from the University of California, Berkeley. On December 21, 1963, Oktay Sinanoƒülu married to Paula Armbruster, who was doing graduate work at Yale University. The wedding ceremony took place in the Branford College Chapel of Yale. He remarried to Dilek Sinanoƒülu and from this marriage he became father of twins. The family resided in the Emerald Lakes neighborhood of Fort Lauderdale, Texas and in Istanbul, Turkey.  Academic career  In 1960, Sinanoƒülu joined the Yale faculty. He was appointed full professor of chemistry on July 1, 1963. At age 28, he became the youngest full professor in Yale‚Äôs 20th-century history. It is believed that he was the third-youngest full professor in the 300-plus year history of Yale University. In 1964, he founded the theoretical chemistry division at Yale. During his tenure at Yale, he developed the \\"Many Electron Theory of Atoms and Molecules\\" (1961), \\"Solvophobic Theory\\" (1964), \\"Network Theory of Coupled Chemical Reactions\\" (1974), \\"Microthermodynamic surface tension\\"(1981), and \\"Valency Interaction Formula Theory\\" (1983). He developed a revolutionary method called \\"Sinanoƒülu Made Simple\\" from his own mathematical theories and published in 1988. With the help of this research system, and using simple pictures, chemists could predict the ways in which complex chemical reactions would proceed, and solve complex problems in quantum chemistry. After 37 years on the Yale faculty, Sinanoƒülu retired in 1997. During his time at Yale, Sinanoƒülu served as a frequent consultant to several Turkish universities and to the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (T√úBƒ∞TAK) as well as to the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). In 1962, the Board of Trustees of Middle East Technical University in Ankara dignified him with the title \\"consulting professor\\", for the first time and unique only for him. He received the \\"T√úBƒ∞TAK Science Award\\" for chemistry in 1966, the \\"Alexander von Humboldt Research Award\\" in chemistry in 1973, and the \\"International Outstanding Scientist Award of Japan\\" in 1975. Sinanoƒülu was also a two-time nominee for Nobel Prize in Chemistry. After his retirement from Yale, Sinanoƒülu was appointed to the chemistry department of Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University in Istanbul, serving until 2002. Sinanoƒülu was author or co-author of many scientific books and articles. He also authored books on contemporary affairs in Turkey, and Turkish language such as \\"Target Turkey\\" and \\"Bye Bye Turkish\\" (2005). In \\"Bye Bye Turkish\\", he propounded the idea of cognation between Turkish and Japanese based on the alleged similarity of a number of words. A 2001-published best-seller book about his life and works, edited by Turkish writer Emine √áaykara, titled him The Turkish Einstein, Oktay Sinanoglu (). Death His wife Dilek Sinanoƒülu made public on April 10, 2015 that Oktay Sinanoƒülu was hospitalized in Miami, Florida, and was taken into intensive care unit in coma. According to the posting, it was assumed that nutrition reached his lungs from feeding tube during his stay in a nursing home. He died at age 80 on April 19, 2015. No medical statement was released about the cause of the death. He is survived by his first wife, Paula Armbruster, son Karacabey Levni Sinanoƒülu, daughter Elif Sinanoƒülu Armbruster, son Murat Armbruster, His wife Dilek Sinanoƒülu, twins Oya and Alper Sinanoƒülu, grandson Ayuka Wilhelm Sinanoƒülu and granddaughter Mary Elizabeth Cochrane. His body was transferred to Turkey. A memorial service was held at Caddebostan Cultural Center in Kadƒ±k√∂y, Istanbul on April 26 attended by his wife Dilek Sinanoƒülu, twin children Oya and Alper Sinanoƒülu as well as his son from the first marriage, Karacabey Levni Sinanoƒülu.

The minimum reserve is generally determined by the central bank to be no less than a specified percentage of the amount of deposit liabilities the commercial bank owes to its customers. The commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash owned by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the commercial bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank. The required reserve ratio is sometimes used as a tool in monetary policy, influencing the country's borrowing and interest rates by changing the amount of funds available for banks to make loans with. Western central banks rarely increase the reserve requirements because it would cause immediate liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. The People's Bank of China uses changes in reserve requirements as an inflation-fighting tool, and raised the reserve requirement ten times in 2007 and eleven times since the beginning of 2010. An institution that holds reserves in excess of the required amount is said to hold excess reserves. Effects on money supply =Conventional view= The theory that a reserve requirement can be used as a tool of monetary policy is frequently found in economics textbooks. Under the theory, the higher the reserve requirement is set, the less funds banks will have available to lend out, leading to lower money creation and perhaps to higher purchasing power of the money previously in use. Under this view, the effect is multiplied, because money obtained as loan proceeds can be re- deposited, and a portion of those deposits may again be lent out, and so on. Under this theory, the effect on the money supply is governed by the following formulas: :M_1=\\\\mathit{MB} \\\\times m \\\\, : definitional relationship between monetary base MB (bank reserves plus currency held by the non-bank public) and the narrowly defined money supply, M_1, :m=\\\\frac{(1+c)}{(c+R)} = \\\\frac{1+\\\\frac{C}{D}}{\\\\frac{C}{D}+R} : derived formula for the money multiplier m, the factor by which lending and re-lending leads M_1 to be a multiple of the monetary base: where notationally, :c = the currency ratio: the ratio of the public's holdings of currency (undeposited cash) to the public's holdings of demand deposits; and :R = the total reserve ratio (the ratio of legally required plus non-required reserve holdings of banks to demand deposit liabilities of banks). However, in the United States (and other countries except Brazil, China, India, Russia), the reserve requirements are generally not frequently altered to implement monetary policy because of the short-term disruptive effect on financial markets. =Endogenous money view= Most economists dispute the conventional theory of the reserve requirement. Criticisms of the conventional theory are usually associated with theories of endogenous money. Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof of the IMF Research Department report that the \\"deposit multiplier\\" of the undergraduate economics textbook, where monetary aggregates are created at the initiative of the central bank, through an initial injection of high-powered money into the banking system that gets multiplied through bank lending, turns the actual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism on its head. Benes and Kumhof assert that in most cases where banks ask for replenishment of depleted reserves, the central bank obliges. Under this view, reserves therefore impose no constraints, as the deposit multiplier is simply, in the words of Kydland and Prescott (1990), a myth. Under this theory, private banks almost fully control the money creation process. Required reserves =United States= In the United States, a reserve requirementSee generally Regulation D, at 12 C.F.R. sec. 204.4 and sec. 204.5 (or liquidity ratio) is a minimum value, set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of the ratio of required reserves to a category of deposit liabilities (called the \\"Net Transaction Accounts\\" or \\"NTAs\\") owed by depository institutions to their customers (e.g., owed by commercial banks including U.S. branches of a foreign bank, savings and loan association, savings bank, credit union). The deposit liability categories currently subject to reserve requirements are mainly checking accounts. There is no reserve requirement on savings accounts and time deposit accounts owned by individuals. The total amount of all NTAs held by customers with U.S. depository institutions, plus the U.S. paper currency and coin currency held by the nonbank public, is called M1. As of March 2020, the minimum reserve requirement for all deposit institutions was abolished, or more technically, fixed to zero percent of eligible deposits. The Board previously mandated a zero reserve requirement for banks with eligible deposits up to $16 million, 3% for banks up to $122.3 million, and 10% thereafter. The removal of reserve requirements followed the Federal Reserve's shift to an \\"ample-reserves\\" system, in which the Federal Reserve Banks pay member banks interest on reserves that they keep in excess of the required amount.The Fed Fires ‚ÄòThe Big One‚Äô The International Banking Act of 1978 required branches of foreign banks operating in the United States to follow the same required reserve ratio standards. =Countries and districts without reserve requirements= Canada, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Hong Kong have no reserve requirements. This does not mean that banks can‚Äîeven in theory‚Äîcreate money without limit. On the contrary, banks are constrained by capital requirements, which are arguably more important than reserve requirements even in countries that have reserve requirements. It also does not mean that a commercial bank's overnight reserves can become negative, in these countries. The central bank will always step in to lend the necessary reserves if necessary so that this does not happen; this is sometimes described as \\"defending the payment system\\". Historically a central bank might once have run out of reserves to lend and so have had to suspend redemptions, but this can no longer happen to modern central banks because of the end of the gold standard worldwide, which means that all nations use a fiat currency. A zero reserve requirement cannot be explained by a theory that holds that monetary policy works by varying the quantity of money using the reserve requirement. Even in the United States, which retained formal reserve requirements until 2020, the notion of controlling the money supply by targeting the quantity of base money fell out of favor many years ago, and now the pragmatic explanation of monetary policy refers to targeting the interest rate to control the broad money supply. (See also Regulation D (FRB).) United Kingdom In the UK the term clearing banks is sometimes used, meaning banks that have direct access to the clearing system. However, for the purposes of clarity, the term commercial banks will be used for the remainder of this section. The Bank of England, which is the central bank for the entire United Kingdom, previously held to a voluntary reserve ratio system, with no minimum reserve requirement set. In theory this meant that commercial banks could retain zero reserves. The average cash reserve ratio across the entire United Kingdom banking system, though, was higher during that period, at about 0.15% . From 1971 to 1980, the commercial banks all agreed to a reserve ratio of 1.5%. In 1981 this requirement was abolished. From 1981 to 2009, each commercial bank set out its own monthly voluntary reserve target in a contract with the Bank of England. Both shortfalls and excesses of reserves relative to the commercial bank's own target over an averaging period of one day would result in a charge, incentivising the commercial bank to stay near its target, a system known as reserves averaging. Upon the parallel introduction of quantitative easing and interest on excess reserves in 2009, banks were no longer required to set out a target, and so were no longer penalised for holding excess reserves; indeed, they were proportionally compensated for holding all their reserves at the Bank Rate (the Bank of England now uses the same interest rate for its bank rate, its deposit rate and its interest rate target). In the absence of an agreed target, the concept of excess reserves does not really apply to the Bank of England any longer, so it is technically incorrect to call its new policy \\"interest on excess reserves\\".

It is Located in Riga, Latvia it was previously known as Riga Polytechnical Institute and Riga Polytechnicum. History =Riga Polytechnical Institute (1862‚Äì1918)= Riga Polytechnicum was first established in 1862 and was the first polytechnical institute in Imperial Russia. It offered degrees in agriculture, chemistry, engineering, mechanics, trade and architecture, with education in German. In addition to four technical faculties (architecture, engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry), the polytechnic also included an agricultural and a commercial faculty. The first lecturers came from Germany, Switzerland and Austria- Hungary. The language of instruction was German. Between 1863 and 1869, the number of students grew from sixteen to ninety. In 1869 the polytechnic moved into a new building. Since there was a lack of technical universities in Russia, many students - especially from the Baltic Sea governments - had gone to study at ETH Zurich, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, TU Dresden and Leibniz University Hannover. That should be changed. On January 1, 1874, Alexander II of Russia introduced general conscription. Now all men from the age of 21 had to serve fifteen years, six in Imperial Russian Army and nine in the reserve. For graduates of the Russian university who wanted to study, the period of service was only six months. This difference led to a significant increase in student numbers. At the beginning of the academic year 1874/75, 59 students enrolled, the total student body comprised 201 members. In the course of Russification, Nicholas II of Russia nationalized the university by decree of May 6, 1896. From 1896 to 1918 it was called the Riga Polytechnic Institute (Rƒ´gas Politehniskais instit≈´ts - RPI). The number of students continued to increase, reaching 2088 students in 1913/14. In 1918/19 the Polytechnic was called the Baltic Technical University (Baltijas TehniskƒÅ augstskola). In 1896, it was renamed Riga Polytechnical Institute and the language of instruction was changed to Russian. The establishment of a faculty of architecture at the Polytechnicum in 1869 was instrumental in providing Riga with a group of locally trained architects, with consequences for the development of the characteristic Art Nouveau architecture in Riga. When World War I started in 1914, the Riga Polytechnical Institute was evacuated to Moscow and worked there until 1918. After that, part of the faculty returned to Latvia and joined the newly established University of Latvia. In 1919, the university was incorporated as a technical faculty of the Latvian University of Applied Sciences (Latvijas Augstskola, since 1923: University of Latvia), which was founded after independence. On September 1, 1958, their technical faculties were spun off again and raised to an independent university. From 1958 to 1983 it was called the Riga Polytechnic Institute, and then renamed the Arvƒ´ds Pel≈°e Institute of Technology in Riga (Arvƒ´da Pel≈°es vƒÅrdƒÅ nosauktais Rƒ´gas politehniskais instit≈´ts). In the mid-1970s, the university became the largest university in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic. It has been called the Riga Technical University since March 1990. On April 23, 1992, a student parliament was founded. It is the oldest student self-government in Latvia.  Riga Technical University, 1958‚Äìpresent  Riga Polytechnical Institute was re-established in 1958 by splitting off the engineering departments from the State University of Latvia. In 1990, it was renamed to Riga Technical University.

Riga Business School  The Riga Business School is a management‚Äìeducation institution within Riga Technical University. It was founded in 1991, in close cooperation with the State University of New York at Buffalo (USA) and the University of Ottawa (Canada), and it was the first higher education institution in the Baltic states that offered Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs in English. The school currently has more than 800 MBA graduates, mostly middle- and upper-level level managers both in Latvia and abroad. The education standards and structure are adopted from the North-American style MBA, which contains case studies, working in groups, and active participation in classrooms.

He was the son of Johann Strauss I and Maria Anna Streim. The family dominated the Viennese light music world for decades, creating many waltzes and polkas for many Austrian nobility as well as dance-music enthusiasts around Europe. He was affectionately known in his family as 'Edi'. Life and music ‚ÄúEdi‚Äù Strauss, silhouette by Otto B√∂hler Eduard Strauss' style was individual and did not attempt to emulate the works of his other brothers or his contemporaries. But he was primarily remembered and recognized as a dance music conductor rather than as a major composer in the , and his popularity was overshadowed by that of his elder brothers. Realising this, he stamped his own mark with the quick polka, known in German as the \\"polka-schnell\\". Among the more popular polkas that he penned for the Strauss Orchestra, which he continued to conduct until its disbandment on 13 February 1901, were \\"\\", Op. 45, \\"Ausser Rand und Band\\", Op. 168, and \\"Ohne Bremse\\", Op. 238. He also found time to pen a few lovely waltzes, of which only a handful survived obscurity. The most famous is probably \\"Doctrinen\\", Op.79. Strauss's musical career was pervaded with rivalry, not only from his brothers, but also from the military bandmaster and dance music composer Karl Michael Ziehrer, who even formed a rival orchestra called \\"Formerly Eduard Strauss Orchestra\\", and began giving concerts in Vienna under this new title. Eduard Strauss successfully filed a court action against Ziehrer for the improper and misleading use of his name, but Ziehrer would eventually surpass the Strauss family in popularity in Vienna, particularly after the deaths of his more talented brothers, Johann Strauss II and Josef Strauss. Their rivalry was to extend until the Strauss Orchestra was disbanded. Strauss married Maria Klenkhart on 8 January 1863 and had two sons, Johann Strauss III and Josef Eduard Strauss. The elder son, Johann Strauss III, was to lead the Strauss revival well into the 20th century. Josef Eduard's son, Eduard Strauss II, was active as conductor. However, personal setbacks in the 1890s, such as the death of brother Johann Strauss II in 1899, and his realization that his immediate family had squandered his personal fortune, led Eduard Strauss to decide on retirement. Eduard Strauss engaged in the final tour of his musical career to North America in 1899 and in 1901, disbanded the Strauss Orchestra, and returned to Vienna, where he died in 1916. He retired from public life and never actively took part in any public musical activity, although he did document his family memoirs titled Erinnerungen in 1906. He is buried in Zentralfriedhof (Vienna) cemetery. Since 1825, the Strauss Orchestra Archives collected the compositions of not only Eduard, but of Johann II and the rest of the Strauss family. In 1907, Eduard instructed that the archives be burned. Eighty years later, conductors Alfred Walker and Klaus Heymann managed to put together a semi-complete collection of Johann's works (according to Johann Strauss II: The Complete Orchestral Edition).

For instance, Old Norse poets might use j√≥r \\"steed\\" instead of the prosaic hestr \\"horse\\". Kennings In the modern sense, heiti are distinguished from kennings in that a heiti is a simple word, whereas a kenning is a circumlocution in the form of a phrase or compound word; thus m√¶kir is a heiti for \\"sword\\" (the usual word in prose is sver√∞), whereas grand hl√≠far \\"bane of shield\\" and ben-f√∫rr \\"wound-fire\\" are kennings for \\"sword\\". However, Snorri Sturluson, writing in the 13th century, understood heiti in a broader sense that could include kennings. Snorri termed simple words, poetic or otherwise, √≥kend heiti \\"unqualified terms\\". These he distinguished from circumlocutions, kend heiti \\"qualified terms\\" (i.e. kennings).Faulkes (1998 a), p. xxxiv. Types Some heiti are words not normally found outside verse, e.g. f√≠rar, one of numerous synonyms for menn \\"men, people\\". Others are common enough in prose but used by the poets in some specialised sense, such as salt \\"salt\\" to mean sj√°r \\"sea\\". Heiti had a variety of origins. Some were archaic words: j√≥r \\"steed\\", some loanwords: sinj√≥r \\"lord\\" (from Latin senior, probably via Old French seignor). Several kinds of synecdoche and metonymy were employed: bar√∞ \\"part of the prow of a ship\\" for \\"ship\\" as a whole; gotnar \\"Goths\\" for \\"men\\" or \\"people\\" in general; targa \\"targe\\" (a type of shield) for \\"shield\\" in general; st√°l \\"steel\\" for \\"weapons, warfare\\". A few heiti were metaphorical: hr√≠√∞ \\"storm\\" for \\"attack, (onset of) battle\\". Some were originally proper names: Hrotti, Laufi, Mistilteinn and Tyrfingr were all swords owned by legendary heroes. There were also heiti for specific individuals, especially gods (e.g. Gr√≠mnir, Fj√∂lnir, Vi√∞rir and many more for Odin). There were a great many heiti for certain concepts which the poets often dealt with, such as \\"man\\", \\"woman\\", \\"leader\\", and terms for weapons. Names of s√¶konungar \\"sea-kings\\" (legendary pirate leaders) constitute another large category. From these were formed kennings for \\"sea\\" and \\"ship\\", e.g. Rakna bifgrund \\"Rakni's shaking ground\\" = \\"the sea\\"; √ûvinnils d√Ωr \\"Thvinnil's beast\\" = \\"ship\\". Parallels Analogous, and in some cases cognate terms, are found in the poetic traditions of other early Germanic languages, e.g. Old English guma, secg: Old Norse gumi, seggr \\"man\\"; Old English heoru, mƒìce: Old Norse hj«´rr, m√¶kir \\"sword\\". Many other languages, ancient and modern, have possessed a specialised poetic vocabulary more or less removed from everyday speech, often derived in similar ways to Old Norse heiti.

It was once the largest manufacturer of holiday lighting in the world, but since 1967 has existed only as a licensed trademark, which is now held by Inliten, LLC, of Glenview, Illinois. NOMA was formed in 1925 as the National Outfit Manufacturer's Association, a trade group made up of 13 to 15 smaller manufacturers hoping to gain competitive advantage by combining their manufacturing, marketing, distribution, and purchasing power. In 1926, the association‚Äôs members officially incorporated as the NOMA Electric Corporation and began selling NOMA-branded light sets by 1927. NOMA introduced a number of innovations to holiday lighting, including: * the use of E17 intermediate base lamps for outdoor decorating (1928), * successful parallel-wired light sets for indoor use (1934), * all-rubber cords (1940), * Bubble Lites (1946), and * fused safety plugs (1951). When the NOMA Electric Company was located in New York City, it may have produced the first commercial printed circuit board in 1946 with its Party Quiz Game. It was an electrical board game with replaceable question cards and two electrodes which, when placed in the proper positions to answer a question correctly, cause a bulb to light. Initially hard-wired, the game was made thinner by hot pressing aluminum foil onto cardboard, with the electrical contacts made into the board.Original internal documentation of inventor Seymour Golub and NOMA catalog In 1953, NOMA incorporated its Christmas light manufacturing operations into NOMA Lites, Inc. and enjoyed considerable success. But by the early 1960s, the company faced increasing competition from cheaper, imported light sets, and it filed for bankruptcy in 1965. There is a company in the UK called NOMA Lights, founded in 1939 making it the oldest supplier of holiday lights in the world, by Fred Capel and now in the hands of his son, Clive Capel. There was a NOMA Corporation in Canada. In February 2007, Electrical Components International (ECI) purchased GenTek‚Äôs wire and cable assembly business known as NOMA Corporation.

Homie, as it stands now, was a one-time effort. Homie has released just one song, \\"American Girls\\", for the soundtrack of the 1998 film Meet the Deedles. For this recording, Cuomo was joined by Greg Brown (member of Cake and Deathray), Matt Sharp (formerly of Weezer, lead singer of The Rentals), Adam Orth of Shufflepuck and Yuval Gabay of Soul Coughing and Sulfur.Luerssen D., John. Rivers' Edge: The Weezer Story. ECW Press, 2004, p. 251 Weezer fans sometimes erroneously apply the Homie moniker to a very different Cuomo-led group of Boston-area musicians that played several shows while Rivers took time off from Harvard. This group was not Homie, but were played under the guise of Rivers Cuomo solo shows and the material played at these shows were songs Rivers had written for the third Weezer album at the time. This Band included members of other local bands such as Chevy Heston, Heretix, and The Shods. This band is often referred to by fans as \\"The Rivers Cuomo Band\\", although this was never a name used by the band. The \\"Rivers Cuomo Band\\" formed in 1997 and began playing in October of that year they were a way for Cuomo to release solo music and play small clubs. For the first show the lineup of the band consisted of Rivers Cuomo, Kevin Stevenson, Mikey Welsh, and Zeph Courtney. After Stevenson complained of being unable to work with the current lineup, Welsh and Courtney were replaced with Fred Eltringham and Drew Parsons. This was the lineup for the second show in late October. By the third show Cuomo had come up with a fully developed solo project he called Homie. Further shows were billed as Homie and the material played at Homie shows were exclusive to the Homie project and are assumed to have been intended for the Homie album which was worked on in 1997 and 1998. The song \\"Wanda (You're My Only Love)\\", although originally written as a Weezer song for the movie Angus, is considered to be a Homie song since it was played during the Homie shows. The song \\"Wanda (You're My Only Love)\\" was released on Alone - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo,. The song \\"I'll Think About You\\" was released on Alone II: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo. According to Cuomo's blog, master tapes of recording sessions made during the Homie-era exist, but are largely unfinished, having only drum tracks laid down. Bootlegs of their live shows have been available online since 1997 and played a small role in Weezer's resurgence following their second album, Pinkerton. On February 20, 2009, a fan-made tribute was distributed by two members of a Weezer fan community, Jack Mergist (The Lifetaker) and Ryan Rowland (runnersdialzero). The tribute features an album worth of high-quality recordings of interpretations of Homie and Rivers Cuomo solo songs from this era. \\"Rivers Cuomo Band\\" Musicians Rivers Cuomo, Kevin Stevenson, Mikey Welsh, Jamie Kurowitz, and Zeph Courtney, Fred Eltringham and Drew Parsons Homie Musicians Rivers, Kevin, Fred, Drew, Adam, Matt, Jamie, Pat, Jake, Yuval, Sebastian, Greg, Justin, and Todd.

Biography A native of Elizabethtown, New York, her father was a carpenter who loved literature. From an early age, Post and her seven siblings were taught the importance of education and manners in society. Wanting a better future for his daughter, Post's father hired a teacher to teach her during summers. A fast learner, Post got her first job as a teacher in 1856 at the age of 15 Post applied for a scholarship at the University of Vermont, not knowing that the university did not accept female students. Undaunted by this rejection, she went on to study at the Burlington Female Seminary. In 1863, after graduating from that school, Post relocated with her family to Iowa. In Iowa, Post met and fell in love with a politician who was a rising star in his party. While he was campaigning for an important political position, his political enemies, aware that he was about to win the election, spread a rumor that he was having an affair. While these rumors had no base, Post believed them and, deeply hurt, avoided him for the rest of her life, refusing to speak with him or respond to his letters. Soon after, she accepted a job teaching in Lansing, Iowa. While in Lansing, Post began to investigate her former boyfriend's supposed affair. Despite discovering the truth, she did not apologize to him. Post moved to Arizona City, Arizona (now known as Yuma, Arizona) in 1872. Upon her arrival in Yuma, she was met by Arizona territorial governor Anson P. K. Safford. Only the fifth teacher in Arizona, Post got help from Safford to re-open a former saloon and turn it into Arizona's third school. Post was known as a strict rule enforcer in class; for example, if a student missed class Post would go to the student's home and unless the student had a valid excuse not to be in class, would take the student to school herself. Many of her students' parents disliked her practices, and Post was aware of this. She began to win the parents over, however, by ordering trendy uniforms from San Francisco and teaching the students' mothers how to sew. On May 2, 1873, Mary witnessed the hanging of Manuel Fernandez, who had been found guilty of murdering Michael \\"Rawhide\\" McCartney, a local salesman. Disillusioned by the act and by the subsequent approval by the Arizona Sentinel, Post decided to relocate to San Diego, California, where she took a job as general vice-principal of San Diego's school system. However, only a year later she returned to Arizona City. She and her brother, Albert, shared positions at her new school; Mary supervised the girls while Albert oversaw the boys. Occasionally, Post engaged in creative fundraising for education. Post once convinced a wealthy man to hold a charity horse race that raised $600, which she used to buy school supplies. She also hired Colorado River boat captain Isaac Pulhamus (1828-1922) to organize a beauty contest from which she garnered $500, which were also used for school supplies. After her retirement from teaching at the age of 72, the United States Senate passed a bill which dictated for Post to receive a pension of fifty dollars a month. She was the first teacher in the state to do so. In her retirement, Post operated a small store and pursued her hobby of sewing, going door to door teaching women to sew clothes. Post died of natural causes in 1934, at the age of 93. The \\"Mary E. Post school\\" in Yuma is named after her.

Specifically, Enfield exists in both the East Hants Municipal District and the Halifax Regional Municipality and is divided by the Shubenacadie River. History Grants of land around what is now Enfield were given after 1760. The first was given to Benjamin Franklin, a parcel of land on the side of the Shubenacadie River opposite the main part of the present village. A Mr. Hall was hired by Franklin to take charge of the grant, and to operate a Wayside Inn. The Grand Lake East area was the location of another grant, 2500 acres that was given to Norman Fitzgerald Uniacke. Several men, of the name MacDonell, now own a portion of this land. Another grant of land was given to Jacob Horne Sr., a German who enlisted in the 42nd Highland Regiment. Horne, being familiar with the coast of Nova Scotia, accompanied General Wolfe as a pilot, fighting under him at Quebec in 1758. Jacob's son, Andrew Horne, was the first settler in Enfield district, clearing a farm in the wilderness near the lock at Horne Settlement. Enfield became a village comparatively late in the history of Nova Scotia; it does not appear in any early census of the province. Early people living in the area were probably listed under Nine Mile River, Douglas or 'The Crossing'. (Enfield was previously known as 'The Crossing'.) It is recorded that Enfield was named at a public meeting, called at Malcolm's Pottery in 1862. Thomas B. Donaldson suggested the name Enfield. In 1863, due to his interest and perseverance, the name \\"Enfield\\" was officially adopted as the name for the settlement. It has been said that he took a fancy to the name when he resided in the town of Enfield Connecticut. On selling out his general store business in 1867, he purchased the Hall farm located in the OX-Bow on the Hants side of the Shubenacadie River, crossed by the bridge on Highway No. 1. This farm was operated by his son Charles F. for the years 1900 ‚Äì 1950, and the old homestead is now part of the large modern home owned by his grandson, Frank C. Donaldson. Firmly established as a permanent resident in 1871, Thomas B. drew a plan for a church building in the village. His plan was adopted and the building erected within the year. Eleven men went to the woods to get out logs ‚Äì some of these were T. Kenty, C. Todd, Lang, Miller, and the Halls. The 105th anniversary of this church was celebrated on June 20, 1976, when every pew was filled. It was by then a part of the United Church of Canada, but originally, the church was Methodist. When the congregation joined the United Church in Elmsdale, the building was turned over to the Women's Institute of Nova Scotia-Enfield Branch. It became the home of the Enfield Heritage Centre, which was founded by the WINS (Enfield Branch.) The church building was demolished in the early 2000s, after the Women's Institute members could no longer maintain it. The Enfield Heritage Centre is now housed in the former E H Horne School and is maintained by the Enfield Heritage Centre Association. It is said that the first school was built at Horne Settlement, and serviced young and old alike. Among the school teachers was Miss Sarah Hanson who came out of the state of Maine, with others who were interested in investing in the Shubenacadie Canal. Later a school was built at Enfield near where the current Chinese restaurant is situated. This building was used as school until the early 1940s. It was later divided into two parts and became the homes of Marie & Vince Horne and Margaret & Andy MacDonnell. There was a school on the Horne Settlement Road near Jack Hawkins house (on the opposite side of the road) for many years. It remained abandoned for some years, and has since been demolished. In 1942 a new school was built and gifted to the community by Edmund H Horne. This school opened in January 1943 and served the people of Enfield as a school until June 2000. The Enfield District School was later built as the population of Enfield grew, and along with the E H Horne School it housed the elementary grade students of Enfield. In June 2000 the new Enfield District school opened to replace both the E H Horne School and the former Enfield District School. The new school serves grades Primary to Five. The other grades now go to school in Milford at either the Riverside Education Centre or for the higher grades to Hants East Rural High. The area is primarily a bedroom community for those working in HRM or at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport. Situated near the halfway point between Halifax and Truro, Enfield was once home to a prominent railway station constructed by the Nova Scotia Railway and later the Intercolonial Railway and Canadian National Railway; it has since been sold, moved and now is a private cottage near Monte Vista. During the mid-19th century, a system of locks on the Shubenacadie River in Enfield assisted small vessels in navigating from the Bay of Fundy to nearby Shubenacadie Grand Lake as part of the Shubenacadie Canal. The Enfield Rugby Football Club (Established 2007) won the NSRFU Summer Division II Championship against the Halifax Tars 26-12 after completing an undefeated 8-0 season. They were also the Truro 7's Indoor Rugby Men's Div 'A' Champions for 2009. On April 19, 2020, a spree killing that spanned a wide area of Nova Scotia resulted in a police chase that ended on Highway 2 in Enfield. Climate Enfield has a humid continental climate with some marine influence, as typical of Nova Scotia. The nearest station is at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport located around south of the Enfield core.

The association does not regulate or certify doctors, a responsibility which lies with the General Medical Council. The association's headquarters are in Tavistock Square, London and it has national offices in Cardiff, Belfast, and Edinburgh, a European office in Brussels and a number of offices in English regions. The BMA has a range of representative and scientific committees and is recognised by National Health Service (NHS) employers as the sole contract negotiator for doctors. The BMA's stated aim is \\"to promote the medical and allied sciences, and to maintain the honour and interests of the medical profession\\". Membership Currently 159,000 doctors and 19,000 medical students are members of the association. It is officially recognized by the British government and by the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration. The BMA shares national bargaining rights with the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA). Members of the BMA have access to employment advice, covering subjects including contract checking, job planning, pay disputes and relationship issues. Members also receive a subscription to The BMJ, and other associated resources. BMA committees As part of the representative remit of the BMA, it has a number of representative committees formed from members elected at the Annual Representatives Meeting (ARM) and via other election processes. The most senior of these is Council, which meets five times a year to implement policy as decided at the ARM and to take relevant decisions during the year. Council has 34 voting members, led by the Chairman who is elected by council for an initial term of three years and to a maximum of five. The Board of Professional Activities reports to Council and considers ethical, scientific, research, and educational matters whilst The Board of Representative and Political Activities considers reports from the following committees which represent doctors across the seven branches of practice, namely: *Central Consultants and Specialists Committee (CCSC) ‚Äì representing senior hospital doctors *General Practitioners Committee (GPC) ‚Äì representing NHS General Practitioners (GPs) and GP trainees throughout their training *Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) ‚Äì representing junior hospital doctors *Medical Academic Staff Committee (MASC) ‚Äì representing academic and research staff *Medical Students Committee (MSC) ‚Äì representing medical students *Public Health Medicine Committee (PHMC) ‚Äì representing public and community health doctors *Staff and Associate Specialists Committee(SASC) ‚Äì for doctors in the non consultant career grades. Branch of Practice committees have a majority of BMA members but may also include non-members. All members are elected. These UK committees are mirrored across the devolved nations of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. =Other committees= The BMA also has a number of committees which represent other specialities and interests which affect its members, including: * Medical Ethics * Board of Medical Education * Equality and Diversity Committee * Pensions * Armed Forces * Civil and Public Services Committee * International Committee * Medico-Legal * Occupational Health * GP Trainees' Subcommittee =Medical Ethics Committee= The BMA has a Medical Ethics Committee provides guidance to the association on current and developing issues in medical ethics. It is widely seen as one of the foremost authorities on ethical issues in the UK and international medical field. The committee debates issues of principle including those touching on: =Armed Forces Committee= The BMA supports armed forces doctors through its Armed Forces Committee (AFC) which represents clinicians in all parts of the armed forces, whether they are deployed to war zones, acting as reservists or civilian doctors employed by the Ministry of Defence. A large part of the AFC's work is the production of evidence to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). The AFPRB advises on remuneration for members of the naval, military, and air forces. Further to this work, the AFC negotiates with the Ministry of Defence on the terms and conditions for civilian doctors. The committee holds two conferences a year; an Armed Forces Committee conference usually in May and a Civilian Doctors' conference usually in October. =Private Practice Committee= The BMA supports doctors that undertake private practice outside the NHS through its Private Practice Committee. This body considers topics facing both private consultants and general practitioners. The committee meets three times a year and holds conferences in relation to private practice. The main issues currently being dealt with by the committee include looking at the implementation of revalidation in the independent sector and addressing difficulties that doctors experience in relation to new ways of working by the private medical insurers. Headquarters BMA House, London BMA House has been the headquarters of the BMA since 1925, the association being previously housed at 429 The Strand since its move to London. In addition to offices for its staff, the building is used for BMA conferences and events and parts of the building are available on a private hire basis for events. The building, Grade II listed since 1982, was originally designed for the Theosophical Society by Sir Edwin Lutyens, with work commencing in September 1911. However the start of World War I interrupted construction and the Army Pay Office took over the uncompleted building. After the war the Theosophical Society could not afford to finish the building, and it was sold to the BMA for ¬£50,000, with the association later purchasing the freehold of the site from the Bedford Estates in 1962. After purchasing the building, the BMA commissioned Lutyens to complete the building to its specifications and it was officially opened by King George V and Queen Mary on 13 July 1925. However, plans were soon commissioned from Cyril Wontner Smith to extend the building to overlook Tavistock Square, and this was completed in 1929. The association later commissioned Douglas Wood to design further extensions on either side of Wontner Smith's front entrance (built 1938‚Äì1949), to the south (1947‚Äì1950) and at the back of the building (1959‚Äì1960). A 1954 war memorial by James Woodford in the central courtyard ‚Äì a bronze fountain in a stepped pool, with four stone statues ‚Äì is Grade II* listed, and described by Historic England as a particularly good example of a Second World War memorial to a civilian profession. History =Provincial Medical and Surgical Association and Webster's Medical Association= The British Medical Association traces its origins to the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association (PMSA), founded by Sir Charles Hastings on 19 July 1832, and to the \\"British Medical Association\\" founded by George Webster in 1836. Ten years after its initial meeting the Provincial Medical and Surgical Association's membership had grown to 1,350 and it had begun to publish a weekly journal, The Provincial Medical and Surgical Journal. In 1853 the PMSA extended its membership to London doctors and 1856 transformed itself into the British Medical Association. From 1857 their journal was known as the British Medical Journal or BMJ. Logo used for the BMA's Sixty-fifth Annual Meeting, Montreal, 1897 Although not initially formed with the aim of initiating medical reform, the BMA played a key role in the drafting and passing of the Medical Act 1858, which established the General Medical Council and set a standard for qualified and unqualified doctors and established a system of professional regulation. Prior to this anyone, qualified or not, could practice as a doctor. This also positioned the BMA to play a major role in future medical politics, campaigning on issues such as Poor Law Medicine, quackery, public health, alternative and military medicine, and contract practice. During this time one of the most active and influential of the association's bodies was the Parliamentary Bills Committee, formed in 1863 to take a leading role in influencing legislation on public health matters. =Early 20th century= In May 1911 the Government introduced the National Health Insurance Bill which presented the BMA with new challenges. This bill introduced the idea that for a maximum contribution of four pence a week every employed person in the country could be insured against treatment costs for sickness. The BMA supported the principle but had a number of reservations about the scheme including the lack of doctor involvement in delivering the medical benefits, which were instead being delivered by friendly societies and trade unions. In response the BMA produced \\"Six Cardinal Points\\" which it felt should be included in any legislation. At the BMA's general meeting in July 1912, incoming president Sir James Barr condemned the National Health Insurance Bill as \\"the most gigantic fraud which had ever been perpetrated on the public since the South Sea Bubble.\\" Addressing \\"a large and distinguished audience,\\" Barr \\"spoke eloquently and forcibly in favour of the improvement of the race by attention to eugenics, and pointed out the necessity of preventing disease as well of curing it. No serious attempt, he said, had yet been made to prevent the race from being carried on by its least worthy citizens.\\" Barr explained that: \\"If such an attempt was to be successful we must begin with the unborn. The race must be renewed from the mentally and physically fit, and moral and physical degenerates should not be allowed to take any part in adding to it\\".Doctors' Ultimatum to Ministers, The Times, 24 July 1912:7 Ultimately the final bill was passed in 1913 in which four of the six points had been included. This resulted in an income limit of ¬£2 per week being set to join the scheme, there was to be free choice of doctor by patient, the payment to the doctor should be adequate, and finally there should be adequate medical representation among the various bodies working on the Act. With the start of World War I, the BMA formed a Central Medical War Committee (CMWC), and was given responsibility by the government for managing the demand for doctors in the armed forces whilst maintaining a full medical service for civilians. The BMA repeated this role during World War II. During this time the BMA also campaigned on issues such as the production and marketing of \\"secret remedies\\", nutrition and physical fitness, the relationship of alcohol to road accidents, and the medical aspects of abortion. Early in the Second World War, the BMA became aware of the need for a change in the provision of medical care to the public after the end of the war and during peacetime, so shortly after the war, the BMA had produced its own plan for a \\"general medical service for the nation\\".  Key people  Chairs of the BMA include the following. * 1943‚Äì1949 Sir Guy Dain * 1976‚Äì1979 Sir James Cameron * 1984‚Äì1990 John Marks * 1990‚Äì1993 Jeremy Lee- Potter * 1993‚Äì1998 Sandy MacAra * 1998‚Äì2003 Ian Bogle * 2003‚Äì2007 James Johnson * 2007‚Äì2012 Hamish Meldrum * 2012‚Äì2017 Mark Porter * 2017‚Äìpresent Dr Chaand Nagpaul  Controversy  In 2019, the BMA faced criticism after two leading General Practitioners blew the whistle on sexism and harassment in the organisation. Following the independent Romney review which described the BMA as an \\"old boy's club\\" that undervalued women, the BMA apologised to female doctors. Grants The BMA makes grants to doctors for research and other reasons. Details of all the awards and grants offered by The BMA are available on their website. However, the top three are listed here: Claire Wand Fund A charitable fund, administered by The BMA, that makes grants to fund the further education of medical practitioners predominantly engaged in general practice. Humanitarian Fund The BMA International Department runs the BMA Humanitarian Fund which offers grants of up to ¬£3,000 for projects taking place in developing countries. BMA Research Grants The BMA awards ten grants totalling ¬£500,000 annually. All grants are for research in progress or prospective research and cover a diversity of research areas. Logo The logo of the BMA includes a stylised version of the rod of Asclepius, associated with Asclepius, the Greek god of healing. It was designed by John Lloyd (graphic designer) and Martin Skeet of the British design consultancy, Lloyd Northover. Book awards The BMA Medical Book awards are announced annually. There are awards in 20 subject categories (from \\"Anaesthesia\\" to \\"Surgical Specialities\\"); special category awards including \\"Illustrated book\\", \\"Student textbook\\", \\"Young author\\"; and an overall \\"Medical Book of the Year\\". =BMA Medical book of the year winners= *2018: *2017: Other awards * The Association Medal is awarded to members for \\"outstanding and sustained services\\" to the BMA at national level * Fellowship of the Association is awarded for \\"distinguished and notable\\" services to the BMA and the profession * The Gold Medal is awarded to those who have \\"conspicuously raised the character of the medical profession\\". The medal was instituted in 1877 at the association's annual meeting in Manchester.

It is a stand-alone sequel to Metal Gear that was released in North America (under the Ultra Games brand) and the PAL region following the international commercial success of the NES version. Much like the NES version of the first Metal Gear, the game was produced without the involvement of series creator Hideo Kojima, who went on to develop a separate sequel for the MSX2 titled Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, which was released later during the same year in Japan. Gameplay One of the side-view areas from Snake's Revenge. As in the original Metal Gear, the player's objective is to infiltrate the enemy's stronghold while avoiding detection from enemy soldiers or surveillance devices. To fulfill their mission, the player must collect a variety of weapons and equipment, such as firearms, explosives, and rations, as well as card keys to access new areas. If the player is discovered by the enemy, the game will go into an alert phase, causing enemy soldiers to enter the screen and attack the player. The player must defeat a certain number of enemy soldiers to return to the infiltration phase or go to a different floor or area. In some cases, particularly when a guard sees the player and only a single exclamation mark (!) appears over his head instead of two (!!), the player can also escape the alert phase by simply moving to the adjacent screen. A change to the original Metal Gear formula is the fact that the player now begins the game with a combat knife and a handgun already in their equipment. The A button is used for firearms and explosives as in the original game, whereas the B button is used for a melee attack with a punch or a knife depending on which one is assigned. The knife can be used to instantly kill guards at close range, but guards who are defeated with punches instead will occasionally leave behind an ammo box or a single ration unit. As in the original Metal Gear, Snake's maximum health and carrying capacity are determined by his rank, with the highest level being six stars. The player must rescue various hostages scattered throughout various areas until enough have been rescued for a promotion. The player will also encounter enemy officers in certain rooms who can be interrogated by applying truth gas unto them. Successful interrogations are counted alongside rescued hostages for promotions. The interface of the player's transceiver has also been greatly changed from the original Metal Gear. Instead of dialing frequency numbers, Snake now has a set list of three contacts (John, Nick, and Jennifer) that he can communicate with and a radar that is activated whenever it detects a tracking signal transmitting from a nearby area. Unlike in the original Metal Gear, the transceiver cannot be used when the player enters alert mode. Snake's Revenge features a varied progression of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a cargo ship, and a train, as well as the usual encounters with enemy bosses. In addition to the standard top-view areas, the player must also go through a series of side-view areas that play in a manner similar to Rush 'n Attack, in which Snake proceeds by walking, jumping, or crawling on his stomach while avoiding detection as usual. While in a side-view area, the player is limited to only the knife or handgun as their standard weapon, although plastic explosives can be planted as well to eliminate obstructions. Some of these areas require the player to crawl underwater to progress, resulting in the need for oxygen tanks to proceed without sustaining damage. Each time Snake's oxygen gauge runs out, a tank will be used automatically to refill the gauge until supplies last. Plot Three years after the events of the original Metal Gear, FOXHOUND discovers that a hostile nation in the Middle East may have gotten a hold of the plans for Metal Gear and are secretly constructing a new model. Lt. Solid Snake, the FOXHOUND operative responsible for the destruction of Metal Gear, is given orders to lead a three-man team to the enemy's base consisting of himself and two fellow operatives: John Turner, a former Navy Intelligence agent and infiltration pro; and Nick Myer, a weapons and explosive expert formerly with the Marines. The codename of the mission is Operation 747. Snake infiltrates the enemy's jungle base with the help of John, who acts as a decoy by allowing himself to be captured. Snake eventually learns that the enemy is transporting their weapons, a set of mass-produced Metal Gear tanks, on a cargo ship. Snake blows up the ship's ammunition cache and escapes with the help of the team's helicopter pilot while the ship sinks. The pilot informs Snake that the enemy has a prototype of the new Metal Gear 2 model in their main base and is told to contact their double agent, Jennifer, on the inside. As Snake goes deep into the base, he defeats an impostor posing as John, regains contact with Nick and eventually comes in touch with Jennifer, who reveals that the enemy commander is planning to launch nukes around the face of the globe. However, as Snake approaches the commander's lair, Nick is mortally wounded and dies, while Jennifer is exposed as a spy and gets captured. Snake confronts the enemy's commander, who reveals himself to be a cybernetically enhanced Big Boss, having survived his previous encounter with Snake. Snake defeats Big Boss and rescues Jennifer, who shows him to the storage facility where Metal Gear 2 is located. Snake destroys the weapon before its launch countdown is completed. In the aftermath of Operation 747, the United Nations declares \\"World Peace Day\\". John Turner is declared missing in action and removed from Navy records, while Nick Myer is awarded three posthumous promotions. Development Konami produced Snake's Revenge following the release of the NES version of Metal Gear, as a sequel produced specifically for the Western market. Hideo Kojima, the designer of the original MSX2 version of Metal Gear, was not involved in the production of Snake's Revenge. According to Kojima, one of the developers working on Snake's Revenge informed him of the game. He then asked Kojima to develop a true sequel to Metal Gear. This inspired Kojima to direct his own sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake for the MSX2, which served as the sequel to Metal Gear in Japan. Snake's Revenge was released in North America and Europe with no corresponding Famicom version. The game has been referred to in publications by the alternate title of Snake's Revenge: Metal Gear II, although this title is never used in the actual game. When interviewed by Steven Kent in 1999, Kojima stated that he enjoyed Snake's Revenge and that he thought it was \\"faithful to the Metal Gear concept\\". While Kojima once jokingly stated that Snake's Revenge was \\"somewhat of a crappy game\\" during the 2009 Game Developers Conference, he later stated in an interview with Nintendo Power that he doesn't consider it to be a \\"bad game\\".

He is also known as Sylaire and as Yslaire, his current artist name. Biography Bernard Hislaire was born in 1957 in Brussels, Belgium.De Weyer, Geert (2005). \\"Hislaire\\". In Belgi√´ gestript, pp. 126-127. Tielt: Lannoo. Passionate about comics since he was very young, he produced his first drawings in the Robidule fanzine, and worked on his style at the Institut Saint-Luc in Brussels. At the age of 18, he joined the drawing team of the Spirou magazine, where he published a story in the section dedicated to young creators. Soon, he began a 16-page story, Le Troisi√®me Laron. He was then supported by the best known scenarists of Dupuis, such as Raoul Cauvin and Jean-Marie Brouy√®re, with whom he realised various series including Coursensac et Baladin. In 1978 he launched his own characters in the Spirou magazine, Bidouille et Violette, which continued until 1985, achieving considerable success with the public. Meanwhile, he also published humorous drawings in La Libre Belgique and Le Trombone Illustr√©. In 1986, after having met the scenarist Balac, he created Sambre, a 19th-century saga, about an impossible love story between Bernard Sambre, a rich young man, and Julie, a farmer girl, during the 1848 revolution in France. This series was original because the graphical style used in these albums is different from the one Hislaire used before, and because the number of colours used is very restricted and centered on red. This was the first publication on which he used the name Yslaire. The whole series was published by Gl√©nat and was a critical and commercial success. In 1997 he surprised his fans again with the release of the unique M√©moires du XXe ciel: 98, later renamed XXe ciel.com: M√©moires98 after it changed publishers as well as some of its content. In 2001, the sequel, M√©moires99 was released. XXe ciel.com has as its central theme the existence of angels. Hislaire has also made some scenarios for other artists, both under his own name and as Yslaire. Some of these works were Trois vierges for Boccar and Le Gang Mazda for Darasse.

It can be used in any kind of therapeutic situation, including peer- to-peer sessions. It involves holding a kind of open, non-judging attention to an internal knowing which is directly experienced but is not yet in words. Focusing can, among other things, be used to become clear on what one feels or wants, to obtain new insights about one's situation, and to stimulate change or healing of the situation. Focusing is set apart from other methods of inner awareness by three qualities: something called the \\"felt sense\\", a quality of engaged accepting attention, and a researched-based technique that facilitates change. Origin At the University of Chicago, beginning in 1953, Eugene Gendlin did 15 years of research analyzing what made psychotherapy either successful or unsuccessful. The conclusion was that it is not the therapist's technique that determines the success of psychotherapy, but rather the way the patient behaves, and what the patient does inside himself during the therapy sessions. Gendlin found that, without exception, the successful patient intuitively focuses inside himself on a very subtle and vague internal bodily awareness‚Äîor \\"felt sense\\"‚Äîwhich contains information that, if attended to or focused on, holds the key to the resolution of the problems the patient is experiencing. \\"Focusing\\" is a process and learnable skill developed by Gendlin which re-creates this successful-patient behavior in a form that can be taught to other patients. Gendlin detailed the techniques in his book Focusing which, intended for the layperson, is written in conversational terms and describes the six steps of Focusing and how to do them. Gendlin stated: \\"I did not invent Focusing. I simply made some steps which help people to find Focusing.\\" \\"Felt sense\\" and \\"felt shift\\" Gendlin gave the name \\"felt sense\\" to the unclear, pre-verbal sense of \\"something\\"‚Äîthe inner knowledge or awareness that has not been consciously thought or verbalized‚Äîas that \\"something\\" is experienced in the body. It is not the same as an emotion. This bodily felt \\"something\\" may be an awareness of a situation or an old hurt, or of something that is \\"coming\\"‚Äîperhaps an idea or insight. Crucial to the concept, as defined by Gendlin, is that it is unclear and vague, and it is always more than any attempt to express it verbally. Gendlin also described it as \\"sensing an implicit complexity, a wholistic sense of what one is working on\\".\\"What matters most in psychotherapy is 'feeling' in the sense of being unclear and sensing an implicit complexity, a wholistic sense of what one is working on. This can be very quietly sensed, or it may be very emotional, but that is not the crucial question at all.\\" Cited from: According to Gendlin, the Focusing process makes a felt sense more tangible and easier to work with. To help the felt sense form and to accurately identify its meaning, the focuser tries out words that might express it. These words can be tested against the felt sense: The felt sense will not resonate with a word or phrase that does not adequately describe it. Gendlin observed clients, writers, and people in ordinary life (\\"Focusers\\") turning their attention to this not-yet-articulated knowing. As a felt sense formed, there would be long pauses together with sounds like \\"uh....\\" Once the person had accurately identified this felt sense in words, new words would come, and new insights into the situation. There would be a sense of felt movement‚Äîa \\"felt shift\\"‚Äîand the person would begin to be able to move beyond the \\"stuck\\" place, having fresh insights, and also sometimes indications of steps to take. Learning and using Focusing One can learn the Focusing technique from one of several books, or from a Focusing trainer or practitioner. Focusing is easiest to sense and do in the presence of a \\"listener\\"‚Äîeither a Focusing trainer, a therapist, or a layperson trained in Focusing. Gendlin's book details the six steps of Focusing, which can also be taught as a four-step process, while emphasizing that there is an essence to Focusing which is a flow that is beyond steps. Focusing is now practiced all over the world by thousands of people‚Äîboth in professional settings with Focusing trainers, and informally between laypersons. As a stand-alone process, a Focusing session can last from approximately 30 minutes to an hour, on average‚Äîwith the \\"focuser\\" being listened to, and his verbalized thoughts and feelings being reflected back to him by the \\"listener\\". Generally speaking, but not always, the focuser has his eyes closed, in order to more accurately focus inwardly on his \\"felt sense\\" and the shifts that take place from it. Focusing can also be done alone. Subsequent developments In 1996, Gendlin published a comprehensive book on Focusing-oriented psychotherapy. The Focusing-oriented psychotherapist attributes a central importance to the client's capacity to be aware of his \\"felt sense\\", and the meaning behind his words or images. The client is encouraged to sense into feelings and meanings which are not yet formed. Other elements of Focusing are also incorporated into the therapy practice so that Focusing remains the basis of the process‚Äîallowing for inner resonance and verification of ideas and feelings, and allowing new and fresh insights to come from within the client. Several adaptations of Gendlin's original six-step Focusing process have been developed. The most popular and prevalent of these is the process Ann Weiser Cornell teaches, called Inner Relationship Focusing. Other developments in Focusing include focusing alone using a journal or a sketchbook. Drawing and painting can be used with Focusing processes with children. Focusing also happens in other domains besides therapy. Attention to the felt sense naturally takes place in all manner of processes where something new is being formed: for example in creative process, learning, thinking, and decision making.

It is the great extensor muscle of the knee, forming a large fleshy mass which covers the front and sides of the femur. The name derives . Structure The quadriceps consists of four separate muscles It is subdivided into four separate muscles (the 'heads'): *Rectus femoris occupies the middle of the thigh, covering most of the other three quadriceps muscles. It originates on the ilium. It is named from its straight course. *The other three lie deep to rectus femoris and originate from the body of the femur, which they cover from the trochanters to the condyles: **Vastus lateralis is on the lateral side of the femur (i.e. on the outer side of the thigh). **Vastus medialis is on the medial side of the femur (i.e. on the inner part thigh). **Vastus intermedius lies between vastus lateralis and vastus medialis on the front of the femur (i.e. on the top or front of the thigh), but deep to the rectus femoris. Typically, it cannot be seen without dissection of the rectus femoris. The rectus femoris arises from the anterior inferior iliac spine and from the superior edge of the acetabulum. It is thus a biarticular muscle. The other parts of the quadriceps arise from the surface of the femur. All four parts of the quadriceps muscle ultimately insert into the tuberosity of the tibia via the patella, where the quadriceps tendon becomes the patellar ligament. There is a small fifth muscle of the quadriceps complex called the articularis genus that is not often included. In addition, cadaver studies have confirmed the presence of a sixth muscle, the tensor vastus intermedius. While the muscle has variable presentations, it consistently originates at the proximal femur, runs between the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius muscles, and inserts distally at the medial aspect of the patellar base. Historically considered a part of the vastus lateralis, the tensor vastus intermedius muscle is innervated by an independent branch of the femoral nerve and its tendinous belly can be separated from the vasti lateralis and intermedius muscles in most cases. =Nerve supply= Femoral nerve (L2, L3, L4). Function All four quadriceps are powerful extensors of the knee joint. They are crucial in walking, running, jumping and squatting. Because the rectus femoris attaches to the ilium, it is also a flexor of the hip. This action is also crucial to walking or running as it swings the leg forward into the ensuing step. The quadriceps, specifically the vastus medialis, play the important role of stabilizing the patella and the knee joint during gait.Therapeutic Exercises, Carolyn Kisner & Lynn A. Colby, 5th ed. (2002) 692-93. Society and culture =Training= The leg extension is an isolation exercise. In strength training, the quadriceps are trained by several leg exercises. Effective exercises include the squat and leg press. The isolation movement (i.e. targeting solely the quadriceps) is the leg extension. Etymology The proper Latin plural form of the adjective quadriceps would be quadricipites. In modern English usage, quadriceps is used in both singular and plural. The singular form quadricep, produced by back- formation, is frequently used.

Burlington, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, is an American national off-price department store retailer, and a division of Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation with 740 stores in 40 states and Puerto Rico, with its corporate headquarters located in Burlington Township, New Jersey. In 2007, it was acquired by Bain Capital in a take-private transaction and in 2008, Tom Kingsbury became President and CEO. The company went public again in 2013. Burlington is the third largest off-price retailer after TJX Companies and Ross Stores. History Burlington store in San Antonio, Texas Monroe Milstein and his father, Abe, had been running a successful wholesale and retail outerwear business together since 1946. In 1972, Henrietta Milstein convinced her husband Monroe to purchase a former factory outlet in Burlington, New Jersey, for $675,050, using money she had saved from her job as a librarian for most of the $75,000 down payment. Initially, the Milsteins sold coats and jackets wholesale, but in order to become less dependent on the seasonal coat business, they gradually began adding additional clothing items and accessories, eventually expanding into linens, gift items, a baby department and shoes. A second location was opened in 1975 in Copiague on Long Island, and Milstein asked his son Lazer, who was living in Israel at the time, to return home and act as the store's legal owner for the new location. Lazer agreed, on the condition that the store be closed Saturdays in observance of the Sabbath. At the time, businesses faced legal action for being open on Sunday, with an exception made for religions observing a different Sabbath. In 1983, with 31 locations, the company, whose name was Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation since it was bought by the family in 1972, went public. In 2006, the company was purchased by Bain Capital Partners for $2.06 billion. The Milstein family held almost 30 million shares of the Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation, making approximately $1.3 billion, and Monroe Milstein was unassociated with the business following the sale, although two of his sons, Stephen and Andrew, stayed on briefly. Mark Nesci, the former executive vice president and chief operating officer, was named to serve as the acting CEO. A holding company called Burlington Coat Factory Holdings Inc., was formed to be the ultimate parent of the chain. In July 2012, the company received a $40 million incentive from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority as part of the state's GrowNJ program in order to build a new headquarters in Florence, adjacent to its existing headquarters, keeping the company from moving its headquarters outside the state. On June 27, 2013, Burlington filed its S-1 registration statement with the SEC for an initial public offering. In October 2013, the company's stock rose more than 40% on its first day of trading. The company reported $4.35 billion in sales for the 12-month period ending August 3, 2013. As of October 2013, the company operated 503 stores in 44 states and Puerto Rico under the names Burlington Coat Factory, Cohoes Fashions, Baby Depot, MJM Designer Shoes and Burlington Shoes. In June 2016, it was announced that Burlington Stores had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time. Charitable partnerships Burlington has partnered with charitable organizations for several years. Since 2002, they have partnered with the joining the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society‚Äôs Light the Night campaign, collecting donations at the store checkout. With an annual fundraiser that runs from July through October, the company raised more than $3 million in 2013, bringing the total raised by the company to date to more than $19 million. In 2006, Burlington launched the Warm Coats and Warm Hearts Drive to collect coat donations for those in need. Partnering with ABC's Good Morning America and the national nonprofit Fashion Delivers, Burlington stores served as drop off spots for the donations, which were then distributed within the area by local charities. Since the program's inception, over 1.2 million coats have been collected and distributed. In 2012, the company first partnered with WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease to promote women‚Äôs heart health education during National Heart Health Month As part of this partnership, the company holds a yearly Red Dress Event, where red dresses are sold in stores, with $1 from every sale donated to WomenHeart. In 2014, as part of the partnership they launched the ‚ÄúHeart of Style Tour‚Äù. For the tour, a bus traveled to various store locations, with heart health professionals on board providing blood pressure tests and Body Mass Index (BMI) tests and education about women's heart disease.  Business issues  The old Burlington Coat Factory on 45 Park Place in New York. For many years after the September 11, 2001 attacks, it was planned to be replaced by the unrelated controversial Park51. A 43-story residential tower was constructed instead. Under investigation from animal welfare organization Humane Society of the United States, Burlington Coat Factory has been accused of labeling real fur products as \\"faux fur\\". The company agreed to pull the false advertisements after an undercover investigation revealed \\"faux fur\\" as actually made from the pelts of animals killed in China. Coats sold by stores such as Burlington Coat Factory have also been found to contain hair of raccoon dog. From 1981 until 2009, Burlington Coat Factory's logo was supplemented with the tag \\"Not Affiliated with Burlington Industries.\\" When Burlington Coat Factory settled a trademark dispute with fabric maker Burlington Industries in 1981, Burlington Coat Factory agreed to say in advertising that the two companies were not affiliated. Even though Burlington Industries ceased operations in 2004 following a buyout of its remaining operations, the \\"not affiliated\\" disclaimer remained on advertising logo and company media until 2009, when the text was retired from all logos used by the company. An urban legend concerning snakes hiding in coats being sold at Burlington became widely circulated in the early 1990s. A representative from the company assured customers that since distribution centers and stores were maintained at 68 ¬∞F, a snake would not be able to survive retail conditions.\\"Season 1, Episode 1.\\" Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed, written by Thomas Quinn, directed by Thomas Quinn, Burrud Productions, 2002.

The store had been the company's first location in Manhattan, opened in 1991.HighBeam Three floor beams of the top floor of the building were destroyed, causing major structural damage.

The game simulates combat in space between galactic scale empires. It follows the 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit & eXterminate) model: The players start with a homeworld, and have to build spaceships, explore the galaxy, colonize planets, mine minerals, build up their industry. The game is set in the \\"Echo Cluster\\" where 11 different races fight for control. It was one of the first indie games to become commercially successful. It was notable for being played via email, without a central server: each game of up to 11 players is handled independently, with the players sending their orders for each turn to the computer which manages that game. A hosted web version is now available. History The game was originally released in 1992 but became well known as a play-by-mail game in 1994 with version 3, although the prior version 2.2 was already played worldwide. Version 3 allows up to 11 players to join, each of them leading one of the 11 possible races. In 1994, the game was distributed as shareware, which could be purchased for $15 and registration was free. Although games could be set up directly by any group of players, a common way to find groups was to post and answer game invitations on the Usenet group rec.games.vga-planets. The predefined races are modeled after Star Trek, Star Wars and Battlestar Galactica, though custom races can be created with special tools. Each predefined race has some special powers and specific fields of expertise (for example: Cyborgs can assimilate native races into colonists; Robots are expert minelayers; Birdmen excel at spy tactics and cloaking). VGA Planets follows the 4X game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit & eXterminate) model: The players start with a homeworld, and have to build spaceships, explore the galaxy, colonize planets, mine minerals, build up their industry, etc. The game has no built-in victory condition: the players have to agree on one before starting a game. =VGA Planets 3= Clients up to version 3.0 were DOS programs; from version 3.5 on there were clients for Microsoft Windows. In addition, there are cross-platform third-party tools, including clients written in Java. A third-party Linux client named \\"GNOME War Pad\\" is also available. =VGA Planets 4= This is an expanded version of the original, with many new races and many new rules, expanded fleet combat - and the addition of ground combat units. =VGA Planets 5= This new browser- based version, based on version 4, was supposed to be published in 2011, but in February 2012 was put on hold indefinitely.\\"StarCube is currently on indefinite hold until the development team can be rebuilt.\\" =VGA Planets Nu= In May 2010 a new project was approved by Tim Wisseman called VGA Planets \\"Nu\\" to rebuild the version 3 game on to modern web-based technology. The Nu project was developed over the course of 2010 and was released for live games in November 2010. VGA Planets Nu is a remake of the version 3.0 game which runs on the web in a web browser or via the mobile app. The Nu project aims to overcome the technology challenges found in the older VGA Planets 3 versions which do not run on modern technology and create many barriers to entry for new players. Players sign up and can start playing immediately. This is now the most common way to play VGA Planets. Original gameplay The gameplay for both version 3 and 4 uses three programs: a master program that allows the creation of a universe with the desired characteristics; a host program that acts as a server; and a copy of the client program for each player. First, the host sends a file with the initial conditions to each player. The client program allows the player to view data about the game and make decisions. Once the player has finished giving orders for the turn, either the client program or an external helper program takes the data, creates a turn file (usually with a .TRN extension), and sends it to the host person, who feeds all the turn files into the host program. The host processes all the turns and creates new status files (usually with a .RST extension), which are then sent back to the players. This process can be fully automated (the host can be an automatic server). At the time that the game gained popularity, LANs and the Internet were not generally available to the public, so VGA Planets was primarily played via dial-up bulletin board systems (BBS), gradually moving to email as a PBEM as it became more widely available. The turn files and the game status files were transferred to and from the BBS or by email manually. This required games to have a regular hosting schedule. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1993 and 1994 noted VGA Planets 3.0s \\"clunky\\" interface and lack of single-player AI, but approved the \\"great deal Mr. Wisseman is giving the computer gaming public\\" for $15, and his \\"constant striving to improve his product\\". The magazine recommended that \\"anyone who enjoys spaceploitation\\" should try the game, stating that it \\"is very similar in feel to a play-by-mail system but without the cost and wait\\". A May 1994 survey in the magazine of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave 3.0 four stars out of five, calling it \\"excellent ... easy to learn, tough to master\\". Another article in the issue described 3.0 as \\"a wonderful blend of Reach for the Stars, Master of Orion and Diplomacy\\". In June 1994 VGA Planets was named a Finalist (Honorable Mention) for Computer Gaming Worlds \\"Online Game of the Year\\" award, losing to Multiplayer BattleTech. It was the first PBEM game nominated for the award. See also * Stars!

A sound system is a group of DJs and audio engineers contributing and working together as one, playing and producing music over a large PA system or sound reinforcement system, typically for a dance event or party. Origin The sound system concept originated in the 1950s in Kingston, Jamaica. DJs would load up a truck with a generator, turntables, and huge speakers to set up street parties. The sound system scene is a part of Jamaican cultural history and responsible for the rise of modern Jamaican musical styles such as ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub. When Jamaicans emigrated to the United Kingdom, the sound system culture followed and became firmly rooted there in the 1970s. It is still strongly linked with those Jamaican-originated music genres, and some bands or producers still call themselves sound systems, such as Dub Narcotic Sound System and the On-U Sound System. When Asian Dub Foundation are advertised as Asian Dub Foundation, the whole band performs, but when they announce themselves as Asian Dub Foundation Sound System, members of the band mix and play music (by other artists, as well as their own) while one or two MCs rap over the songs. The term also has become connected with sound reinforcement systems by DJs. Freetekno/Free Party The term \\"sound system\\" is also used to refer to a free party sound system, also known as a rig. The equipment includes a van, loudspeakers, amplifiers, turntable decks and cables. Larger rigs might also have a fog machine, stage lighting, video projectors and an electrical generator; the generator enables the sound system to be set up anywhere. A sound system collective is usually five or more people, with larger sound systems having more members. Equipment is owned by some and others are DJs, record producers or enthusiastic ravers who help out. They will be the people who organise free parties and teknivals and will be a group of friends with similar interests. Some owners purposely use second hand equipment, to reduce their risk if the equipment is stolen or damaged. This type of rig is called a \\"suicide rig\\" and usually used at insecure locations where it may get stolen or damaged and if it is suspected that police will have knowledge of the party. Sometimes a sound system collective is well known for its wide travels. This type of collective can be described as modern Nomad tribes or New age travellers. In this context the word sound system is used interchangeably to describe either the group of people or the equipment. The techno travelling scene of the 1990s was made of sound system crews like Bedlam sound system and Spiral Tribe. The free party community has been criticized for the unkempt appearance of attendees to such events, accusations of substance abuse of illegal drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, amphetamines and LSD, and complaints about messes left behind by such parties have given the scene a negative reputation. However, despite such complaints, the scene continues to grow with a large following in Bristol, Abergavenny, Newport, London, Devon and Cornwall.

She was a prolific writer who was published for over 40 years from 1958. At the time of her death, she had won more Miles Franklin Awards, Australia's major literary award, than any other writer. As well as being a writer, she taught at all levels of education - primary, secondary and tertiary. Astley has a significant place in Australian letters as she was \\"the only woman novelist of her generation to have won early success and published consistently throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when the literary world was heavily male-dominated\\".\\"Introduction\\" in Sheridan, Susan and Genomi, Paul (eds) (2008) Thea Astley's Fictional Worlds, Newcastle upon Tyne, Cambridge Scholars Publishing Life Born in Brisbane and educated at All Hallows' School, Astley studied arts at the University of Queensland then trained to become a teacher.Sheridan, Susan. (2011). Nine Lives: Postwar Women Writers Making Their Mark. University of Queensland Press. . After marrying Jack Gregson in 1948, she moved to Sydney where she taught at various high schools, as well as kept up with her writing. She tutored at Macquarie University from 1968 to 1980, before retiring to write full-time, at which time she and her husband moved to Kuranda in North Queensland. In the late 1980s they moved to Nowra, New South Wales, on the state's south coast, and, after her husband's death in 2003, she moved to Byron Bay to be near her only child, Ed Gregson, a musician and television producer. In addition to her passion for writing, Astley, along with her husband, had a great love of music, particularly jazz and chamber music.Baker (1986) p. 32 Wyndham writes that \\"in person and in print, the chain-smoking Astley was unsentimental, wickedly funny and yet had a deep kindness and a loathing of injustice towards Aborigines, underdogs and misfits\\".Wyndham (2004a) p. 79 Thea Astley died at the John Flynn Hospital on the Gold Coast in 2004. In 2005, the Thea Astley lecture was instituted at the Byron Bay Writers Festival, with Kate Grenville delivering the inaugural one.Whitlock, Gillian (2007) \\"Thea Astley's Fictional Worlds. Ed. Susan Sheridan and Paul Genoni\\" (Review), JASAL. Vol. 6 Career Thea Astley plaque in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay Astley's novels won four Miles Franklin Awards and in 1989 the author won the Patrick White Award for services to Australian literature and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Queensland. Much of her writing, which draws heavily from her early childhood, is set in Queensland, which she has described as \\"the place where the tall yarn happens, where it is lived out by people who are the dramatis personae of the tall yarns.\\"Thea Astley (Jessie Street National Women's Library) Accessed: 22 January 2007. Astley nearly became a journalist, following her father's footsteps, but was refused a position by the Brisbane Telegraph for being too old when she applied after having finished her university degree. She sold her first poem under the name \\"Phillip Cressy\\" because men were paid ¬£5, while women were only paid ¬£3.cited by Wyndham (2004) p. 79 Her first book, Girl with a monkey was published in 1958. The author noted that \\"I wrote quite a bit of it before Ed was born and entered it in the Herald and got an honourable mention. So I thought. 'Oh well, I'll bung it into A&R;'s, which was the only publisher I knew'\\". After the publication of her third book, The Well-dressed Explorer, the Herald's reviewer, Sidney J. Baker, wrote \\"With this book, Miss Astley earns a place among the leaders of modern Australian fiction\\". He associated her with writers such as Patrick White and Hal Porter who wrote \\"poetic prose ... an important but by no means popular dimension to Australian fiction\\". Her early style, in particular, used \\"obscure polysyllables, formal syntax and lush imagery [which] divided critics and daunted many readers\\". In 1997, Thea Astley wrote in a column for Australian House & Garden magazine that \\"For me the chief advantage of writing is that it can be done anywhere. I recall writing almost the whole of a short story in Hunting the Wild Pineapple on a plane coming down from Cooktown. I've taken copious notes at a luncheon table in Santo, in small pub rooms in Charleville and Roma when I was on the Writers' Train. I've written in a convent bedroom on Palm Island, on the wharf at Magnetic [Island]\\".Astley (1997), p. 63-64 Two weeks before her death, Astley appeared at the Byron Bay Writers' Festival and gave \\"a brilliantly comic reading of 'Why I Wrote a Story Called the Diesel Epiphany', a short story about one of her many journeys by bus with all its annoyances\\". A plaque commemorating Astley's writing is included in the Sydney Writers Walk at Circular Quay. Influences In her early years she was friends with Patrick White, Hal Porter and Thomas Keneally. She had few female literary contemporaries until the 1980s. Style and themes According to the AustLit Gateway News Astley was \\"revered for her meticulous and controlled use of language and her portrayals of the Queensland landscape and character, [and] was renowned for her quick wit, raspy voice, and ever-present cigarettes\\".AustLit Gateway News 2004 Many of her books explore the \\"geography and politics of the small community\\".Falkiner (1992) p. 112 Astley built a reputation as a \\"metaphoric\\" writer, resulting in a style that alienated some readers and critics. In an interview with Candida Baker, Astley quotes Helen Garner as saying \\"I simply hate her style\\"Baker (1986) p. 37 and goes on to say \\"I can't resist using imagistic language. I like it. I really don't do it to annoy reviewers\\".Baker (1986) p. 47 In her review of An Item from the Late News, Garner wrote \\"Great story, great characters ... Stylistically, however, this book is like a very handsome, strong and fit woman with too much makeup on ... This kind of writing drives me berserk\\". Despite tepid reception among some, there were also many who admired Astley's writing for both its style and for the subject matter, such as writer Kerryn Goldsworthy, who was quoted as saying, \\"I love its densely woven grammar, its ingrained humour, its uncompromising politics, and its undimmed outrage at human folly, stupidity and greed\\".Goldsworthy (1999) Goldsworthy continues to say that \\"her body of work [over four decades] adds up to a protracted study in the way that full- scale violence and tragedy can flower extravagantly from the withered seeds of malice and resentment ... The perps in Drylands are all her usual suspects: racists, developers, hypocritical gung-ho civic do-gooders, and assorted unreconstructed male-supremacist swine\\". Academic and literary editor, Delys Bird, summarises the author's themes as follows: \\"Astley's novels and stories typically present a sceptical view of social relationships among ordinary people, one often coloured by her former Catholicism, and directed through the struggles of her self-conscious protagonists to find an expressive space within their uncongenial surroundings\\".Bird (2000) p. 187 In several novels, such as A Kindness Cup and The Multiple Effects of Rainshadow, she explores the relationships between white and Indigenous Australian societies. Leigh Dale writes that A Kindness Cup \\"focuses on the massacre of a group of Aborigines and the efforts made to forget and to remember this violence at a town reunion twenty years later, is marked largely by the rage and frustration felt by its central character who seems to mirror Astley's horror at the genial amorality that pervades some rural communities.\\"Dale (1999) Astley found her material in newspaper stories and through her travels, but mostly in the various communities she and her husband lived in. In north Queensland, for example, she \\"found a wealth of stories and 'screwball' characters by listening to people in the small towns and wilderness of the tropics\\".

Graphene is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. The name is a portmanteau of \\"graphite\\" and the suffix -ene, reflecting the fact that the graphite allotrope of carbon consists of stacked graphene layers. Each atom in a graphene sheet is connected to its three nearest neighbors by a œÉ-bond, and contributes one electron to a conduction band that extends over the whole sheet. This is the same type bonding seen in carbon nanotubes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and (partially) in fullerenes and glassy carbon. These conduction bands make graphene a semimetal with unusual electronic properties that are best described by theories for massless relativistic particles. Charge carriers in graphene show linear, rather than quadratic, dependence of energy on momentum, and field-effect transistors with graphene can be made that show bipolar conduction. Charge transport is ballistic over long distances; the material exhibits large quantum oscillations and large and nonlinear diamagnetism. Graphene conducts heat and electricity very efficiently along its plane. The material strongly absorbs light of all visible wavelengths, which accounts for the black color of graphite; yet a single graphene sheet is nearly transparent because of its extreme thinness. The material is also about 100 times stronger than would be the strongest steel of the same thickness. Photograph of a suspended graphene membrane in transmitted light. This one-atom-thick material can be seen with the naked eye because it absorbs approximately 2.3% of light. Scientists have theorized about graphene for decades. It has likely been unknowingly produced in small quantities for centuries, through the use of pencils and other similar applications of graphite. It was originally observed in electron microscopes in 1962, but only studied while supported on metal surfaces. The material was later rediscovered, isolated and characterized in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 for their research on the material. High- quality graphene proved to be surprisingly easy to isolate and dispersion of graphene in water, was achieved for creating conductive patterns and bio- interfacing. The global market for graphene was $9 million in 2012, with most of the demand from research and development in semiconductor, electronics, electric batteries, and composites. In 2019, it was predicted to reach over $150 million by 2021. The IUPAC recommends use of the name \\"graphite\\" for the three-dimensional material, and \\"graphene\\" only when the reactions, structural relations or other properties of individual layers are discussed. A narrower definition, of \\"isolated or free-standing graphene\\" requires that the layer be sufficiently isolated from its environment, but would include layers suspended or transferred to silicon dioxide or silicon carbide. History A lump of graphite, a graphene transistor, and a tape dispenser. Donated to the Nobel Museum in Stockholm by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2010. =Structure of graphite and its intercalation compounds= In 1859 Benjamin Brodie noted the highly lamellar structure of thermally reduced graphite oxide. In 1916, Peter Debije and P. Scherrer determined the structure of graphite by powder X-ray diffraction. The structure was studied in more detail by V. Kohlsch√ºtter and P. Haenni in 1918, who also described the properties of graphite oxide paper. Its structure was determined from single-crystal diffraction in 1924. The theory of graphene was first explored by P. R. Wallace in 1947 as a starting point for understanding the electronic properties of 3D graphite. The emergent massless Dirac equation was first pointed out in 1984 by Gordon Walter Semenoff,David P. DiVincenzo, and Eugene J. Mele. Semenoff emphasized the occurrence in a magnetic field of an electronic Landau level precisely at the Dirac point. This level is responsible for the anomalous integer quantum Hall effect. =Observations of thin graphite layers and related structures= Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of thin graphite samples consisting of a few graphene layers were published by G. Ruess and F. Vogt in 1948.) Eventually, single layers were also observed directly. Single layers of graphite were also observed by transmission electron microscopy within bulk materials, in particular inside soot obtained by chemical exfoliation. In 1961‚Äì1962, Hanns- Peter Boehm published a study of extremely thin flakes of graphite, and coined the term \\"graphene\\" for the hypothetical single-layer structure. This paper reports graphitic flakes that give an additional contrast equivalent of down to ~0.4 nm or 3 atomic layers of amorphous carbon. This was the best possible resolution for 1960 TEMs. However, neither then nor today is it possible to argue how many layers were in those flakes. Now we know that the TEM contrast of graphene most strongly depends on focusing conditions. For example, it is impossible to distinguish between suspended monolayer and multilayer graphene by their TEM contrasts, and the only known way is to analyze the relative intensities of various diffraction spots. The first reliable TEM observations of monolayers are probably given in refs. 24 and 26 of Geim and Novoselov's 2007 review. Starting in the 1970s, C. Oshima and others described single layers of carbon atoms that were grown epitaxially on top of other materials. This \\"epitaxial graphene\\" consists of a single-atom-thick hexagonal lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms, as in free-standing graphene. However, there is significant charge transfer between the two materials, and, in some cases, hybridization between the d-orbitals of the substrate atoms and œÄ orbitals of graphene; which significantly alter the electronic structure compared to that of free-standing graphene. The term \\"graphene\\" was used again in 1987 to describe single sheets of graphite as a constituent of graphite intercalation compounds, which can be seen as crystalline salts of the intercalant and graphene. It was also used in the descriptions of carbon nanotubes by R. Saito in 1992, and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 2000 by S. Wang and others. Efforts to make thin films of graphite by mechanical exfoliation started in 1990. Initial attempts employed exfoliation techniques similar to the drawing method. Multilayer samples down to 10 nm in thickness were obtained. In 2002, Robert B. Rutherford and Richard L. Dudman filed for a patent in the US on a method to produce graphene by repeatedly peeling off layers from a graphite flake adhered to a substrate, achieving a graphite thickness of . The key to success was high-throughput visual recognition of graphene on a properly chosen substrate, which provides a small but noticeable optical contrast. Another U.S. patent was filed in the same year by Bor Z. Jang and Wen C. Huang for a method to produce graphene based on exfoliation followed by attrition. =Full isolation and characterization= Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the Nobel Laureate press conference, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, 2010. Graphene was properly isolated and characterized in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov at the University of Manchester. They pulled graphene layers from graphite with a common adhesive tape in a process called either micromechanical cleavage or the Scotch tape technique. The graphene flakes were then transferred onto thin silicon dioxide (silica) layer on a silicon plate (\\"wafer\\"). The silica electrically isolated the graphene and weakly interacted with it, providing nearly charge-neutral graphene layers. The silicon beneath the could be used as a \\"back gate\\" electrode to vary the charge density in the graphene over a wide range. This work resulted in the two winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 \\"for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.\\" Their publication, and the surprisingly easy preparation method that they described, sparked a \\"graphene gold rush\\". Research expanded and split off into many different subfields, exploring different exceptional properties of the material ‚Äî quantum mechanical, electrical, chemical, mechanical, optical, magnetic, etc.. =Exploring commercial applications= Since the early 2000s, a number of companies and research laboratories have been working to develop commercial applications of graphene. In 2014 a National Graphene Institute was established with that purpose at the University of Manchester, with a 60 million GBP initial funding. In North East England two commercial manufacturers, Applied Graphene Materials and Thomas Swan Limited have begun manufacturing. FGV Cambridge Nanosystems, is a large scale graphene powder production facility in East Anglia. Structure =Bonding= Carbon orbitals 2s, 2px, 2py form the hybrid orbital sp2 with three major lobes at 120¬∞. The remaining orbital, pz, is sticking out of the graphene's plane. Sigma and pi bonds in graphene. Sigma bonds result from an overlap of sp2 hybrid orbitals, whereas pi bonds emerge from tunneling between the protruding pz orbitals. Three of the four outer-shell electrons of each atom in a graphene sheet occupy three sp2 hybrid orbitals ‚Äì a combination of orbitals s, px and py ‚Äî that are shared with the three nearest atoms, forming œÉ-bonds. The length of these bonds is about 0.142 nanometers. The remaining outer-shell electron occupies a pz orbital that is oriented perpendicularly to the plane. These orbitals hybridize together to form two half-filled bands of free-moving electrons, œÄ and œÄ‚àó, which are responsible for most of graphene's notable electronic properties. Recent quantitative estimates of aromatic stabilization and limiting size derived from the enthalpies of hydrogenation (ŒîHhydro) agree well with the literature reports. Graphene sheets stack to form graphite with an interplanar spacing of . Graphene sheets in solid form usually show evidence in diffraction for graphite's (002) layering. This is true of some single-walled nanostructures. However, unlayered graphene with only (hk0) rings has been found in the core of presolar graphite onions. TEM studies show faceting at defects in flat graphene sheets and suggest a role for two- dimensional crystallization from a melt. =Geometry= alt= The hexagonal lattice structure of isolated, single-layer graphene can be directly seen with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of sheets of graphene suspended between bars of a metallic grid Some of these images showed a \\"rippling\\" of the flat sheet, with amplitude of about one nanometer. These ripples may be intrinsic to the material as a result of the instability of two-dimensional crystals, or may originate from the ubiquitous dirt seen in all TEM images of graphene. Photoresist residue, which must be removed to obtain atomic-resolution images, may be the \\"adsorbates\\" observed in TEM images, and may explain the observed rippling. The hexagonal structure is also seen in scanning tunneling microscope (STM) images of graphene supported on silicon dioxide substrates The rippling seen in these images is caused by conformation of graphene to the subtrate's lattice, and is not intrinsic. =Stability= Ab initio calculations show that a graphene sheet is thermodynamically unstable if its size is less than about 20 nm and becomes the most stable fullerene (as within graphite) only for molecules larger than 24,000 atoms. Properties =Electronic= Electronic band structure of graphene. Valence and conduction bands meet at the six vertices of the hexagonal Brillouin zone and form linearly dispersing Dirac cones. Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, because its conduction and valence bands meet at the Dirac points. The Dirac points are six locations in momentum space, on the edge of the Brillouin zone, divided into two non-equivalent sets of three points. The two sets are labeled K and K'. The sets give graphene a valley degeneracy of . By contrast, for traditional semiconductors the primary point of interest is generally Œì, where momentum is zero. Four electronic properties separate it from other condensed matter systems. However, if the in-plane direction is no longer infinite, but confined, its electronic structure would change. They are referred to as graphene nanoribbons. If it is \\"zig-zag\\", the bandgap would still be zero. If it is \\"armchair\\", the bandgap would be non-zero (see figure). Graphene's hexagonal lattice can be regarded as two interleaving triangular lattices. This perspective was successfully used to calculate the band structure for a single graphite layer using a tight-binding approximation. Electronic spectrum Electrons propagating through graphene's honeycomb lattice effectively lose their mass, producing quasi-particles that are described by a 2D analogue of the Dirac equation rather than the Schr√∂dinger equation for spin- particles. Dispersion relation doping220x220px The cleavage technique led directly to the first observation of the anomalous quantum Hall effect in graphene in 2005, by Geim's group and by Philip Kim and Yuanbo Zhang. This effect provided direct evidence of graphene's theoretically predicted Berry's phase of massless Dirac fermions and the first proof of the Dirac fermion nature of electrons. These effects had been observed in bulk graphite by Yakov Kopelevich, Igor A. Luk'yanchuk, and others, in 2003‚Äì2004. When the atoms are placed onto the graphene hexagonal lattice, the overlap between the pz(œÄ) orbitals and the s or the px and py orbitals is zero by symmetry. The pz electrons forming the œÄ bands in graphene can therefore be treated independently. Within this œÄ-band approximation, using a conventional tight-binding model, the dispersion relation (restricted to first-nearest- neighbor interactions only) that produces energy of the electrons with wave vector k is :E(k_x,k_y)=\\\\pm\\\\,\\\\gamma_0\\\\sqrt{1+4\\\\cos^2{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}ak_x}+4\\\\cos{\\\\tfrac{1}{2}ak_x} \\\\cdot \\\\cos{\\\\tfrac{\\\\sqrt{3}}{2}ak_y}} with the nearest-neighbor (œÄ orbitals) hopping energy Œ≥0 ‚âà and the lattice constant . The conduction and valence bands, respectively, correspond to the different signs. With one pz electron per atom in this model the valence band is fully occupied, while the conduction band is vacant. The two bands touch at the zone corners (the K point in the Brillouin zone), where there is a zero density of states but no band gap. The graphene sheet thus displays a semimetallic (or zero-gap semiconductor) character, although the same cannot be said of a graphene sheet rolled into a carbon nanotube, due to its curvature. Two of the six Dirac points are independent, while the rest are equivalent by symmetry. In the vicinity of the K-points the energy depends linearly on the wave vector, similar to a relativistic particle. Since an elementary cell of the lattice has a basis of two atoms, the wave function has an effective 2-spinor structure. As a consequence, at low energies, even neglecting the true spin, the electrons can be described by an equation that is formally equivalent to the massless Dirac equation. Hence, the electrons and holes are called Dirac fermions. This pseudo-relativistic description is restricted to the chiral limit, i.e., to vanishing rest mass M0, which leads to interesting additional features: :v_F\\\\, \\\\vec \\\\sigma \\\\cdot abla \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\,=\\\\,E\\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}). Here vF ~ (.003 c) is the Fermi velocity in graphene, which replaces the velocity of light in the Dirac theory; \\\\vec{\\\\sigma} is the vector of the Pauli matrices, \\\\psi(\\\\mathbf{r}) is the two-component wave function of the electrons, and E is their energy. The equation describing the electrons' linear dispersion relation is :E(q)=\\\\hbar v_F q where the wavevector q is measured from the Brillouin zone vertex K, q=\\\\left\\\\mathbf{k}-\\\\mathrm{K}\\\\right, and the zero of energy is set to coincide with the Dirac point. The equation uses a pseudospin matrix formula that describes two sublattices of the honeycomb lattice. Single-atom wave propagation Electron waves in graphene propagate within a single-atom layer, making them sensitive to the proximity of other materials such as high-Œ∫ dielectrics, superconductors and ferromagnetics. Ambipolar electron and hole transport When the gate voltage in a field effect graphene device is changed from positive to negative, conduction switches from electrons to holes. The charge carrier concentration is proportional to the applied voltage. Graphene is neutral at zero gate voltage and resistivity is at its maximum because of the dearth of charge carriers. The rapid fall of resistivity when carriers are injected shows their high mobility, here of the order of 5000 cm2/Vs. n-Si/SiO‚ÇÇ substrate, T=1K. Graphene displays remarkable electron mobility at room temperature, with reported values in excess of . Hole and electron mobilities are nearly the same. The mobility is independent of temperature between and , and shows little change even at room temperature (300 K), which implies that the dominant scattering mechanism is defect scattering. Scattering by graphene's acoustic phonons intrinsically limits room temperature mobility in freestanding graphene to at a carrier density of . The corresponding resistivity of graphene sheets would be . This is less than the resistivity of silver, the lowest otherwise known at room temperature.Physicists Show Electrons Can Travel More Than 100 Times Faster in Graphene :: University Communications Newsdesk, University of Maryland . Newsdesk.umd.edu (24 March 2008). Retrieved on 2014-01-12. However, on substrates, scattering of electrons by optical phonons of the substrate is a larger effect than scattering by graphene's own phonons. This limits mobility to . Charge transport has major concerns due to adsorption of contaminants such as water and oxygen molecules. This leads to non-repetitive and large hysteresis I-V characteristics. Researchers must carry out electrical measurements in vacuum. The protection of graphene surface by a coating with materials such as SiN, PMMA, h-BN, etc., have been discussed by researchers. In January 2015, the first stable graphene device operation in air over several weeks was reported, for graphene whose surface was protected by aluminum oxide. In 2015 lithium-coated graphene exhibited superconductivity, a first for graphene. Electrical resistance in 40-nanometer-wide nanoribbons of epitaxial graphene changes in discrete steps. The ribbons' conductance exceeds predictions by a factor of 10. The ribbons can act more like optical waveguides or quantum dots, allowing electrons to flow smoothly along the ribbon edges. In copper, resistance increases in proportion to length as electrons encounter impurities. Transport is dominated by two modes. One is ballistic and temperature independent, while the other is thermally activated. Ballistic electrons resemble those in cylindrical carbon nanotubes. At room temperature, resistance increases abruptly at a particular length‚Äîthe ballistic mode at 16 micrometres and the other at 160 nanometres (1% of the former length). Graphene electrons can cover micrometer distances without scattering, even at room temperature. Despite zero carrier density near the Dirac points, graphene exhibits a minimum conductivity on the order of 4e^2/h. The origin of this minimum conductivity is still unclear. However, rippling of the graphene sheet or ionized impurities in the substrate may lead to local puddles of carriers that allow conduction. Several theories suggest that the minimum conductivity should be 4e^2/{(\\\\pi}h); however, most measurements are of order 4e^2/h or greater and depend on impurity concentration. Near zero carrier density graphene exhibits positive photoconductivity and negative photoconductivity at high carrier density. This is governed by the interplay between photoinduced changes of both the Drude weight and the carrier scattering rate.Light pulses control how graphene conducts electricity. kurzweilai.net. 4 August 2014 Graphene doped with various gaseous species (both acceptors and donors) can be returned to an undoped state by gentle heating in vacuum. Even for dopant concentrations in excess of 1012 cm‚àí2 carrier mobility exhibits no observable change. Graphene doped with potassium in ultra-high vacuum at low temperature can reduce mobility 20-fold. The mobility reduction is reversible on heating the graphene to remove the potassium. Due to graphene's two dimensions, charge fractionalization (where the apparent charge of individual pseudoparticles in low-dimensional systems is less than a single quantum) is thought to occur. It may therefore be a suitable material for constructing quantum computers using anyonic circuits. Chiral half-integer quantum Hall effect Landau levels in graphene appear at energies proportional to ‚àöN, in contrast to the standard sequence that goes as N+¬Ω. The quantum Hall effect is a quantum mechanical version of the Hall effect, which is the production of transverse (perpendicular to the main current) conductivity in the presence of a magnetic field. The quantization of the Hall effect \\\\sigma_{xy} at integer multiples (the \\"Landau level\\") of the basic quantity e^2/h (where e is the elementary electric charge and h is Planck's constant). It can usually be observed only in very clean silicon or gallium arsenide solids at temperatures around and very high magnetic fields. Graphene shows the quantum Hall effect with respect to conductivity quantization: the effect is unordinary in that the sequence of steps is shifted by 1/2 with respect to the standard sequence and with an additional factor of 4. Graphene's Hall conductivity is \\\\sigma_{xy}=\\\\pm {4\\\\cdot\\\\left(N + 1/2 \\\\right)e^2}/h , where N is the Landau level and the double valley and double spin degeneracies give the factor of 4. These anomalies are present not only at extremely low temperatures but also at room temperature, i.e. at roughly . This behavior is a direct result of graphene's chiral, massless Dirac electrons. In a magnetic field, their spectrum has a Landau level with energy precisely at the Dirac point. This level is a consequence of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem and is half-filled in neutral graphene, leading to the \\"+1/2\\" in the Hall conductivity. Bilayer graphene also shows the quantum Hall effect, but with only one of the two anomalies (i.e. \\\\sigma_{xy}=\\\\pm {4\\\\cdot N\\\\cdot e^2}/h ). In the second anomaly, the first plateau at N=0 is absent, indicating that bilayer graphene stays metallic at the neutrality point. Chiral half-integer quantum Hall effect in graphene. Plateaux in transverse conductivity appear at half integers of 4e¬≤/h. Unlike normal metals, graphene's longitudinal resistance shows maxima rather than minima for integral values of the Landau filling factor in measurements of the Shubnikov‚Äìde Haas oscillations, whereby the term integral quantum Hall effect. These oscillations show a phase shift of œÄ, known as Berry's phase. Berry's phase arises due to chirality or dependence (locking) of the pseudospin quantum number on momentum of low-energy electrons near the Dirac points. The temperature dependence of the oscillations reveals that the carriers have a non-zero cyclotron mass, despite their zero effective mass in the Dirac-fermion formalism. Graphene samples prepared on nickel films, and on both the silicon face and carbon face of silicon carbide, show the anomalous effect directly in electrical measurements. Graphitic layers on the carbon face of silicon carbide show a clear Dirac spectrum in angle-resolved photoemission experiments, and the effect is observed in cyclotron resonance and tunneling experiments. Strong magnetic fields In magnetic fields above 10 tesla or so additional plateaus of the Hall conductivity at with are observed. A plateau at and the fractional quantum Hall effect at were also reported. These observations with indicate that the four-fold degeneracy (two valley and two spin degrees of freedom) of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted. Casimir effect The Casimir effect is an interaction between disjoint neutral bodies provoked by the fluctuations of the electrodynamical vacuum. Mathematically it can be explained by considering the normal modes of electromagnetic fields, which explicitly depend on the boundary (or matching) conditions on the interacting bodies' surfaces. Since graphene/electromagnetic field interaction is strong for a one-atom-thick material, the Casimir effect is of growing interest. Van der Waals force The Van der Waals force (or dispersion force) is also unusual, obeying an inverse cubic, asymptotic power law in contrast to the usual inverse quartic. 'Massive' electrons Graphene's unit cell has two identical carbon atoms and two zero-energy states: one in which the electron resides on atom A, the other in which the electron resides on atom B. However, if the two atoms in the unit cell are not identical, the situation changes. Hunt et al. show that placing hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in contact with graphene can alter the potential felt at atom A versus atom B enough that the electrons develop a mass and accompanying band gap of about 30 meV [0.03 Electron Volt(eV)]. The mass can be positive or negative. An arrangement that slightly raises the energy of an electron on atom A relative to atom B gives it a positive mass, while an arrangement that raises the energy of atom B produces a negative electron mass. The two versions behave alike and are indistinguishable via optical spectroscopy. An electron traveling from a positive-mass region to a negative-mass region must cross an intermediate region where its mass once again becomes zero. This region is gapless and therefore metallic. Metallic modes bounding semiconducting regions of opposite-sign mass is a hallmark of a topological phase and display much the same physics as topological insulators. If the mass in graphene can be controlled, electrons can be confined to massless regions by surrounding them with massive regions, allowing the patterning of quantum dots, wires, and other mesoscopic structures. It also produces one-dimensional conductors along the boundary. These wires would be protected against backscattering and could carry currents without dissipation. =Permittivity= Graphene's permittivity varies with frequency. Over a range from microwave to millimeter wave frequencies it is roughly 3.3. This permittivity, combined with the ability to form both conductors and insulators, means that theoretically, compact capacitors made of graphene could store large amounts of electrical energy. =Optical= Graphene's unique optical properties produce an unexpectedly high opacity for an atomic monolayer in vacuum, absorbing of light, from visible to infrared. Here, Œ± is the fine-structure constant. This is a consequence of the \\"unusual low-energy electronic structure of monolayer graphene that features electron and hole conical bands meeting each other at the Dirac point... [which] is qualitatively different from more common quadratic massive bands.\\" Based on the Slonczewski‚ÄìWeiss‚ÄìMcClure (SWMcC) band model of graphite, the interatomic distance, hopping value and frequency cancel when optical conductance is calculated using Fresnel equations in the thin-film limit. Although confirmed experimentally, the measurement is not precise enough to improve on other techniques for determining the fine- structure constant. Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance was used to characterize both thickness and refractive index of chemical-vapor-deposition (CVD)-grown graphene films. The measured refractive index and extinction coefficient values at wavelength are 3.135 and 0.897, respectively. The thickness was determined as 3.7√Ö from a 0.5mm area, which agrees with 3.35√Ö reported for layer-to-layer carbon atom distance of graphite crystals. The method can be further used also for real-time label-free interactions of graphene with organic and inorganic substances. Furthermore, the existence of unidirectional surface plasmons in the nonreciprocal graphene-based gyrotropic interfaces has been demonstrated theoretically. By efficiently controlling the chemical potential of graphene, the unidirectional working frequency can be continuously tunable from THz to near-infrared and even visible. Particularly, the unidirectional frequency bandwidth can be 1‚Äì 2 orders of magnitude larger than that in metal under the same magnetic field, which arises from the superiority of extremely small effective electron mass in graphene. Graphene's band gap can be tuned from 0 to (about 5 micrometre wavelength) by applying voltage to a dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor (FET) at room temperature. The optical response of graphene nanoribbons is tunable into the terahertz regime by an applied magnetic field. Graphene/graphene oxide systems exhibit electrochromic behavior, allowing tuning of both linear and ultrafast optical properties. A graphene-based Bragg grating (one-dimensional photonic crystal) has been fabricated and demonstrated its capability for excitation of surface electromagnetic waves in the periodic structure by using He‚ÄìNe laser as the light source. Saturable absorption Such unique absorption could become saturated when the input optical intensity is above a threshold value. This nonlinear optical behavior is termed saturable absorption and the threshold value is called the saturation fluence. Graphene can be saturated readily under strong excitation over the visible to near-infrared region, due to the universal optical absorption and zero band gap. This has relevance for the mode locking of fiber lasers, where fullband mode locking has been achieved by graphene-based saturable absorber. Due to this special property, graphene has wide application in ultrafast photonics. Moreover, the optical response of graphene/graphene oxide layers can be tuned electrically. Saturable absorption in graphene could occur at the Microwave and Terahertz band, owing to its wideband optical absorption property. The microwave saturable absorption in graphene demonstrates the possibility of graphene microwave and terahertz photonics devices, such as a microwave saturable absorber, modulator, polarizer, microwave signal processing and broad-band wireless access networks. Nonlinear Kerr effect Under more intensive laser illumination, graphene could also possess a nonlinear phase shift due to the optical nonlinear Kerr effect. Based on a typical open and close aperture z-scan measurement, graphene possesses a giant nonlinear Kerr coefficient of , almost nine orders of magnitude larger than that of bulk dielectrics. This suggests that graphene may be a powerful nonlinear Kerr medium, with the possibility of observing a variety of nonlinear effects, the most important of which is the soliton. =Excitonic= First-principle calculations with quasiparticle corrections and many-body effects are performed to study the electronic and optical properties of graphene-based materials. The approach is described as three stages. With GW calculation, the properties of graphene- based materials are accurately investigated, including bulk graphene, nanoribbons, edge and surface functionalized armchair oribbons, hydrogen saturated armchair ribbons, Josephson effect in graphene SNS junctions with single localized defect and armchair ribbon scaling properties. =Spin transport= Graphene is claimed to be an ideal material for spintronics due to its small spin-orbit interaction and the near absence of nuclear magnetic moments in carbon (as well as a weak hyperfine interaction). Electrical spin current injection and detection has been demonstrated up to room temperature. Spin coherence length above 1 micrometre at room temperature was observed, and control of the spin current polarity with an electrical gate was observed at low temperature. =Magnetic properties= Strong magnetic fields Graphene's quantum Hall effect in magnetic fields above 10 Teslas or so reveals additional interesting features. Additional plateaus of the Hall conductivity at \\\\sigma_{xy}= u e^2/h with u=0,\\\\pm {1},\\\\pm {4} are observed. Also, the observation of a plateau at u=3 and the fractional quantum Hall effect at u=1/3 were reported. These observations with u=0,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 3, \\\\pm 4 indicate that the four-fold degeneracy (two valley and two spin degrees of freedom) of the Landau energy levels is partially or completely lifted. One hypothesis is that the magnetic catalysis of symmetry breaking is responsible for lifting the degeneracy. Spintronic and magnetic properties can be present in graphene simultaneously. Low-defect graphene nanomeshes manufactured by using a non-lithographic method exhibit large-amplitude ferromagnetism even at room temperature. Additionally a spin pumping effect is found for fields applied in parallel with the planes of few-layer ferromagnetic nanomeshes, while a magnetoresistance hysteresis loop is observed under perpendicular fields. Magnetic substrates In 2014 researchers magnetized graphene by placing it on an atomically smooth layer of magnetic yttrium iron garnet. The graphene's electronic properties were unaffected. Prior approaches involved doping graphene with other substances.T. Hashimoto, S. Kamikawa, Y. Yagi, J. Haruyama, H. Yang, M. Chshiev, \\"Graphene edge spins: spintronics and magnetism in graphene nanomeshes\\", February 2014, Volume 5, Issue 1, pp 25 The dopant's presence negatively affected its electronic properties. =Thermal conductivity= Thermal transport in graphene is an active area of research, which has attracted attention because of the potential for thermal management applications. Following predictions for graphene and related carbon nanotubes, early measurements of the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene reported an exceptionally large thermal conductivity up to , compared with the thermal conductivity of pyrolytic graphite of approximately at room temperature. However, later studies primarily on more scalable but more defected graphene derived by Chemical Vapor Deposition have been unable to reproduce such high thermal conductivity measurements, producing a wide range of thermal conductivities between ‚Äì for suspended single layer graphene . The large range in the reported thermal conductivity can be caused by large measurement uncertainties as well as variations in the graphene quality and processing conditions. In addition, it is known that when single-layer graphene is supported on an amorphous material, the thermal conductivity is reduced to about ‚Äì at room temperature as a result of scattering of graphene lattice waves by the substrate, and can be even lower for few layer graphene encased in amorphous oxide. Likewise, polymeric residue can contribute to a similar decrease in the thermal conductivity of suspended graphene to approximately ‚Äì for bilayer graphene. It has been suggested that the isotopic composition, the ratio of 12C to 13C, has a significant impact on the thermal conductivity. For example, isotopically pure 12C graphene has higher thermal conductivity than either a 50:50 isotope ratio or the naturally occurring 99:1 ratio. Lay summary: It can be shown by using the Wiedemann‚ÄìFranz law, that the thermal conduction is phonon-dominated. However, for a gated graphene strip, an applied gate bias causing a Fermi energy shift much larger than kBT can cause the electronic contribution to increase and dominate over the phonon contribution at low temperatures. The ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is isotropic. Potential for this high conductivity can be seen by considering graphite, a 3D version of graphene that has basal plane thermal conductivity of over a (comparable to diamond). In graphite, the c-axis (out of plane) thermal conductivity is over a factor of ~100 smaller due to the weak binding forces between basal planes as well as the larger lattice spacing. In addition, the ballistic thermal conductance of graphene is shown to give the lower limit of the ballistic thermal conductances, per unit circumference, length of carbon nanotubes. Despite its 2-D nature, graphene has 3 acoustic phonon modes. The two in-plane modes (LA, TA) have a linear dispersion relation, whereas the out of plane mode (ZA) has a quadratic dispersion relation. Due to this, the T2 dependent thermal conductivity contribution of the linear modes is dominated at low temperatures by the T1.5 contribution of the out of plane mode. Some graphene phonon bands display negative Gr√ºneisen parameters. At low temperatures (where most optical modes with positive Gr√ºneisen parameters are still not excited) the contribution from the negative Gr√ºneisen parameters will be dominant and thermal expansion coefficient (which is directly proportional to Gr√ºneisen parameters) negative. The lowest negative Gr√ºneisen parameters correspond to the lowest transverse acoustic ZA modes. Phonon frequencies for such modes increase with the in- plane lattice parameter since atoms in the layer upon stretching will be less free to move in the z direction. This is similar to the behavior of a string, which, when it is stretched, will have vibrations of smaller amplitude and higher frequency. This phenomenon, named \\"membrane effect,\\" was predicted by Lifshitz in 1952. =Mechanical= The (two-dimensional) density of graphene is 0.763 mg per square meter. Graphene is the strongest material ever tested, with an intrinsic tensile strength of (with representative engineering tensile strength ~50-60 GPa for stretching large-area freestanding graphene) and a Young's modulus (stiffness) close to . The Nobel announcement illustrated this by saying that a 1 square meter graphene hammock would support a cat but would weigh only as much as one of the cat's whiskers, at (about 0.001% of the weight of of paper). Large-angle-bent graphene monolayer has been achieved with negligible strain, showing mechanical robustness of the two-dimensional carbon nanostructure. Even with extreme deformation, excellent carrier mobility in monolayer graphene can be preserved. The spring constant of suspended graphene sheets has been measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM). Graphene sheets were suspended over cavities where an AFM tip was used to apply a stress to the sheet to test its mechanical properties. Its spring constant was in the range 1‚Äì5 N/m and the stiffness was , which differs from that of bulk graphite. These intrinsic properties could lead to applications such as NEMS as pressure sensors and resonators. Due to its large surface energy and out of plane ductility, flat graphene sheets are unstable with respect to scrolling, i.e. bending into a cylindrical shape, which is its lower-energy state. As is true of all materials, regions of graphene are subject to thermal and quantum fluctuations in relative displacement. Although the amplitude of these fluctuations is bounded in 3D structures (even in the limit of infinite size), the Mermin‚ÄìWagner theorem shows that the amplitude of long-wavelength fluctuations grows logarithmically with the scale of a 2D structure, and would therefore be unbounded in structures of infinite size. Local deformation and elastic strain are negligibly affected by this long- range divergence in relative displacement. It is believed that a sufficiently large 2D structure, in the absence of applied lateral tension, will bend and crumple to form a fluctuating 3D structure. Researchers have observed ripples in suspended layers of graphene, and it has been proposed that the ripples are caused by thermal fluctuations in the material. As a consequence of these dynamical deformations, it is debatable whether graphene is truly a 2D structure. It has recently been shown that these ripples, if amplified through the introduction of vacancy defects, can impart a negative Poisson's ratio into graphene, resulting in the thinnest auxetic material known so far. Graphene nanosheets have been incorporated into a Ni matrix through a plating process to form Ni-graphene composites on a target substrate. The enhancement in mechanical properties of the composites is attributed to the high interaction between Ni and graphene and the prevention of the dislocation sliding in the Ni matrix by the graphene. Fracture toughness In 2014, researchers from Rice University and the Georgia Institute of Technology have indicated that despite its strength, graphene is also relatively brittle, with a fracture toughness of about 4 MPa‚àöm. This indicates that imperfect graphene is likely to crack in a brittle manner like ceramic materials, as opposed to many metallic materials which tend to have fracture toughnesses in the range of 15‚Äì50 MPa‚àöm. Later in 2014, the Rice team announced that graphene showed a greater ability to distribute force from an impact than any known material, ten times that of steel per unit weight. The force was transmitted at . Polycrystalline graphene Various methods ‚Äì most notably, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as discussed in the section below - have been developed to produce large-scale graphene needed for device applications. Such methods often synthesize polycrystalline graphene. The mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene is affected by the nature of the defects, such as grain-boundaries (GB) and vacancies, present in the system and the average grain-size. How the mechanical properties change with such defects have been investigated by researchers, theoretically and experimentally. Graphene grain boundaries typically contain heptagon-pentagon pairs. The arrangement of such defects depends on whether the GB is in zig-zag or armchair direction. It further depends on the tilt-angle of the GB. In 2010, researchers from Brown University computationally predicted that as the tilt-angle increases, the grain boundary strength also increases.They showed that the weakest link in the grain boundary is at the critical bonds of the heptagon rings. As the grain boundary angle increases, the strain in these heptagon rings decreases, causing the grain-boundary to be stronger than lower-angle GBs. They proposed that, in fact, for sufficiently large angle GB, the strength of the GB is similar to pristine graphene. In 2012, it was further shown that the strength can increase or decrease, depending on the detailed arrangements of the defects. These predictions have since been supported by experimental evidences. In a 2013 study led by James Hone's group, researchers probed the elastic stiffness and strength of CVD-grown graphene by combining nano- indentation and high-resolution TEM. They found that the elastic stiffness is identical and strength is only slightly lower than those in pristine graphene. In the same year, researchers from UC Berkeley and UCLA probed bi-crystalline graphene with TEM and AFM. They found that the strength of grain-boundaries indeed tend to increase with the tilt angle. While the presence of vacancies is not only prevalent in polycrystalline graphene, vacancies can have significant effects on the strength of graphene. The general consensus is that the strength decreases along with increasing densities of vacancies. In fact, various studies have shown that for graphene with sufficiently low density of vacancies, the strength does not vary significantly from that of pristine graphene. On the other hand, high density of vacancies can severely reduce the strength of graphene. Compared to the fairly well-understood nature of the effect that grain boundary and vacancies have on the mechanical properties of graphene, there is no clear consensus on the general effect that the average grain size has on the strength of polycrystalline graphene. In fact, three notable theoretical/computational studies on this topic have led to three different conclusions. First, in 2012, Kotakoski and Myer studied the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with \\"realistic atomistic model\\", using molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation. To emulate the growth mechanism of CVD, they first randomly selected nucleation sites that are at least 5A (arbitrarily chosen) apart from other sites. Polycrystalline graphene was generated from these nucleation sites and was subsequently annealed at 3000K, then quenched. Based on this model, they found that cracks are initiated at grain-boundary junctions, but the grain size does not significantly affect the strength. Second, in 2013, Z. Song et al. used MD simulations to study the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene with uniform-sized hexagon-shaped grains. The hexagon grains were oriented in various lattice directions and the GBs consisted of only heptagon, pentagon, and hexagonal carbon rings. The motivation behind such model was that similar systems had been experimentally observed in graphene flakes grown on the surface of liquid copper. While they also noted that crack is typically initiated at the triple junctions, they found that as the grain size decreases, the yield strength of graphene increases. Based on this finding, they proposed that polycrystalline follows pseudo Hall-Petch relationship. Third, in 2013, Z. D. Sha et al. studied the effect of grain size on the properties of polycrystalline graphene, by modelling the grain patches using Voronoi construction. The GBs in this model consisted of heptagon, pentagon, and hexagon, as well as squares, octagons, and vacancies. Through MD simulation, contrary to the fore-mentioned study, they found inverse Hall- Petch relationship, where the strength of graphene increases as the grain size increases. Experimental observations and other theoretical predictions also gave differing conclusions, similar to the three given above. Such discrepancies show the complexity of the effects that grain size, arrangements of defects, and the nature of defects have on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline graphene. =Chemical= Graphene has a theoretical specific surface area (SSA) of . This is much larger than that reported to date for carbon black (typically smaller than ) or for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), from ‚âà100 to and is similar to activated carbon. Graphene is the only form of carbon (or solid material) in which every atom is available for chemical reaction from two sides (due to the 2D structure). Atoms at the edges of a graphene sheet have special chemical reactivity. Graphene has the highest ratio of edge atoms of any allotrope. Defects within a sheet increase its chemical reactivity. The onset temperature of reaction between the basal plane of single-layer graphene and oxygen gas is below . Graphene burns at very low temperature (e.g., ). Graphene is commonly modified with oxygen- and nitrogen- containing functional groups and analyzed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. However, determination of structures of graphene with oxygen- and nitrogen- functional groups requires the structures to be well controlled. In 2013, Stanford University physicists reported that single- layer graphene is a hundred times more chemically reactive than thicker multilayer sheets. Graphene can self-repair holes in its sheets, when exposed to molecules containing carbon, such as hydrocarbons. Bombarded with pure carbon atoms, the atoms perfectly align into hexagons, completely filling the holes. =Biological= The Cambridge Graphene Centre and the University of Trieste in Italy conducted a collaborative research on use of Graphene as electrodes to interact with brain neurons. It is shown that applying conductive graphene patterns on flexible substrates can enable the study on neuronal cells by resolving the reported mechanical mismatch between biosensors and the soft cell membrane. Researchers have shown that aqueous graphene patterns do not hinder the viability of dopaminergic neuronal cells, and can be used as an interface for establishing a reliable communication pathway with the neuronal networks. Researchers at the Graphene Research Centre at the National University of Singapore (NUS) discovered in 2011 the ability of graphene to accelerate the osteogenic differentiation of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells without the use of biochemical inducers. In 2015 researchers used graphene to create sensitive biosensors by using epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide. The sensors bind to the 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and is capable of selective binding with antibodies. The presence of 8-OHdG in blood, urine and saliva is commonly associated with DNA damage. Elevated levels of 8-OHdG have been linked to increased risk of developing several cancers. The research revealed that uncoated Graphene can be used as neuro-interface electrode without altering or damaging the neural functions such as signal loss or formation of scar tissue. Graphene electrodes in body stay significantly more stable than modern day electrodes (of tungsten or silicon) because of its unique properties such as flexibility, bio- compatibility, and conductivity. Despite the promising results in different cell studies and proof of concept studies, there is still incomplete understanding of the full biocompatibility of graphene based materials. Different cell lines react differently when exposed to graphene, and it has been shown that the lateral size of the graphene flakes, the form and surface chemistry can elicit different biological responses on the same cell line. =Support substrate= The electronics property of graphene can be significantly influenced by the supporting substrate. Studies of graphene monolayers on clean and hydrogen(H)-passivated silicon (100) (Si(100)/H) surfaces have been performed. The Si(100)/H surface does not perturb the electronic properties of graphene, whereas the interaction between the clean Si(100) surface and graphene changes the electronic states of graphene significantly. This effect results from the covalent bonding between C and surface Si atoms, modifying the œÄ-orbital network of the graphene layer. The local density of states shows that the bonded C and Si surface states are highly disturbed near the Fermi energy. Forms =Monolayer sheets= In 2013 a group of Polish scientists presented a production unit that allows the manufacture of continuous monolayer sheets. The process is based on graphene growth on a liquid metal matrix. The product of this process was called HSMG. =Bilayer graphene= Bilayer graphene displays the anomalous quantum Hall effect, a tunable band gap and potential for excitonic condensation ‚Äìmaking it a promising candidate for optoelectronic and nanoelectronic applications. Bilayer graphene typically can be found either in twisted configurations where the two layers are rotated relative to each other or graphitic Bernal stacked configurations where half the atoms in one layer lie atop half the atoms in the other. Stacking order and orientation govern the optical and electronic properties of bilayer graphene. One way to synthesize bilayer graphene is via chemical vapor deposition, which can produce large bilayer regions that almost exclusively conform to a Bernal stack geometry. It has been shown that the two graphene layers can withstand important strain or doping mistmach which ultimately should lead to their exfoliation. =Graphene superlattices= Periodically stacked graphene and its insulating isomorph provide a fascinating structural element in implementing highly functional superlattices at the atomic scale, which offers possibilities in designing nanoelectronic and photonic devices. Various types of superlattices can be obtained by stacking graphene and its related forms. The energy band in layer-stacked superlattices is found to be more sensitive to the barrier width than that in conventional III‚ÄìV semiconductor superlattices. When adding more than one atomic layer to the barrier in each period, the coupling of electronic wavefunctions in neighboring potential wells can be significantly reduced, which leads to the degeneration of continuous subbands into quantized energy levels. When varying the well width, the energy levels in the potential wells along the L-M direction behave distinctly from those along the K-H direction. =Graphene nanoribbons= Names for graphene edge topologies GNR Electronic band structure of graphene strips of varying widths in zig-zag orientation. Tight-binding calculations show that they are all metallic. GNR Electronic band structure of grahene strips of various widths in the armchair orientation. Tight-binding calculations show that they are semiconducting or metallic depending on width (chirality). Graphene nanoribbons (\\"nanostripes\\" in the \\"zig-zag\\" orientation), at low temperatures, show spin-polarized metallic edge currents, which also suggests applications in the new field of spintronics. (In the \\"armchair\\" orientation, the edges behave like semiconductors.) =Graphene quantum dots= A graphene quantum dot (GQD) is a graphene fragment with size less than 100 nm. The properties of GQDs are different from 'bulk' graphene due to the quantum confinement effects which is only become apparent when size is smaller than 100 nm. =Graphene oxide= Using paper-making techniques on dispersed, oxidized and chemically processed graphite in water, the monolayer flakes form a single sheet and create strong bonds. These sheets, called graphene oxide paper, have a measured tensile modulus of 32 GPa. The chemical property of graphite oxide is related to the functional groups attached to graphene sheets. These can change the polymerization pathway and similar chemical processes. Graphene oxide flakes in polymers display enhanced photo-conducting properties. Graphene is normally hydrophobic and impermeable to all gases and liquids (vacuum-tight). However, when formed into graphene oxide-based capillary membrane, both liquid water and water vapor flow through as quickly as if the membrane was not present. =Chemical modification= Photograph of single-layer graphene oxide undergoing high temperature chemical treatment, resulting in sheet folding and loss of carboxylic functionality, or through room temperature carbodiimide treatment, collapsing into star-like clusters. Soluble fragments of graphene can be prepared in the laboratory through chemical modification of graphite. First, microcrystalline graphite is treated with an acidic mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid. A series of oxidation and exfoliation steps produce small graphene plates with carboxyl groups at their edges. These are converted to acid chloride groups by treatment with thionyl chloride; next, they are converted to the corresponding graphene amide via treatment with octadecylamine. The resulting material (circular graphene layers of thickness) is soluble in tetrahydrofuran, tetrachloromethane and dichloroethane. Refluxing single-layer graphene oxide (SLGO) in solvents leads to size reduction and folding of individual sheets as well as loss of carboxylic group functionality, by up to 20%, indicating thermal instabilities of SLGO sheets dependent on their preparation methodology. When using thionyl chloride, acyl chloride groups result, which can then form aliphatic and aromatic amides with a reactivity conversion of around 70‚Äì80%. Boehm titration results for various chemical reactions of single-layer graphene oxide, which reveal reactivity of the carboxylic groups and the resultant stability of the SLGO sheets after treatment. Hydrazine reflux is commonly used for reducing SLGO to SLG(R), but titrations show that only around 20‚Äì30% of the carboxylic groups are lost, leaving a significant number available for chemical attachment. Analysis of SLG(R) generated by this route reveals that the system is unstable and using a room temperature stirring with HCl (< 1.0 M) leads to around 60% loss of COOH functionality. Room temperature treatment of SLGO with carbodiimides leads to the collapse of the individual sheets into star-like clusters that exhibited poor subsequent reactivity with amines (c. 3‚Äì5% conversion of the intermediate to the final amide). It is apparent that conventional chemical treatment of carboxylic groups on SLGO generates morphological changes of individual sheets that leads to a reduction in chemical reactivity, which may potentially limit their use in composite synthesis. Therefore, chemical reactions types have been explored. SLGO has also been grafted with polyallylamine, cross-linked through epoxy groups. When filtered into graphene oxide paper, these composites exhibit increased stiffness and strength relative to unmodified graphene oxide paper. Full hydrogenation from both sides of graphene sheet results in graphane, but partial hydrogenation leads to hydrogenated graphene. Similarly, both-side fluorination of graphene (or chemical and mechanical exfoliation of graphite fluoride) leads to fluorographene (graphene fluoride), while partial fluorination (generally halogenation) provides fluorinated (halogenated) graphene. =Graphene ligand/complex= Graphene can be a ligand to coordinate metals and metal ions by introducing functional groups. Structures of graphene ligands are similar to e.g. metal-porphyrin complex, metal-phthalocyanine complex, and metal-phenanthroline complex. Copper and nickel ions can be coordinated with graphene ligands. =Graphene fiber= In 2011, researchers reported a novel yet simple approach to fabricate graphene fibers from chemical vapor deposition grown graphene films. The method was scalable and controllable, delivering tunable morphology and pore structure by controlling the evaporation of solvents with suitable surface tension. Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors based on this graphene fibers were demonstrated in 2013. In 2015 intercalating small graphene fragments into the gaps formed by larger, coiled graphene sheets, after annealing provided pathways for conduction, while the fragments helped reinforce the fibers. The resulting fibers offered better thermal and electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. Thermal conductivity reached , while tensile strength reached . In 2016, Kilometer-scale continuous graphene fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and excellent electrical conductivity are produced by high-throughput wet-spinning of graphene oxide liquid crystals followed by graphitization through a full-scale synergetic defect-engineering strategy. The graphene fibers with superior performances promise wide applications in functional textiles, lightweight motors, microelectronic devices, etc. Tsinghua University in Beijing, led by Wei Fei of the Department of Chemical Engineering, claims to be able to create a carbon nanotube fibre which has a tensile strength of . =3D graphene= In 2013, a three-dimensional honeycomb of hexagonally arranged carbon was termed 3D graphene, and self-supporting 3D graphene was also produced. 3D structures of graphene can be fabricated by using either CVD or solution based methods. A 2016 review by Khurram and Xu et al. provided a summary of then-state-of-the-art techniques for fabrication of the 3D structure of graphene and other related two-dimensional materials. In 2013, researchers at Stony Brook University reported a novel radical-initiated crosslinking method to fabricate porous 3D free-standing architectures of graphene and carbon nanotubes using nanomaterials as building blocks without any polymer matrix as support. These 3D graphene (all-carbon) scaffolds/foams have applications in several fields such as energy storage, filtration, thermal management and biomedical devices and implants. Box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure appearing after mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite was reported in 2016. The discovered nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. Potential fields of BSG application include: ultra-sensitive detectors, high-performance catalytic cells, nanochannels for DNA sequencing and manipulation, high- performance heat sinking surfaces, rechargeable batteries of enhanced performance, nanomechanical resonators, electron multiplication channels in emission nanoelectronic devices, high-capacity sorbents for safe hydrogen storage. Three dimensional bilayer graphene has also been reported. =Pillared graphene= Pillared graphene is a hybrid carbon, structure consisting of an oriented array of carbon nanotubes connected at each end to a sheet of graphene. It was first described theoretically by George Froudakis and colleagues of the University of Crete in Greece in 2008. Pillared graphene has not yet been synthesised in the laboratory, but it has been suggested that it may have useful electronic properties, or as a hydrogen storage material. =Reinforced graphene= Graphene reinforced with embedded carbon nanotube reinforcing bars (\\"rebar\\") is easier to manipulate, while improving the electrical and mechanical qualities of both materials. Functionalized single- or multiwalled carbon nanotubes are spin-coated on copper foils and then heated and cooled, using the nanotubes themselves as the carbon source. Under heating, the functional carbon groups decompose into graphene, while the nanotubes partially split and form in-plane covalent bonds with the graphene, adding strength. œÄ‚ÄìœÄ stacking domains add more strength. The nanotubes can overlap, making the material a better conductor than standard CVD-grown graphene. The nanotubes effectively bridge the grain boundaries found in conventional graphene. The technique eliminates the traces of substrate on which later-separated sheets were deposited using epitaxy. Stacks of a few layers have been proposed as a cost-effective and physically flexible replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) used in displays and photovoltaic cells. =Molded graphene= In 2015, researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) developed a new approach for forming 3D shapes from flat, 2D sheets of graphene. A film of graphene that had been soaked in solvent to make it swell and become malleable was overlaid on an underlying substrate \\"former\\". The solvent evaporated over time, leaving behind a layer of graphene that had taken on the shape of the underlying structure. In this way they were able to produce a range of relatively intricate micro-structured shapes. Features vary from 3.5 to 50 Œºm. Pure graphene and gold-decorated graphene were each successfully integrated with the substrate. =Graphene aerogel= An aerogel made of graphene layers separated by carbon nanotubes was measured at 0.16 milligrams per cubic centimeter. A solution of graphene and carbon nanotubes in a mold is freeze dried to dehydrate the solution, leaving the aerogel. The material has superior elasticity and absorption. It can recover completely after more than 90% compression, and absorb up to 900 times its weight in oil, at a rate of 68.8 grams per second. =Graphene nanocoil= In 2015 a coiled form of graphene was discovered in graphitic carbon (coal). The spiraling effect is produced by defects in the material's hexagonal grid that causes it to spiral along its edge, mimicking a Riemann surface, with the graphene surface approximately perpendicular to the axis. When voltage is applied to such a coil, current flows around the spiral, producing a magnetic field. The phenomenon applies to spirals with either zigzag or armchair patterns, although with different current distributions. Computer simulations indicated that a conventional spiral inductor of 205 microns in diameter could be matched by a nanocoil just 70 nanometers wide, with a field strength reaching as much as 1 tesla. The nano-solenoids analyzed through computer models at Rice should be capable of producing powerful magnetic fields of about 1 tesla, about the same as the coils found in typical loudspeakers, according to Yakobson and his team ‚Äì and about the same field strength as some MRI machines. They found the magnetic field would be strongest in the hollow, nanometer-wide cavity at the spiral's center. A solenoid made with such a coil behaves as a quantum conductor whose current distribution between the core and exterior varies with applied voltage, resulting in nonlinear inductance. =Crumpled graphene= In 2016, Brown University introduced a method for 'crumpling' graphene, adding wrinkles to the material on a nanoscale. This was achieved by depositing layers of graphene oxide onto a shrink film, then shrunken, with the film dissolved before being shrunken again on another sheet of film. The crumpled graphene became superhydrophobic, and, when used as a battery electrode, the material was shown to have as much as a 400% increase in electrochemical current density. Production A rapidly increasing list of production techniques have been developed to enable graphene's use in commercial applications. Isolated 2D crystals cannot be grown via chemical synthesis beyond small sizes even in principle, because the rapid growth of phonon density with increasing lateral size forces 2D crystallites to bend into the third dimension. In all cases, graphene must bond to a substrate to retain its two-dimensional shape. Small graphene structures, such as graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons, can be produced by \\"bottom up\\" methods that assemble the lattice from organic molecule monomers (e. g. citric acid, glucose). \\"Top down\\" methods, on the other hand, cut bulk graphite and graphene materials with strong chemicals (e. g. mixed acids). =Mechanical= Mechanical exfoliation Geim and Novoselov initially used adhesive tape to pull graphene sheets away from graphite. Achieving single layers typically requires multiple exfoliation steps. After exfoliation the flakes are deposited on a silicon wafer. Crystallites larger than 1 mm and visible to the naked eye can be obtained. As of 2014, exfoliation produced graphene with the lowest number of defects and highest electron mobility. Alternatively a sharp single-crystal diamond wedge penetrates onto the graphite source to cleave layers. In 2014 defect-free, unoxidized graphene-containing liquids were made from graphite using mixers that produce local shear rates greater than . Shear exfoliation is another method which by using rotor-stator mixer the scalable production of the defect-free Graphene has become possible It has been shown that, as turbulence is not necessary for mechanical exfoliation, low speed ball milling is shown to be effective in the production of High-Yield and water-soluble graphene. Ultrasonic exfoliation Dispersing graphite in a liquid medium can produce graphene by sonication followed by centrifugation, producing concentrations in N-methylpyrrolidone. Using a suitable ionic liquid as the dispersing liquid medium produced concentrations of . Restacking is an issue with this technique. Adding a surfactant to a solvent prior to sonication prevents restacking by adsorbing to the graphene's surface. This produces a higher graphene concentration, but removing the surfactant requires chemical treatments. Sonicating graphite at the interface of two immiscible liquids, most notably heptane and water, produced macro-scale graphene films. The graphene sheets are adsorbed to the high energy interface between the materials and are kept from restacking. The sheets are up to about 95% transparent and conductive. With definite cleavage parameters, the box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure can be prepared on graphite crystal. =Splitting monolayer carbon= Nanotube slicing Graphene can be created by opening carbon nanotubes by cutting or etching. In one such method multi- walled carbon nanotubes are cut open in solution by action of potassium permanganate and sulfuric acid. In 2014, carbon nanotube-reinforced graphene was made via spin coating and annealing functionalized carbon nanotubes. Fullerene splitting Another approach sprays buckyballs at supersonic speeds onto a substrate. The balls cracked open upon impact, and the resulting unzipped cages then bond together to form a graphene film. =Chemical= Graphite oxide reduction P. Boehm reported producing monolayer flakes of reduced graphene oxide in 1962. Rapid heating of graphite oxide and exfoliation yields highly dispersed carbon powder with a few percent of graphene flakes. Another method is reduction of graphite oxide monolayer films, e.g. by hydrazine with annealing in argon/hydrogen with an almost intact carbon framework that allows efficient removal of functional groups. Measured charge carrier mobility exceeded /Vs. Burning a graphite oxide coated DVD produced a conductive graphene film (1738 siemens per meter) and specific surface area (1520 square meters per gram) that was highly resistant and malleable. A dispersed reduced graphene oxide suspension was synthesized in water by a hydrothermal dehydration method without using any surfactant. The approach is facile, industrially applicable, environmentally friendly and cost effective. Viscosity measurements confirmed that the graphene colloidal suspension (Graphene nanofluid) exhibit Newtonian behavior, with the viscosity showing close resemblance to that of water. Molten salts Graphite particles can be corroded in molten salts to form a variety of carbon nanostructures including graphene. Hydrogen cations, dissolved in molten lithium chloride, can be discharged on cathodically polarized graphite rods, which then intercalate, peeling graphene sheets. The graphene nanosheets produced displayed a single-crystalline structure with a lateral size of several hundred nanometers and a high degree of crystallinity and thermal stability. Electrochemical synthesis Electrochemical synthesis can exfoliate graphene. Varying a pulsed voltage controls thickness, flake area, number of defects and affects its properties. The process begins by bathing the graphite in a solvent for intercalation. The process can be tracked by monitoring the solution's transparency with an LED and photodiode. Hydrothermal self- assembly Graphene has been prepared by using a sugar (e.g. glucose, sugar, fructose, etc.) This substrate-free \\"bottom-up\\" synthesis is safer, simpler and more environmentally friendly than exfoliation. The method can control thickness, ranging from monolayer to multilayers, which is known as \\"Tang-Lau Method\\". Sodium ethoxide pyrolysis Gram-quantities were produced by the reduction of ethanol by sodium metal, followed by pyrolysis and washing with water. Microwave-assisted oxidation In 2012, microwave energy was reported to directly synthesize graphene in one step. This approach avoids use of potassium permanganate in the reaction mixture. It was also reported that by microwave radiation assistance, graphene oxide with or without holes can be synthesized by controlling microwave time. Microwave heating can dramatically shorten the reaction time from days to seconds. Graphene can also me made by microwave assisted hydrothermal pyrolysis Thermal decomposition of silicon carbide Heating silicon carbide (SiC) to high temperatures () under low pressures (c. 10‚àí6 torr) reduces it to graphene. =Chemical vapor deposition= Epitaxy Epitaxial graphene growth on silicon carbide is wafer-scale technique to produce graphene. Epitaxial graphene may be coupled to surfaces weakly enough (by Van der Waals forces) to retain the two dimensional electronic band structure of isolated graphene. A normal silicon wafer coated with a layer of germanium (Ge) dipped in dilute hydrofluoric acid strips the naturally forming germanium oxide groups, creating hydrogen- terminated germanium. CVD can coat that with graphene. The direct synthesis of graphene on insulator TiO2 with high-dielectric-constant (high-Œ∫). A two-step CVD process is shown to grow graphene directly on TiO2 crystals or exfoliated TiO2 nanosheets without using any metal catalyst. Metal substrates CVD graphene can be grown on metal substrates including ruthenium, iridium, nickel and copper Roll-to-roll In 2014 a two-step roll-to-roll manufacturing process was announced. The first roll-to-roll step produces the graphene via chemical vapor deposition. The second step binds the graphene to a substrate. Large-area Raman mapping of CVD graphene on deposited Cu thin film on 150 mm SiO2/Si wafers reveals >95% monolayer continuity and an average value of ‚àº2.62 for I2D/IG. The scale bar is 200 Œºm. Cold wall Growing graphene in an industrial resistive-heating cold wall CVD system was claimed to produce graphene 100 times faster than conventional CVD systems, cut costs by 99% and produce material with enhanced electronic qualities. =Wafer scale CVD graphene= CVD graphene is scalable and has been grown on deposited Cu thin film catalyst on 100 to 300 mm standard Si/SiO2 wafers on an Axitron Black Magic system. Monolayer graphene coverage of >95% is achieved on 100 to 300 mm wafer substrates with negligible defects, confirmed by extensive Raman mapping. =Carbon dioxide reduction= A highly exothermic reaction combusts magnesium in an oxidation‚Äìreduction reaction with carbon dioxide, producing carbon nanoparticles including graphene and fullerenes. =Supersonic spray= Supersonic acceleration of droplets through a Laval nozzle was used to deposit reduced graphene-oxide on a substrate. The energy of the impact rearranges that carbon atoms into flawless graphene. =Laser= In 2014 a infrared laser produced and patterned porous three-dimensional graphene film networks from commercial polymer films. The result exhibits high electrical conductivity. Laser-induced production appeared to allow roll-to-roll manufacturing processes. =Ion implantation= Accelerating carbon ions inside an electrical field into a semiconductor made of thin nickel films on a substrate of SiO2/Si, creates a wafer-scale () wrinkle/tear/residue-free graphene layer at a relatively low temperature of 500 ¬∞C. = CMOS-compatible graphene = Integration of graphene in the widely employed CMOS fabrication process demands its transfer-free direct synthesis on dielectric substrates at temperatures below 500 ¬∞C. At the IEDM 2018, researchers from University of California, Santa Barbara, demonstrated a novel CMOS-compatible graphene synthesis process at 300 ¬∞C suitable for back-end-of-line (BEOL) applications. The process involves pressure-assisted solid-state diffusion of carbon through a thin-film of metal catalyst. The synthesized large-area graphene films were shown to exhibit high-quality (via Raman characterization) and similar resistivity values when compared with high-temperature CVD synthesized graphene films of same cross-section down to widths of 20 nm. Simulation In addition to experimental investigation of graphene and graphene-based devices, their numerical modeling and simulation have been an important research topic. The Kubo formula provides an analytic expression for the graphene's conductivity and shows that it is a function of several physical parameters including wavelength, temperature, and chemical potential. Moreover, a surface conductivity model, which describes graphene as an infinitesimally thin (two sided) sheet with a local and isotropic conductivity, has been proposed. This model permits derivation of analytical expressions for the electromagnetic field in the presence of a graphene sheet in terms of a dyadic Green function (represented using Sommerfeld integrals) and exciting electric current. Even though these analytical models and methods can provide results for several canonical problems for benchmarking purposes, many practical problems involving graphene, such as design of arbitrarily shaped electromagnetic devices, are analytically intractable. With the recent advances in the field of computational electromagnetics (CEM), various accurate and efficient numerical methods have become available for analysis of electromagnetic field/wave interactions on graphene sheets and/or graphene- based devices. A comprehensive summary of computational tools developed for analyzing graphene-based devices/systems is proposed. Graphene analogs Graphene analogs (also referred to as \\"artificial graphene\\") are two- dimensional systems which exhibit similar properties to graphene. Graphene analogs are studied intensively since the discovery of graphene in 2004. People try to develop systems in which the physics is easier to observe and to manipulate than in graphene. In those systems, electrons are not always the particles which are used. They might be optical photons, microwave photons, plasmons, microcavity polaritons, or even atoms. Also, the honeycomb structure in which those particles evolve can be of a different nature than carbon atoms in graphene. It can be, respectively, a photonic crystal, an array of metallic rods, metallic nanoparticles, a lattice of coupled microcavities, or an optical lattice.

(b) An actual example of 2D Carbon Graphene Material Co.,Ltd's graphene transparent conductor-based touchscreen that is employed in (c) a commercial smartphone. Graphene is a transparent and flexible conductor that holds great promise for various material/device applications, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LED), touch panels, and smart windows or phones. Smartphone products with graphene touch screens are already on the market. In 2013, Head announced their new range of graphene tennis racquets. As of 2015, there is one product available for commercial use: a graphene-infused printer powder. Many other uses for graphene have been proposed or are under development, in areas including electronics, biological engineering, filtration, lightweight/strong composite materials, photovoltaics and energy storage. Graphene is often produced as a powder and as a dispersion in a polymer matrix. This dispersion is supposedly suitable for advanced composites, paints and coatings, lubricants, oils and functional fluids, capacitors and batteries, thermal management applications, display materials and packaging, solar cells, inks and 3D-printers' materials, and barriers and films. In 2016, researchers have been able to make a graphene film that can absorb 95% of light incident on it. Graphene is also getting cheaper. In 2015, scientists at the University of Glasgow found a way to produce graphene at a cost that is 100 times less than the previous methods. On August 2, 2016, BAC's new Mono model is said to be made out of graphene as a first of both a street-legal track car and a production car. In January 2018, graphene based spiral inductors exploiting kinetic inductance at room temperature were first demonstrated at the University of California, Santa Barbara, led by Kaustav Banerjee. These inductors were predicted to allow significant miniaturization in radio- frequency integrated circuit applications. The potential of epitaxial graphene on SiC for metrology has been shown since 2010, displaying quantum Hall resistance quantization accuracy of three parts per billion in monolayer epitaxial graphene. Over the years precisions of parts-per-trillion in the Hall resistance quantization and giant quantum Hall plateaus have been demonstrated. Developments in encapsulation and doping of epitaxial graphene have led to the commercialisation of epitaxial graphene quantum resistance standards. Health risks The toxicity of graphene has been extensively debated in the literature. The most comprehensive review on graphene toxicity published by Lalwani et al. exclusively summarizes the in vitro, in vivo, antimicrobial and environmental effects and highlights the various mechanisms of graphene toxicity. Results show that the toxicity of graphene is dependent on several factors such as shape, size, purity, post-production processing steps, oxidative state, functional groups, dispersion state, synthesis methods, route and dose of administration, and exposure times. Research at Stony Brook University showed that graphene nanoribbons, graphene nanoplatelets and graphene nano‚Äìonions are non-toxic at concentrations up to 50 Œºg/ml. These nanoparticles do not alter the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells towards osteoblasts (bone) or adipocytes (fat) suggesting that at low doses graphene nanoparticles are safe for biomedical applications. Research at Brown university found that 10 Œºm few-layered graphene flakes are able to pierce cell membranes in solution. They were observed to enter initially via sharp and jagged points, allowing graphene to be internalized in the cell. The physiological effects of this remain uncertain, and this remains a relatively unexplored field. See also References > Bor Z. Jang and Wen C. Huang (2002): \\"Nano-scaled graphene plates\\".

Nicknamed \\"the Little Giant\\" for his short stature and forceful playing, Griffin's career began in the early 1940s and continued until the month of his death. At eighty, he felt no need to stop. He did not complain. He had a hard life, but often said, ‚Äúas long as God has given me the gift to blow, I owe it to God to keep on blowing.‚Äù A pioneering figure in hard bop, Griffin recorded prolifically as a bandleader in addition to stints with pianist Thelonious Monk, drummer Art Blakey, in partnership with fellow tenor Eddie \\"Lockjaw\\" Davis and as a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band after he moved to Europe in the 1960s. In 1995, Griffin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.  Early life and career  Griffin studied music at DuSable High School in Chicago under Walter Dyett, starting out on clarinet before moving on to oboe and then alto sax. While still at high school at the age of 15, Griffin was playing with T-Bone Walker in a band led by Walker's brother.\\"In Conversation with Johnny Griffin\\" by Ted Panken at Jazz.com Alto saxophone was still his instrument of choice when he joined Lionel Hampton's big band three days after his high school graduation, but Hampton encouraged him to take up the tenor, playing alongside Arnett Cobb. He first appeared on a Los Angeles recording with Hampton's band in 1945 at the age of 17. By mid-1947, Griffin and fellow Hampton band member Joe Morris had formed a sextet made up of local musicians, including George Freeman, where he remained for the next two years. His playing can be heard on various early Rhythm and Blues recordings for Atlantic Records. By 1951 Griffin was playing baritone saxophone in an R&B; septet led by former bandmate Arnett Cobb.Johnny Griffin catalog jazzdisco.org. Retrieved July 8, 2013. After returning to Chicago from two years in the Army, Griffin began establishing a reputation as one of the premiere saxophonists in that city. Thelonious Monk enthusiastically encouraged Orrin Keepnews of Riverside Records to sign the young tenor, but before he could act Blue Note Records had signed Griffin. He joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1957, and his recordings from that time include a memorable album joining together the Messengers and Thelonious Monk. Griffin then succeeded John Coltrane as a member of Monk's Five Spot quartet; he can be heard on the albums Thelonious in Action and Misterioso. Griffin's unique style, based on an astounding technique, included a vast canon of bebop language. He was known to quote generously from classical, opera and other musical forms. A prodigious player, he was often subjected to and victorious at \\"cutting sessions\\" (a musical battle between two musicians) involving a legion of tenor players, both in his hometown Chicago with the likes of Hank Mobley and Gene Ammons, and on the road. Diminutive, he was distinctive as a fashionable dresser, a good businessman, and a well-liked bandleader to other musicians. Recording career Johnny Griffin backstage at Bach Dancing & Dynamite Society, Half Moon Bay, California, 1985 Griffin was leader on his first Blue Note album Introducing Johnny Griffin in 1956. Also featuring Wynton Kelly on piano, Curly Russell on bass and Max Roach on drums, the recording brought Griffin critical acclaim. The album A Blowin' Session (1957) featured John Coltrane and Hank Mobley. He played with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers for a few months in 1957, and in the Thelonious Monk Sextet and Quartet (1958). During this period, he recorded a set with Clark Terry on Serenade to a Bus Seat featuring the rhythm trio of Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones. Move to Europe Griffin moved to France in 1963 and to the Netherlands in 1978. His relocation was the result of several factors, including income tax problems, a failing marriage and feeling \\"embittered by the critical acceptance of free jazz\\" in the United States, as journalist Ben Ratliff would write.Ratliff, Ben (2008). \\"Johnny Griffin, 80, Jazz Saxophonist, dies.\\" The New York Times, July 26, 2008; accessed 12 September 2016 Apart from appearing regularly under his own name at jazz clubs such as London's Ronnie Scott's, Griffin became the \\"first choice\\" sax player for visiting US musicians touring the continent during the 1960s and '70s. He briefly rejoined Monk's groups (an Octet and Nonet) in 1967. Griffin and Davis met up again in 1970 and recorded Tough Tenors Again 'n' Again, and again with the Dizzy Gillespie Big 7 at the Montreux Jazz Festival. In 1965 he recorded albums with Wes Montgomery. From 1967 to 1969, he was part of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band and in the late '70s recorded with Peter Herbolzheimer and His Big Band, which also included, among others, Nat Adderley, Derek Watkins, Art Farmer, Slide Hampton, Jiggs Whigham, Herb Geller, Wilton Gaynair, Stan Getz, Gerry Mulligan, Rita Reys, Jean \\"Toots\\" Thielemans, Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen, Grady Tate, and Quincy Jones as arranger. He also recorded with the Nat Adderley Quintet in 1978, having previously recorded with Adderley in 1958. On July 25, 2008, Johnny Griffin died of a heart attack at the age of 80 in Maupr√©voir, near Availles-Limouzine, France, \\"Le saxophoniste am√©ricain Johnny Griffin est mort\\" Le Nouvel Observateur.

He resides in Santa Monica, California. Bachardy was the partner of Christopher Isherwood for over 30 years.  Early life  Born in Los Angeles, California, Bachardy studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and the Slade School of Art in London. His first one-man exhibition was held in October 1961 at the Redfern Gallery in London. He met the writer Christopher Isherwood on Valentine's Day 1953, when he was 18 and Isherwood was 48. They remained together until Isherwood's death in 1986. A number of paperback editions of Isherwood's novels feature Bachardy's pencil portraits of the author. A film about their relationship, titled Chris & Don: A Love Story, was released in 2008. Work Bachardy has had many one-man exhibitions in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Houston and New York City. More recently, he exhibited at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, in 2004‚Äì2005. His works reside in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum of Art in San Francisco, the University of Texas, Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, California, the University of California, Los Angeles, the Fogg Art Museum of Harvard University, Princeton University, the Smithsonian Institution, and the National Portrait Gallery, London. Six books of his work have been published. His life and works are also documented in Terry Sanders' film The Eyes of Don Bachardy. He collaborated with Isherwood on Frankenstein: The True Story (1973). His book Stars in My Eyes (2000), about celebrated people whom he had painted, became a number one best-seller in Los Angeles. Bachardy's most haunting and eloquent published collection, \\"Last Drawings of Christopher Isherwood\\" in 1990 contains the dying and deceased Isherwood for the last time in his eyes. One of Bachardy's most notable works is the official gubernatorial portrait of Jerry Brown that hangs in the California State Capitol Museum. Most recently, Bachardy made a cameo appearance in the movie A Single Man (starring Colin Firth) based on Isherwood's book of the same name‚Äîhe portrays a professor in the teacher's lounge, to whom Firth says \\"Hello. Don.\\"Eric Gutierrez, \\"Tom Ford was right about Isherwood\\". The Times. February 5, 2010. Bachardy told Angeleno Magazine in their December 2009 issue: \\"Chris got the idea for that book when he and I were having a domestic crisis. We'd been together 10 years. I was making a lot of trouble and wondering if I shouldn't be on my own. Chris was going through a very difficult period (as well). So he killed off my character, Jim, in the book and imagined what his life would be like without me.\\" Personal life Bachardy still lives in his and Isherwood's Santa Monica home (his place of residence for over 50 years), where he paints portraits for gallery shows and on a commission basis. In January 2010 he showed a retrospective of self- portraits (from 1959‚Äì2009) at Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica.Ann Harold (02-15-2010), \\"A Brush With Life\\", LAmag.com. In Fall of 2011, Bachardy exhibited portraits made over the last 40 years depicting artists from Southern California, including Peter Alexander, Larry Bell, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Ed Moses, and Ed Ruscha at Craig Krull Gallery in conjunction with the Getty initiative Pacific Standard Time.

His works span the colonial period under Dutch rule, Indonesia's struggle for independence, its occupation by Japan during the Second World War, as well as the post-colonial authoritarian regimes of Sukarno and Suharto, and are infused with personal and national history. Pramoedya's writings sometimes fell out of favour with the colonial and later the authoritarian native governments in power. He faced censorship in Indonesia during the pre-Refomasi era even though he was well-known outside Indonesia. The Dutch imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949 during the War of Independence (1945-1949). During the transition to the Suharto regime, he was caught up in the shifting tides of political change and power struggles. Suharto had him imprisoned from 1969 to 1979 on the Maluku island of Buru and branded him a Communist. He was seen as a holdover from the previous regime, despite having struggled with it. It was on the Island of Buru that he composed his most famous work, the Buru Quartet. Not permitted access to writing materials, he recited the story orally to other prisoners before it was written down and smuggled out. Pramoedya opposed some policies of founding President Sukarno as well as the New Order regime of Suharto, Sukarno's successor. Political criticisms were often subtle in his writing, although he was outspoken against colonialism, racism and corruption of the Indonesian new government. During the many years in which he suffered imprisonment and house arrest (in Jakarta after his imprisonment on Buru), he became a cause c√©l√®bre for advocates of human rights and freedom of expression. Early years Pramoedya was born on 6 February 1925, in the town of Blora in the heartland of Java, then a part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the firstborn son in his family; his father was a teacher, who was also active in Boedi Oetomo (the first recognized indigenous national organization in Indonesia) and his mother was a rice trader. His maternal grandfather had taken the pilgrimage to Mecca. As it is written in his semi-autobiographical collection of short stories \\"Cerita Dari Blora\\", his name was originally Pramoedya Ananta Mastoer. However, he felt that the family name Mastoer (his father's name) seemed too aristocratic. The Javanese prefix \\"Mas\\" refers to a man of the higher rank in a noble family. Consequently, he omitted \\"Mas\\" and kept Toer as his family name. He went on to the Radio Vocational School in Surabaya but had barely graduated from the school when Japan invaded Surabaya (1942). During World War II, Pramoedya (like many Indonesian Nationalists, Sukarno and Suharto among them) at first supported the occupying forces of Imperial Japan. He believed the Japanese to be the lesser of two evils, compared to the Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. As the war went on, however, Indonesians were dismayed by the austerity of wartime rationing and by increasingly harsh measures taken by the Japanese military. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan; all indications are that Pramoedya did as well. On 17 August 1945, after the news of Allied victory over Japan reached Indonesia, Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence. This touched off the Indonesian National Revolution against the forces of the British and Dutch. In this war, Pramoedya joined a paramilitary group in Karawang, Kranji (West Java) and eventually was stationed in Jakarta. During this time he wrote short stories and books, as well as propaganda for the Nationalist cause. He was eventually imprisoned by the Dutch in Jakarta in 1947 and remained there until 1949, the year the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence. While imprisoned in Bukit Duri from 1947 to 1949 for his role in the Indonesian Revolution, he wrote his first major novel The Fugitive. Post-Independence prominence In the first years after the struggle for independence, Pramoedya wrote several works of fiction dealing with the problems of the newly founded nation, as well as semi-autobiographical works based on his wartime memoirs. He was soon able to live in the Netherlands as part of a cultural exchange program. In the years that followed, he took an interest in several other cultural exchanges, including trips to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as translations of Russian writers Maxim Gorky and Leo Tolstoy. In Indonesia, Pramoedya built up a reputation as a literary and social critic, joining the left-wing writers' group Lekra and writing in various newspapers and literary journals. His writing style became more politically charged, as evidenced in his story Korupsi (Corruption), a critical fiction of a civil servant who falls into the trap of corruption. This created friction between him and the government of Sukarno. From the late 1950s, Pramoedya began teaching literary history at the left-wing Universitas Res Publica. As he prepared material, he began to realise that the study of Indonesian language and literature had been distorted by the Dutch colonial authorities. He sought out materials that had been ignored by colonial educational institutions, and which had continued to be ignored after independence. Having spent time in China, he became greatly sympathetic to the Indonesian Chinese over the persecutions they faced in post-colonial Indonesia. Most notably, he published a series of letters addressed to an imaginary Chinese correspondent discussing the history of the Indonesian Chinese, called Hoakiau di Indonesia (History of the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia). He criticised the government for being too centred on Java and insensitive to the needs and desires of the other regions and peoples of Indonesia. As a result, he was arrested by the Indonesian military and jailed at Cipinang prison for nine months. Imprisonment under Suharto In an October 1965 coup, the army took power after alleging that the assassination of several senior generals was masterminded by the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI). The transition to Suharto's New Order followed, and Pramoedya's position as the head of People's Cultural Organisation, a literary group with connections to the PKI, caused him to be considered a communist and enemy of the \\"New Order\\" regime. During the violent anti-Communist purge, he was arrested, beaten, and imprisoned by Suharto's government and named a tapol (\\"political prisoner\\"). His books were banned from circulation, and he was imprisoned without trial, first in Nusa Kambangan off the southern coast of Java, and then in the penal colony of Buru in the eastern islands of the Indonesian archipelago. He was banned from writing during his imprisonment on the island of Buru but still managed to compose - orally - his best-known series of work to date, the Buru Quartet, a series of four historical fiction novels chronicling the development of Indonesian nationalism and based in part on his own experiences growing up. The English titles of the books in the tetralogy are This Earth of Mankind, Child of All Nations, Footsteps, and House of Glass. The main character of the series, Minke, a Javanese minor royal, was based in part on an Indonesian journalist active in the nationalist movement, Tirto Adhi Surjo. The quartet includes strong female characters of Indonesian and Chinese ethnicity and addresses the discrimination and indignities of living under colonial rule, and the struggle for personal and national political independence. Like much of Pramoedya's work, it tells personal stories and focuses on individuals caught up in the tide of a nation's history. Pramoedya had researched for the books before his imprisonment in the Buru prison camp. When he was arrested, his library was burned, and much of his collection and early writings were lost. In Buru, he was not permitted even to have a pencil. Doubting that he would ever be able to write the novels down himself, he narrated them to his fellow prisoners. With the support of other prisoners who took on extra labour to reduce his workload, Pramoedya was eventually able to write the novels down, and the published works derived their name \\"Buru Quartet\\" after the prison. They have been collected and published in English (translated by Max Lane) and Indonesian, as well as many other languages. Though the work is considered a classic by many outside of Indonesia, the publication was banned in Indonesia, causing one of the most famous of Indonesia's literary works to be mostly unavailable to the country's people whose history it addressed. Copies were scanned by Indonesians abroad and distributed via the Internet to people inside the country. Pramoedya's works on colonial Indonesia recognised the importance of Islam as a vehicle for widespread opposition to the Dutch, but his works are not overtly religious. He rejected those who used religion to deny critical thinking, and on occasion wrote with considerable negativity to the religiously pious. Release and subsequent works Pramoedya was released from imprisonment in 1979 but remained under house arrest in Jakarta until 1992. During this time he released The Girl From the Coast, another semi- fictional novel based on his grandmother's own experience (volumes 2 and 3 of this work were destroyed along with his library in 1965). He also wrote Nyanyi Sunyi Seorang Bisu (1995); A Mute's Soliloquy, an autobiography based on the letters that he wrote for his daughter from imprisonment in Buru but were not allowed to be sent, and Arus Balik (1995). Pramoedya in the 1990s Pramoedya's grave in Karet Bivak Cemetery, Jakarta He wrote many columns and short articles criticising the Indonesian government. He wrote a book Perawan Remaja dalam Cengkeraman Militer (Young Virgins in the Military's Grip), a documentary written showcasing the plight of Javanese women who were forced to become comfort women during the Japanese occupation and were subsequently subject to oppression by their own Indonesian society. The women were brought to Buru where they were sexually abused by the Japanese and ended up staying there instead of returning to Java. Pramoedya's fellow political prisoners were able to meet some of these women (generally only once) and relate this information to Pramoedya, who wrote it down in narrative form in the 1970s, providing the basis for the book published in 2001.William Bradley Horton, \\"Pramoedya and the Comfort Women of Buru A Textual Analysis of Perawan Remaja dalam Cengkeraman Militer (Teenage Virgins in the Grasp of the Military)\\", Journal of Asia Pacific Studies 14 (2010): 71-88 Pramoedya was hospitalised on 27 April 2006, for complications brought on by diabetes and heart disease. He was also a heavy smoker of Kretek (clove) cigarettes and had endured years of abuse while in detention. Pramoedya earned several accolades and was frequently discussed as Indonesia's and Southeast Asia's best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature. Pramoedya's writings on Indonesia address the international and regional currents caused by political events in history and how these events flowed through his homeland and buffeted its people. Pramoedya also shares a personal history of hardship and detention for his efforts of self-expression and the political aspects of his writings and struggled against the censorship of his work by the leaders of his own people.

The original name was VAX Rdb/VMShttp://gordonbell.azurewebsites.net/digital/timeline/1984-1.htm. Product history In 1994 DEC sold the Rdb division to Oracle Corporation where it was rebranded Oracle Rdb. As of 2020, Oracle is still enhancing and developing this product (although Oracle's RDBMS gets the lion's share of Oracle's advertising budget). It currently runs on OpenVMS for VAX, Alpha and IA-64 (Itanium). It used to run on DEC Tru64 and Microsoft Windows NT. Demand for the Tru64 version was so low that support was dropped. The Windows NT port was never released as Oracle could not obtain support on the compilers necessary for this platform. Rdb featured one of the first cost-based optimizers, and after acquisition Oracle introduced a cost-based optimizer in its regular Oracle RDBMS product. Data access Interactive access to the Oracle Rdb can be by SQL (Structured Query Language), RDO (Relational Database Operator), or both. High level languages usually access Oracle-Rdb by: #embedding RDO statements in the source file then running it through a precompiler #:(example: \\"file.RCO\\" is pre-compiled into \\"file.COB\\") #embedding SQL statements in the source file then running it through a precompiler #:(example: \\"file.SCO\\" is pre-compiled into \\"file.COB\\") #placing the SQL statements in a file external to the source code; this separate file is converted to object code by the \\"SQL Module Language\\" compiler, and the source code then references these SQL statements and, after compilation, the two are joined by the OpenVMS linker. example: $ SQL$MOD file_bas.sqlmod -> file_bas.obj $ BASIC file.bas -> file.obj $ LINK file.obj,file_bas.obj -> file.exe A variation of example 3 allows \\"Dynamic SQL\\" to be created in the source code, and then used to communicate with Rdb via a structure known as SQLDA (SQL Descriptor Area). On OpenVMS systems, Oracle Rdb is a popular (although expensive) upgrade path for applications written using Record Management Services (RMS) files.  Future of Rdb  Oracle has released a statement of direction which indicates integration with Oracle 9i and 10g through technology sharing.Oracle Rdb Statement of Direction // Oracle On March 22, 2011, Oracle announced it has decided to end all software development on the Itanium; Oracle Rdb 7.3 will be the last major version released by Oracle. Statement issued on September 4, 2012: Previously, Oracle announced that it would stop developing new versions of its software on Itanium microprocessors. For example, that meant version 12c of the Oracle database due out in early 2013 would not be available on Itanium. However, a judge recently ruled that Oracle has a contract to continue porting its software to Itanium computers for as long as HP sells Itanium computers. Therefore, Oracle will continue building the latest versions of its database and other software covered by the judge's ruling to HP Itanium computers.

It can lead to emotions such as frustration and anger. The property of being easily annoyed is called irritability. Psychology Various reasons exist for why one finds particular stimuli annoying. Measurement of annoyance is highly subjective. As an attempt at measurement, psychological studies on annoyance often rely on their subjects' own ratings of levels of annoyance on a scale. Any kind of stimuli can cause annoyance, such as getting poked in the side or listening to a song repeatedly. Many stimuli that one is at first neutral to, or even finds pleasant, can turn into annoyances from repeated continued exposure. One can often encounter annoyance factors in media, including popular music, memes, commercials, and advertising jingles, which by their very nature are continually repeated over a period of weeks or months. A study published in the International Journal of Conflict Management found that one's response to an annoyance, at least when the perceived cause is another person, escalate to more extreme levels as they go unresolved.Dean G Pruitt, John C Parker, Joseph M Mikolic. \\"Escalation as a reaction to persistent annoyance.\\", International Journalists of Conflict Management. Bowling Green: July 1997, Vol 8, Issue 3; pg. 252 It also found that one was more likely to blame the party who was causing the annoyance in the study, rather than one's self, for the annoyance as it escalated. Psychological warfare can involve creating annoyances to distract and wear down the resistance of the target. For example, in 1993, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) played music \\"specifically selected for its irritation ability\\" on loudspeakers outside the Branch Davidian church in Waco, Texas in an attempt to bring about the surrender of David Koresh and his followers.Mark Potok. \\"FBI grinds away at cult\\", USA Today, April 14, 1993, pg. 1A.

Born in Webster, New York, she came to prominence as the lead singer of the punk rock band Plasmatics. Her onstage theatrics included partial nudity, exploding equipment, firing a shotgun, and chainsawing guitars. Dubbed the \\"Queen of Shock Rock\\" and the \\"Metal Priestess\\", Williams was considered the most controversial and radical female singer of her time. Performing her own stunts in videos, she often sported a mohawk hairstyle. In 1985, during the height of her popularity as a solo artist, she was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Leaving home at 16, Williams hitchhiked to Colorado, earning money by crocheting string bikinis. She travelled to Florida and Europe landing various jobs such as lifeguard, stripper, macrobiotic cook, and server at Dunkin' Donuts. After arriving in New York City in 1976, she began performing in live sex shows, and in 1979 appeared in the porno Candy Goes to Hollywood. That year manager Rod Swenson recruited her to the Plasmatics and the two became romantically involved. The band quickly became known on the local underground scene, performing at clubs such as CBGB. Three albums with Plasmatics later, Williams embarked on a solo career and released her debut album, WOW, in 1984. Albums Kommander of Kaos (1986) and Deffest! and Baddest! (1988) followed, before her retirement from the music industry. Williams made her non-adult screen debut in Tom DeSimone's film Reform School Girls (1986), for which she recorded the title song. She also appeared in the 1989 comedy Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog, television series The New Adventures of Beans Baxter, and MacGyver. On 6 April 1998, Williams committed suicide near her home in Storrs, Connecticut by gunshot. She had attempted to kill herself twice in the years leading up to her death; allegedly she had also been struggling with deep depression.  Life and career  = 1949‚Äì1976: Early life = Williams was born to Robert F. Williams, a chemist at Eastman Kodak, and Audrey Stauber Williams (1921‚Äì2008) on May 28, 1949 in Webster, New York. She studied clarinet at the Community Music School program of the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, and later was a clarinetist in her high school's concert band. At the age of six, she appeared tap-dancing on the Howdy Doody show as a member of the \\"Peanut Gallery.\\" She had her first run-in with the law at the age of 15, when she was arrested for sunbathing nude. Williams attended R. L. Thomas High School in Webster at least partway through the 10th grade, but left school before graduating. Her schoolmates and teachers recalled Williams as a \\"shy and pretty girl, an average student who played in the junior high band, paid attention to her hair and clothes, and who spoke so softly you had to lean toward her to hear her.\\" At the age of 16, Williams left her home and hitchhiked to Colorado where she earned money by selling crocheted string bikinis. Afterwards, she headed for Florida working as a lifeguard and then to Europe, where she worked as a macrobiotic cook in London and as a dancer with a gypsy dance troupe. Around that time, she was arrested on multiple occasions for shoplifting and passing counterfeit money. In 1976, Williams arrived in New York City, where she saw an ad in the Show Business magazine that lay open on the Port Authority Bus Terminal station floor. It was a casting call for radical artist and Yale University graduate Rod Swenson's experimental \\"Captain Kink's Theatre.\\" She replied to the ad and began performing in live sex shows. She later appeared in Gail Palmer's adult film, Candy Goes to Hollywood (1979), credited as Wendy Williams. She was featured as a performer on a parody of The Gong Show shooting ping pong balls across the set from her vagina. = 1977‚Äì1983: Plasmatics = By 1977, Swenson became Williams' manager and recruited her to join his newly formed punk rock band, Plasmatics. They made their debut in July 1978 at the Manhattan music club CBGB. The Plasmatics toured the world, although a concert in London was cancelled by the promoters due to safety reasons, causing the press to dub the band \\"anarchists.\\" During the shooting of an appearance on SCTV in 1981, studio heads decided they would not air Williams' performance unless she changed out of a costume that revealed her nipples. Williams refused. The show's make-up artists found a compromise and painted her breasts black. In January 1981, Milwaukee, Wisconsin police arrested Williams for simulating masturbation on stage, and charged with battery to an officer and obscene conduct. She was cleared of all charges. Later that year in Cleveland, Ohio, Williams was acquitted of an obscenity charge for simulating sex on stage wearing only shaving cream; she subsequently covered her nipples with electrical tape to avoid arrest. In November, an Illinois judge sentenced her to one year supervision and fined her $35 for attacking a freelance photographer who tried to take her picture as she jogged along the Chicago lakefront. = 1984‚Äì1986: Solo career, WOW and Kommander of Kaos= Williams recorded a duet of the country hit \\"Stand by Your Man\\" with Lemmy of Mot√∂rhead in 1982. In 1984, she released the W.O.W. album, produced by Gene Simmons of Kiss. Kiss members Paul Stanley, Ace Frehley, Eric Carr, and Vinnie Vincent also perform on the album. Gene Simmons plays bass but is credited as Reginald Van Helsing. In 1985 Williams starred in The Rocky Horror Show at the Westport Playhouse in St. Louis. The show played for over six months, but a nationwide tour fell through. In 1986, she starred in Tom DeSimone's indie-film Reform School Girls. Neither she nor manager Rod Swenson liked the film when it came out, but at this point the producers had heard Kommander of Kaos (her second solo album) and wanted to include three tracks from the album in the movie score. They approached Rod about producing the title track for the film and having Wendy sing it. The band reluctantly agreed to do it. Uncle Brian from the Broc joined Rod as co-producer and also played sax. He also appeared in the video that the film company had asked Rod to produce and direct, playing the sax and wearing a tutu. = 1987‚Äì1990: Reunion with Plasmatics and Deffest! and Baddest! = In 1987, Williams starred as the part-time friend/enemy in the underground spy world to the title character on Fox's The New Adventures of Beans Baxter. The Plasmatics' last tour was in late 1988. Williams appeared in Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog, directed by Paul S. Parco, in 1990. In 1988, Wendy put out another solo album, this time a \\"thrash rap\\" album called Deffest! and Baddest! under the name \\"Ultrafly and the Hometown Girls.\\" Wendy's last known performance of a Plasmatics song occurred due to the prompting of Joey Ramone. She performed \\"Masterplan\\" one final time with Richie Stotts, when Richie's band opened for the Ramones on New Year's Eve, 1988. = 1991‚Äì1998: Retirement and final years = In 1991, Williams moved to Storrs, Connecticut, where she lived with her long-time companion and former manager, Rod Swenson, and worked as an animal rehabilitator and at a food co- op in Willimantic. She explained her move by saying that she \\"was pretty fed up dealing with people.\\"  Death  Williams first attempted suicide in 1993 by hammering a knife into her chest where it lodged in her sternum. However, she changed her mind and called Rod Swenson to take her to the hospital. She attempted suicide again in 1997 with an overdose of ephedrine. Williams died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 6, 1998, when she was 48. Swenson, her partner for more than 20 years, returned to their home in the area where they had lived since moving to Connecticut from New York City. He found a package she left for him that contained some noodles he liked, a packet of seeds for growing garden greens, some Oriental massage balm, and sealed letters from her. The suicide letters, which included a \\"living will\\" denying life support, a love letter to Swenson and various lists of things to do, caused Swenson to begin searching the woods for her. After about an hour, as dusk fell, he found her body in a wooded area with a pistol lying on the ground nearby. She had apparently been feeding wild squirrels moments before her suicide, as well as putting a bag over her head before shooting herself to spare her partner the horrible sight. \\"Wendy's act was not an irrational in- the-moment act,\\" he said; for four years she had contemplated suicide. Swenson reportedly described her as \\"despondent\\" at the time of her death. This is what she reportedly wrote in a suicide note regarding her decision: Joey Ramone and many others issued statements at the time of her death. On Mot√∂rhead's 1999 live album Everything Louder Than Everyone Else, before the song \\"No Class,\\" Mot√∂rhead vocalist Lemmy said that he wanted to dedicate the song to her. A memorial was held at CBGB on May 18. Several of Wendy's former Plasmatics co-members (Chosei Funahara, Richie Stotts, Wes Beech, Stu Deutsch, Jean Beauvoir and TC Tolliver) played a six-song set with four of them handling the vocals.  Personal life  Her teachers and other sources described Wendy Williams as a shy and soft-spoken child who was an average student that learned to play the clarinet very well in the junior high band ‚Äì though she herself has numerous times stated that she felt like an outcast and was misunderstood by her strict parents, whom she referred to as \\"cocktail zombies\\". Swenson recalled in an interview how Wendy told him there were attempts to have her institutionalised after she became a rebellious teenager. She was said to have \\"experimented with drugs and furious sex\\" in her teenage years (though years later as an adult woman in 1979 and the early 1980s she would go on to become a \\"teetotaler\\", in the words of her partner). When transitioning into early adulthood, after running away from her family at the age of 16 and leaving the US to explore the world for several years, for a time Wendy became interested in Far Eastern spirituality, religions, and gurus as well as experimenting with mind-altering substances like LSD and mescaline. She continued to try different jobs and lifestyles in order to discover somewhere where she felt she belonged, until eventually finding the show- business magazine ad for Rod Swenson's Sex Fantasy Theater in 1976 ‚Äì he would go on to form and manage their band, the Plasmatics; the two remained lifelong romantic partners until her suicide in 1998. Williams was strictly against sexism in the rock scene. Throughout her musical careers, her songs frequently featured anti-consumerist and anti-establishment messages. Swenson claims that Wendy and he agreed together that they \\"didn't want to do things that sold, [they] wanted to do things that were interesting, new territory\\". A committed vegetarian since 1966 until her death, Williams believed in leading a healthy lifestyle and aiming for self-improvement. She was once featured on the cover of the Vegetarian Times. In her later years, she gave up smoking (which she felt very strongly about and would not allow anyone to smoke in her changing rooms) as well as eventually stopping drinking entirely and never using any other drugs; she also became strongly opposed to the high sugar content in easily available processed foods. Swenson recalls that: \\"[Wendy] was a consummate professional, always working on her craft, working on the show. She would work out hours every day, she would run six miles a day. She was a total vegetarian, totally into health food. When we were on the road, she always made sure the band was well fed. No processed meats, no white bread\\". She was known for refusing to wear makeup products manufactured by companies that used animals for laboratory experimentation and she was completely against needless poaching. After leaving the music scene, Swenson and Williams moved to Storrs, Connecticut, in 1991 to live in the geodesic dome house that they built for each other. Wendy worked at a food co-op and became a wildlife rehabilitator to help animals, which she loved since her childhood as she was known for taking in and helping wounded wild animals as a child. Williams once described herself as a \\"marginal nymphomaniac and terminal exhibitionist\\". Several sources state that she was struggling with deep depression for many years before her death, as the two suicide attempts prior to her death also indicate. Although some have retroactively referred to her as straight edge, and her lifestyle supports this as she never used drugs and stopped drinking/smoking at a certain point in her life, there is no known evidence to suggest that Wendy identified as such. When Williams was promoting Kommander of Kaos during a televised interview with Joan Rivers, the host says that Wendy's favorite movie is The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ‚Äì which could either be a true statement or a simple reference to the Plasmatics' onstage stunts at their concerts, that regularly involved acts of destruction and chainsawing through guitars. In several interviews, Williams has spoken about her passion for tattoos. On her brief appearance in the adult film Candy Goes to Hollywood, Wendy was quoted as saying: \\"It was just like working in a donut shop, except you didn't wear a paper hat\\".

Wang is also known by the courtesy name Xiaoyu (). He is most well known in the West for his series of interlinked novels, collectively referred to as Crane-Iron Series, which includes Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The novel been adapted to film and television several times, most notably the award-winning film adaptation of the same name directed by Ang Lee.  Early life  Wang was born in 1909 in Beijing to a poor family of Bannerman background. (His ancestors were ethnic Han Chinese adopted into the Manchu Eight Banners.)„ÄäÈáëÂâõÁéâÂØ∂Âäç„ÄãÁ∏ΩÂ∫èÔºåÂåóÂ≤≥ÊñáËóùÂá∫ÁâàÁ§æÔºå2017, p. 6: \\"ÁéãÊ∞èÁï∂Â±¨Á∑®ÂÖ•ÊªøÊ¥≤Èë≤ÈªÉÊóóÁöÑ‚ÄúÊº¢Âßì‰∫∫‚Äù...Êªø‰∫∫Êää‰ªñÂÄëË¶ñÁÇ∫ÂêåÊóè„ÄÇ\\" He worked as an editor for a newspaper agency, and as a clerk for a merchant association before becoming a writer. He is reported to have been self- educated. However, he graduated high school in 1924, and worked infrequently as a teacher until he moved to Beijing in 1931. He also worked as freelance editor and journalist. He and Li Danquan were married in 1935. They had three children. Some sources credit Li as a working as journalist or editor at Minyabao (), a daily newspaper, where Wang also worked.  Career  Wang wrote more than twenty novels from 1931 to 1949, though some sources attribute as many fifty novels to him. Most of his earlier works were detective and mystery novels. He began writing wuxia novels after moving to Qingdao, sometime before 1938. The Epoch Times reported that Wang wrote serialized stories for Qingdao Xinmin Daily () newspaper during this period. From 1939 to 1949, Wang produced as many as sixteen wuxia novels. = Crane-Iron Series = Wang most popular works are collectively referred to as the Crane-Iron Series (), named after the first characters in the titles of the first and last installments in the series. The series‚Äô five novels chronicle the struggles of four generations of youxia (), often translated as wandering heroes. Each novel contains elements which link it with the others. Portions or possibly all of the novels may have been serialized. The publication history is not clear. Wang was also known to self-publish, and promote his own works. The following titles are arranged in internal chronological order rather than by their publication date: # Crane Startles Kunlun (, serialized 1940-1941https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÁéãÂ∫¶Â∫ê/171847?fr=aladdin) # Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin (, serialized 1938-1939; collected edition 1939https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÁéãÂ∫¶Â∫ê/171847?fr=aladdin) # Sword Force, Pearl Shine (, serialized 1939-1940; collected edition 1941https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÁéãÂ∫¶Â∫ê/171847?fr=aladdin) # Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (, serialized 1941-1942; collected edition 1948https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÁéãÂ∫¶Â∫ê/171847?fr=aladdin) # Iron Knight, Silver Vase (, serialized 1942-1944; collected edition 1948https://baike.baidu.com/item/ÁéãÂ∫¶Â∫ê/171847?fr=aladdin) Crane Startles Kunlun was written third, after Sword Force, Pearl Shine, and serialized under the title Dancing Crane, Singing Luan (). The official website of actress Michelle Yeoh includes an English-language summary of the series. = Translations = The two first volumes were translated into French, and published by Calmann- L√©vy. As of 2017, no official English language translations of his novels exist. However, there is a manhua series of the same name (and a second, revised edition), created by Andy Seto. The plot of the manhua departs substantially from the novels. An unofficial English translation of Crane Startles Kunlun exists, and a translation is currently in progress for Precious Sword, Golden Hairpin. = Adaptations = Ang Lee's 2000 film adaptation, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, included elements from other books in the Crane series, and also took liberties with the novel it was based on. The changes emphasized the romantic relationships between the protagonists from the novel. The film was also pitched as a martial-arts adaptation of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. In 2013, The Weinstein Company announced an English-language adaptation of Iron Knight, Silver Vase was in development, with Ronny Yu attached to direct. The film was later renamed Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny, and principal photography began in August 2014, with Yuen Woo-ping as director.  Later life and death  After the Chinese Civil War, Wang was assigned to work as a school teacher by Communist leaders, who labelled him an \\"old literati\\". He was forbidden from producing new works. Following his retirement, possibly around 1966, he was labelled a \\"reactionary literati\\", thus the Communist Party punitively sentenced him to farm labor. He died from an unknown illness on . Prior to his death he made several attempts to return to his wife and family who were living in Shenyang. In 1999, Wang‚Äôs widow Ms. Li Dan Quan met with Ang Lee and Michelle Yeoh during the production of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Criticism  Wang is considered to be one of the pioneers of the modern wuxia genre, along with other established wuxia writers such as Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng. He is also regarded as one of the \\"Ten Great Writers\\", and one of the \\"Four Great Writers of the Northern School\\", which included Li Shoumin, Gong Baiyu and Zheng Zhengyin. Zhang Gansheng, a scholar of modern and contemporary Chinese literature, has characterized Wang as perfecting the wuxia genre, and paving the way for a generation of great writers. However, according to Xu Sinian, another scholar, there has not been any detailed critique of Wang's works, apart from that of the Taiwanese scholar Ye Hongsheng.

It was founded in 1943 as an orthodox Protestant underground newspaper during World War II. Since 2009, it has been owned by DPG Media (known as De Persgroep until 2019). Trouw received the European Newspaper Award in 2012. Cees van der Laan is the current editor-in-chief. History Trouw is a Dutch word meaning \\"fidelity\\", \\"loyalty\\", or \\"allegiance\\", and is cognate with the English adjective \\"true\\". The name was chosen to reflect allegiance and loyalty to God and Country in spite of the German occupation of The Netherlands. Trouw was started during World War II by members of the Dutch Protestant resistance. Hundreds of people involved in the production and distribution of the newspaper were arrested and killed during the war. The newspaper was published irregularly during the war due to lack of paper. In 1944 the Nazi occupying forces tried to stop publication by rounding up and imprisoning some 23 of the couriers. They issued an ultimatum to the leaders of Trouw; however, the editors did not give in and all of the captured couriers were executed. Amongst the people that lost their life during the war due to their involvement with the newspaper was Trouw co-founder and resistance member Wim Speelman. After the war the paper became a daily, its allegiance to the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. By 1967, though, the paper's chief editor made it clear that Trouw was not to be considered a paper only for Christians: it wanted to be a paper for everyone. In the course of time the percentage of Trouw readers that belong to the Reformed churches shrank considerably: in 1965 69% of readers belonged to one of those churches, but by 1979 this had dropped to 48%, and by 1999 to 28%. Circulation at the end of the 20th century was a little over 133,000. On 3 February 2005, Trouw changed its format from broadsheet to compact. In their own words, in 2005, they intended to \\"remain a newspaper rooted in a Christian tradition and to be a source of contemplation and inspiration for everyone, churchgoer or not, who feels a need for moral and spiritual orientation.\\" Today, Trouw is a part of the De Persgroep Nederland, the name given to the former PCM group after the Belgian publishing house De Persgroep bought a majority stake in PCM in the summer of 2009.

A Handbook to Literature Fourth Edition (1980), C. Hugh Holman, Ed., pp. 91‚Äì92 The satire of fashion, manners, and outlook on life of the social classes, is realised with stock characters, such as the braggart soldier of Ancient Greek comedy, and the fop and the rake of English Restoration comedy.George Henry Nettleton, Arthur British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan p.149 The clever plot of a comedy of manners (usually a scandal) is secondary to the social commentary thematically presented through the witty dialogue of the characters, e.g. The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), by Oscar Wilde, which satirises the sexual hypocrisies of Victorian morality. The comedy-of-manners genre originated in the New Comedy period (325‚Äì260 BC) of Classical Greece (510‚Äì323 BC), and is known from fragments of works by the playwright Menander, whose style of writing, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by Roman playwrights, such as Plautus and Terence, whose comedies were known to and staged during the Renaissance. In the 17th century, the comedy of manners is best realised in the plays of Moli√®re, such as The School for Wives (1662), The Imposter (1664), and The Misanthrope (1666), which satirise the hypocrisies and pretensions of the ancien r√©gime that ruled France from the late 15th century to the 18th century.  Early examples  The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. Horace's Satire 1.9 is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit. William Shakespeare's Much Ado about Nothing might be considered the first comedy of manners In England, but the genre really flourished during the Restoration period. Restoration comedy, which was influenced by Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time. The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of William Wycherley (The Country Wife, 1675) and William Congreve (The Way of the World, 1700). In the late 18th century Oliver Goldsmith (She Stoops to Conquer, 1773) and Richard Brinsley Sheridan (The Rivals, 1775; The School for Scandal, 1777) revived the form.  More recent examples  The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting, and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright Oscar Wilde in Lady Windermere's Fan (1892) and The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists No√´l Coward (Hay Fever, 1925) and Somerset Maugham. Other early twentieth-century examples of comedies of manners include George Bernard Shaw's 1913 play Pygmalion (later adapted into the musical My Fair Lady), E. M. Forster's A Room with a View, and the Jeeves and Wooster stories of P. G. Wodehouse. The term comedy of menace, which British drama critic Irving Wardle based on the subtitle of The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace (1958), by David Campton, is a jocular play-on-words derived from the \\"comedy of manners\\" (menace being manners pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent).Susan Hollis Merritt, Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (Durham & London, 1990: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9‚Äì10, 225‚Äì28, 240. Harold Pinter's play The Homecoming has been described as a mid-twentieth-century \\"comedy of manners\\". Other more recent examples include Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, Barbara Pym's Excellent Women, Douglas Carter Beane's As Bees in Honey Drown, The Country Club, and The Little Dog Laughed. In Boston Marriage (1999), David Mamet chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme). Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class. Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity. Comedies of manners have been a staple of British film and television. The Carry On films are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners style, and elements of the style can be found in The Beatles' films A Hard Day's Night and Help!. Television series by David Croft in collaboration with Jimmy Perry (Dad's Army) and with Jeremy Lloyd (Are You Being Served?) might also be considered examples of the genre. Television series such as George and Mildred, Absolutely Fabulous, The Young Ones, and The League of Gentlemen also contain many elements of the genre. Though less common as a genre in American television, series such as Frasier, Ugly Betty, Soap, and The Nanny are also comedies of manners.

This \\"blobby\\" appearance makes them versatile tools, often used to model organic objects and also to create base meshes for sculpting.https://www.blendernation.com/2008/03/25/metaballs- as-digital-clay/ The technique for rendering metaballs was invented by Jim Blinn in the early 1980s to model atom interactions for Carl Sagan's 1980 TV series Cosmos.http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/misc/metaballs.html It is also referred to colloquially as the \\"jelly effect\\" in the motion and UX design community, commonly appearing in UI elements such as navigations and buttons. Metaball behavior corresponds to mitosis in cell biology, where chromosomes generate identical copies of itself through cell division.  Definition  Each metaball is defined as a function in n dimensions (e.g., for three dimensions, f(x,y,z); three-dimensional metaballs tend to be most common, with two-dimensional implementations popular as well). A thresholding value is also chosen, to define a solid volume. Then, :\\\\sum_{i=0}^m \\\\mbox{metaball}_i(x,y,z) \\\\leq \\\\mbox{threshold} represents whether the volume enclosed by the surface defined by m metaballs is filled at (x,y,z) or not.  Implementation  Bryce. Note that the two smaller metaballs combine to create one larger object. A typical function chosen for metaballs is the inverse-square law, that is the contribution to the thresholding function falls off in a bell as the distance from the centre of the metaball increases. For the three dimensional case f(x,y,z) = 1 / ((x-x_0)^2 + (y-y_0)^2 + (z-z_0)^2), where (x_0, y_0, z_0) is the center of the metaball. However, due to the division, it is computationally expensive. For this reason, approximate polynomial functions are typically used. When seeking a more efficient falloff function, several qualities are desired: * Finite support. A function with finite support goes to zero at a maximum radius. When evaluating the metaball field, any points beyond their maximum radius from the sample point can be ignored. A hierarchical culling system can thus ensure only the closest metaballs will need to be evaluated regardless of the total number in the field. * Smoothness. Because the isosurface is the result of adding the fields together, its smoothness is dependent on the smoothness of the falloff curves. The simplest falloff curve that satisfies these criteria is f(r) = (1 - r^2)^2, where r is the distance to the point. This formulation avoids expensive square root calls. More complicated models use a Gaussian potential constrained to a finite radius or a mixture of polynomials to achieve smoothness. The Soft Object model by the Wyvill brothers provides higher degree of smoothness and still avoids square roots. A simple generalization of metaballs is to apply the falloff curve to distance-from-lines or distance- from-surfaces. There are a number of ways to render the metaballs to the screen. In the case of three dimensional metaballs, the two most common are brute force raycasting and the marching cubes algorithm. 2D metaballs were a very common demo effect in the 1990s. The effect is also available as an XScreensaver module.

Biography Born in New York City, Turner was pushed into appearing on the stage at age three by her ambitious mother. Turner became a regular performer in a variety of productions. In 1906 she joined the fledgling motion picture business, signing with the pioneering Vitagraph Studios and making her film debut in How to Cure a Cold (June 8, 1907). At the time there were no stars per se, unless an already famous stage star made a movie. Performers were not even mentioned by name. Long, drawn out screen credits were not thought of. There was nothing but the name of the company and the picture. As the content of movies evolved from simple incidents, or situations, into definite stories, some of the heroes and heroines were conceded a vague identity, such as the \\"Edison Girl\\", etc. Vitagraph Girl\\" in 1912 Though she was known only as the \\"Vitagraph Girl\\" in the early motion picture shorts, Turner became the most popular American actress to appear on screen (at that time still dominated by French pictures, especially from the Pathe and Gaumont companies). Her worth to the studio, as its biggest box-office draw, was recognised in 1907 when her pay was upped to $22 a week, as proto-star plus part-time seamstress. It was somewhat less than the male leading players, especially those with stage experience, particularly the super-popular Maurice Costello. In March 1910 she and Florence Lawrence became the first screen actors not already famous in another medium to be publicized by name by their studios to the general public.Eileen Bowser, The Transformation of Cinema, 1907‚Äì1915, University of California Press, 1994, p. 112‚Äì113. . Later that year, Florence was paired several times with heart throb Wallace Reid, who was on his way to stardom. But with the rise of more stars such as Gene Gauntier and Marin Sais at Kalem Studios, Marion Leonard and Mary Pickford at Biograph Studios, and Florence Lawrence (Biograph, moving to IMP in 1910), Florence Turner was no longer quite as special. By 1913 she was looking for new pastures and left the United States accompanied by longtime friend Laurence Trimble, who directed her in a number of movies.Passenger list of S.S.

They moved to England, where she and Larry began performing together in London music halls. Turner sometimes wrote screenplays and directed her own movies, including a number of comedies. She also organized her own production company, Turner Films, for which she made more than thirty shorts.Florence Turner at bfi.org.uk, accessed 16 April 2020 These were shot at the Walton Studios of Cecil Hepworth, west of London. Turner entertained Allied troops during World War I. She returned to the U.S. after the Armistice, but was not as successful as before. In 1920, she again went to England, where she remained until moving to Hollywood, virtually forgotten, in 1924.\\"Would You Be Famous?

In 1928 she acted in a minor role on Broadway in Sign of the Leopard, which ran for 39 performances.Internet Broadway Database. Turner was placed on the payroll at MGM by Louis B. Mayer in the 1930s, but was limited in the assignments offered. She mostly played bit or small parts and worked as an extra. She later moved to the Motion Picture Country House, a retirement community for the industry in Woodland Hills, California. After appearing in more than 160 motion pictures, Florence Turner died at 61 in Woodland Hills. She was cremated at a mortuary in Hollywood and, at her request, there was no funeral service.

Established in 1859, it is Italy‚Äôs oldest technical university. The university offers several courses in the fields of Engineering, Architecture and Industrial Design. History The Regio Politecnico di Torino (Royal Turin Polytechnic) was established in 1906. The present-day institution was preceded by the Scuola di Applicazione per gli Ingegneri (Technical School for Engineers, which was founded in 1859 in application of the Casati law) and the Museo Industriale Italiano (Italian Industry Museum) founded in 1862 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Trade and Industry.History ‚Äì Politecnico di Torino The Technical School for Engineers was part of the University, which led to technical studies being accepted as part of higher education. In those times Italy was about to begin a new industrial era, which the Industry Museum was to address more directly thanks to famous scholars and researchers dealing with new subjects such as electrotechnics and building science. The new school was deeply concerned with the needs of the Italian society and its development perspectives. Like other well known Polytechnic Schools in the first years of the 20th century the Regio Politecnico di Torino had several goals and began contacting the European academic world and the Italian industry. Aeronautics began as a subject. Students from all over Italy came to Turin and found in the new laboratories built for the study of various subjects ranging from chemistry to architecture in a positive and helpful atmosphere. During November 1958 a large complex of buildings located in Corso Duca degli Abruzzi was inaugurated in order to expand the volume and the facilities offered by the historical headquarters of Valentino Castle (Castello del Valentino), given in 1859 to the Technical School for Engineers. In the 1990s, new teaching campuses were opened in Alessandria, Biella, Ivrea and Mondov√¨. Campuses Campuses of the Politecnico di Torino draw inspiration from the structure of Anglo-Saxon ones, with multipurpose buildings for teaching, basis and applied research and services to the students in Turin, and a regional network of technological centers (Alessandria, Biella, Mondov√¨, Verr√®s), dedicated to research activities, technological transfer, specialist education and services to the region. The historical and representative base of the Politecnico is in the town, on the River Po: the Castle of Valentino, a House of Savoy of the 17th Century. It is the main teaching campus for Architecture and has an area of 23.000 sq. m. The big complex in corso Duca degli Abruzzi ‚Äì with 122.000 sq. m., the main campus of Engineering ‚Äì was opened in 1958 and it is completed by the Cittadella Politecnica: a modern complex of 170,000 sq. m. adjoining to the main building, including areas dedicated to students, research activities, technological transfer and services. The newest campus is the Design and Sustainable Mobility Citadel, in an area adjoining to the manufacturing establishment of Mirafiori, FIAT manufacturing facility which has been remodeled as well as the Lingotto building, which hosts the Master School.

It is located below the granite dome, Liberty Cap, at the west end of Little Yosemite Valley. The waterfall is widely recognized by its \\"bent\\" shape, in which the water free- falls for roughly the first third of its length to a steep slick-rock slope. This mid-fall impact of the water on the cliff face creates a turbulent, whitewater appearance in the fall and produces a great deal of mist which covers a wide radius, which led to its current name (Nevada is a Spanish word meaning \\"snowy\\"). The Indian name was Yo-wy-we, signifying the twist or squirm of the falling water. Lafayette Bunnell suggested the name \\"Nevada\\" for the waterfall. He wrote, \\"The Nevada Fall was so called because it was the nearest to the Sierra Nevada, and because the name was sufficiently indicative of a wintry companion for our spring (Vernal Fall)... The white, foaming water, as it dashed down Yo-wy-we from the snowy mountains, represented to my mind a vast avalanche of snow.\\"Bunnell, Lafayette H. (1892) Discovery of the Yosemite. Chapter 13, p. 205. The Emerald Pool forms on the \\"step\\" between Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall downstream. The high Vernal Fall is a short hike from the bottom of Nevada Fall. They form a cascade in which the Merced River flows down to Yosemite Valley. This cascade is sometimes called the giant staircase, which is evident when viewed from above, at Glacier Point. The hike to the top of Nevada Fall, along the Mist Trail, is from the trailhead in Yosemite Valley. One must first hike to Vernal Fall and then trek another to reach the top. The John Muir Trail, which starts near the trail to Happy Isles, goes to the top of Nevada Fall.  Hazards  In spite of the dangers and deaths as recently as June 2013, the pool above Nevada Fall remains a popular swimming location, with no park restrictions. In June 2018, an 18-year-old man fell to his death from the edge of the fall while attempting to take a selfie.

Members of IHSA participate at horse shows, regardless of their experience or financial status. Students compete at eight levels from beginner through advanced with provided horses, eliminating the expense of horse ownership. Founded in 1967 by Bob Cacchione, it is the oldest and largest intercollegiate equestrian organization with 10,000 members in 47 states and Canada. IHSA college and university team participation is represented through a variety of programs including varsity athletics, academic departments and club sports. IHSA offers hands-on experience and professional development in multiple facets of the equine industry. Many IHSA teams participate in service projects, giving back to their communities. An estimated 250,000 people have participated in the IHSA and it contributes a significant percentage of membership to the U.S. Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA), the U.S. Equestrian Federation (USEF), the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) and the National Reining Horse Association (NRHA). Divisions Within the IHSA, riders compete as individuals and teams in English riding (hunter seat equitation, aka, 'flat,' and over fences) or Western riding (Western horsemanship and reining). There are eight hunter seat levels total of nine classes including: Introductory, Pre-Novice, Novice, Limit on the flat and over fences, Intermediate on the flat and over fences, and Open on the flat and over fences. Alumni on the flat and Alumni over fences may also be offered. For the Hunter Seat divisions, over fences, the Limit division jumps are set at 2‚Äô-2‚Äô3‚Äù, Intermediate jumps at 2‚Äô6‚Äù-2‚Äô9‚Äù and Open jumps at 2‚Äô9‚Äù-3‚Äô. The Limit courses tend to be very straight forward while the Open courses require more challenging patterns such as bending lines or rollback turns. In Western Horsemanship there are six levels: Beginner Western Horsemanship, Rookie A and B, Novice, Level I, Level II, Open and Open Reining. Alumni Horsemanship may be offered. Judging In both Hunter Seat and Western divisions, riders are judged on their equitation, i.e., each rider is individually judged on their effectiveness in communicating with their horse, while maintaining proper form. The best top competitors make their riding appear smooth and effortless. IHSA shows are unlike open horse shows. An IHSA team organizes and hosts each show and invites other member colleges in its IHSA Region to compete. The show is usually at the host team's facility or nearby. Competitors are not permitted to ride their own horses. IHSA show horses are provided by host stables or \\"donated\\" for the day from other teams, coaches or area equestrian facilities. Each horse is schooled (warmed-up) before classes begin by non-competing riders, while student competitors observe to ascertain particular attributes of each potential horse. Each rider is assigned a horse, through random selection, called the \\"draw\\" and partially through a matching of the horse's abilities with those needed for horses participating in certain classes (for example, the more highly trained horses are used in the Open divisions, or a horse that doesn't jump would be put in a flat instead of an over fences class). The rider may or may not know anything about this horse, but the rider is expected to be able to ride any horse that is considered to be at the level that they are in. The rider mounts the horse he has been assigned just before his class is scheduled to begin. Competing riders are not permitted to warm-up their assigned horse except at the walk. One of the goals of the IHSA is to provide all riders with an equal chance of performing well in their class; by not allowing riders to compete on horses that they are comfortable with, judges can accurately rate the ability of the rider to effectively control the horse and ride well. Individual ribbons correspond to points, which combine for a team score. Each team can have only one 'point rider' per division and the lowest score on their card is dropped. Thus larger teams do not get an advantage. A cumulative team score of 49 points for Hunter Seat or 42 points for Western would be a 'perfect' card. To keep divisions fair, a rider may only score a given number of points before they must graduate to another level of riding experience. Points correspond as follows: :General Points Awarded through the Zone/Semi-Final Level :* 1st place: 7 points :* 2nd place: 5 points :* 3rd place: 4 points :* 4th place: 3 points :* 5th place: 2 points :* 6th place: 1 point Nationals Points Points will be counted as follows: * First place 10 points * Second place 8 points * Third place 7 points * Fourth place 6 points * Fifth place 5 points * Sixth place 4 points * Seventh place 3 points * Eighth place 2 points * Ninth place 1 point * Tenth place 1/2 point To qualify for IHSA Regionals (the first step toward qualifying for the oldest and largest annual collegiate riding championships in America, the IHSA National Championships), a rider must accumulate a certain number of points. Once a rider has qualified for IHSA Regionals in a division, they must compete the rest of the year in the next division. The one exception are Introductory and Beginner divisions. However, a rider is only allowed to remain in the Introductory or Beginner division for two years before moving up to the next division. IHSA Regional qualifiers then progress to IHSA Zone Championships, and Western Semi-Finals whose qualifiers then compete to represent their college or university at the IHSA National Championships. Competition With 400+ teams and more than 10,000 members, the IHSA divides the country into eight zones organized geographically. Every zone is divided into regions, and each region ranges with approximately five to 15 collegiate teams. The teams within the region compete against each other in two to ten horse shows per year. Each place (first through sixth) has an assigned point value that accumulates throughout the seasons. When riders acquire thirty-six (or twenty- eight for Open) points in their division, they qualify to compete in the Regional Finals competition. The top two riders in each class move on to compete in the Zone Finals and the top rider from Zones move on to Nationals.

When the material comes to rest in the ocean trough, it is the sand and other coarse material which settles first followed by mud and eventually the very fine particulate matter. It is this sequence of deposition that creates the Bouma sequences that characterize these rocks. A turbidite is the geologic deposit of a turbidity current, which is a type of sediment gravity flow responsible for distributing vast amounts of clastic sediment into the deep ocean. Sequencing Turbidite sequence. Carboniferous Ross Sandstone Formation (Namurian), County Clare, Western Ireland (USGS image) Complete Bouma sequence in Devonian Sandstone (Becke-Oese Quarry, Germany) Turbidites were first properly described by Arnold H. Bouma (1962),Bouma, Arnold H. (1962) Sedimentology of some Flysch deposits: A graphic approach to facies interpretation, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 168 p who studied deepwater sediments and recognized particular \\"fining-up intervals\\" within deep water, fine-grained shales, which were anomalous because they started at pebble conglomerates and terminated in shales. This was anomalous because within the deep ocean it had historically been assumed that there was no mechanism by which tractional flow could carry and deposit coarse-grained sediments into the abyssal depths. Bouma cycles begin with an erosional contact of a coarse lower bed of pebble to granule conglomerate in a sandy matrix, and grade up through coarse then medium plane parallel sandstone; through cross-bedded sandstone; rippled cross-bedded sand/silty sand, and finally laminar siltstone and shale. This vertical succession of sedimentary structures, bedding, and changing lithology is representative of strong to waning flow regime currents and their corresponding sedimentation. It is unusual to see all of a complete Bouma cycle, as successive turbidity currents may erode the unconsolidated upper sequences. Alternatively, the entire sequence may not be present depending on whether the exposed section was at the edge of the turbidity current lobe (where it may be present as a thin deposit), or upslope from the deposition centre and manifested as a scour channel filled with fine sands grading up into a pelagic ooze. It is now recognized that the vertical progression of sedimentary structures described by Bouma applies to turbidites deposited by low-density turbidity currents. As the sand concentration of a flow increases, grain-to-grain collisions within the turbid suspension create dispersive pressures that become important in hindering further settling of grains. As a consequence, a slightly different set of sedimentary structures develops in turbidites deposited by high-density turbidity currents. This different set of structures is known as the Lowe sequence, which is a descriptive classification that complements, but does not replace, the Bouma sequence.Lowe, D.R. (1982), Sediment gravity flows: II. Depositional models with special reference to the deposits of high-density turbidity currents, Journal of Sedimentology, Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, v. 52, p. 279-297. Formation Gorgoglione Flysch, Miocene, South Italy Turbidites are sediments which are transported and deposited by density flow, not by tractional or frictional flow. The distinction is that, in a normal river or stream bed, particles of rock are carried along by frictional drag of water on the particle (known as tractional flow). The water must be travelling at a certain velocity in order to suspend the particle in the water and push it along. The greater the size or density of the particle relative to the fluid in which it is travelling, the higher the water velocity required to suspend it and transport it. Density-based flow, however, occurs when liquefaction of sediment during transport causes a change to the density of the fluid. This is usually achieved by highly turbulent liquids which have a suspended load of fine grained particles forming a slurry. In this case, larger fragments of rock can be transported at water velocities too low to otherwise do so because of the lower density contrast (that is, the water plus sediment has a higher density than the water and is therefore closer to the density of the rock). This condition occurs in many environments aside from simply the deep ocean, where turbidites are particularly well represented. Lahars on the side of volcanoes, mudslides and pyroclastic flows all create density-based flow situations and, especially in the latter, can create sequences which are strikingly similar to turbidites. Turbidites in sediments can occur in carbonate as well as siliciclastic sequences. Classic, low- density turbidites are characterized by graded bedding, current ripple marks, climbing ripple laminations, alternating sequences with pelagic sediments, distinct fauna changes between the turbidite and native pelagic sediments, sole markings, thick sediment sequences, regular bedding, and an absence of shallow-water features.Fairbridge, Rhodes W. (ed.) (1966) The Encyclopedia of Oceanography, Encyclopedia of earth sciences series 1, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York, p. 945‚Äì946. A different vertical progression of sedimentary structures characterize high-density turbidites. Massive accumulations of turbidites and other deep-water deposits may result in the formation of submarine fans. Sedimentary models of such fan systems typically are subdivided into upper, mid, and lower fan sequences each with distinct sand- body geometries, sediment distributions, and lithologic characteristics.Mutti, E. & Ricci Lucci, F. (1975) Turbidite facies and facies associations. In: Examples of turbidite facies and associations from selected formations of the northern Apennines. IX Int. Congress of Sedimentology, Field Trip A-11, p. 21‚Äì36.Normark, W.R. (1978) \\"Fan valleys, channels, and depositional lobes on modern submarine fans : Characters for recognition of sandy turbidite environments\\", American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 62 (6), p. 912‚Äì931.Walker, R.G. (1978) \\"Deep-water sandstone facies and ancient submarine fans: model for exploration for stratigraphic traps\\", American Association of Petroleum Geologists Bulletin, 62 (6), p. 932‚Äì966. Turbidite deposits typically occur in foreland basins. Importance Turbidites provide a mechanism for assigning a tectonic and depositional setting to ancient sedimentary sequences as they usually represent deep-water rocks formed offshore of a convergent margin, and generally require at least a sloping shelf and some form of tectonism to trigger density-based avalanches. Density currents may be triggered in areas of high sediment supply by gravitational failure alone. Turbidites can represent a high resolution record of seismicity, and terrestrial storm/flood events depending on the connectivity of canyon/channel systems to terrestrial sediment sources.Goldfinger et al., 2012 Turbidites from lakes and fjords are also important as they can provide chronologic evidence of the frequency of landslides and the earthquakes that presumably formed them, by dating using radiocarbon or varves above and below the turbidite.Moernaut et al., 2007, Strasser et al., 2002Enkin et al., 2013 Economic importance Turbidite sequences are classic hosts for lode gold deposits, the prime example being Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, Australia, where more than 2,600 tons of gold have been extracted from saddle-reef deposits hosted in shale sequences from a thick succession of Cambrian- Ordovician turbidites. Proterozoic gold deposits are also known from turbidite basin deposits. Lithified accumulations of turbidite deposits may, in time, become hydrocarbon reservoirs and the petroleum industry makes strenuous efforts to predict the location, overall shape, and internal characteristics of these sediment bodies in order to efficiently develop fields as well as explore for new reserves.

The show was the brainchild of Spanish writer Dolores Rico Oliver (better known for her artistic name, Lolo Rico) and was hosted by pop singer Alaska. It is worth noting the continuous recognition of different sectors of society towards this program that went beyond the norm set by the children's programs of its time and other more current ones, and that bet on treating children as adults. The show, which was ostensibly targeted at a young audience, reflected the spirit of the times, that of the post-Franco Spanish transition and of the cultural and musical movement known as la movida. In contrast to previous shows, with a very childish use of language, it had continuous puns related to electronics: the Electroduendes (\\"Electrogoblins\\") puppets included Maese C√°mara, Hada V√≠deo and Bruja Aver√≠a (the Breakdown Witch) as regular characters. In one of its sections, they used to introduce an episode of classic American series. The first season included The Little Rascals, the second season, The Munsters, and the third season, Bewitched.

It is based on the Honda Ballade and used a Honda-designed engine, but met United Kingdom component-content requirements. It was the final model of the Triumph marque, and the first fundamentally Japanese car to be assembled in Europe. 1984 Triumph Acclaim HLS Trio-Auto rear The development process began in 1978, when British Leyland entered into negotiations with Honda to develop a new small family saloon. Although the Acclaim officially replaced the Triumph Dolomite, BL's mainstream products in the segment were the Austin Allegro and Austin Maxi - both of which were badly dated and suffered a reputation for poor quality and reliability. The Acclaim was therefore originally intended as a stopgap measure until the Maestro/Montego models were to be ready for production in 1983 and 1984 respectively. On 26 December 1979, Michael Edwardes officially signed a collaboration between the two companies. The new car went into production 18 months later, badged as the Triumph Acclaim and based on the Honda Ballade (which was not sold in Europe). It replaced the Triumph Dolomite, which had finished production a year earlier at the defunct Canley plant in Coventry. The Acclaim was officially launched by BL on 7 October 1981. The end of Dolomite and TR7 production meant that the Acclaim was the only car to wear the Triumph badge after 1981. The Acclaim was significant as the first essentially Japanese car to be built within the European Economic Community (now the European Union), to bypass Japan's voluntary limit of 11 percent market of the total number of European sales. The Acclaim was also a major turnaround point for BL itself, with the car sporting good reliability and build quality from the outset - a stark contrast to the quality issues which had plagued the Austin Allegro and Morris Marina during the 1970s. The Acclaim holds the record for the lowest percentage of warranty claims for a BL car. Unlike previous Triumphs, it was assembled at the Pressed Steel Fisher Plant at Cowley Oxford, taking over the withdrawn Austin Maxi production lines. It paved the way for the Honda-based, Rover-badged range of cars which BL (and successor organisations Austin Rover and Rover Group) would develop throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The most notable outward change from the Honda was the appearance of a central badge on the grille. At the time, the Japanese model had \\"Honda\\" to the right-hand side of the grille. Other changes included twin Keihin carburettors (the Ballade had only a single carburettor), the mirrors were situated on the doors, the independent front and rear MacPherson strut suspension was tweaked for the UK market and the seats were based on Morris Ital frames. The Acclaim was provided in a more luxurious interior trim than its Honda equivalent, even in its base models. The brakes were disc at the front and drum at the rear. All Acclaims were powered by the transverse- mounted all alloy and overhead-cam engine found in the Honda Civic. This engine was a member of the Honda CVCC family, although the cast alloy rocker cover with Honda branding was replaced with a plain black pressed steel item for the Acclaim to disguise the car's Honda origins. The engine drove the front wheels through either a five-speed manual gearbox or a three-speed Trio- matic (which was a manually selectable automatic transmission) gearbox (the same as the Hondamatic) and the interior was nearly identical (except for the seats). The usual BL trim levels were offered: L, HL, HLS and the top of the range CD, which had front and rear electric windows, chrome bumpers, headlamp washers, 165/70 tyres (the L had 145/80 tyres and the HL & HLS had 155/80 tyres), plastic wheel trims, velour upholstery with seat pockets on the back of the front seats, front seat head restraints and optional air conditioning. The car remained largely the same throughout its production life. A Mark 2 version of the Acclaim came out in 1983 (from VI No. 180415 onwards). The main changes were to the exterior door handles, an electronic digital clock replaced the previous mechanical one, a restyled steering wheel, a restyled gear knob, the rear interior door handles (they were just swapped) and the heater recirculation control, which was moved. Mark 2 HL and HLS cars were better equipped than the earlier ones. There was a limited-edition Avon Acclaim, getting its name from Avon coachbuilders of Warwick who did the conversion work, that had leather seats with piping to match the body colour, leather door panels, wooden and leather trimmed dashboard, wooden door cappings, two-tone metallic paint, colour-coded wheels with chrome embellishers, chrome-plated grille, colour-coded headlamp surrounds, vinyl roof and extra soundproofing. There was also an Avon Turbo, which had Lunar alloy wheels with 205/60 tyres, suede upholstery, front air dam, and side decals. A Turbo Technics turbocharger increased the engine's power output from the standard 70 bhp to 105 bhp. It is thought that there are only four surviving Avon Turbos including the press car (VWK689X), which was the first Avon Turbo. The Acclaim was Britain's seventh best selling car in 1982 and the eighth best selling car in 1983. Production finished in the summer of 1984 when the Rover 200 was launched, based on the next incarnation of the Honda Ballade. A total of 133,625 Acclaims were produced, the vast majority of which were sold in the UK. The last Acclaim off the production line (a silver CD with the Trio-matic) is now in the Heritage Motor Centre. The Acclaim's demise saw the end of the Triumph marque as a car (although the name continues in motorcycles), as Austin Rover's restructuring retained only the Austin, Rover and MG marques, and by 1989 even the Austin marque had been axed. Earlier in 1984, Austin Rover had confirmed that the Triumph brand would be discontinued when the Acclaim was replaced, and its successor would be badged as a Rover. On Sunday 9 October 2011, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the launch of the Acclaim, 23 Acclaims were gathered at the Cowley works where the cars were built and the Heritage Motor Centre. This included the oldest known surviving Acclaim, the first Avon Turbo, the final production Acclaim and the only known nut-and-bolt restored Acclaim.

Because of its outstanding performance, the TR8 was often dubbed the \\"English Corvette\\". The majority of TR8s were sold in the United States and Canada. Background A more powerful V8-engined version of the TR7 was planned in the early stages of the TR7's development, a prototype being produced in 1972.William Kimberley, The Complete Guide to the Triumph TR7 and TR8, Chap. 3, 1981 However, British Leyland's financial state, labour problems and lack of engines‚Äîas MG and Range Rover had first priority‚Äîdelayed the project. By 1978 some 145 prototype cars were built with V8 engines (and usually automatic transmissions). These \\"anonymous\\" TR8s (no identifying badges, and all coupes) were evaluated for British Leyland by various dealers and then sold off as used cars. The FIA papers for the TR8 homologation, granted 1 April 1978, include pictures showing a 1977 TR7 V8 prototype with a set of decals indicating it to be a TR7 V8.FIA Book of Recognition number 654 However, oddly, these TR8 homologation pictures also show it had the large \\"Sprint\\" decals on the rear wings, in the same font as the TR7 and V8 decals on the boot lid. It is not clear from the picture of the front of the car whether or not it had a small Sprint decal below the TR7 decal, as is shown on the TR8 prototype in Hardcastle‚Äôs book on the Rover V8 engine.Hardcastle D., The Rover V8 Engine, J H Haynes & Co Ltd; 2nd Revised edition (15 May 1995), . Neither of these decals are part of the set used on the car shown in the TR7 Sprint homologation pictures in the BMIHT archives,Negatives from number T105512 to T105517 (6 negatives), \\"TR7 Sprint Homologation\\", British Motor Industries Heritage Trust Film & Picture Library. and in Knowles‚Äô Triumph TR7 The Untold Story.Knowles D., Triumph TR7 The Untold Story, 2007, pages 110‚Äì5, Crowood Press, . And, unlike that decal set, the Sprint decals shown on this TR8 and that in Hardcastle are not known by any BL part numbers. The official use of these pictures in the homologation process may suggest that BL toyed with the idea of calling this car the \\"TR7 V8 Sprint\\" or \\"TR7 Sprint V8\\", etc., at some point, but did not progress the idea beyond when these photographs were taken. Description The TR8 did not use Triumph's own single overhead cam V8 as found in the Stag due to its weight and service record but instead shared its Rover V8 engine with the Rover SD1. The engine itself was derived from an early 1960s Buick/Oldsmobile all-aluminium V8 that Rover acquired from General Motors in the mid-60s. History has shown this engine to be an extremely reliable, flexible, and robust powerplant, especially after BL developed a better manufacturing process. TR8s were initially fitted with twin Zenith-Stromberg carburetors. However, about 400 1980 models sold in California, all 1981 models‚Äîof which only 352 were produced including twenty carbed cars for the UK market---and all 1982 models (of which all seventy went to Canada) featured a Bosch L-jetronic fuel injection system with a specially designed Lucas fuel injection computer (ECU). The 1980 carburetor model was rated at (at 5000 rpm) and the fuel injected California version at at the same engine speed. For 1981, all North American cars received a unified version with fuel injection, producing at 5100 rpm and delivering 0‚Äì60 mph times in the low 8 seconds. Other differences between the TR8 and TR7 are upgraded brakes, revised axle ratio (3.08:1 on the TR8 and all automatic TR7s), battery moved to the trunk (boot), alloy wheels, leather steering wheel and a few minor trim changes.  Production  TR8 coupes based on the original Harris Mann TR7 design made from 1978 to 1980 are quite rare; it is estimated that only about 400 TR8 coupes ever existed‚Äîthis number from records kept by members of the North America-based wedge club, the Triumph Wedge Owners Association. To the roughly 150 pre-production coupes mentioned above, another 250 or so coupes were produced, some sold in Canada as 1979 models but most ended up being held back and then finally sold in the US as 1980 models. In 1979, a long-anticipated Michelotti-refreshed TR7 Drophead (convertible) was introduced, and almost all subsequent production TR8s were convertibles.Bill Piggott, Original Triumph TR7 & TR8, MBI Publishing, 2000 Total worldwide production, as best as can be determined throughout all the labour turmoil at the time, is only around 2750, give or take a \\"handful\\". (Enthusiast Richard Connew went through the records at British Motor Heritage Industry Trust and counted 2746.) Other estimates exist. The German version of this page claims 2722 and cites the TR Register- Austria as source; 2815 is the number quoted in an article from Classic & Sports Car, March 1986 and in William Kimberley's 1981 bookWilliam Kimberley, The Complete Guide to the Triumph TR7 and TR8, Dalton Watson Ltd., London, 1981 as well. Both the TR7 and TR8 were made until October 1981 when production ceased. Very few genuine TR8s exist outside of the United States and Canada. In other countries the TR7 is often converted to a \\"TR7V8\\" with the same ubiquitous Buick/Rover 3.5 litre V8 powerplant used in original factory TR8s. In Australia a popular TR7V8 conversion is to use the 4416 cc version of this engine that had been developed for the Leyland P76. In North America, the TR8 originally sold for around $11,000. A current rough estimate of the number of these cars remaining taken from the Triumph Wedge Owners Association registry of unique VINs, current Triumph Wedge Owners Association membership records, the World Wide TR7 TR8 Owners Club, and the TR Drivers Club UK is around 1000 convertibles and 200 coupes. As of Q1 2011 there were approximately seventeen licensed and 33 SORN TR8s registered with the DVLA. The accuracy of this data is questionable as many converted TR7s with a V8 have been registered with DVLA as TR8s. Out of these fifty cars, only two are automatic, but more are known to exist. Motorsport TR8 racer on display at the Canadian International Autoshow. Despite their low production numbers, TR8s have an interesting racing history. John Buffum successfully raced one as a rally car in the late 1970s. Bob Tullius of Group 44 fame dominated SCCA racing in 1979 in one, so much so that the SCCA added enough \\"reward\\" weight to the car that Tullius left Trans Am and successfully competed in IMSA GT instead. TR8s ran successfully in the SCCA's showroom stock series being campaigned by Morey Doyle ( Nationals & Regionals) and Ted Schumacher (Nationals). Schumacher with Doyle had great success in the Playboy/Escort Endurance series with his car. Starting the last race of the year, Schumacher was fourth in the overall point standings (just three points away from first) when an accident ruined their chances; nevertheless, Schumacher still ended up seventh in the manufacturer's points for that year, all with no official factory help. Presently, at least three cars are being run in SCCA's ITS class. Morey Doyle and his son Andy run their TR8s in the Midwest Region, currently Morey and his sons, Morey C. and Andy are preparing the car for the SCCA National Runoffs in E-Prod at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (2017). Jeff Young runs his green TR8 in the Southeast Division with numerous regional race wins and the 2011 Southeast Division SARRC ITS championship, running against over seventy other drivers in Mazda RX7s, Miatas, 240/260/280zs, BMW 325is, Porsche 944s and Acura Integras. The TR8 was homologated for Group 4 (racing) on the first of April 1978. According to the FIA rules that applied at this time, recognition would have required the production of 400 similar cars suitable for normal sale. However, production records (in the BMIHT archives) show that only about 150 cars had actually been built by this time, mostly due to major industrial action at the BL Speke plant that included a 17-week-long strike from November 1977. Rally journalist and historian Graham Robson quotes John Davenport (director of BL Motorsport at the time) as reminding him that \\"In those days there was no rigorous FIA inspection system. Provided that one provided production sheets signed by an important manager, then nobody worried....\\" Robson goes on to state that \\"A lot of fast and persuasive talking then went on, to show that the makings of well over 500 [sic] cars were either built, partly built, or stuck in the morass of the Speke strike\\".FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1976: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, 11 December 1975, Article 252, clause g.British Motor Industries Heritage Trust Archives, Heritage Motor Centre, Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.Robson G., The Works Triumphs: 50 Years in Motorsport, 1993, J H Haynes & Co Ltd, . However, the FIA rules are clear that only complete cars may be counted towards this requirement. Unlike the papers for the TR7 homologation in 1975, those for the TR8 homologation in 1978 do not give a production number achieved or a date for this. Hence, it is unclear how many prototype TR8s the FIA believed had been finished. However, it is also well recorded that the Ford Escort RS1800 was re-homologated directly into group 4 in 1977 when there were only ever about 108 produced, and it is possibly only the 50 (X0 marked cars) produced in 1977 were relevant - the cars were required to have been produced within 24 months, and the group 4 Escort RS was homologated with the 1975 cc version of the BDA engine.FIA Book of Recognition number 650FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1976: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, 11 December 1975.Robson G., \\"Ford Escort RS1800\\" Rally Giants, page 30, Veloce Publishing Ltd, 2008, , 9781845841409. It appears then, that where a group 4 car was a modification to an existing approved car, as the TR8 was to the TR7, the FIA were able to grant approval on a much smaller number of cars than the 400 stated in the homologation requirements, possibly only about 50 cars. This also appears to apply to the Vauxhall Chevette HSR, Porsche 924 Carrera GTS, and Triumph TR7 Sprint (for the re- approval of the 16-valve head, to allow its continued use into 1978, following a change to the FIA homologation rules), where it is clear that the FIA could not have been persuaded that 400 cars had been or would ever be produced. The TR8 was not a production car in April 1978 and did not go on sale in North America until mid-1979. According to Graham Robson, the Group 4 rally car was therefore called the TR7V8 as a compromise with BL Sales and Marketing.

It has been there for centuries and is used in a variety of roles. Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced on the moors, the Dartmoor is a particularly hardy breed with excellent stamina. Over the centuries, it has been used as a working animal by local tin miners and quarry workers. It is kept in a semiferal state on Dartmoor. Despite this, numbers living on the open moor have declined from an estimated 5,000 in 1900 to about 300 registered ponies today. Only around 800 ponies were known to be grazing the moor in the spring of 2004.BBC News, April 2004 Breed characteristics The Dartmoor Pony has a small head, with large, wide-set eyes and alert ears. The body is strong, with a broad, deep rib cage, and of medium length. The legs are strong, long from body to knee and hock, but with short cannons with strong, dense bone, and a flat-fronted knee; the foreleg rises to a shoulder that is well-angled and with good freedom of movement, and the hindleg rises to a quarter that is well-muscled and rounded in appearance, rather than flat or sloping. The mane and tail should be full and flowing, and the pony's movement free and smooth. The Dartmoor Pony has a kind temperament, being reliable, gentle, and calm. Most Dartmoors stand between ; a pony should stand at no more than 12.2 hands under the breed standard, introduced in 1924. Recognised colours include bay, brown, black, grey, chestnut, or roan. Piebald and skewbald colouring is not permitted within the Dartmoor Pony breed. Ponies with this colouring, seen running on Dartmoor, are likely to be Dartmoor Hill Ponies, as Dartmoor commoners may graze any type of pony out on the moors.Dartmoor Commoners Council The Dartmoor Hill Pony is classified as a pony born on Dartmoor, but not a purebred registered Dartmoor Pony. It is not a true breed as such, as the registry for Dartmoor Hill Ponies is open only to those born on the moors, so a pony born of two Dartmoor Hill ponies, but not born on the moors, could not be registered with the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association.Ponies found on Dartmoor , The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association Although Exmoor Ponies live fairly close geographically and their markings are somewhat similar, evidence now suggests that Dartmoor and Exmoor Ponies are not related as was once thought. History The bones of prehistoric horses have been found in chamber tombs dating from Vere Gordon Childe's period III - IV in southern Britain. This would date the bones at the transition from a hunter-gatherer society to an agricultural society (the Neolithic Revolution) around 3500 BC; the bones are probably from wild horses but domestication may have begun by that date. Archeological investigation from the 1970s has shown that domesticated ponies were to be found on Dartmoor as early as 1500 BC. The first written record, dated to AD 1012, refers to wild horses at Ashburton, and early records from Dartmoor manors refer to ponies being branded and earmarked.Local Government Factsheet A Dartmoor mare nursing her foal The Dartmoor Pony was used in medieval times for carrying heavy loads of tin from the mines across the moor. When the mines closed, some ponies were kept for farming, but most were turned out onto the moor. Ponies were bred at Dartmoor Prison from the early 1900s until the 1960s, and used by guards for escorting prisoners. The Dartmoor received Arab blood from the stallion Dwarka, foaled in 1922, as well as Dwarka‚Äôs son, The Leat. Welsh Pony breeding was introduced from the stallion Dinarth Spark, and infusions of Fell Pony blood were also added.The British Horse Ponies on Little Mis Tor The first attempt to define and register the breed was in 1898, when the ponies were entered into a studbook started by the Polo Pony Society. In 1924, the breed society was founded, and a studbook opened. World War I and World War II were devastating to the breed. Only a few ponies were registered during World War II. However, after the war, local people began to inspect and register as many ponies as they could, and by the 1950s, numbers were back up. Two schemes have been introduced to halt the decline in numbers, and broaden the gene pool of the Dartmoor Pony. The Dartmoor Pony Moorland Scheme was established in 1988 and is administered by the Dartmoor Pony Society and the Duchy of Cornwall, as well as being supported by the Dartmoor National Park. In 2004, a new scheme, the Dartmoor Pony Preservation Scheme, was introduced, and herds taking part in this new scheme must enter one mare each year to the DPMS. The Dartmoor Pony has been granted Rare Breed status. Dartmoor Ponies today Dartmoor Hill pony on Dartmoor Dartmoor Ponies are native to Britain, but are also seen in other parts of the world, including the USA, Continental Europe, New Zealand, and Australia. They are often used as foundation breeding stock for the Riding Pony. The breed is a suitable size and temperament for a children‚Äôs mount, but it is also quite capable of carrying an adult. They are used for hunting, trail riding, showing, jumping, dressage, and driving, as well as everyday riding. All ponies free-roaming on Dartmoor are owned and protected by Dartmoor Commoners. Visitors feeding the ponies is illegal.

It is in the Dacorum Ward of Bovingdon, Flaunden and Chipperfield. History Bourne End formerly lay within the extended parish of Northchurch (Berkhamsted St. Mary). It was then known as the hamlet of Broadway. In 1909 the south-eastern part of Northchurch was separated into a new parish consisting of the hamlets of Sunnyside and Broadway. Bourne End/Broadway became a separate parish in 1915. Bourne End derives its name as it lies at the end of the Bourne Gutter, an irregularly flowing stream, at its confluence with the River Bulbourne.Dacorum Environmental Forum Water Group - Dacorum Water News According to local tradition the Bourne Gutter is a Woe Water that only flows at times of tragedy. Recorded instances include during 1665 at the time of the Great Plague, in 1914 at the outbreak of the World War I and in 1956 during the Suez Crisis.Birchnell P, A Short History of Berkhamsted, Clunberry Press, 1972 The Hemel Hempstead Gazette has also run stories on the Gutter flowing in early 1982 as Argentinian Forces invaded the Falkland Islands, in early October 1987 days before the Great Storm of 1987 that devastated woodlands throughout southern England, and in 2003 as British troops joined the International invasion of Iraq Bourne End was the scene of the rail disaster on the West Coast Main Line on 30 September 1945 when an express train was derailed with many fatalities.Accident at Bourne End on 30 September 1945 - The Railway Archive Church of Saint John the Evangelist  Church of Saint John the Evangelist Bourne End In the 1850s the rector Cannon Sir John Hobart Culme Seymour decided to found a chapel of ease for St Mary's Northchurch. The architect George Gilbert Scott was commissioned to design the new church and construction was funded by Thomas Halsey of The Hall, Berkhamsted. An additional donation was made by the Prince of Wales on behalf of the landowner, the Duchy of Cornwall. The Church of St. John The Evangelist was completed in 1854. It is a small flint church in the Gothic Revival style with a steep pitched roofs and decorative red tiles topped with a small wooden spire, a timber-framed porch and a semicircular apse at the east end. The six stained glass windows in the apse are early works by Alfred Bell. In 1889-1891 the chancel was altered to add a richly carved altar and a Gothic reredos depicting the Resurrection, and the domed apse ceiling was decorated with a painted scene of Dante‚Äôs vision of Heaven, painted by David Bell. In 2001 four of the Alfred Bell stained glass windows were stolen. These have since been replaced by replica windows, installed in 2003.

Crossovers are often based on a platform shared with a passenger car. Compared to truck-based SUVs, they typically have better interior comfort, a more comfortable ride, superior fuel economy, and less off-road capability. Many crossovers lack all- wheel drive, which, in combination with their lesser off-road capability, challenges their definition as \\"sports utility vehicles\\". Furthermore, there are inconsistencies about whether some vehicles are considered crossovers or SUVs; therefore, the term \\"SUV\\" is often used as a catch-all for both crossovers and compact SUVs. In the United States , crossover models comprised more than 50% of the overall SUV market. Crossovers have become increasingly popular in Europe also since the early 2010s. Forerunners of the modern crossover include the 1977 Matra Rancho and the AMC Eagle introduced in 1979.  Definition  The difference between crossovers and other SUVs is sometimes defined as a crossover being built using a unibody platform (the type used by most passenger cars), while an SUV is built using a body-on-frame platform (the type used by off-road vehicles and light trucks). However, these definitions are often blurred in practice, since unibody vehicles are also often referred to as SUVs. Also, \\"crossover\\" is a relatively recent term, and early unibody SUVs (such as the 1984 Jeep Cherokee) are rarely called crossovers. Due to these inconsistencies, the term \\"SUV\\" is often used as an umbrella term for both crossovers and SUVs. Outside of the United States, the term \\"crossover\\" tends to be used for C-segment (compact) or smaller vehicles, with large unibody vehicles‚Äîsuch as the Audi Q7, Range Rover and Volkswagen Touareg‚Äîusually referred to as SUVs rather than crossovers. In the United Kingdom, a crossover is sometimes defined as a hatchback with raised ride height and SUV-like styling features.  History  Introduced in 1979, the AMC Eagle is retroactively considered to be the first dedicated crossover automobile that made its debut prior to the terms \\"SUV\\" or \\"crossover\\" being coined. The mass-market Eagle model line was based on a unibody passenger car platform, with fully automatic four-wheel drive and a raised ride height. Some cite the front-wheel drive 1977 Matra Rancho as a slightly earlier forerunner to the modern crossover. Though it is not part of the modern linear evolution, and only fifteen were built, some stretch the definition and history of the \\"crossover\\" to regard the off-road racing 1936 Opel Gel√§ndesportwagen as the first of the class. The 1994 Toyota RAV4 is credited as the model that expanded the concept and the crossover market segment. Essentially a shrunken SUV, the RAV4 was based on the platform used by the Toyota Corolla.  Size categories  = Subcompact crossover = Subcompact crossovers are usually based on the platform of a subcompact (also known as supermini or B-segment) passenger car. They typically have limited off-road capabilities, with some differing from the standard hatchback model with only a bumper hinge and more ground clearance.

The first compact crossovers included the 1994 Toyota RAV4, 1995 Honda CR-V, 1997 Subaru Forester, 2000 Nissan X-Trail, 2000 Mazda Tribute, and 2001 Ford Escape. The number of compact crossover models offered has rapidly increased since 2010.

By 2017, European sales of compact and mid-sized crossover models continued to surge. = United States = Sales of crossovers increased 30% between 2003 and 2005. By 2006, the segment came into strong visibility in the U.S., when crossover sales \\"made up more than 50% of the overall SUV market\\". Sales increased in 2007 by 16%. In 2013, the Audi Q5 became Audi's second best-selling vehicle in the United States market after the Audi A4 sedan. Around half of Lexus' sales volume has come from its SUVs since the late 1990s. American manufacturers were initially slow to switch from their emphasis on light truck-based SUVs, and foreign automakers developed crossovers targeting the U.S. market as an alternative to station wagons that were unpopular there. But by the 2010 model year, American car manufacturers had caught up.

Plot summary The novel revolves around the mishaps of its narrator, Fred Trumper, a floundering late-twenty-something graduate student with serious commitment and honesty issues that earn him the nickname \\"Bogus.\\" The novel shows Irving beginning to develop a blend of comedy and pathos, as well as a penchant for fashioning quirky characters. It follows a non-linear narrative in the form of a sort of 'confession' authored by Trumper, who humorously recounts his various failures in life and love, from his New England childhood through his experiences on foreign study in Vienna, Austria, and as a graduate student in Iowa, leading up to the present-action setting, early-1970s New York, where Trumper is attempting to sever himself from his adolescent past. \\"I want to change\\", Trumper says at the end of Chapter One. The phrase seems to be the novel's central theme. The title refers to a method prescribed to Trumper for the treatment of non-specific urological disorders relating to his abnormally narrow urinary tract. Trumper's urologist, Dr. Jean Claude Vigneron, offers him three options for the treatment of his disorder: abstinence from sex and alcohol, a painful operation to widen the urinary canal, or the Water Method, which consists simply of consuming abnormal quantities of water before and after sex to flush bacteria out of the urinary tract. Trumper opts for the Water Method, suggesting both his generally comical cowardice and lack of self-discipline. Trumper's narration meanders through flashbacks revolving around his relationships with the novel's two primary female characters: Sue \\"Biggie\\" Kunft, a former championship downhill skier whom Trumper courts, impregnates, and marries in Vienna while still a student, and Tulpen, Trumper's present day live-in girlfriend, a documentary film editor in New York, where he lands after losing Biggie. Though the two relationships function chiefly as a means of demonstrating Bogus Trumper's tendency to repeat his mistakes, Irving is often noted for his strong, independent female characters, and Tulpen and Biggie can be seen as markers in the development of the strong women in his more popularly successful novels, particularly The World According to Garp (1979). Other characters include Trumper's best childhood friend Couth, a still-photographer; Merrill Overturf, an alcoholic and diabetic loon Trumper befriends in Vienna; Ralph Packer, a pretentious documentary filmmaker who employs Trumper as a sound editor; and Colm, Trumper's young son from his first marriage to Biggie. Trumper is a graduate student at the University of Iowa in comparative literature whose thesis is to be a translation of an ancient, \\"Old Low Norse\\" epic called \\"Akthelt and Gunnel\\". Irving employs the \\"Akthelt and Gunnel\\" poem as a means for allowing Trumper to poke merciless fun at himself through analogously inventing the story of the poem according to his own life's mishaps.

Equitation is the art or practice of horse riding or horsemanship. More specifically, equitation may refer to a rider's position while mounted, and encompasses a rider's ability to ride correctly and with effective aids. In horse show competition, the rider, rather than the horse is evaluated. Such classes go by different names, depending on region, including equitation classes, rider classes, or horsemanship classes. Judging criteria covers the rider's performance and control of the horse, use of riding aids, proper attire, correct form, and usually factor in rider poise and the cleanliness and polish of horse, rider and equipment. The performance of the horse is not judged per se, but a poorly performing horse is considered to reflect the ability of the rider. Equitation classes occur in the Hunt seat, Saddle seat, Dressage, and Western disciplines. A good equitation rider is always in balance with the horse, maintains a correct position in every gait, movement, or over a fence, and possesses a commanding, but relaxed, presence, able to direct the horse with nearly invisible aids. Hunt seat equitation A hunter equitation rider jumping her course. The hunt seat style of riding is derived from the hunt field. In equitation competition, flat classes (those that do not including jumping) include judging at the walk, trot, and canter in both directions, and the competitors may be asked to ride without stirrups or perform assorted other tests or patterns. It is correct for the riders to have a light and steady contact with their horse's mouth the entire ride. Incorrect leads, break of pace, and wrong diagonals are penalized. Loss of a stirrup or dropping the reins are also faults, and may be cause for elimination. In over fences classes (classes in which the horse and rider jump obstacles), the competitor rides over a course of at least six jumps (usually more). Equitation over fence classes rarely have fences higher than . Classes for more accomplished riders may require at least one flying lead change, and one or more combinations. The rider is judged not only on position and effectiveness of riding aids, but should also maintain an even, forward pace and meet each fence at an appropriate distance. At the highest level of hunt seat equitation in North America are the national ASPCA Maclay Finals, the USET Talent Search Finals, the WIHS Equitation Finals, and USEF Medal classes in the United States, and the CET (Canadian Equestrian Team) Medal and Jump Canada Medal in Canada. These championships and their qualifying classes may include bending lines, roll back turns, narrow fences, and fences with a long approach to test the rider. Fences must be at least 3'6\\" and may be up to 5' wide, and the course must have at least eight obstacles and at least one combination. The course may include liverpool or open water elements, depending on the class and region specifications. The USET Talent Search Finals always includes an open water element. Equitation tests may be chosen by the judge to help place the top riders. These tests are required in the medal classes. Tests may include a halt for several seconds, rein back, demonstration of the hand gallop, figure-8 at the trot or canter with correct diagonals or leads (simple change of lead or flying), trotting or cantering low fences (up to 3'), jump obstacles at the walk (up to 2'), jumping fences on a figure-8, oral questions regarding tack, equipment, conformation, and basic horsemanship, riding without stirrups, performing a turn on the forehand or haunches, and a serpentine at the trot or canter with flying changes. Riders may also be asked to switch horses at higher levels of competition, such as at a national final. Switching of horses is no longer common at smaller competitions, usually only championships, due to the risks involved. The National Collegiate Equestrian Association (NCEA) mainly focuses on hunt seat equitation. Riders wanting to compete in the college division 1 teams need prior knowledge on riding hunt seat equitation to be considered for the teams. Saddle seat equitation A saddle seat rider on an American Saddlebred Saddle seat is a uniquely American form of riding that grew out of a style of riding used on Southern plantations, with some European influences from \\"Park\\" or Sunday exhibition riding of high-stepping horses in public venues (often literally, city parks). Today it is seen most often at horse shows organized for exhibitors of the American Saddlebred, Morgan, Arabian, Tennessee Walking Horse, and the National Show Horse. It is also sometimes seen in competition for Andalusian horses. There are open and breed-specific national championships as well as an international championship held every other year. Gaits shown in Saddle Seat classes include the walk, trot, and canter. Some competitions may call for extended gaits, particularly the trot. When showing a Tennessee Walking Horse they will be required to perform a flat walk and running walk. Some class will also require a canter. All classes require Rail work, where competitors show and are judged as a group going both ways of the arena. Saddle seat equitation may include individual tests or a pattern to be ridden. Tests may include backing up, mounting and dismounting, riding without stirrups, \\"addressing\\" the reins (i.e. picking up the four or two reins correctly), figure eights, serpentines and straight line patterns done at any gait. At the canter, only simple changes of lead are required when changing directions. It is possible to have a \\"ride-off,\\" where two or more riders are asked to perform additional work to determine the winner. Correct position for the rider is to have the ear, shoulder, hip, and heel in a line. He/she is also to have a straight line from knee to toe, and from elbow to wrist to the horse's bit. The rider's back should be straight yet relaxed, and the legs and arms are to remain virtually motionless. The informal dress for saddle seat equitation includes a coat and Kentucky jodhpurs of a dark, conservative color, e.g., herringbone, pin stripes, black, blue, grey, dark burgundy, dark green or beige; a white or pastel collared shirt with a tie; derby or soft hat; and jodhpur boots. Vests and gloves are optional. After 6 p.m. formal wear is required. This habit includes a tuxedo-style jacket, pants and vest with bow tie and formal shirt, and top hat. Pleasure equitation is another form of saddle seat equitation in which a rider is required to wear informal dress (coat, jodhpur pants, derby or soft hat, all in a dark color) in the day and evening and ride a horse that has a full mane and tail which is not set. The horses used are of a less animated style than in open competition, such as a country pleasure horse. The Morgan equivalent of this class is called Classic Saddle Seat Equitation. The value given to rail work and pattern work varies from qualifying competition to championship competition. Western equitation A western equitation rider Video of a rider performing a western equitation pattern Western equitation (sometimes called Western horsemanship, stock seat equitation, or, in some classes, reining seat equitation) competitions are judged at the walk, jog, and lope in both directions. Some classes require individual patterns. Riders must sit to the jog and never post. Riders must use a Western saddle and a curb bit, and may only use one hand to hold the reins while riding. Two hands are allowed if the horse is ridden in a snaffle bit or hackamore, which are only permitted for use on younger, \\"junior\\" horses, defined differently by various breed associations, but usually referring to horses four or five years of age and younger. Horses are not allowed to wear a noseband or cavesson, nor any type of protective boot or bandage, except during some tests that require a reining pattern. Riders are allowed two different styles of reins: 1) split reins, which are not attached to each other, and thus the rider is allowed to place one finger between the reins to aid in making adjustments; and 2) \\"romal reins,\\" which are joined together and have a romal (a type of long quirt) on the end, which the rider holds in his/her non-reining hand, with at least 16 inches of slack between the two, and the rider is not allowed to place a finger between the reins. The correct position for this discipline, as in all forms of riding, is a balanced seat. This is seen when a bystander can run an imaginary straight line that passes through the rider's ear, shoulder, hip, and heel. The Western style is seen in a long stirrup length, often longer than that used by dressage riders, an upright posture (equitation riders are never to lean forward beyond a very slight inclination), and the distinctive one-handed hold on the reins. The reining hand should be bent at the elbow, held close to the rider's side, and centered over the horse's neck, usually within an inch of the saddle horn. Due to the presence of the saddle horn, a true straight line between rider's hand and horse's mouth is usually not possible. The non-reining hand either holds onto the romal, if one is used; or if split reins are used, is held in a still position, which varies as styles change, but often is also bent at the elbow and held close to the pommel of the saddle. Dressage seat equitation Dressage horse and rider Dressage seat equitation is a relatively new class offered at dressage shows. Unlike a dressage test, the horse's gaits are not judged, although the horse's frame is taken into consideration by the judge, but rather it is the rider who is evaluated. Also, instead of a single competitor in the ring, there are several riders in the ring at one time. The rider is judged on a proper classical position. This includes evaluating leg position, seat, hands, balance, and rhythm. The rider is to be relaxed and not interfere with the horse's movement, but able to make full use of all riding aids. The rider and horse should have unity, and the rider should use the aids correctly and efficiently.

Biography Honderich was born Edgar Dawn Ross Honderich on 30 January 1933 in Baden, Ontario, Canada. An undergraduate at the University of Toronto, qualifying as B.A. (Hons) in Philosophy and English Literature, he came to University College London to study under the logical positivist and Grote Professor A. J. Ayer, graduating with a PhD in 1968. He has since lived in England and become a British citizen. After being a lecturer at the University of Sussex he became lecturer, reader, professor and then Grote Professor at University College London. He was visiting professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Yale and the universities of Bath and Calgary. He is author of many books and articles on such subjects as consciousness, determinism, qualia, functionalism, timings of sensory experiences, psychophysical intimacy, the correspondence theory of truth, Russell's theory of descriptions, time, causation, Mill's On Liberty, John Searle's view of free will and G. A. Cohen's defence of Marx's theory of history. He has also edited several series of philosophy books. He has been involved in controversy for his moral defence of Palestinian political violence, despite his justification of the founding and maintaining of Israel in its original 1948 borders. His papers in philosophical journals have been published in three volumes by Edinburgh University Press. He has appeared on radio and television, is the editor of The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, has written a philosophical autobiography, is chairman of the Royal Institute of Philosophy where he inaugurated the annual lectures subsequently published as Philosophers of Our Times, and he is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. He is married to Ingrid Coggin Honderich. Consciousness Honderich's theory of consciousness in the long book Actual Consciousness and the precis-book Your Being Conscious is What? Where? replaces entirely his philosophy of mind in A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life-Hopes and the precis-book How Free Are You?. The new theory derives from a database to the effect that being conscious, figuratively speaking, is something's being actual. This issues, by way of (a) speculation that disagreement about consciousness is significantly owed to no adequate initial clarification of the subject matter, and (b) examination of five leading ideas of consciousness and existing theories of consciousness, and (c) a specification of the objective physical world, into the wholly literal theory or analysis of the nature of consciousness called Actualism. It distinguishes three sides of consciousness: (1) perceptual consciousness‚Äîconsciousness in perception, (2) cognitive consciousness, and (3) affective consciousness. In each case the theory satisfies the two primary criteria of explaining what is actual, and what its being actual consists in. In the case of perceptual consciousness what is actual is only a subjective physical world out there. I.e. being perceptually conscious is essentially or primarily a state of affairs external to the perceiver. Its being actual is its being subjectively physical, which is specified. In the case of cognitive and affective consciousness, what is actual is representations, internal to the conscious thing, and their being actual is their being subjectively physical, differently so from subjective physical worlds. Actualism argues, further, that it satisfies further criteria better than other existing theories of consciousness including one of subjectivity, individuality or personal identity, and that it is relevant to desires for human standing that are the motivation of beliefs in free will as against determinism. Actualism has been received as a new and arguable theory by philosophers who have previously declared the urgent need for one. A predecessor of the theory is discussed by 11 other philosophers in Radical Externalism: Honderich's Theory of Consciousness Discussed, ed. Anthony Freeman, Imprint Academic. Determinism and freedom In A Theory of Determinism: The Mind, Neuroscience and Life- Hopes and in the precis-book How Free Are You?, Honderich expounds a theory of causation as well as other lawlike connections. This he uses to formulate three hypotheses of a deterministic philosophy of mind. They are argued to be true, mainly on the basis of neuroscience. The clarity of determinism is contrasted with the obscurity of the doctrines of free will or origination. The centuries-dominant philosophical traditions of determinism and freedom, Compatibilism and Incompatibilism, are examined. According to the first, determinism is consistent with our freedom and moral responsibility; according to the second, it is inconsistent with them. Honderich considers Compatibilism's argument that our freedom consists in voluntariness, doing what we desire and not being coerced; hence its conclusion that determinism and freedom can go together. He also examines Incompatibilism's argument that our freedom consists in origination or free will, our choosing without our choosing's being caused; hence the conclusion that determinism and freedom are inconsistent. Honderich argues that both views are mistaken, since freedom as voluntariness and freedom as origination are each as fundamental to our lives. The real problem of the consequences of determinism is not choosing between the two traditional doctrines, but a more practical one: trying to give up what must be given up, since we do not have the power of origination. Honderich's rejection of both traditions has been taken up by other philosophers, many of whom find his criticisms decisive. Mind and brain Honderich's Union Theory of mind and brain is defended in A Theory of Determinism. The Union Theory takes it as possible that conscious events like our choices and decisions are in a way subjective but are nevertheless physical rather than near-physical events. They stand in a kind of lawlike connection with neural events, sometimes called the supervenience of mental events on neural events. These psychoneural pairs, as Honderich calls them, are just effects of certain causal sequences, and are causes of our actions. This sort of physicalism, a predecessor to the notion of supervenience, has since been succeeded in Honderich's writings by the near-physicalism of Radical Externalism. Radical Externalism holds that perceptual consciousness does not have a nomic sufficient condition in a head but only a necessary one. Honderich argues that reflective and affective consciousness are different again. He also argues that this is consistent with contemporary neuroscience, rescues us from the argument from illusion or brain in a vat, and also from the dubious conclusions of sense-data theory and phenomenalism. The Principle of Humanity Honderich argues that the Principle of Humanity is that what is right always consists in what, according to the best available knowledge and judgement, are actually rational steps, effective and not self- defeating ones rather than pretences, to the end of getting and keeping people out of bad lives. Bad lives are defined as those deprived of six fundamental human goods: a decent length of life, bodily well-being, freedom and power in various settings, respect and self-respect, the goods of relationship, and the goods of culture. It is a consequentialist principle, but not the principle of utility, nor of course the claim that the ends justify the means. Honderich argues that the principle is fundamental to but not the whole of a morality of humanity. This, he claims, includes certain policies of equality and inequality and certain practices, one being a better democracy than we have. Honderich concludes that the Principle of Humanity is better supported than any other sort of moral principle, on the basis of both consistency and certain facts. He takes it that non-consequentialist reasons are not really reasons at all, nor, he says, does the Principle grant any distinction between acts and omissions. International right and wrong, democracy, terrorism Following 9/11, Honderich published After the Terror. The author first lays out premises for what he terms the \\"bad lives\\" and \\"good lives\\", of those living in Africa and in rich countries respectively. With respect to bad lives, Honderich argues that our omissions have resulted in 20 million years of possible living-time lost by a certain sample of Africans. He also considers the creation of Israel in 1948 and records what he describes as the bad lives of Palestinians as a result of what is called the neo-Zionist expansion of Israel since the 1967 war. Honderich asks whether those in the rich societies do wrong in doing nothing about bad lives. He considers natural morality as well as our worked-out or philosophical moralities. Such outlooks as political realism and such ideologies as liberalism and libertarianism are also considered, as is what Honderich calls 'hierarchic democracy'. The Principle of Humanity is used to judge our moral responsibility for the many bad lives, which Honderich tells us is great. The Principle also condemns the terrorist killings of 11 September as hideous. The killings were not rational means to an end that was partly defensible. The West's subsequent attack on Afghanistan is excused. But the taking from Palestinians of at least their freedom in the last fifth of their homeland, historic Palestine, is condemned. Honderich writes: '...the Palestinians have had a moral right to their terrorism as certain as was the moral right, say, of the African people of South Africa against their white captors and the apartheid state'. Honderich claims that we need to see the power of our societies as deadly. Americans, first of all, because of their unique power, need to think more carefully about their actions. He also argues that we should supplement our democracies with the transformations of the civil disobedience of Henry David Thoreau, Martin Luther King, Jr., Bertrand Russell, and those in Eastern Europe who brought down the wall. His later book, Humanity, Terrorism, Terrorist War: Palestine, 9/11, Iraq, 7/7... begins by asking if analytic philosophy in considering large questions of right and wrong should proceed by embracing international law, human rights, just war theory or the like. Honderich, finding these means of judgement wanting, again takes up the Principle of Humanity. The book justifies and defends Zionism, defined as the creation of Israel in its original borders, but also reaffirms that Palestinians have had a moral right to their liberation‚Äîto terrorism within historic Palestine against what Honderich calls the ethnic cleansing of Neo-Zionism, the expansion of Israel beyond its original borders. After a further consideration of 9/11, there is an analysis of 10 reasons for what he calls 'our terrorist war' in Iraq. Honderich condemns the war as morally barbaric, given the foreseen and thus intentional killing of many innocents. In condemning the 7/7 terrorist attack on London, Honderich considers the importance of horror to morality. He also argues that Tony Blair and George W. Bush are friends rather than enemies of terrorism. The book ends with a postscript on the charge of anti-semitism against critics of neo-Zionism ‚Äì a charge Honderich says is principally a part of Neo-Zionism or at least something insufficiently detached from it. In January 2011, Honderich wrote a letter to the Guardian on terrorism, in response to details released about the Israeli-Palestinian peace process: Punishment In Punishment: The Supposed Justifications, Honderich surveys and analyses 14 traditional, backward-looking reasons for the justification of punishment by the state. Most have to do with desert or retribution, others with annulment or consent. All are found to be weak or worse. Honderich then argues that the strong tradition of punishment must have in it some real content or argument. This is found to be that punishment is justified by giving satisfaction to grievance-desires‚Äîdoing no more than satisfying them. This, Honderich concludes, is the reality of retributivism, but it cannot be an effective justification of punishment. The Utilitarian prevention theory of punishment is also rejected, because it justifies certain victimisations. Mixed theories of punishment, drawing on backward-looking considerations as well as the notion of prevention, sometimes in terms of the reform of offenders, are also found to be untenable. Robert Nozick's theory in particular is examined. Honderich's conclusion is that the long-running problem of the justification of punishment is now dead. Its justification must be in terms of its consequences‚Äîin discouraging and licensing certain kinds of behaviour. The live issue is determining what these are. Honderich's answer has to do with the Principle of Humanity. Punishment is or would be justified when it rationally takes forward the humanisation of our societies. He argues, on the basis of this, that most punishments are in fact wrong. Conservatism Honderich's book Conservatism begins with a general inquiry into the distinctions between British and American conservatism. He argues that one [British conservatism?] has to do with eternal values and therefore with reform rather than change, a view underpinning Edmund Burke's condemnation of the French Revolution and all conservatives since. Other distinctions [between British and American conservatism or conservatism and other systems?] have to do with the right kind of political thinking and with human nature, with particular doctrines of incentive and reward, and with certain freedoms, including those of private property. Given these distinctions which set conservatism apart from other views, Honderich asks what underlies and brings these distinctions together. What is the rationale or underlying principle of conservatism? The answer he gives is not just that the conservative tradition is selfish. Its self-interest, he argues, does not distinguish it from other political traditions. What does distinguish it, Honderich concludes, is that it lacks a moral principle to defend its self- interest. It is unique in its amorality. Conservatism was enlarged as Conservatism: Burke, Nozick, Bush, Blair? in 2005, and includes Honderich's consideration of whether Britain's New Labour is truly in the conservative political tradition. Controversy Honderich has been involved in controversy since the publication of his book After the Terror in 2002. Honderich arranged with Oxfam in Britain and the publisher of After the Terror, Edinburgh University Press, to have the ¬£5,000 advance on royalties go to the charity, along with more money from the publishers. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail suggested that Oxfam was taking money from a terrorist sympathiser, and it then declined the contributions, for which it was judged adversely in the British media. The book was published in a German translation. Micha Brumlik, director of a Holocaust centre and Professor of Pedagogy at Frankfurt University, demanded publicly that the book be withdrawn from sale by the publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag. Despite the declaration by the philosopher J√ºrgen Habermas, who had recommended the translation, that the book was not anti-semitic, it was withdrawn from sale. Honderich demanded the dismissal of Brumlik from his professorship, for violation of academic principle. There was a media furore in Germany. The book was retranslated and republished by an antizionist Jewish publishing house, Melzer Verlag.T. Honderich, The Rise and Fall of a Book in Germany, March (2005) Lesser controversies have included an imputation of anti-semitism by a student newspaper in London, against which Honderich took successful legal action. There have been attacks by Palestinians on Honderich's justification of Zionism too, including disruptions at meetings.T. Honderich, On Being Persona Non Grata to Palestinians Too CounterPunch, March (2005) Other writings Honderich wrote a number of papers in criticism of Donald Davidson's Anomalous Monism, and in particular made the objection that on certain assumptions the view is epiphenomenalist. The papers are reprinted in Mental Causation and the Metaphysics of Mind, edited by Neil Campbell. Earlier journal papers are about Austin's correspondence theory of truth, causation, time, Russell's theory of descriptions, and John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty. Honderich's philosophical autobiography, Philosopher: A Kind of Life, is a personal and general picture of English academic life over several decades. An encyclopaedia edited by him, The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, is in its second edition.

Such ofuda, also called , or , are often placed on household Shinto altars (kamidana) and revered both as a symbol of the shrine's deity (or deities) - indeed containing the kami's essence or power by virtue of its consecration - and a medium through which the kami in question can be accessed by the worshiper. In this regard they are somewhat similar to (but not the same as) goshintai, physical objects which serve as repositories for kami in Shinto shrines. # A talisman intended for a specific purpose (e.g. protection against misfortune, safety within the home, love, etc.) usually distributed by both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. Such amulets are also called . Like shinsatsu, gofu from shrines or temples are imbued with the power of the kami or Buddhist figures revered therein. Unlike shinsatsu, they are not necessarily enshrined in kamidana or in Buddhist altars (butsudan) but may be kept on one's person or placed on other areas of the home (e.g. gates, doorways, kitchens, ceilings). Small, portable gofu encased in a small bag of decorated cloth are referred to as omamori. Ofuda are made out of various materials such as paper, wood, cloth or metal. Paper ofuda may also be referred to as , while those made of wood may be called . History Ofuda (gofu) distributed in Kinkakuji (left) and Ginkakuji (right) in Kyoto. These also serve as admission tickets to the temples. A Go≈çfu (ÁâõÁéãÁ¨¶) from Kumano Hong≈´ Taisha in Wakayama Prefecture The practice of creating gofu originated from Onmy≈çd≈ç - which adopted elements of Daoism - and Buddhism. Indeed, such ofuda and omamori were heavily influenced by the Daoist lingfu. Later, similar talismans also came to be produced at Shinto shrines. The three shrines of Kumano in Wakayama Prefecture were particularly famous for their paper talisman, the Kumano Go≈çfu (ÁÜäÈáéÁâõÁéãÁ¨¶ 'Kumano Ox King Talisman'), also known as the Go≈çh≈çin (ÁâõÁéãÂÆùÂç∞), which were stamped on one side with intricate designs of stylized crows. During the medieval period, these and similar gofu produced by other shrines were often employed in oath taking and contract drafting, with the terms of the oath or agreement being written on the blank side of the sheet. Naik≈´) of Ise. From left: Kaik≈ç taima (Êµ∑Âπ∏Â§ßÈ∫ª, a kind of kifuda for luck in fishing), kenharai (Ââ£Á•ì), kakuharai (ËßíÁ•ì), and daikakuharai (Â§ßËßíÁ•ì, a larger version of kakuharai). The shinsatsu currently found in most Shinto shrines meanwhile are modeled after the talisman issued by the Grand Shrines of Ise (Ise Jing≈´) called Jing≈´ Taima (Á•ûÂÆÆÂ§ßÈ∫ª). Jing≈´ Taima were originally purification wands (Á•ì‰∏≤ haraegushi) that wandering preachers associated with the shrines of Ise (Âæ°Â∏´ oshi or onshi) handed out to devotees across the country as a sign and guarantee that prayers were conducted on their behalf. These wands, called Oharai Taima (Âæ°Á•ìÂ§ßÈ∫ª), were contained either in packets of folded paper - in which case they are called kenharai (Ââ£Á•ì, also kenbarai), due to the packet's shape resembling a sword (Ââ£ ken) blade - or in boxes called oharaibako (Âæ°Á•ìÁÆ±). The widespread distribution of Oharai Taima first began in the Muromachi period and reached its peak in the Edo period: a document dating from 1777 (An'ei 6) indicates that eighty- nine to ninety percent of all households in the country at the time owned an Ise talisman. The end of the Edo period witnessed the rise of public festivities and protests known as ee ja nai ka triggered by reports of talismans raining from the sky. In 1871, an imperial decree abolished the oshi and allotted the production and distribution of the amulets, now renamed Jing≈´ Taima, to the shrine's administrative offices. It was around this time that the talisman changed into its present day form: a wooden tablet containing a sliver of cedar wood known as gyoshin (Âæ°Áúü 'sacred core') wrapped in paper on which is printed the shrine's name (Â§©ÁÖßÁöáÂ§ßÁ•ûÂÆÆ Tensh≈ç K≈çtai Jing≈´) and stamped with the seals of the shrine (ÁöáÂ§ßÁ•ûÂÆÆÂæ°ÁíΩ K≈çtai Jing≈´ Gyoji) and its high priest (Â§ßÁ•ûÂÆÆÂè∏‰πãÂç∞ Daijing≈´ji no In). In 1900, a new department, the Kanbesho (Á•ûÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ 'Department of Priests'), took over production and distribution duties. The distribution of Jing≈´ Taima was eventually delegated to the National Association of Shinto Priests (ÂÖ®ÂõΩÁ•ûËÅ∑‰ºö Zenkoku Shinshokukai) in 1927 and finally to its successor, the Association of Shinto Shrines, after World War II. The Association nowadays continues to disseminate Jing≈´ Taima to affiliated shrines throughout Japan, where they are made available alongside the shrines' own amulets. Varieties and usage A Jing≈´ Taima still in its translucent paper wrapper. This cover may be removed when setting up the talisman in a kamidana. Ofuda - both shinsatsu and gofu - come in a variety of forms. Some are slips or sheets of paper, others like the Jing≈´ Taima are thin rectangular plaques (ËßíÁ•ì kakubarai / kakuharai) enclosed in an envelope-like casing (which may further be covered in translucent wrapping paper), while still others are wooden tablets (kifuda) which may be smaller or larger than regular shinsatsu. Some shrines distribute kenharai, which consists of a sliver of wood placed inside a fold of paper. As noted above, the Oharai Taima issued by the shrines of Ise before the Meiji period were usually in the form of kenharai; while the kakuharai variety is currently more widespread, Jing≈´ Taima of the kenharai type are still distributed in Ise Shrine. K≈çjinyama Shrine in Shiga Prefecture): a plaque with the names of the shrine's kami - Homusubi, Okitsuhiko and Okitsuhime - written in Jindai moji and its paper casing on which is written the name of the shrine or the epithet of its deity - in this case, 'K≈çjinyama-no-≈åkami' (ËçíÁ•ûÂ±±Â§ßÁ•û 'Great Deity of K≈çjinyama (Shrine)' - and stamped with the seals of the shrine (middle) and its priest (bottom). Ofuda and omamori are available year round in many shrines and temples, especially in larger ones with a permanent staff. As these items are sacred, they are technically not 'bought' but rather 'received' (Êéà„Åã„Çã sazukaru, Âèó„Åë„Çã ukeru), with the money paid in exchange for them being considered to be a donation or offering (ÂàùÁ©ÇÊñô hatsuhory≈ç, literally 'first fruit fee'). One may also receive a wooden talisman called a kit≈çfuda (Á•àÁ•∑Êú≠) after having formal prayers or rituals (Á•àÁ•∑ kit≈ç) performed on one's behalf in these places of worship. Shinsatsu such as Jing≈´ Taima are enshrined in a household altar (kamidana) or a special stand (ofudatate); in the absence of one, they may be placed upright in a clean and tidy space above eye level or attached to a wall. Shinsatsu and the kamidana that house them are set up facing east (where the sun rises), south (the principal direction of sunshine), or southeast. The Association of Shinto Shrines recommends that a household own at least three kinds of shinsatsu: #Jing≈´ Taima #The ofuda of the tutelary deity of one's place of residence (ujigami) #The ofuda of a shrine one is personally devoted to (Â¥áÊï¨Á•ûÁ§æ s≈´kei jinja) Various possible ways of arranging ofuda (shinsatsu) in a Shinto altar In a 'three-door' style (‰∏âÁ§æÈÄ† sansha-zukuri) altar, the Jing≈´ Taima is placed in the middle, with the ofuda of one's local ujigami on its left (observer's right) and the ofuda of one's favorite shrine on its right (observer's left). Alternatively, in a 'one-door' style (‰∏ÄÁ§æÈÄ† issha-zukuri) kamidana, the three talismans are laid on top of one another, with the Jing≈´ Taima on the front. One may own more shinsatsu; these are placed on either side of or behind the aforementioned three. Regular (preferably daily) worship before the shinsatsu or kamidana and offerings of rice, salt, water, and/or sake to the kami (with additional foodstuffs being offered on special occasions) are recommended. The manner of worship is similar to those performed in shrines: two bows, two claps, and a final bow, though a prayer (norito) - also preceded by two bows - may be recited before this. Fukagawa Fud≈çd≈ç in Tokyo Other ofuda are placed in other parts of the house. For instance, ofuda of patron deities of the hearth - Sanb≈ç-K≈çjin in Buddhism, Kamado-Mihashira-no-Kami (the 'Three Deities of the Hearth': Kagutsuchi, Okitsuhiko and Okitsuhime) in Shinto \\\\- are placed in the kitchen. In toilets, a talisman of the Buddhist wrathful deity Ucchu·π£ma (Ususama My≈ç≈ç), who is believed to purify the unclean, may be installed. Protective gofu such as Tsuno Daishi (ËßíÂ§ßÂ∏´ 'Horned Great Master', a depiction of the Tendai monk Ry≈çgen in the form of an oni) are placed on doorways or entrances. Japanese spirituality lays great importance on purity and pristineness (Â∏∏Ëã• tokowaka, lit. 'eternal youth'), especially of things related to the divine. It is for this reason that periodic (usually annual) replacement of ofuda and omamori are encouraged. It is customary to obtain new ofuda before the end of the year at the earliest or during the New Year season, though (as with omamori) one may purchase one at other times of the year as well. While ideally, old ofuda and omamori are to be returned to the shrine or temple where they were obtained as a form of thanksgiving, most Shinto shrines in practice accept talismans from other shrines. (Buddhist ofuda are however not accepted in many shrines and vice versa.) Old ofuda and omamori are burned in a ceremony known either as Sagich≈ç (Â∑¶Áæ©Èï∑) or Dondoyaki („Å©„Çì„Å©ÁÑº„Åç, also Dontoyaki or Tondoyaki) held during the Little New Year (January 14th or 15th), the end of the Japanese New Year season.

Card making is the craft of hand-making greeting cards. Many people with interests in allied crafts such as scrapbooking and stamping have begun to use their skills to start making handmade cards. This has contributed to cardmaking becoming a popular hobby. Traditional high street stores have begun to devote an increasing amount of their floorspace to handmade cards. Handmade products are now being seen by retailers as a way to increase margins, and handmade cards are no exception. This is particularly the case as mass-produced printed greeting cards have been faced with competition from electronic greeting cards. Over seven billion greeting cards were sent in the US alone last year; greeting cards are a multibillion-dollar business. In contrast, hundreds of small businesses have been set up by avid crafters keen to make a return on their cardmaking efforts. Many of these are taking advantage of the low setup costs of web-based selling and the wide customer-base of auction sites like eBay. Many others continue to sell their creations at craft fairs, markets and f√™tes. Others use their cardmaking skills to turn a profit in the wedding planning market making handmade wedding invitations and favors. There are many different variations of handmade cards including decoupage, more commonly known as 3D, where a design is printed a number of times, then various areas of the design are cut and layered on top of each other using double-sided sticky foam squares to mount the layers together to create the 3D effect making a very attractive greeting card. History The custom of sending greeting cards can be traced back to the ancient Chinese, who exchanged messages of good will to celebrate the New Year, and to the early Egyptians, who conveyed their greetings on papyrus scrolls. By the early 15th century, handmade paper greeting cards were being exchanged in Europe. The Germans are known to have printed New Year's greetings from woodcuts as early as 1400, and handmade paper Valentines were being exchanged in various parts of Europe in the early to mid-15th century. However, by the 1850s, the greeting card had been transformed from a relatively expensive, handmade and hand-delivered gift to a popular and affordable means of personal communication, due largely to advances in printing and mechanization. This trend continued, followed by new trends like Christmas cards, the first of which appeared in published form in London in 1843 when Sir Henry Cole hired artist John Calcott Horsley to design a holiday card that he could send to his friends and acquaintances. Technical developments like color lithography in 1930 propelled the manufactured greeting card industry forward. During the 1980s, the trend began to turn, with consumers increasing looking for greeting cards that were differentiated from the standard offering. In the late 1990s, e-cards made their way into the market. Materials Common cardmaking materials include: cardstock, stencils, markers, vellum, tissue paper, glue, rulers and t-squares, rickrack, foil, sequins, beads, ribbon, acetate, paper embossing, die cutting machines and more. Other materials that can be used in cardmaking are brads, eyelets, tea bag medallions, and buttons. Brads can be used to hold the four corners of one piece of cardstock on top of another to create a layered effect. Eyelets can be used to draw a piece of string or ribbon from one side of the card to another. Tea bag medallions are a type of origami that makes a wonderful decoration for the front of a card. Pretty shaped buttons make nice additions to a design. Other ways of decorating cards include using rubber or polymer stamps to add images or sentiments to the card which can then be coloured or decorated using a wide variety of paint or ink techniques.

During the 17th and 18th century, the term implied incidental aspects of an entertainment (usually involving singing and dancing) that might be inserted in an opera or ballet or other stage performance. In the operas produced by the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique, both trag√©dies lyriques and com√©dies lyriques, these 'divertissements' were sometimes linked to the main plot, or performed at the close of the performance. (Similar examples during the 19th century include Charles Gounod's opera Faust and Delibes's ballet Copp√©lia.) Special entertainments of a similar kind given between the acts of an opera were called 'interm√®des'. The term is also sometimes used for a ballet suite of loosely connected dances. One 20th-century example is Jacques Ibert's Divertissement. Jean Fran√ßaix named four of his compositions Divertissement: *for string trio and piano (1933) *for string trio and orchestra (1935) *for bassoon and string quintet (or orchestra, 1942) *for oboe, clarinet and bassoon (1945).

However, a recent DNA-based phylogenetic study retains the two separate genera, by clarifying that unifoliolate-leaved Berberis s.s. is derived from within a paraphyletic group of shrubs bearing imparipinnate evergreen leaves, which the paper then divides into three genera: Mahonia, Alloberberis (formerly Mahonia section Horridae), and Moranothamnus (formerly Berberis claireae); it confirms that a broadly- circumscribed Berberis (that is, including Mahonia, Alloberberis, and Moranothamnus) is monophyletic. Mahonia species bear pinnate leaves long with 3 to 15 leaflets, and flowers in racemes which are long. Several species are popular garden shrubs, grown for their ornamental, often spiny, evergreen foliage, yellow (or rarely red) flowers in autumn, winter and early spring, and blue-black berries. The flowers are borne in terminal clusters or spreading racemes, and may be among the earliest flowers to appear in the growing season. The berries are edible, and rich in vitamin C, though with a very sharp flavor. Although edible, the plants contain berberine, a compound found in many Berberis and Mahonia species, which can cause vomiting, lowered blood pressure, reduced heart rate, lethargy, and other ill effects when consumed in large quantities. The genus name, Mahonia, derives from Bernard McMahon, one of the stewards of the plant collections from the Lewis and Clark expedition. The type species of the genus is M. aquifolium.

A distinction should be made between: * The Latter Rain Revival (1948‚Äì1952) * The Latter Rain Movement (1952‚Äì1960s) * Sharon Schools (Global Missions) * Other groups influenced by the Latter Rain. The Latter Rain Movement had its beginnings in the years following World War II and was contemporary with the evangelical awakening led by Billy Graham, as well as the Healing Revival of Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and William Branham. In the fall of 1947, several leaders of the small Pentecostal, 'Sharon Orphanage and Schools' in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, who were hungry for God were inspired to fast and pray and wait on God after visiting Rev. Branham's healing campaign that was held in the Exhibition Garden in Vancouver, Canada, where four to five thousand people packed inside to witness people being healed. They had never seen anything like it before and those at the Sharon Schools began to fast and pray for more outpourings of the Holy Spirit.‚ÄúThe History, Teaching and Practice of the Latter Rain Heritage‚Äù by Gideo Chiu, 19 82, thesis. Later that year, groups organized large revival events, and news quickly swept across Canada and the United States, influencing many Pentecostal believers. As the revival died down after a few years, those who had been changed by the doctrine formed various groups which became known as \\"The Latter Rain\\" (Movement). The Latter Rain strongly emphasized relational networks over organizational structure. In addition, the term Latter Rain has become somewhat of a pejorative label; therefore, many ministers who were influenced by it are reluctant to make this well known. They often choose to emphasize only formal participation. Much of the movement, along with elements of the Healing Revival, slowly dissolved into parts of the larger Charismatic movement. Emanuele Cannistraci, Dick Iverson, Kevin Conner, Dick Benjamin, Leonard Fox, Violet Kitely, Reg Lazelle, David Schock, George Evans, Charlotte Baker, Fuschia Pickett, Jim Watt and others, were some of the greatest voices that came out of the Latter Rain Revival of 1948. Latter Rain emphases are some of the most noticeable differences between Pentecostals and Charismatics, as delineated, for example, by the Assemblies of God USA in their 2000 position paper on End Time Revival. The Latter Rain movement was rejected by classical Pentecostal denominations. This should not be confused with earlier movements or ideas within Pentecostalism, including the Latter Rain Assemblies in South Africa, begun in 1927. Distinction should also be made between various groups with Latter Rain influences and the Sharon Schools (also known as Global Missions) organization, which has \\"camp\\" meeting grounds at North Battleford, where the revival and movement both originated. History =Latter Rain Revival (1948‚Äì1952)= The late 1940s was a time of deep spiritual hunger among Pentecostals,Schmitt, Charles P. (2002). Floods Upon the Dry Ground, Shippensburg, PA: Revival Press. who were concerned about the declining operation of the gifts of the Spirit once so evident when Pentecostalism began in the early 20th century.Nichol, John Thomas (1966) Pentecostalism, New York: Harper & Row. In response to this spiritual hunger, about 70 students gathered in October 1947 in North Battleford, Saskatchewan, to begin the first term of the newly formed Sharon Bible College.Wanagas, Ewald A. (2000). The Revival & Outpouring of the Holy Spirit: Things I Have Seen and Heard, North Battleford: Sharon Children's Homes and Schools. Most were first-year students, but some were second- and third-year students from the Pentecostal Bible College in Saskatoon. From the latter part of October until the great visitation of the Spirit in February, daily there was someone or a number of people in fasting and prayer, day after day, week after week, classes were suspended, as a heavy burden of prayer and supplication swept in upon the bible school. They knew that God was about to do a new thing in the Church, but just what it was they could not tell. A few prophecies urged them to seek the face of the Lord. It was difficult to study, as the desire to pray was so great.‚ÄúThe History, Teaching and Practice of the Latter Rain Heritage‚Äù by Gideo Chiu, 1982, thesis. The students worked hard by day to prepare the buildings for classes and gathered for prayer in the evenings, which included intercessory prayer, prophecy and fasting. Some fasted between three and forty days. At this time, the school consisted of three buildings at the North Battleford airport.Warnock, George H. (1978) The Feast of Tabernacles, North Battleford: Sharon Schools The group was led primarily by George Hawtin and Percy G. Hunt, two former pastors of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, and Herrick Holt, a pastor of the Church of the Foursquare Gospel in North Battleford.Albert James Dager, \\"An Examination of Kingdom Theology\\", Apologetics Index They were later joined by George Hawtin's brother Ernest Hawtin, and brother-in-law Milford Kirkpatrick. The initial 70 Sharon School students had followed Hawtin and Hunt from Bethel Bible Institute in Saskatoon, where both had formerly taught. Hawtin had been asked to resign for lack of cooperation with the institute, and Hunt resigned in sympathy. = Restoration by Laying on of Hands and Praise and Prophesy by Presbytery = On February 11, 1948, a young woman prophesied\\"that we are on the very verge of a great revival, and all we have to do is open the door, and we could enter in.\\" After the prophecy Pastor Hawtin prayed, \\"Father we do not know where the door is, neither do we know how to enter it.\\"‚ÄúThe History, Teaching and Practice of the Latter Rain Heritage‚Äù by Gideo Chiu, 1982, thesis. A following prophecy described the open door as the doorway into the gifts and ministries in the Body of Christ. Then, the following day, the rain began to pour down. One of the eyewitnesses, Ern Hawtin, brother of Pastor George Hawtin, reported the outpouring as the revival suddenly began in the largest classroom where the entire student body was gathered. One student recalled a vision. Some students were under the power of God on the floor. Other students knelt in worship before the Lord as the anointing deepened and all were in awe of God. The Lord impressed on one of the brethren to lay hands upon a student and pray for him; he was uncertain until one of the sisters [Mrs. Knutson] spoke the same words to him, naming the same student he was to pray for. He obeyed and a revelation was given concerning the student's life and future ministry. Then a lengthy prophecy was given by Ern Hawtin that the gifts of the spirit will be restored to the church to be received by prophecy and the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Haltingly, they began to pray and lay hands on people, as the spiritual gift of healing was received by the power of God. Great repentance, humbling, fasting and prayer prevailed in everyone. Prior to this, the laying on of hands for this purpose was viewed as heretical and had not been practiced for several decades throughout Pentecostalism. Pastor G. Hawtin believed that the nine Spiritual Gifts had been restored to the Church. The revival quickly spread across the country and the world. Down through the decades, Glad Tidings Temple in Vancouver, British Columbia, spread the message of revival around the world through her publications, tapes and missionaries worldwide and Bible schools in Vancouver, Taiwan, Mexico, the Arctic and in Uganda.‚ÄúThe History, Teaching and Practice of the Latter Rain Heritage‚Äù by Gideo Chiu, 1982, thesis.BN Thomas Holdcroft wrote about the events: In the spring of 1948 on Easter weekend, special services were held which the school called the \\"Feast of Pentecost\\". Many people who had heard of the revivals in North Battleford attended these services. This led to what is considered the first \\"Camp Meeting\\" during July 7‚Äì18, 1948, which began drawing large crowds in the thousands. = Pentecostal Denominations Disapproved of the Latter Rain Revival = The teachings from this revival came to be known as \\"Latter Rain\\" and quickly spread throughout Canada, the United States and around the world. Denominational leadership opposed some of the revival in late spring of 1948, and questioned the teachings and practices of the movement.Hawtin, George R. (1948). Local Church Government, North Battleford: Sharon Star For instance, the 1949 General Council of the Assemblies of God USA declared in its Resolution #7: Bill Britton wrote that, However, although there are differences, Assemblies of God USA and Latter Rain have fundamental beliefs in common as shown in Assemblies of God USA's \\"Statement of Fundamental Truths\\" of 16 doctrines that are non-negotiable tenets of faith including the Baptism in the Holy Spirit and Divine Healing, which are considered among the Assemblies of God USA's Cardinal Doctrines that they expressly give continuing emphasis as they are in the New Testament apostolic pattern by teaching and encouraging believers to be baptized in the Holy Spirit, which experience enables believers to evangelize in the power of the Holy Spirit with accompanying supernatural signs and the full working of the Holy Spirit in expression of fruit and spiritual gifts and ministries, with Divine healing an integral part of the gospel including deliverance from sickness.  Israel and the Church  It is generally accepted in Christianity that the Church is the spiritual counterpart of Israel. Parallels have been drawn between the history of Israel and the Church such that whenever GOD moves to restore Israel, the Church similarly experiences a spiritual restoration. For example, in 1900, when the Jews sought to return to their homeland, the Church experienced a restoration of the Baptism of the Holy spirit at the Azusa Street revival in 1906 and in 1948 when the nation of Israel was being restored and Jews pouring into Israel, God restored the doctrine of the laying on hands and praise through the Latter Rain Revival and raised up healing evangelists such as Branham and Oral Roberts. As early as 1952 Layzell of the Latter Rain movement wrote that Israel's natural history is a parallel spiritual history of the Church. While natural Israel deals with earthly nations and kings, spiritual Israel deals with spiritual nations and spiritual rulers. To illustrate this comparison, he compared Israel's sin against GOD in gradually turning to worshipping idols, resulting in GOD letting Israel be captured by Babylon, to the Church gradually allowing elements of pagan worship (images and idols) to infiltrate the Roman Church. God delivered natural Israel from Babylon and the spiritual Israel (the Church) from the Roman bondage as the true evangelical church will never allow images and idols to aid in their worship. In 1967, Israel won the six days war and the charismatic movement was bring restoration to the Church. Finally, in 1980, when Israel declared Jerusalem to be her capital, Glad Tidings Temple had an Israel vision that began the most recent move of GOD in the Church that one day Christians around the world would comfort Israel with singing and worshipping God the land and ministering comfort through financial aid. Divine confirmation of this vision was received through the prophetic word of Emanuele Cannistraci, \\"an accepted prophet in revival circles\\", who unexpectedly telephoned the platform in the sanctuary of Glad Tidings Temple during the Sunday morning service on April 17, 1980, calling from the United States with a prophetic message that was immediately broadcast live through the P. A. system to the entire congregation listening to his message. Emanuele Cannistraci's message totally confirmed the vision the Lord had given Glad Tidings Temple about the Church and Israel. Later his message would be circulated in print.Chieu, Gideon. Thesis on Latter Rain (1982) \\"The History, Teaching and Practice of the Latter Rain Heritage.\\" \\"Latter Rain Teachings on Restoration.\\" (Pages 4, 40) Appendix A. \\"New Move of God Israel Vision.\\" \\"In 1980, Latter Rain came to understand that before the final truths ... could be restored to the Church, Israel must first be restored.\\" \\"Divine Confirmation Through Emmanuel Cannistraci\\". \\"Glad Tidings Temple [Canada]... on April 17, 1980... the voice of Emanuele Cannistraci, an accepted prophet in revival circles... from the States ... immediately broadcast live ... and subsequently circulated in a print-out ... message totally confirmed what the Lord was initiating.\\" George Warnock, former personal secretary to Ern Baxter (an associate with William Branham's healing ministry), resided at Sharon Schools in the fall of 1949 and performed various work supporting the movement. Warnock's book, The Feast of Tabernacles (1951), discussed the role of Sharon Schools and affiliated groups in living out the completion of God's feasts for Israel, through perfection of the saints and their dominion over the earth. He described the Jewish feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles as ones that \\"pre-figure and typify the whole Church Age, beginning with the death of Jesus on the cross, and consummating in \\"the manifestation of the Sons of God\\" ‚Äì the \\"overcomers\\" who will step into immortality and establish the Kingdom of God on earth.\\" Beliefs Latter Rain proponents saw Pentecostalism as spiritually dry in the post-war period and in danger of slipping into a dry or mental formalism like many of their evangelical peers. Latter Rain doctrines addressed this formalism with a series of doctrinal and practical changes. These changes made the Latter Rain Movement distinct from the Pentecostal context from which it arose. Church life in Latter Rain influenced the development of church congregations significantly different from traditional Pentecostal ones. The Latter Rain brought a new focus on the spiritual elements of Christianity, including personal prophecy, typological interpretation of Scripture, the restoration of the five-fold ministry, and a different eschatological emphasis. George Warnock's Feast of Tabernacles outlined some of these emphases, and is widely quoted as an early distillation of the teachings. =Eschatology= The Latter Rain broke with the dispensationalism, which had become entrenched in the ranks of Pentecostalism. It tended to be pessimistic in its outlook, whereas the Latter Rain emphasized a victorious eschatological outlook. Rather than attempting to save a few souls before the rise of the anti-Christ, the Latter Rain emphasized the Church as overcoming and victorious, relating that it would come into \\"full stature\\" as taught by the Apostle Paul. The term Latter Rain stems from Bible passages such as Jeremiah 3:3, 5:23‚Äì25, Joel 2:23, Hosea 6:3, Zechariah 10:1, and James 5:7. The idea of a latter rain was not new to Pentecostals. It was present from the earliest days of Pentecostalism, which believed that the reappearance of speaking in tongues and the baptism of the Holy Spirit marked the \\"latter rain of God's Spirit.\\" It was believed that these were signs of the coming end of history. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost had been the \\"former rain\\" that established the Church, but the current \\"move\\" of the Spirit was the latter rain that would bring the Church's work to completion and culminate in the imminent Second Coming of Jesus Christ. =Joel's Army= A major feature of the expected latter rain would be the \\"manifestation of the Sons of God\\" or \\"Joel's Army\\". The Latter Rain movement taught that as the end of the age approached, the \\"overcomers\\" would arise within the Church. Various branches debated the nature and extent of this manifestation. These Manifest Sons of God, ones who have come into the full stature of Jesus Christ, would receive the Spirit without measure. They would be as Jesus was when he was on earth and would receive a number of divine gifts, including the ability to change their physical location, to speak any language through the Holy Spirit, and to perform divine healings and other miracles. They would complete the work of God, restoring man's rightful position as was originally mandated in Genesis. By coming into the full stature of Christ, they would usher in his millennial reign. Extreme versions of this interpretation referred to Jesus as a \\"pattern\\" Son and applied \\"ye are gods\\" (Psalms 82:6) to this coming company of believers.Kenneth E. Hagin, New Thresholds of Faith, (Tulsa, OK: FLP, 2nd edn, 1985 [1972]), p.56. Joel's Army has been connected to Dominion Theology and Fivefold ministry thinking. It has been described in the 21st century as a \\"rapidly growing apocalyptic movement,\\" prophesied to become an \\"Armageddon-ready military force of young people who will love not their life unto death, who will stand face to face with the incarnation of satan as the antichrist and his army in the end of the age. =Ecclesiology= The \\"Sacrifice of Praise\\" and the restoration of the Tabernacle of David were important themes within the Latter Rain. Dancing, lifting of hands and spontaneous praise are marks of this movement. An effort was made to show the error of many Christians who denied that such practices were imperative for believers. A major theme of the Latter Rain was \\"unity\\" among the believers in the church service, the geographic region, and at large. They taught that God saw the Church organized not into denominations but along geographical lines, as in the book of Acts‚Äîone Church but in different locations. They expected that in the coming \\"last days,\\" the various Christian denominations would dissolve, and the true Church would coalesce into citywide churches under the leadership of the newly restored apostles and prophets. The Latter Rain taught that there would be a restoration of the five ministerial roles mentioned in Ephesians 4:11: apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher. They believed that the foundational roles of apostle and prophet had been lost after the time of the first apostles due to the Dark Ages. They thought that God was restoring these ministries in the present day. These ideas are part of the \\"prophetic movement\\" and \\"New Apostolic Reformation\\". Belief in the restoration of the offices of apostle and prophet distinguished the Latter Rain Movement from the rest of Pentecostalism. Classical Pentecostals understood the five ministerial roles not as offices or authority designated to any particular person but as functions available to the entire Spirit-baptized congregation, subject to the leading of the Spirit.Shane Jack Clifton, An Analysis of the Developing Ecclesiology of the Assemblies of God in Australia , [PhD thesis, Australian Catholic University, 2005], p. 150. Accessed May 20, 2010. =Pneumatology= Pentecostals traditionally held that the baptism of the Holy Spirit usually comes after prolonged \\"tarrying\\" or waiting for the Spirit. By contrast, the Latter Rain movement taught that the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts can be imparted from one believer to another through the laying on of hands.Riss, \\"The Latter Rain Movement of 1948\\", Pneuma, p. 35-36. A participant in services at Bethesda Missionary Temple in Detroit, Michigan described the discerning of gifts: Controversies The movement is distinguished from those whom it influenced. Some branches of the movement developed as cult-like groups, such as the Body of Christ or The Move; some remained orthodox Christian, and other parts of the movement moderated the doctrine and ultimately had positive effects on the Charismatic and Pentecostal churches at large. During the early years, some of the most ardent critics of the Latter Rain and its theology came from within Pentecostalism, particularly the Assemblies of God. In 1949, the General Council of the Assemblies of God, following the leadership of its General Superintendent E. S. Williams, stated that pre-tribulation rapture represented correct eschatology. It rejected the Latter Rain practice of personal prophecy accompanied by the laying on of hands, as well as the Manifest Sons of God doctrine.Minutes of the General Council of the Assemblies of God, Resolution 7: \\"The New Order of the Latter Rain.\\" Stanley Frodsham, a noted Assemblies of God leader, left the Assemblies in favor of the Latter Rain. He noted that it had practices and experiences similar to the Azusa Street Revival, a founding element of the Pentecostal Church. The opposition of other Pentecostal denominations ultimately led to the withdrawal, under pressure, of Ivan Q. Spencer, founder of the Elim Fellowship, from inter-Pentecostal fellowship. Contemporary criticism of the Latter Rain movement has emanated from fundamentalists such as John MacArthur, as demonstrated by their websites that attack the movement. Writers on such sites typically use association with the Latter Rain as a way to discredit modern Charismatics.For an example, see Barbara Aho, \\"The Latter Rain Revival\\", WatchPair.com. Some identify the roots of more recent Charismatic trends such as Kingdom Now theology, the Kansas City Prophets including Paul Cain, and the New Apostolic Reformation including C. Peter Wagner as being rooted in the Latter Rain. The modern charismatic movement, while clearly influenced by some Latter Rain ideals such as the fivefold ministry and the laying on of hands, generally rejects the more extreme elements of Latter Rain theology, although even many charismatics argue that the New Apostolic Reformation wing of the movement are more heavily influenced by this theology. A small, controversial branch of the Latter Rain is the \\"Reconciliation\\" movement, especially those who believe in \\"Manifest Sonship\\" theology.Sigler.org and Greater-emmanuel.org are websites with many links to ministries that teach both Reconciliation and Sonship doctrines. Reconciliation (also called ultimate or universal reconciliation) is a doctrine of Christian Universalism that acknowledges God's plan to save the whole world through the atoning sacrifice of Christ. According to this tradition, the manifest Sons of God are expected to reign on earth during a coming millennial age until ultimately every human being will be restored to harmony with God.See Hearingthetruthofgod.com: THE ‚ÄúSECOND‚Äù COMING ‚Äú?‚Äù by J. Preston Eby, THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SONS OF GOD , and THE COMING AGE OF MIRACLES by Bill Britton. Leaders in this tradition include John Gavazzoni, Kenneth Greatorex, Gary Sigler, and Robert Torango. Leaders The following list includes some representative leaders of various branches, both past and present; it is not exhaustive. =Founders= *Mara Fraser founded the Latter Rain Assemblies in South Africa (Blourokkies) in the 1920s, but this is generally considered a different movement from what developed in North America. *Reg Layzell founded Glad Tidings church in Vancouver, British Columbia; he is an author and influenced such books as The Key of David and Unto Perfection. *George Warnock wrote The Feast of Tabernacles (1951) which became very influential for its view of the biblical feasts and approach to the Scriptures. One identifiable mark of those influenced by the Latter Rain is their spiritual hermeneutic. *George Hawtin and his brother Ern Hawtin were early leaders and evangelists in the movement, who traveled to spread the word. *A. Earl Lee was one of the fathers of the movement in southern California. He had previously been involved with the preacher Aimee Semple McPherson. *Myrtle D. Beall was the founder and Senior Pastor of Bethesda Missionary Temple in Detroit, Michigan until her death in 1979. M.D. Beall was raised Catholic, and was converted during the Depression in a Protestant church in northeast Detroit that asked her to leave after she began sharing her experience of the Baptism in the Holy Ghost with the evidence of speaking in tongues (she said this happened in the early 1930s in front of her wood- burning stove early one morning as she prayed with her Bible open.) Bethesda's first building was a former tire repair shop. Beall began the work simply as a place for neighborhood women to bring their children to be schooled in the Scriptures. It was here that Phil W. \\"Pop\\" Baer and his wife Macy were saved, and served faithfully the rest of their lives. P.W. Baer was Bethesda's first adult male member and was the church treasurer until his death. His wife Macy was prominent leader of the daily prayer meetings that began in 1941 when Pearl Harbor was bombed, and continued until M. D. Beall visited Glad Tidings in Vancouver, British Columbia in December 1948. When she arrived back at her church, the same revival fires that she experienced in Vancouver erupted in Detroit. The next year, Bethesda would move into a brand new sanctuary holding 2,200 on the corner of Nevada and Van Dyke Avenue in Detroit (the building is now owned by The Perfecting Church pastored by Marvin Wynans.) Sons James (1924 - 2013) and Harry Beall later joined her in the ministry. At her death, James became the senior pastor of Bethesda. During the 1970s, he was a prominent speaker and writer in the Charismatic Renewal. For instance, he was one of the speakers at the World Conference on the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem in 1974. Other speakers included Corrie ten Boom, Kathryn Kuhlman, Jamie Buckingham, J. Rodman Williams, as well as many others. The most widely circulated Charismatic magazine of that time, the Logos Journal, often featured articles by James. Her married daughter Patricia Beall Gruits became the author of several books, including \\"Understanding God\\", and also founder of a mission to Haiti called RHEMA, providing medical care to the poor, and trains native ministers and medical workers to serve in Haiti. Her husband Peter Gruits worked to build and direct the Haiti mission until his death. Rev. Patricia Gruits resides today in Rochester Hills, Michigan near family members who are carrying on the mission in Haiti, and now publishes her Foundation Stone Teaching series in many languages. James Beall's only daughter Analee Dunn is now Senior Pastor in Sterling Heights, Michigan at what is now known as Bethesda Christian Church north of Detroit, Michigan. This was one of the first major churches to embrace the Latter Rain and became the center of much activity, where services were held daily for almost 4 years, affecting tens of thousands from around the globe. *James Watt was an elder at the Sharon Orphanage and school. *J. Preston Eby was an early proponent; he resigned under pressure from the Pentecostal Holiness Church in 1956 because his Latter Rain beliefs were not approved by the church. *Thomas Wyatt, a pastor from Portland, Oregon, hosted the North Battleford men at a pastor's conference, thus enabling the spread of the doctrine. *Garlon and Modest Pemberton were the pastors of a significant Latter Rain church in Houston. *Charles E.

It founded Portland Bible College in Portland, Oregon, which is a leading institution in the Latter Rain tradition. Many of the books used by Latter Rain churches are textbooks created for Portland Bible College and written by its original teachers. These books include Present Day Truths by Dick Iverson and many by Kevin Conner. City Bible Publishing carries many contemporary books that define the movement. Kevin Conner's Tabernacle of David and Present Day Truths are classics on worship and restoration. MFI's leadership includes many significant figures from the early years of the movement. *Dick Iverson, founder of City Bible Church, formerly Bible Temple, and Portland Bible College, was the apostolic overseer of Ministers Fellowship International. That position is now held by Frank Damazio. *Kevin Conner, an influential Bible teacher in the Latter Rain; he blended some of the new ideas with more traditional hermeneutics. He influenced T.D. Jakes and other ministers.Jakes citing Conner, The Potter's House *David Schoch was associated with this branch of the Latter Rain and was an honorary member of the apostolic board of MFI until his death in July 2007.

He worked as an illustrator in the advertising industry in S√£o Paulo before once more leaving Brazil, this time for France, in 1981. He had hoped to find work illustrating comics, but the Franco-Belgian comics industry was in difficulty at the time so he fell back on advertising once again, with a few comics pieces being published in L'√âcho des savanes and Pilote.

Cajal bodies (CBs) also coiled bodies, are spherical nuclear bodies of 0.3‚Äì1.0 ¬µm in diameter found in the nucleus of proliferative cells like embryonic cells and tumor cells, or metabolically active cells like neurons. CBs are membrane-less organelles and largely consist of proteins and RNA. They were first reported by Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in 1903, who called them nucleolar accessory bodies due to their association with the nucleoli in neuronal cells. They were rediscovered with the use of the electron microscope (EM) and named coiled bodies, according to their appearance as coiled threads on EM images, and later renamed after their discoverer. Research on CBs was accelerated after discovery and cloning of the marker protein p80/Coilin. CBs have been implicated in RNA-related metabolic processes such as the biogenesis, maturation and recycling of snRNPs, histone mRNA processing and telomere maintenance. CBs assemble RNA which is used by telomerase to add nucleotides to the ends of telomeres. History CBs were initially discovered by neurobiologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in 1903 as small argyrophilic (readily stained by silver salts, literally \\"silver loving\\") spots in the nuclei of silver-stained neuronal cells. Because of their close association with nucleoli, he named them nucleolar accessory bodies. Later on, they were forgotten and rediscovered multiple times independently which led to a state where scientists from different research fields used different names for the same structure. Names used for CBs included \\"sphere organelles\\", \\"Binnenk√∂rper\\", \\"nucleolar bodies\\" or \\"coiled bodies\\". The name coiled bodies comes from observation of electron microscopists Monneron and Bernhard. They described bodies as aggregates composed of coiled threads with thickness of 400‚Äì600 √Ö. When using higher magnification, they appear as tiny, 50 √Ö thick fibrils irregularly twisted along the axis of the threads. The bodies were even predicted to consist of ribonucleoproteins since treatment of cells with protease and RNase together, but not alone, caused dramatic changes to the structure of CBs. Localization Cajal bodies are only found in nuclei of plant, yeast, and animal cells. The cells in which Cajal bodies are most apparent usually demonstrate high levels of transcriptional activity, and are often dividing rapidly. Cell cycle They are about 0.1‚Äì2.0 micrometres and are found one to five per nucleus. The number varies in different types of cells and over the cell cycle. Maximum number is reached in mid G1 phase and towards G2 they become larger and their number decreases. CBs disassemble during the M phase and reappear again later in G1 phase. Cajal bodies are possibly sites of assembly or modification of the transcription machinery of the nucleus. Functions CBs are bound to the nucleolus by coilin proteins. P80-coilin is a specific marker for coiled bodies, and demonstrates these bodies tend to be associated with the nucleolus when cells are not dividing. CBs are associated with telomerase assembly and recruitment via a CAB-RNA sequence common in both CB RNAs (scaRNAs) and the RNA component of telomerase (TERC). TCAB1 recognizes the CAB sequence in both and recruits telomerase to the CBs. CBs contain high concentrations of splicing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), possibly indicating that they function to modify RNA after it has been transcribed from DNA. Experimental evidence indicates that CBs contribute to the biogenesis of enzyme telomerase, and assist in subsequent transport of telomerase to telomeres.

He left a lasting impact on televangelism and the modern Charismatic movement and is recognized as the \\"principal architect of restorationist thought\\" for Charismatics by some Christian historians. At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India. Branham claimed to have received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame spread rapidly as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion the broader healing revival that later became the modern Charismatic movement. From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the Pentecostal churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry. Unlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings known as the Full Gospel tradition, Branham developed an alternate theology that was primarily a mixture of Calvinist and Arminian doctrines, and had a heavy focus on dispensationalism and Branham's own unique eschatological views. While widely accepting the restoration doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his Charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as \\"revelatory madness\\". Many of his followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as The Message. In 1963, Branham preached a sermon in which he indicated he was a prophet with the anointing of Elijah, who had come to herald Christ's second coming. Despite Branham's objections, some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a cult of personality during his final years. Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted through the William Branham Evangelistic Association, who reported in 2018 that about 2 million people receive their material. Branham died following a car accident in 1965. Early life The dirt-floor log cabin that was William Branham's birthplace as shown in his biography William Branham: A Man Sent From God William M. Branham was born near Burkesville, Kentucky, on April 6, 1909, the son of Charles and Ella Harvey Branham, the oldest of ten children. He claimed that at his birth, a \\"Light come whirling through the window, about the size of a pillow, and circled around where I was, and went down on the bed\\". Branham told his publicist Gordon Lindsay that he had mystical experiences from an early age; and that at age three he heard a \\"voice\\" speaking to him from a tree telling him \\"he would live near a city called New Albany\\". According to Branham, that year his family moved to Jeffersonville, Indiana. Branham also said that when he was seven years old, God told him to avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. Branham stated he never violated the command. Branham's father was an alcoholic, and he grew up in \\"deep poverty\\" much like their neighbors. As a child, he would often wear a coat held closed only by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Branham's neighbors reported him as \\"someone who always seemed a little different\\", but said he was a dependable youth. His tendency towards \\"mystical experiences and moral purity\\" caused misunderstandings among his friends, family, and other young people; he was a \\"black sheep\\" from an early age. Branham called his childhood \\"a terrible life.\\" At 19, Branham left home seeking a better life. He traveled to Phoenix, Arizona, where he worked for two years on a ranch and began a successful career in boxing. He returned to Jeffersonville when his brother died in 1929. Branham had no experience with religion as a child; he said the first time he heard a prayer was at his brother's funeral. Soon after, while working for the Public Service Company of Indiana, Branham was almost killed when he was overcome by gas. While recovering from the accident, he said he again heard a voice leading him to begin seeking God. He began attending a local Independent Baptist church, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville, where he converted to Christianity. Six months later, he was ordained as an Independent Baptist minister. His early ministry was an \\"impressive success\\"; he quickly attracted a small group of followers, who helped obtain a tent in which he could hold a revival. At the time of Branham's conversion, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville was a nominally Baptist church that observed some Pentecostal doctrines, including divine healing. As a result, he may have been exposed to some Pentecostal teachings from his conversion. He was first exposed to a Pentecostal denominational church in 1936, which invited him to join, but he refused. During June 1933, Branham held revival meetings in his tent. On June 2 that year, the Jeffersonville Evening News said the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. His followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning, and that when he was baptizing converts on June 11, 1933, in the Ohio River near Jeffersonville, a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say, \\"As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming\\". Belief in the baptismal story is a critical element of faith among Branham's followers. Branham initially interpreted this in reference to the restoration of the gifts of the spirit to the church and made regular references to the baptismal story from the earliest days of the healing revival. In later years, Branham also connected the story to his teaching ministry. Baptist historian Doug Weaver said Branham might have embellished the baptismal story when he was achieving success in the healing revival. Branham Tabernacle c. 1935 Following his June tent meeting, Branham's supporters helped him organize a new church, the Branham Tabernacle, in Jeffersonville. Branham served as pastor from 1933 to 1946. The church flourished at first, but its growth began to slow. Because of the Great Depression, it was often short of funds, so Branham served without compensation. Branham believed the stagnation of the church's growth was a punishment from God for his failure to embrace Pentecostalism. Branham married Amelia Hope Brumbach (b. July 16, 1913) in 1934, and they had two children; William \\"Billy\\" Paul Branham (b. September 13, 1935) and Sharon Rose Branham (b. October 27, 1936). Branham's wife died on July 22, 1937, and their daughter died four days later (July 26, 1937), shortly after the Ohio River flood of 1937. Branham interpreted their deaths as God's punishment for his continued resistance to holding revivals for the Oneness Pentecostals. Branham married Meda Marie Broy in 1941, and together they had three children; Rebekah (b. 1946), Sarah (b. 1950), and Joseph (b. 1955). Healing revival =Background= Branham is known for his role in the healing revivals that occurred in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, and most participants in the movement regarded him as its initiator. Christian writer John Crowder described the period of revivals as \\"the most extensive public display of miraculous power in modern history\\". Some, like Christian author and countercult activist Hank Hanegraaff, rejected the entire healing revival as a hoax and condemned the evangelical and Charismatic movements as cults. Divine healing is a tradition and belief that was historically held by a majority of Christians but it became increasingly associated with Evangelical Protestantism. The fascination of most of American Christianity with divine healing played a significant role in the popularity and inter-denominational nature of the revival movement. Branham held massive inter-denominational meetings, from which came reports of hundreds of miracles. Historian David Harrell described Branham and Oral Roberts as the two giants of the movement and called Branham its \\"unlikely leader.\\" =Early campaigns= William Branham and F. F. Bosworth Branham held his first meetings as a faith healer in 1946. His healing services are well documented, and he is regarded as the pacesetter for those who followed him. At the time they were held, Branham's revival meetings were the largest religious meetings some American cities he visited had ever seen; reports of 1,000 to 1,500 converts per meeting were common. Historians name his June 1946 St. Louis meetings as the inauguration of the healing revival period. He said he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry. In his later years, in an attempt to link his ministry with the end time, he connected his vision with the establishment of the nation of Israel, at one point mistakenly stating the vision occurred on the same day. His first revival meetings were held over 12 days during June 1946 in St. Louis. His first campaign manager, W. E. Kidston, was editor of The Apostolic Herald and had many contacts in the Pentecostal movement. Kidston was instrumental in helping organize Branham's early revival meetings. Time magazine reported on his St. Louis campaign meetings, and according to the article, Branham drew a crowd of over 4,000 sick people who desired healing and recorded him diligently praying for each. Branham's fame began to grow as a result of the publicity and reports covering his meetings. Following the St. Louis meetings, Branham launched a tour of small Oneness Pentecostal churches across the Midwest and southern United States, from which stemmed reports of healing and one report of a resurrection. By August his fame had spread widely. He held meetings that month in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and drew a crowd of 25,000 with attendees from 28 different states. The size of the crowds presented a problem for Branham's team as they found it difficult to find venues that could seat large numbers of attendees. F. F. Bosworth counsels attendees on the doctrine of divine healing at a Branham Campaign meeting in Tacoma, Washington, April 1948. Branham's revivals were interracial from their inception and were noted for their \\"racial openness\\" during the period of widespread racial unrest. An African American minister participating in the St. Louis meetings claimed to be healed during the revival, helping to bring Branham a sizable African American following from the early days of the revival. Dedicated to ministering to both races, Branham insisted on holding interracial meetings even in the southern states. To satisfy segregation laws when ministering in the south, Branham's team would use a rope to divide the crowd by race. After holding a very successful revival meeting in Shreveport during mid-1947, Branham began assembling an evangelical team that stayed with him for most of the revival period. The first addition to the team was Jack Moore and Young Brown, who periodically assisted him in managing his meetings. Following the Shreveport meetings, Branham held a series of meetings in San Antonio, Phoenix, and at various locations in California. Moore invited his friend Gordon Lindsay to join the campaign team, which he did beginning at a meeting in Sacramento, California, in late 1947. Lindsay was a successful publicist and manager for Branham, and played a key role in helping him gain national and international recognition.In 1948, Branham and Lindsay founded Voice of Healing magazine, which was originally aimed at reporting Branham's healing campaigns. Lindsay was impressed with Branham's focus on humility and unity, and was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance among Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostal groups by expanding his revival meetings beyond the United Pentecostal Church to include all of the major Pentecostal groups. April 1948 cover of Voice of Healing magazine The first meetings organized by Lindsay were held in northwestern North America during late 1947. At the first of these meetings, held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canadian minister Ern Baxter joined Branham's team. Lindsay reported 70,000 attendees to the 14 days of meetings and long prayer lines as Branham prayed for the sick. William Hawtin, a Canadian Pentecostal minister, attended one of Branham's Vancouver meetings in November 1947 and was impressed by Branham's healings. Branham thus became an influence on the Latter Rain revival movement, which Hawtin helped initiate. In January 1948, meetings were held in Florida; F. F. Bosworth met Branham at the meetings and also joined his team. Bosworth was among the pre-eminent ministers of the Pentecostal movement and lent great weight to Branham's campaign team. He remained a strong Branham supporter until his death in 1958. Bosworth endorsed Branham as \\"the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit\\" he had ever met. During early 1947, a major campaign was held in Kansas City, where Branham and Lindsay first met Oral Roberts. Roberts and Branham had contact at different points during the revival. Roberts said Branham was \\"set apart, just like Moses\\". From left: Young Brown, Jack Moore, William Branham, Oral Roberts, Gordon Lindsay; photo taken at Kansas City in 1948 Branham spent many hours ministering and praying for the sick during his campaigns, and like many other leading evangelists of the time he suffered exhaustion. After one year of campaigning, his exhaustion began leading to health issues. Attendees reported seeing him \\"staggering from intense fatigue\\" during his last meetings. Just as Branham began to attract international attention in May 1948, he announced that due to illness he would have to halt his campaign. His illness shocked the growing movement, and his abrupt departure from the field caused a rift between him and Lindsay over the Voice of Healing magazine. Branham insisted that Lindsay take over complete management of the publication. With the main subject of the magazine no longer actively campaigning, Lindsay was forced to seek other ministers to promote. He decided to publicize Oral Roberts during Branham's absence, and Roberts quickly rose to prominence, in large part due to Lindsay's coverage. Branham partially recovered from his illness and resumed holding meetings in October 1948; in that month he held a series of meetings around the United States without Lindsay's support. Branham's return to the movement led to his resumed leadership of it. In November 1948, he met with Lindsay and Moore and told them he had received another angelic visitation, instructing him to hold a series of meetings across the United States and then to begin holding meetings internationally. As a result of the meeting, Lindsay rejoined Branham's campaigning team. Style Branham at a healing campaign meeting Most revivalists of the era were flamboyant but Branham was usually calm and spoke quietly, only occasionally raising his voice. His preaching style was described as \\"halting and simple\\", and crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitation and \\"constant communication with God\\". He refused to discuss controversial doctrinal issues during the early years of his campaigns, and issued a policy statement that he would only minister on the \\"great evangelical truths\\". He insisted his calling was to bring unity among the different churches he was ministering to and to urge the churches to return to the roots of early Christianity. In the first part of his meetings, one of Branham's companion evangelists would preach a sermon. Ern Baxter or F. F. Bosworth usually filled this role, but other ministers also participated in Branham's campaigns. Baxter generally focused on bible teaching; Bosworth counseled supplicants on the need for faith and the doctrine of divine healing. Following their build-up, Branham would take the podium and deliver a short sermon, in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences. After completing his sermon, he would proceed with a prayer line where he would pray for the sick. Branham would often request God to \\"confirm his message with two-or-three faith inspired miracles\\". His campaign manager organized the prayer line, sending supplicants forward to be prayed for on stage individually. Branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing the results on the stage would inspire faith in the audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for. Describing Branham's method, Bosworth said \\"he does not begin to pray for the healing of the afflicted in body in the healing line each night until God anoints him for the operation of the gift, and until he is conscious of the presence of the Angel with him on the platform. Without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless.\\" Branham told audiences the angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission. He described the first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person's hand, which communicated to him the nature of the illness, but did not guarantee healing. Branham's use of what his fellow evangelists called a word of knowledge gift separated him from his contemporaries. This second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948, and was used to \\"amaze tens of thousands\\" at his meetings. According to Bosworth, this gift of knowledge allowed Branham \\"to see and enable him to tell the many events of [people's] lives from their childhood down to the present\\". This caused many in the healing revival to view Branham as a \\"seer like the old testament prophets\\". Branham amazed even fellow evangelists, which served to further push him into a legendary status in the movement. Branham's audiences were often awestruck by the events during his meetings. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and \\"the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation\\". Opposition Branham faced criticism and opposition from the early days of the healing campaign. According to historian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact; \\"most people either loved him or hated him\\". In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, a minister in Saskatchewan, Canada, stated that many people Branham pronounced as healed later died. A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation. Taylor presented evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated. He stated, \\"there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong\\". The number of people who claimed to be healed in Branham's campaign meetings \\"is impossible to approximate\\" and the numbers vary greatly between sources. According to Kydd, by watching films of the revival meetings, \\"the viewer would assume almost everyone was healed\\" but the results proved otherwise the few times follow-up was made. No consistent record of follow-ups was made, making analysis of the claims difficult to subsequent researchers. Pentecostal historian Walter Hollenweger said, \\"very few were actually healed\\". Some attendees of Branham's meetings believed the healings were a hoax and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter the prayer line. Some people left his meetings disappointed after finding Branham's conviction that everyone in the audience could be healed without being in the prayer line proved incorrect. Branham generally attributed the failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith. The \\"word of knowledge\\" gift was likewise subject to much criticism. Hollenweger investigated Branham's use of the \\"word of knowledge gift\\" and found no instances in which Branham was mistaken in his often-detailed pronouncements. Criticism of Branham's use of this gift was primarily around its nature; some accused him of witchcraft and telepathy. Branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected the assertions. =Growing fame= alt=A man stands at a podium with a light colored object above his head In January 1950, Branham's campaign team held their Houston campaign, one of the most significant series of meetings of the revival. The location of their first meeting was too small to accommodate the approximately 8,000 attendees, and they had to relocate to the Sam Houston Coliseum. On the night of January 24, 1950, Branham was photographed during a debate between Bosworth and local Baptist minister W. E. Best regarding the theology of divine healing. Bosworth argued in favor, while Best argued against. The photograph showed a light above Branham's head, which he and his associates believed to be supernatural. The photograph became well-known in the revival movement and is regarded by Branham's followers as an iconic relic. Branham believed the light was a divine vindication of his ministry; others believed it was a glare from the venue's overhead lighting. Congressman William Upshaw In January 1951, US Congressman William Upshaw, who had been crippled for 59 years as the result of an accident, said he was miraculously healed and had regained the ability to walk in a Branham meeting, further fueling Branham's fame. Upshaw sent a letter describing his healing claim to each member of Congress. Among the widespread media reports was a story in the Los Angeles Times that described it as \\"perhaps the most effective healing testimony this generation has ever seen\\". Upshaw died in November 1952, at the age of 86. Branham's meetings were regularly attended by journalists, who wrote articles about the miracles reported by Branham and his team throughout the years of his revivals, and claimed patients were cured of various ailments after attending prayer meetings with Branham. Durban Sunday Tribune and The Natal Mercury reported wheelchair-bound people rising and walking. Winnipeg Free Press reported a girl was cured of deafness. El Paso Herald-Post reported hundreds of attendees at one meeting seeking divine healing. Logansport Press reported a father's claim that his four-year-old son, who suffered from a \\"rare brain ailment\\", benefited from Branham's meetings. Despite such occasional glowing reports, most of the press coverage Branham received was negative. According to Hollenweger, \\"Branham filled the largest stadiums and meeting halls in the world\\" during his five major international campaigns. Branham held his first series of campaigns in Europe during April 1950 with meetings in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Attendance at the meetings generally exceeded 7,000 despite resistance to his meetings by the state churches. In Norway, the Directorate of Health forbade Branham from laying hands on the sick and sent police to his meetings to enforce the order. Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully tour in Europe. A 1952 campaign in South Africa had the largest attendance in Branham's career, with an estimated 200,000 attendees. According to Lindsay, the altar call at his Durban meeting received 30,000 converts. During international campaigns in 1954, Branham visited Portugal, Italy, and India. Branham's final major overseas tour in 1955 included visits to Switzerland and Germany. =Financial difficulties= In 1955, Branham's campaigning career began to slow following financial setbacks. Even after he became famous, Branham continued to wear inexpensive suits and refused large salaries; he was not interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry and was reluctant to solicit donations during his meetings. During the early years of his campaigns, donations had been able to cover costs, but from 1955, donations failed to cover the costs of three successive campaigns, one of which incurred a $15,000 deficit. Some of Branham's business associates thought he was partially responsible because of his lack of interest in the financial affairs of the campaigns and tried to hold him personally responsible for the debt. Branham briefly stopped campaigning and said he would have to take a job to repay the debt, but the Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International ultimately offered financial assistance to cover the debt. Branham became increasingly reliant on the Full Gospel Businessmen to finance his campaign meetings as the Pentecostal denominations began to withdraw their financial support. Finances became an issue again in 1956 when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) charged Branham with tax evasion. The American government targeted the other leading revivalists with lawsuits during the same time period, including Oral Roberts, Jack Coe, and A. A. Allen. The IRS asserted income reported by the ministers as non-taxable gifts was taxable, despite the fact Branham had not kept the gifts for himself. Except Allen, who won his legal battle, the evangelists settled their cases out of court. The IRS investigation showed Branham did not pay close attention to the amount of money flowing through his ministry. It also revealed that others were taking advantage of him. Branham's annual salary was $7,000 while his manager's was $80,000. Oral Roberts earned a salary of $15,000 in the same years. The case was eventually settled out of court with the payment of a $40,000 penalty. Branham was never able to completely pay off the debt. Amid the financial issues, Lindsay left Branham's campaign team. Branham eventually criticized the Voice of Healing magazine as a \\"massive financial organization\\" that put making money ahead of promoting good. =End of the revival= By the mid-1950s, dozens of the ministers associated with Branham and his campaigns had launched similar healing campaigns. In 1956, the healing revival reached its peak, as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings. Through the Voice of Healing magazine, Branham and Lindsay ineffectively attempted to discourage their activities by saying Branham wished they would help their local churches rather than launch national careers. The swelling number of competitors and emulators further reduced attendance at Branham's meetings. His correspondence also decreased sharply; whereas he had once received \\"a thousand letters a day\\", his mail dropped to 75 letters a day but Branham thought the decline was temporary. He continued expecting something greater, which he said \\"nobody will be able to imitate\\". In 1955, he reported a vision of a renewed tent ministry and a \\"third pull which would be dramatically different\\" than his earlier career. Among Branham's emulators was Jim Jones, the founder and leader of the Peoples Temple. According to Historian Catherine Wessinger, while rejecting Christianity as a false religion, Jones covertly used popular Christian figures to advance his own ideology. To draw the crowds he was seeking, Jones needed a religious headliner and invited Branham to share the platform with him at a self-organized religious convention held at the Cadle Tabernacle auditorium in Indianapolis from June 11 to 15, 1956. Branham critics Peter Duyzer and John Collins reported that Branham \\"performed numerous miracles\\", drawing a crowd of 11,000. Jones later became known for the mass murder and suicide at Jonestown in November 1978. According to Collins, Jim Jones and Paul Sch√§fer were influenced to move to South America by Branham's 1961 prophecy concerning Armageddon, but ultimately concluded that Jones and Branham \\"did not see eye to eye\\", and that Jones rejected Branham as a dishonest person. By 1960, the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11. Several perspectives on the decline of the healing revival have been offered. Crowder suggested Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline. Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations. Weaver agreed Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns. The Assemblies of God were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953. Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial ecumenism of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflicts‚Äîparticularly between the Oneness and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism. Later life =Teaching ministry= As the healing revival began to wane, many of Branham's contemporaries moved into the leadership of the emerging Charismatic movement, which emphasized use of spiritual gifts. The Charismatic movement is a global movement within both Protestant and non-Protestant Christianity that supports the adoption of traditionally Pentecostal beliefs, especially the spiritual gifts (charismata). The movement began in the teachings of the healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of Christians. At the same time the Charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance, Branham began to transition to a teaching ministry. He began speaking on the controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of the revival. By the 1960s, Branham's contemporaries and the Pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher. The leadership of the Pentecostal churches pressed Branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for the sick. Branham refused, arguing that the purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and, having thus been attracted, it was time to teach them the doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation. Branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted, saying, \\"It's either all of God, or none of God\\". At first, Branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at Jeffersonville, but beginning in the 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited. His criticisms of Pentecostal organizations, and especially his views on holiness and the role of women, led to his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement and the Pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity. Branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations \\"had choked out the glory and Spirit of God\\". As a result of their view of his teachings, many Pentecostals judged that Branham had \\"stepped out of his anointing\\" and had become a \\"bad teacher of heretical doctrine\\". Despite his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement, Branham's followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life; some even claimed he was the Messiah. Branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering, but the belief persisted. Many followers moved great distances to live near his home in Jeffersonville and, led by Leo Mercer, subsequently set up a colony in Arizona following Branham's move to Tucson in 1962. Branham lamented Mercer and the actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers. Branham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across North America during the 1960s. He held his final set of revival meetings in Shreveport at the church of his early campaign manager Jack Moore in November 1965. =Teachings= Branham developed a unique theology and placed emphasis on a few key doctrines, including his eschatological views, annihilationism, oneness of the Godhead, predestination, eternal security, and the serpent's seed. His followers refer to his teachings collectively as \\"The Message\\". Kydd and Weaver have both referred to Branham's teachings as \\"Branhamology\\". Most of Branham's teachings have precedents within sects of the Pentecostal movement or in other non-Pentecostal denominations. The doctrines Branham imported from non-Pentecostal theology and the unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from Pentecostal churches and the Charismatic movement. His unique arrangement of doctrines, coupled with the highly controversial nature of the serpent seed doctrine, caused the alienation of many of his former supporters. The Full Gospel tradition, which has its roots in Wesleyan Arminianism, is the theology generally adhered to by the Charismatic movement and Pentecostal denominations. Branham's doctrines are a blend of both Calvinism and Arminianism, which are considered contradictory by many theologians. As a result, his theology seemed \\"complicated and bizarre\\" to many people who admired him personally during the years of the healing revival. Many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe Branham had rediscovered the true doctrines of the early church. Divine healing Throughout his ministry, Branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often the central teaching he espoused during the healing campaign. He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual atonement; \\"salvation for the soul and healing for the body\\". He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times. Branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing. Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present. This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith. Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by Smith Wigglesworth, Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation. Annihilationism Annihilationism, the doctrine that the damned will be totally destroyed after the final judgment so as to not exist, was introduced to Pentecostalism in the teachings of Charles Fox Parham (1873‚Äì1929). Not all Pentecostal sects accepted the idea.Douglas Gordon Jacobsen. (2006) A Reader in Pentecostal Theology: Voices from the First Generation, Indiana University Press. p. 31. Prior to 1957, Branham taught a doctrine of eternal punishment in hell. By 1957 he began promoting an annihilationist position in keeping with Parham's teachings. He believed that \\"eternal life was reserved only for God and his children\\". In 1960, Branham claimed the Holy Spirit had revealed this doctrine to him as one of the end- time mysteries. Promoting annihilationism led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups that had rejected Parham's teaching on the subject. Godhead Like other doctrines, the Godhead formula was a point of doctrinal conflict within Pentecostalism. As Branham began offering his own viewpoint, it led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups adhering to Trinitarianism. Branham shifted his theological position on the Godhead during his ministry. Early in his ministry, Branham espoused a position closer to an orthodox Trinitarian view. By the early 1950s, he began to privately preach the Oneness doctrine outside of his healing campaigns. By the 1960s, he had changed to openly teaching the Oneness position, according to which there is one God who manifests himself in multiple ways; in contrast with the Trinitarian view that three distinct persons comprise the Godhead. Branham came to believe that trinitarianism was tritheism and insisted members of his congregation be re- baptized in Jesus's name in imitation of Paul the Apostle. Branham believed his doctrine had a nuanced difference from the Oneness doctrine and to the end of his ministry he openly argued that he was not a proponent of Oneness doctrine. He distinguished his baptismal formula from the Oneness baptism formula in the name of Jesus by teaching that the baptismal formula should be in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. He argued that there were many people named Jesus but there is only one Lord Jesus Christ. By the end of his ministry, his message required an acceptance of the oneness of the Godhead and baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Predestination Branham adopted and taught a Calvinistic form of the doctrine of predestination and openly supported Calvin's doctrine of Eternal Security, both of which were at odds with the Arminian view of predestination held by Pentecostalism. Unlike his views on the Godhead and Annihilationism, there was no precedent within Pentecostalism for his views on predestination, and opened him to widespread criticism. Branham lamented that more so than any other teaching, Pentecostals criticized him for his predestination teachings. Branham believed the term \\"predestination\\" was widely misunderstood and preferred to use the word \\"foreknowledge\\" to describe his views. Opposition to modern culture As Branham's ministry progressed, he increasingly condemned modern culture. According to Weaver, Branham's views on modern culture were the primary reason the growing Charismatic movement rejected him; his views also prevented him from following his contemporaries who were transitioning from the healing revival to the new movement. He taught that immoral women and education were the central sins of modern culture and were a result of the serpent's seed. Branham viewed education as \\"Satan's snare for intellectual Christians who rejected the supernatural\\" and \\"Satan's tool for obscuring the 'simplicity of the Message and the messenger'\\". Weaver wrote that Branham held a \\"Christ against Culture\\" opinion, according to which loyalty to Christ requires rejection of non-Christian culture; an opinion not unique to Branham. Pentecostalism inherited the Wesleyan doctrine of entire sanctification and outward holiness from its founders, who came from Wesleyan-influenced denominations of the post-American Civil War era. The rigid moral code associated with the holiness movement had been widely accepted by Pentecostals in the early twentieth century. Branham's strict moral code echoed the traditions of early Pentecostalism but became increasingly unpopular because he refused to accommodate mid-century Pentecostalism's shifting viewpoint. He denounced cigarettes, alcohol, television, rock and roll, and many forms of worldly amusement. Branham strongly identified with the lower-class roots of Pentecostalism and advocated an ascetic lifestyle. When he was given a new Cadillac, he kept it parked in his garage for two years out of embarrassment. Branham openly chastised other evangelists, who seemed to be growing wealthy from their ministries and opposed the prosperity messages being taught. Branham did not view financial prosperity as an automatic result of salvation. He rejected the prosperity gospel that originated in the teachings of Oral Roberts and A. A. Allen. Branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings, elaborate choir robes, and large salaries for ministers, and insisted the church should focus on the imminent return of Christ. Branham's opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of the \\"immorality of modern women\\". He taught that women with short hair were breaking God's commandments and according to Weaver, \\"ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup\\". Branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust, and viewed a woman's place as \\"in the kitchen\\". Citing the creation story in which Eve is taken from Adam's side, Branham taught that woman was a byproduct of man. According to Weaver, \\"his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory\\" and he regularly offered glowing praise of women. Weaver stated that Branham \\"once told women who wore shorts not to call themselves Christians\\" but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to the holiness moral code was not a requirement for salvation. Branham did not condemn women who refused the holiness moral code to Hell, but he insisted they would not be part of the rapture. Weaver wrote that Branham's attitude to women concerning physical appearance, sexual drive, and marital relations was misogynistic, and that Branham saw modern women as \\"essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery, divorce and death. They were the tools of the Devil.\\" Some of Branham's contemporaries accused him of being a \\"woman hater\\", but he insisted he only hated immorality. According to Edward Babinski, women who follow the holiness moral code Branham supported regard it as \\"a badge of honor\\". Serpent's seed Branham taught an unorthodox doctrine of the source of original sin. He believed the story of the fall of man in the Garden of Eden is allegorical and interpreted it to mean the serpent had sexual intercourse with Eve and that their offspring was Cain. Branham taught that Cain's modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists, and that Cain's descendants were \\"a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children\\" who comprised the majority of society's criminals. He believed the serpent was the missing link between the chimpanzee and man, and speculated that the serpent was possibly a human-like giant. Branham held the belief that the serpent was transformed into a reptile after it was cursed by God. Weaver commented on Branham's interpretation of the story; \\"Consequently every woman potentially carried the literal seed of the devil\\". Branham first spoke about original sin in 1958; he rejected the orthodox view of the subject and hinted at his own belief in a hidden meaning to the story. In later years, he made his opinion concerning the sexual nature of the fall explicitly known. Weaver wrote that Branham may have become acquainted with serpent's seed doctrine through his Baptist roots; Daniel Parker, an American Baptist minister from Kentucky, promulgated a similar doctrine in the mid-1800s. According to Pearry Green, Branham's teaching on the serpent's seed doctrine was viewed by the broader Pentecostal movement as the \\"filthy doctrine ... that ruined his ministry\\". No other mainstream Christian group held a similar view; Branham was widely criticized for spreading the doctrine. His followers view the doctrine as one of his greatest revelations. Eschatology In 1960, Branham preached a series of sermons on the seven church ages based on chapters two and three of the Book of Revelation. The sermons closely aligned with the teachings of C. I. Scofield and Clarence Larkin, the leading proponents of dispensationalism in the preceding generation. Like Larkin and Scofield, Branham said each church represents a historical age, and taught that the angel of each age was a significant church figure. The message included the description of a messenger to the Laodicean Church age, which Branham believed would immediately precede the rapture. Branham explained the Laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to Sodom and Gomorrah, and it would be a time in which Christian denominations rejected Christ. As described by Branham, the characteristics of the Laodicean age resemble those of the modern era. Branham described the characteristics of the Laodicean messenger by comparing his traits to Elijah and John the Baptist. He asserted the messenger would be a mighty prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be a lover of the wilderness, that he would hate wicked women, and be an uneducated person. Branham claimed the messenger to this last age would come in the spirit of Elijah the prophet and cited the Book of Malachi 4:5‚Äì6 (3:23‚Äì24 in Hebrew) as the basis for claiming the Elijah spirit would return. His belief in a \\"seventh church age messenger\\" came from his interpretation of the Book of Revelation 3:14‚Äì22. Branham preached another sermon in 1963, further indicating he was a prophet who had the anointing of Elijah and was a messenger heralding the second coming of Christ. Branham did not directly claim to be the end-time messenger in either of his sermons. Weaver believed Branham desired to be the eschatological prophet he was preaching about, but had self-doubt. Branham left the identity of the messenger open to the interpretation of his followers, who widely accepted that he was that messenger. Branham regarded his 1963 series of sermons on the Seven Seals as a highlight of his ministry. According to Weaver, they were primarily \\"a restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages\\". The sermons focused on the Book of Revelation 6:1‚Äì17, and provided an interpretation of the meaning of each of the seals. Branham claimed the sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation. Anti- denominationalism Branham believed denominationalism was \\"a mark of the beast\\", which added to the controversy surrounding his later ministry. Branham was not opposed to organizational structures; his concern focused on the \\"road block to salvation and spiritual unity\\" he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations. Branham's doctrine was similar to the anti-Catholic rhetoric of classical Pentecostalism and Protestantism, which commonly associated the mark of the beast with Catholicism. Branham, though, uniquely associated the image of the beast with Protestant denominations. In his later years, he came to believe all denominations were \\"synagogues of Satan\\". A key teaching of Branham's message was a command to true Christians to \\"come out\\" of the denominations and accept the message of the Laodicean messenger, who had the \\"message of the hour\\". He argued that continued allegiance to a denomination was an acceptance of the mark of the beast, which would mean missing the rapture. Prophecies Branham issued a series of prophecies during his ministry. He claimed to have had a prophetic revelation in June 1933 that predicted seven major events would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. His followers believe he predicted several events, including the 1937 Ohio River Flood. In 1964, Branham said judgement would strike the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles would sink into the ocean; his most dramatic prediction. Following both the 1933 and 1964 prophecies, Branham predicted the rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters, the unification of denominational Christianity, and the rise-to-power of the Roman Catholic Pope. Peter Duyzer, among other of Branham's critics, wrote that either none of Branham's prophecies came true or that they were all made after the fact. Weaver wrote that Branham tended to embellish his predictions over time. Branham's followers believe his prophecies came true, or will do so in the future. Restorationism Of all of Branham's doctrines, his teachings on Christian restorationism have had the most lasting impact on modern Christianity. Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty described his teachings on the subject as \\"extremely significant\\" because they have \\"impacted every major restoration movement since\\". As a result, Moriarty concluded Branham has \\"profoundly influenced\\" the modern Charismatic movement. Branham taught the doctrine widely from the early days of the healing revival, in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like the primitive church of early Christianity. The teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of the evangelists of the healing revival, and they took it with them into the subsequent Charismatic and evangelical movements. Paul Cain, Bill Hamon, Kenneth Hagin, and other restoration prophets cite Branham as a major influence; they played a critical role in introducing Branham's restoration views to the Apostolic-Prophetic Movement, the Association of Vineyard Churches, and other large Charismatic organizations. The Toronto Blessing, the Brownsville Revival, and other nationwide revivals of the late 20th century have their roots in Branham's restorationist teachings. The teaching holds that Christianity should return to a form mirroring the primitive Christian church. It supports the restoration of apostles and prophets, signs and wonders, spiritual gifts, spiritual warfare, and the elimination of non-primitive features of modern Christianity. Branham taught that by the end of the first century of Christianity, the church \\"had been contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit\\". As a result, he believed that from a very early date, the church had stopped following the \\"pure Word of God\\" and had been seduced into a false form of Christianity. He stated the corruption came from the desire of early Christianity's clergy to obtain political power, and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds. This led to denominationalism, which he viewed as the greatest threat to true Christianity. Branham viewed Martin Luther as the initiator of a process that would result in the restoration of the true form of Christianity, and traced the advancement of the process through other historic church figures. He believed the rapture would occur at the culmination of this process. Although Branham referred in his sermons to the culmination of the process as a future event affecting other people, he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs. Death On December 18, 1965, Branham and his family‚Äîexcept his daughter Rebekah‚Äîwere returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana, from Tucson for the Christmas holiday. About east of Friona, Texas, and about southwest of Amarillo on US Highway 60, just after dark, a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in the eastbound lane collided head-on with Branham's car. He was rushed to the hospital in Amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1965. Branham's death stunned the Pentecostal world and shocked his followers. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed until April 11, 1966; Easter Monday. Most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged Branham's controversial teachings, focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalled his wide popularity and impact during the years of the healing revival. Gordon Lindsay's eulogy stated that Branham's death was the will of God and privately he accepted the interpretation of Kenneth E. Hagin, who claimed to have prophesied Branham's death two years before it happened. According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing him because of his disobedience. In the confusion immediately following Branham's death, expectations that he would rise from the dead developed among his followers. Most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings. Weaver attributed the belief in Branham's imminent resurrection to Pearry Green, though Green denied it. Even Branham's son Billy Paul seemed to expect his father's resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to Branham's followers, in which he communicated his expectation for Easter 1966. The expectation of his resurrection remained strong into the 1970s, in part based on Branham's prediction that the rapture could occur by 1977. After 1977, some of his followers abandoned his teachings. Legacy and influence Branham was the \\"initiator of the post-World War II healing revival\\" and, along with Oral Roberts, was one of its most revered leaders. Branham is most remembered for his use of the \\"sign-gifts\\" that awed the Pentecostal world. According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, \\"the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement.\\" The many revivalists who attempted to emulate Branham during the 1950s spawned a generation of prominent Charismatic ministries. Branham has been called the \\"principal architect of restorationist thought\\" of the Charismatic movement that emerged out of the healing revival. The Charismatic view that the Christian church should return to a form like that of the early church has its roots in Branham's teachings during the healing revival period. The belief is widely held in the modern Charismatic movement, and the legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and the Charismatic movement. The more controversial doctrines Branham espoused in the closing years of his ministry were rejected by the Charismatic movement, which viewed them as \\"revelatory madness\\". Charismatics are apologetic towards Branham's early ministry and embrace his use of the \\"sign-gifts\\". Charismatic author John Crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by \\"the small sliver of his later life\\", but by the fact that he indirectly \\"lit a fire\\" that began the modern Charismatic movement. Non- Charismatic Christianity completely rejected Branham. Crowder said Branham was a victim of \\"the adoration of man\\" because his followers began to idolize him in the later part of his ministry. Harrell took a similar view, attributing Branham's teachings in his later career to his close friends, who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training. Weaver also attributed Branham's eschatological teachings to the influence of a small group of his closest followers, who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry. According to Weaver, to Branham's dismay, his followers had placed him at the \\"center of a Pentecostal personality cult\\" in the final years of his ministry. Edward Babinski describes Branham's followers as \\"odd in their beliefs, but for the most part honest hard-working citizens\\", and wrote that calling them a cult \\"seems unfair\\". While rejecting Branham's teachings, Duyzer offered a glowing review of Branham's followers, stating he \\"had never experienced friendship, or love like we did there\\". Though Branham is no longer widely known outside Pentecostalism, his legacy continues today. Summarizing the contrasting views held of Branham, Kydd stated, \\"Some thought he was God. Some thought he was a dupe of the devil. Some thought he was an end-time messenger sent from God, and some still do.\\" Followers of Branham's teachings can be found around the world; Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his campaign meetings. In 1986, there were an estimated 300,000 followers. In 2000, the William Branham Evangelical Association had missions on every inhabited continent‚Äîwith 1,600 associated churches in Latin America and growing missions across Africa. In 2018, Voice of God Recordings claimed to serve Branham-related support material to about two million people through the William Branham Evangelical Association.

In dressage, riders execute a caracole as a single half turn, either to the left or to the right, representative of the massed cavalry tactic of caracole previously used in the military. Military use Variations of the military caracole has a long history of usage by various cavalry forces that used missile weapons throughout history. The Scythians and Parthians were thought to use it, while ancient Iberian cavalry famously developed their own variation known as the 'Cantabrian circle'. It was noted in the 13th century to be used by the Mongols of Genghis Khan and also by the Han Chinese military much earlier. It was later adapted by European militaries in the mid-16th century in an attempt to integrate gunpowder weapons into cavalry tactics. Equipped with one or more wheellock pistols or similar firearms, cavalrymen would advance on their target at less than a gallop in formation as deep as 12 ranks. As each rank came into range, the soldiers would turn their mount slightly to one side, discharge one pistol, then turn slightly to the other side to discharge another pistol at their target. The horsemen then retired to the back of the formation to reload, and then repeat the manoeuvre. The whole caracole formation might move slowly forward as each rank fired to help press the attack, or move slowly backward to avoid an enemy's advance. Despite this complex manoeuvring, the formation was kept dense rather than open, as the cavalrymen were generally also armed and armoured for melee, and hoped to follow the caracole with a charge. The tactic was accompanied by the increasing popularity of the German Reiter in Western armies from about 1540. The effectiveness of the caracole is debated. This tactic was often successfully implemented, for instance, at the battle of Pinkie Cleugh, where the mounted Spanish herguletier under Dom Pedro de Gamboa successfully harassed Scottish pike columns. Likewise, at the battle of Dreux mercenary German reiters in the Huguenot employ inflicted huge casualties on the Royal Swiss pike squares, although they failed to break them. Some historians after Michael Roberts associate the demise of the caracole with the name of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden (1594‚Äì1632). Certainly he regarded the technique as fairly useless, and ordered cavalry under Swedish command not to use the caracole; instead, he required them to charge aggressively like their Polish-Lithuanian opponents. However, there is plenty of evidence that the caracole was falling out of use by the 1580s at the latest. Henry IV's Huguenot cavalry and Dutch cuirassiers were good examples of cavalry units that abandoned the caracole early on ‚Äî if they ever used it at all. According to De la Noue, Henry IV's pistol-armed cavalrymen were instructed to deliver a volley at close quarters and then \\"charge home\\" (charge into the enemy). Ranks were reduced from 12 to 6, still enough to punch a hole into the classic thin line in which heavy lancers were deployed. That was the tactic usually employed by cavalry since then, and the name reiter was replaced by cuirassier. Sometimes it has been erroneously identified as caracole when low morale cavalry units, instead of charging home, contented themselves with delivering a volley and retire without closing the enemy, but in all those actions the distinctive factor of the caracole, the rolling fire through countermarching, was absent. The caracole was rarely tried against enemy cavalry, as it could be easily broken when performing the maneuver by a countercharge. The last recorded example of the use of the caracole against enemy cavalry ended in disaster at the battle of Klushino in 1610, when the Polish hussars smashed a unit of Russian reiters, which served as the catalyst for the rout of much of the Russian army. The battle of Mookerheyde (1574) was also another example of the futility in using caracole against aggressive enemy cavalry, as 400 Spanish lancers charged 2,000 German reiters (in Dutch employ) while the second line was reloading their pistols, easily routing the whole force and later the whole Dutch army as well. It is significant that 20 years later, the Dutch cuirassiers easily routed the same Spanish lancers at the battle of Turnhout and the battle of Nieuwpoort, so that according to Charles Oman, in 1603 lancers were finally disbanded from the Spanish army. Nevertheless, variations of caracole tactics continued to be used well into the 17th century against enemy cavalry. During the battle of Gniew of 1626, the Polish light cavalry used it with success twice. The first time light cavalry units under Miko≈Çaj Abramowicz fired at the Swedish cavalry rank by rank, but instead of withdrawing to reload, it immediately proceeded to charge the enemy with sabres. Later the same unit also tried the caracole using gaps in the line of charging husaria heavy cavalry. It is worth noting that 16th- and 17th-century sources do not seem to have used the term \\"caracole\\" in its modern sense. John Cruso, for example, explained the \\"caracoll\\" as a maneuver whereby a formation of cuirassiers received an enemy's charge by wheeling apart to either side, letting the enemy rush in between the pincers of their trap, and then charging inwards against the flanks of the overextended enemy.

He is vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett; Buffett has described Munger as his partner. Munger served as chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation from 1984 through 2011. He is also chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation, based in Los Angeles, California, and a director of Costco Wholesale Corporation. Early life and education Munger was born in Omaha, Nebraska. As a teenager, he worked at Buffett & Son, a grocery store owned by Warren Buffett's grandfather. His father, Alfred Case Munger, was a lawyer. His grandfather was Thomas Charles Munger, a district court judge and state representative. He enrolled in the University of Michigan, where he studied mathematics. During his time in college, he joined the fraternity, Sigma Phi Society. In early 1943, a few days after his 19th birthday, he dropped out of college to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps, where he became Second Lieutenant. After receiving a high score on the Army General Classification Test, he was ordered to study meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, California,Lemann, p. 189. the town he was to make his home. Through the GI Bill Munger took a number of advanced courses through several universities. When he applied to his father's alma mater, Harvard Law School, the dean of admissions rejected him because Munger had not completed an undergraduate degree. However, the dean relented after a call from Roscoe Pound, the former dean of Harvard Law and a Munger family friend. Munger excelled in law school,Lemann, p. 191. graduating magna cum laude with a J.D. in 1948. At Harvard, he was a member of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau. In college and the Army, he developed \\"an important skill\\": card playing. ‚ÄúWhat you have to learn is to fold early when the odds are against you, or if you have a big edge, back it heavily because you don't get a big edge often. Opportunity comes, but it doesn't come often, so seize it when it does come.‚Äù Investment career He moved with his family to California, where he joined the law firm Wright & Garrett (later Musick, Peeler & Garrett). In 1962 he founded and worked as a real estate attorney at Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP. He then gave up the practice of law to concentrate on managing investments and later partnered with Otis Booth in real estate development. He then partnered with Jack Wheeler to form Wheeler, Munger, and Company, an investment firm with a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. He wound up Wheeler, Munger, and Co. in 1976, after losses of 32% in 1973 and 31% in 1974. Although Munger is better known for his association with Buffett, he ran an investment partnership of his own from 1962 to 1975. According to Buffett's essay, \\"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\\", published in 1984, Munger's investment partnership generated compound annual returns of 19.8% during the 1962‚Äì75 period compared to a 5.0% annual appreciation rate for the Dow. Munger was previously the chairman of Wesco Financial Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway. It began as a savings and loan association, but eventually grew to control Precision Steel Corp., CORT Furniture Leasing, Kansas Bankers Surety Company, and other ventures. Wesco Financial also held a concentrated equity portfolio of over US$1.5 billion in companies such as Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods, US Bancorp, and Goldman Sachs. Munger believes that holding a concentrated number of stocks, that he knows extremely well, will in the long term produce superior returns. Wesco is based in Pasadena, California, Munger's adopted hometown. Pasadena was also the site of the company's annual shareholders' meeting, which were typically held on the Wednesday or Thursday after the more famous Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting. Munger's meetings were nearly as legendary in the investment community as those he co-hosts with Buffett in Omaha. Such meetings were often perfunctory, but Munger interacted with the other Wesco shareholders at considerable length, sometimes speculating about what Benjamin Franklin would do in a given situation. Meeting notes have been posted on the Futile Finance? website, but no updates exist beyond 2011. Munger is also the chairman of the Daily Journal Corporation. Since Wesco meetings ended, the Daily Journal annual meeting has grown in importance, as investors flock to the meeting to listen to him speak at length. Investment philosophy =\\"Elementary, worldly wisdom\\"= In multiple speeches, and in the book Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger's worldly wisdom consists of a set of mental models framed as a latticework to help solve critical business problems. Munger, along with Buffett, is one of the main inspirations behind the book Seeking Wisdom: From Darwin to Munger. Author Peter Bevelin explained his key learnings from both Munger and Buffett in a 2007 interview: \\"How to think about businesses and investing, how to behave in life, the importance of ethics and honesty, how to approach problems but foremost how to reduce the chance of meeting problems.\\" Bevelin stated that previously, he \\"was lacking the Munger ability to un-learn my own best-loved ideas\\". Munger states that high ethical standards are integral to his philosophy; at the 2009 Wesco Financial Corporation annual meeting he said, \\"Good businesses are ethical businesses. A business model that relies on trickery is doomed to fail.\\"Charlie Munger's got a billion words of wisdom, May 17, 2009, Los Angeles Times, Accessed January 3, 2010 During an interview and Q&A; session at Harvard-Westlake School on January 19, 2010, Munger referred to American philosopher Charles Frankel in his discussion on the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 and the philosophy of responsibility. Munger explained that Frankel believed: :...the system is responsible in proportion to the degree that the people who make the decisions bear the consequences. So to Charlie Frankel, you don‚Äôt create a loan system where all the people who make the loans promptly dump them on somebody else through lies and twaddle, and they don‚Äôt bear the responsibility when the loans are good or bad. To Frankel, that is amoral, that is an irresponsible system. =Lollapalooza effect= Munger uses the term \\"Lollapalooza effect\\" for multiple biases, tendencies or mental models acting in compound with each other at the same time in the same direction. With the Lollapalooza effect, itself a mental model, the result is often extreme, due to the confluence of the mental models, biases or tendencies acting together, greatly increasing the likelihood of acting irrationally.Munger, C. T. (2005). The psychology of human misjudgment. Poor Charlie‚Äôs Almanack. During a talk at Harvard in 1995 entitled The Psychology of Human Misjudgment, Munger mentions Tupperware parties and open outcry auctions, where he explained \\"three, four, five of these things work together and it turns human brains into mush,\\" meaning that normal people will be highly likely to succumb to the multiple irrational tendencies acting in the same direction. In the Tupperware party, you have reciprocation, consistency and commitment tendency, and social proof. (The hostess gave the party and the tendency is to reciprocate; you say you like certain products during the party so purchasing would be consistent with views you've committed to; other people are buying, which is the social proof.) In the open outcry auction, there is social proof of others bidding, reciprocation tendency, commitment to buying the item, and deprivation super-reaction syndrome, i.e. sense of loss. The latter is an individual's sense of loss of what he or she believes should be (or is) his or hers. These biases often occur at either conscious or subconscious level, and in both microeconomic and macroeconomic scale. =Principle of Inversion= Munger is famous for his quote All I want to know is where I‚Äôm going to die, so I‚Äôll never go there. This thinking was inspired by the German mathematician Carl Jacobi who often solved difficult problems by following a simple strategy:man muss immer umkehren (or loosely translated, \\"invert, always invert.\\") \\"[Jacobi] knew that it is in the nature of things that many hard problems are best solved when they are addressed backward,\\" Munger counsels. \\"Indeed, many problems can‚Äôt be solved forward.\\" Wealth and philanthropy As of March 2019, Munger has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion according to Forbes Magazine.Munger Graduate Residence at Stanford University Munger is a major benefactor of the University of Michigan. In 2007, Munger made a $3 million gift to the University of Michigan Law School for lighting improvements in Hutchins Hall and the William W. Cook Legal Research Building, including the noted Reading Room. In 2011, Munger made another gift to the Law School, contributing $20 million for renovations to the Lawyers Club housing complex, which will cover the majority of the $39 million cost.

In 2006, Munger donated 100 shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock, then valued at $9.2 million, to the school toward a building campaign at Harvard- Westlake's middle school campus. The Mungers had previously made a gift to build the $13 million Munger Science Center at the high school campus, a two- story classroom and laboratory building which opened in 1995 and has been described as \\"a science teacher's dream\\".Steve Jordon, \\"Munger Gives 100 Shares of Berkshire to Prep School\\" (June 22, 2006).

Los Angeles Times. The design of the Science Center was substantially influenced by Munger. In October 2014, Munger announced that he would donate $65 million to the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This is the largest gift in the history of the school. The donation went towards the construction of a residence building designed by Munger for visitors of the Kavli Institute in an effort to bring together physicists to exchange ideas as Munger stated,\\"to talk to one another, create new stuff, cross-fertilize ideas\\". In March 2016, Munger announced a further $200 million gift to UC Santa Barbara for state of the art student housing, tripling the record gift he gave for the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics. Personal life In 1945, while studying at Caltech, Munger married Nancy Huggins, daughter of Frederick R. Huggins and Edith M. Huggins. She was a Pasadena native who had been Munger's sister's roommate at Scripps College.Lemann, p. 190. They had three children, Wendy Munger (a former corporate lawyer, trustee of Stanford University, and trustee of The Huntington Library), Molly Munger (a civil rights attorney and funder of a ballot initiative to raise California taxes for public education) and Teddy Munger (deceased, leukemia, age 9). After Munger's divorce, he remarried within a couple of years.Lemann, p. 192. From this second marriage, to Nancy Barry, daughter of David Noble Barry Jr. and Emilie Hevener Barry, he has four children‚Äîphysicist and Republican activist Charles T. Munger Jr., Emilie Munger Ogden, Barry A. Munger and Philip R. Munger‚Äîand two stepchildren: William Harold Borthwick and David Borthwick. On July 22, 2002, Munger's first wife Nancy Huggins Freeman died from cancer. She was 76 years old. On February 6, 2010, Munger's wife Nancy Barry Munger died at home. She was 86 years old. Munger enjoys architecture and has designed multiple buildings, including dormitories at Stanford University and the University of Michigan as well as the house he currently inhabits. Munger is critical of cryptocurrencies, referring to Bitcoin as \\"poison\\". Munger is a Republican and has provided his opinions on a number of political topics including the policies of the Trump administration. Munger states he is \\"not a normal Republican\\" for example advocating \\"I would go to some..Medicare for all\\" as a fix to the U.S. healthcare system, \\"I think we should have single-payer medicine eventually\\"Charlie Munger: We Should Have Single-Payer Medicine  Squawk Box  CNBC Munger repeated the sentiments in another interview, praising Singapore's single payer system in contrast to the U.S. \\"insane\\" system which is a \\"national disgrace\\"Charlie Munger on health care: 'We should have a single payer system' In his 50s, after a failed eye cataract surgery that rendered his left eye blind, Munger had his left eye removed due to severe pain. When doctors told him that he had developed a condition that may cause his remaining eye to fill up with blood and become blind too, Munger started taking braille lessons. The eye condition has since receded meaning he still has sight in his right eye.  References   Additional sources  * * Lowe, Janet (2000) Damn Right!

He was a successful lawyer in Georgia and Alabama, where he served in the state legislatures. Appointed by Franklin Pierce to the United States Supreme Court in 1853, he served until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he became an official of the Confederate States of America. After serving six months in a military prison, he resumed a successful law practice in New Orleans, where he opposed Reconstruction.  Early life  Campbell was born near Washington, Georgia, to Col. Duncan Greene Campbell (for whom the now- defunct Campbell County, Georgia, was named). Considered a child prodigy, he graduated from the University of Georgia in 1825 at the age of 14, and immediately enrolled at the United States Military Academy for three years and would have graduated in 1830, but withdrew upon the death of his father (July 1828) and returned home to Georgia. He read law with his uncle, former Georgia governor John Clark, and was admitted to the bar in 1829, at the age of 18 which required a special act of the Georgia legislature.  Eggnog Riot  While at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, on December 24‚Äì25, 1826, Campbell was involved in the Eggnog Riot also known as the \\"Grog Mutiny.\\" Proceedings began on December 26, 1826, courts-martial was complete on March 16, 1827, and ended on May 3, 1827, with the President adjusting some of the verdicts and approving of the rest. Campbell was among 70 cadets that were involved but a review concluded that only 20 cadets and one enlisted soldier be charged. Many notable cadets such as Jefferson Davis (involved but not charged), and Robert E. Lee (not involved but testified), were involved in the incident. Nine expulsions were approved by President John Quincy Adams. There was a call for Campbell to be expelled, along with James W. M. \\"Weems\\" Berrien (remittance allowed) but this was rejected so Campbell escaped court martial.Eggnog Riot - Retrieved February 27, 2011  Alabama  In 1830, Campbell moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where he met and married Anna Esther Goldthwaite and earned a reputation as a talented lawyer specializing in Spanish land grant titles. Hailed as a war hero for his involvement in the Creek Indian War of 1836, Campbell was elected state representative for that same year's term, firmly establishing himself as a Jacksonian Democrat in the state legislature. That meant that Campbell aligned with Jackson on national policies, supporting the bank veto and condemning nullification, but he remained a moderate proponent of states' rights. After his only term in office, Campbell and his young family (which eventually expanded to include five daughters and one son) relocated to Mobile, Alabama, and Campbell later served a second term as state representative in 1842. Fortunately for Campbell's law career, though, Mobile was a bustling port city that constantly generated commercial lawsuits and Spanish grant disputes. In one such grant case, Mayor of Mobile v. Eslava (1849), Campbell revealed his states-rightist attitude and first articulated his doctrine of \\"original sovereignty\\" before the state supreme court. Briefly, Campbell argued that because each of the original 13 states had retained sovereignty over the navigable waters within its borders, and the Constitution makes all new states enter the Union on equal terms with existing states, new states like Alabama thus also retain sovereignty over their navigable waters. The Supreme Court upheld original sovereignty in an 1845 decision and Campbell would later refer to it in his Dred Scott concurrence. Thereafter, Campbell's star continued to rise as one of the most sought-after attorneys in Alabama, and in 1852, he even acted as an attorney for Myra Clark Gaines against Richard Relf before the Supreme Court. In most cases, Campbell represented debtors against banks, demonstrating a Jacksonian Democratic tendency to advocate for state control of corporate development and champion the individual's economic freedom. Twice, he turned down offers to sit on the Alabama Supreme Court, and on several occasions, he argued cases before the US Supreme Court. During this successful early period as a lawyer, his political involvement also increased. From 1847 to 1851, for example, Campbell joined the national debate on slavery with the publication of four essays in the Southern Quarterly Review in which he called for improved conditions for slaves and gradual emancipation. Here, his theories and practices diverged: Campbell owned up to 14 slaves throughout his life, but he freed several before his Supreme Court appointment. Moreover, Campbell attended the Nashville Convention in 1850, where he helped compose a series of resolutions in reaction to the proposed Compromise of 1850. Although he drafted several of the final 13 resolutions in a conciliatory tone and never called for southern resistance, Campbell advocated the rights of slaveholders, condemned the free soil philosophy, and asserted the sole right of the states to regulate slavery within their borders. Portrait of John A. Campbell, circa 1870s  Supreme Court  = Appointment = In 1852 the death of Justice John McKinley created a vacancy on the Supreme Court. President Millard Fillmore, a Whig, made four nominations to fill the vacancy, all of whom withdrew, declined to serve, or were not acted on by the Democratic-controlled Senate. After the election of Franklin Pierce, a Democrat, a group of sitting Supreme Court justices approached Pierce to recommend Campbell as a nominee; that is one of the few known times that sitting justices have made recommendations for new nominations. Pierce, who was hoping to stave off an insurrection by appeasing the South, agreed to nominate the Alabamian Campbell. The nomination was made on March 21, 1853, and even though Campbell was only 41 and had no previous judicial experience, the Senate unanimously approved the appointment within three days, indicating Northerners, who hoped that Campbell's moderate tendencies would help overpower the growing sectionalism.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997), 110-111. = Constitutional contributions = Under the direction of Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, the Supreme Court weighed in on a number of important economic cases. In the 1837 case of Charles River Bridge v. Warren Bridge, for instance, Taney wrote the majority opinion, arguing for strict construction of corporate charters and effectively restraining the implications of the Marshall Court's 1819 ruling in Dartmouth College v. Woodward, which had recognized corporate charters as contracts under constitutional protection. Thereafter, the slight majority of Jacksonian Democrats on the bench became uneasy supporters of corporate privilege, bound to respect rights that were expressly granted in corporate charters and effectively limiting state control over intrastate internal improvements.Austin Allen, Origins of the Dred Scott Case: Jacksonian Jurisprudence and the Supreme Court, 1837-1857 (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2006). Moreover, in 1844, the Taney Court had expanded upon the Marshall Court's 1809 decision in Bank of the United States v. Deveaux and upheld in Louisville v. Letson (1844) that regardless of where its shareholders resided, a corporation could claim citizenship in the state of its incorporation and thereby bring suit to the federal court under diversity jurisdiction. Although the Taney Court quickly reversed the precedent in Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Transportation & Railroad Company (1854) and ruled that corporations, in fact, derive their citizenship from their shareholders and not from the states themselves, diversity jurisdiction still applied to corporations.William Gillette, \\"John A. Campbell,\\" in The Justices of the United States Supreme Court, 1789-1969: Their Lives and Major Opinions, Vol. II, ed. Leon Friedman and Fred. L. Israel (New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1969). Campbell refused to accept the Taney Court's recent precedents on these corporate issues. His opinion in Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company marked his first major dissent, in which he clearly argued, \\"a corporation is not a citizen. It may be an artificial person, a moral person, a judicial person, a legal entity, a faculty, an intangible, invisible being,\\" but, he continued, quoting John Marshall, \\"it certainly is not a citizen.\\"Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 57 U.S. 314, 351 (1854). Contesting corporate citizenship as the basis for diversity jurisdiction, Campbell further argued that corporations were not \\"within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when they delegated jurisdiction over controversies between the citizens of different states.\\"Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 57 U.S. 314, 351 (1854). The Privileges and Immunities Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 1), in other words, should not extend citizenship to corporations. Arguably, Campbell's argument here, as well as in the dissenting opinions of fellow southern Justices John Catron and Peter V. Daniel, implicitly defended slavery. After all, if states could confer federal citizenship on corporations, then free blacks might also claim federal citizenship under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.Austin Allen, Origins of the Dred Scott Case: Jacksonian Jurisprudence and the Supreme Court, 1837-1857 (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2006). Later in his dissent, Campbell the Jacksonian Democrat also argued that the Court had encroached upon state powers by overextending federal jurisdiction in this case and that corporations themselves threaten states' internal powers.Christine Jordan, \\"Justice John Campbell: Last of the Jacksonians,\\" Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook (1980): 78-88. Explicitly, Campbell wrote, \\"their [corporate] revenues and establishments mock at the frugal and stinted conditions of state administration; their pretensions and demands are sovereign, admitting impatiently interference by state legislative authority.\\"Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, 57 U.S. 314, 353 (1854). If left unchecked by state legislatures and even protected by the national government, corporations threatened states' rights. In his first important case, then, Campbell took a hard stance against corporate privilege, defended states' rights, and arguably protected slavery. In later cases, Campbell continued to fight corporate privilege by challenging Contract Clause protection of corporate charters. The following year, in fact, the Court heard Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop (1854), a case which raised the question of whether a state legislature could change its taxation policy on corporations. Specifically, the Ohio General Banking Act of 1845 had provided that instead of paying taxes, each incorporated branch of the state bank would semiannually send six percent of its profits to the state. A subsequent 1851 law established a new taxing policy on banks. Ultimately, the Court ruled that the 1851 law had violated the Contract Clause because the 1845 law had constituted a contract between the state and a corporation of private shareholders.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997), 118. Campbell, again part of the southern faction with Justices Catron and Daniel, emphatically dissented. Early in this dissent, Campbell distinguished \\"between the statutes which create hopes, expectations, faculties, conditions, and those which form contracts,\\" ultimately arguing that the 1845 statute constituted the latter.Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 57 U.S. 369, 408 (1854). Later, Campbell defended state power to legislate in the public's best interest, explaining that this power is one \\"which every department of government knows that the community is interested in retaining unimpaired and that every corporator understood its abandonment ought not to be presumed in a case in which the deliberate purpose to abandon it does not appear.\\" Piqua Branch of the State Bank of Ohio v. Knoop, 57 U.S. 369, 415 (1854). State governments, according to Campbell, should be able to change their policies in order to keep pace with ever-evolving conditions; furthermore, banks and other corporations were not exempted from tax adjustments unless explicitly stated in the statute. Campbell clearly prioritized states' rights over corporate privilege.William Gillette, \\"John A. Campbell,\\" in The Justices of the United States Supreme Court, 1789-1969: Their Lives and Major Opinions, Vol. II, ed. Leon Friedman and Fred. L. Israel (New York: Chelsea House Publishers, 1969). The Court revisited this Ohio statute in two subsequent cases in the 1850s, and both times, Campbell issued thorough dissents.Timothy Huebner, The Taney Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003). Leading up to the final case, Dodge v. Woolsey (1855), the Ohio state legislature had amended its constitution to end tax exemptions for banks before enacting a new bank tax law in 1852. When a shareholder of the bank brought suit once again, the Court's majority, led by Justice James M. Wayne, maintained that even though the people of Ohio had amended their constitution, the 1845 bank act still constituted an inviolable contract.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997), 119. In his elaborate dissent, Campbell recounted the facts of the case, denied corporate citizenship yet again, and criticized the majority for expanding judicial power. Campbell warned that if a state should grant away its funds and powers to a corporation, then \\"the most deliberate and solemn acts of the people would not serve to redress the injustice, and the overreaching speculator upon the facility or corruption of their legislature would be protected by the powers of this Court in the profits of his bargain.\\" Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. 331, 371 (1855). In other words, this decision bound the Supreme Court to protect corrupt corporations and legislatures against the warranted state constitutional amendments proposed by the people themselves. Furthermore, this collusion between the central government and corporate entities, Campbell cautioned, will \\"establish on the soil of every state a caste made up of combinations of men for the most part under the most favorable conditions in society,\\" eventually spawning \\"a new element of alienation and discord between the different classes of society and the introduction of a fresh cause of disturbance in our distracted political and social system.\\" Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. 331, 373 (1855). Not only did corporations generate class conflict and threaten state sovereignty, argued the Jacksonian Democrat, but they also infringed upon individual liberties.Christine Jordan, \\"Justice John Campbell: Last of the Jacksonians,\\" Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook (1980): 78-88. After all, corporations \\"display a love of power, a preference for corporate interests to moral or political principles or public duties, and an antagonism to individual freedom which have marked them as objects of jealousy in every epoch of their history.\\" Dodge v. Woolsey, 59 U.S. 331, 374 (1855). In short, Campbell did not consider a broad interpretation of the Contract Clause a sufficient justification for all of the potential evils of corporate entities. Instead, Campbell firmly believed that states should have direct control over corporate expansion. Five years later, Campbell successfully persuaded the majority of the Court to agree with a narrower interpretation of the Contract Clause in the 1860 case of Christ's Church Hospital v. County of Philadelphia. In 1833, the Pennsylvania legislature had granted a tax exemption to Christ's Church Hospital, but in 1851, it enacted a tax upon all associations and corporations.Christine Jordan, \\"Justice John Campbell: Last of the Jacksonians,\\" Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook (1980): 78-88. Campbell concisely rejected the hospital's claim that the 1833 tax exemption was perpetual, writing, \\"such an interpretation is not to be favored, as the power of taxation is necessary to the existence of the State, and must be exerted according to the varying conditions of the Commonwealth.\\" Christ's Church Hospital v. County of Philadelphia, 65 U.S. 300, 302 (1860). As he had been arguing since taking the bench, states need to be able to adapt to the times and therefore have the right to control corporate development within their borders. As sectional tensions escalated in the late 1850s, the Court came to hear divisive slavery cases, including the notorious Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857). Attempting to settle the issue of slavery in the territories once and for all, Chief Justice Taney's majority opinion forcefully asserted that blacks were not citizens and condemned the Missouri Compromise by declaring unconstitutional the federal regulation of slavery in the territories. Campbell issued a comprehensive concurring opinion. Although Campbell believed that the Court could not determine Scott's citizenship status and refused to discuss this issue, he aligned with Taney in most other claims and offered a narrow interpretation of the Constitution. Namely, Campbell agreed that Scott remained a slave under Missouri law and therefore could not sue in federal court. He then dedicated the greater part of his opinion to disproving the constitutionality of the Missouri Compromise, ultimately concluding that the Constitution's Territories Clause (Article IV, Section 3) did not grant Congress the power to regulate slavery in the territories.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997). To arrive at this conclusion, Campbell first asserted that Congress could not regulate slavery within existing states. After all, he wrote, \\"it is a settled doctrine of this court that the Federal government can exercise no power over the subject of slavery within the States, nor control the intermigration of slaves, other than fugitives, among the States.\\" Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 500 (1857). And although the Territories Clause may grant Congress the authority to organize a government over public domain, it did not confer Congressional power to regulate municipal institutions, such as slavery, in the territories. Relying on his doctrine of original sovereignty, Campbell argued that such a clause permitting restrictive federal legislation would violate the innate sovereignty of the people in the territories, for when the people established their own state governments, these new states entered into the Union on equal footing with older states.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997). Furthermore, if the framers had really envisioned Congressional regulation of slavery in the territories, then southern delegates at the Constitutional Convention would have vehemently protested. In his own words, \\"the claim for Congress of supreme power in the Territories, under the grant to 'dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting territory,' is not supported by the historical evidence drawn from the Revolution, the Confederation, or the deliberations which preceded the ratification of the Federal Constitution.\\" Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 512 (1857). As follows, the Territories Clause \\"confers no power upon Congress to dissolve the relations of the master and slave on the domain of the United States, either within or without any of the States.\\" Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 517 (1857). In Dred Scott, Campbell clearly challenged what he considered to be an overextension of federal authority and advocated for territorial‚Äîand, by implication, state‚Äîself-government.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997). Despite his proslavery and states' rightist concurrence in Dred Scott, Campbell upset many of his fellow southerners while presiding over the Fifth Circuit. In 1854 and 1858, he had frustrated two separate filibustering efforts to acquire Cuba and then Nicaragua, thus prioritizing national neutrality policies over southern efforts to gain more slaveholding states.Robert Saunders, John Archibald Campbell: Southern Moderate, 1811-1889 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1997).  American Civil War  In March and April 1861, prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War, Justice Campbell served as a mediator between three commissioners representing the Confederacy (Martin Crawford, Andre Roman, and John Forsyth, Jr.), and the Lincoln administration. The commissioners indicated they were interested in preventing war if possible. Since President Lincoln, denied that secession was valid, he refused any official contact with the Confederate commissioners, but Justice Campbell was permitted in their place. Mitcham, Samuel W. (2020). It Wasn‚Äôt About Slavery. Regnery Publishing. p.140. On March 15, 1861, following the impassioned Senate speech of Stephen A. Douglas calling for the withdrawal of US forces from Confederate territory in order to ease tensions and prevent war, Lincoln‚Äôs Secretary of State William H. Seward met with and assured Justice Campbell that Fort Sumter would be evacuated within ten days. Id. Again on March 20, 1861, Campbell was assured by Seward of the Lincoln Administration‚Äôs intent to withdraw from the key military outpost. Due to a distrust of Seward, Campbell brought fellow Supreme Court Justice Samuel Nelson to this second meeting to act as a witness to Seward‚Äôs promise. Id. As feared by Campbell, on April 8th Lincoln reversed course by publicly stating he intended to resupply Fort Sumter either, ‚Äúpeacefully, or otherwise by force.\\" Id. at 148. This resupply mission resulted in the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, Lincoln's proclamation of a state of rebellion and the start of the war. As a result, Campbell resigned from the Supreme Court on April 30, 1861, and returned south. He was the only southern justice to do so. Timothy Huebner, The Taney Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003). Threatened with lynching and effectively banished from Alabama for his moderate views, opposition to secession, and attempt at mediation, Campbell settled in New Orleans. A year and a half later, in October 1862, he was appointed Confederate Assistant Secretary of War by Confederate president Jefferson Davis. He held that position through the end of the war. Since Campbell served the Confederacy after his role as mediator, Lincoln‚Äôs private secretary and subsequent biographer John G. Nicolay, ascribed ill motives to Campbell in that he, ‚Äú ... came to Seward in the guise of a loyal official, though his correspondence with Jefferson Davis soon revealed a treasonable intent.\\"Nicolay, John (1903) A Short Life of Abraham Lincoln pg. 183. However, even when serving the Confederacy, Campbell still advocated for peace. \\"John A. Campbell.\\" Oyez, www.oyez.org/justices/john_a_campbell. Accessed 24 Aug. 2020. Justice Campbell was one of the three Confederate Peace Commissioners (along with Alexander H. Stephens and Robert M. T. Hunter), who met with Abraham Lincoln and William H. Seward in 1865 at the Hampton Roads Conference in an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an end to the Civil War.pp. 11-17, Campbell, John A. Reminisces and Documents Relating to the Civil War During the Year 1865, Baltimore: John Murphy & Co. 1887.  Postbellum  Judge John A. Campbell = Federal Detention = On April 14, 1865, five days after the war ended, Lincoln was assassinated. Having previously personally met with Lincoln as a member of the Confederacy, Campbell was loosely suspected in the assassination. He was arrested on May 30, 1865, and was held in federal detention at Fort Pulaski Georgia for the next five months. Campbell was never formally charged. Former colleagues and Supreme Court Justices Benjamin R. Curtis and Samuel Nelson intervened on Campbell‚Äôs behalf, and he was released in October 1865. = Legal Career = Campbell is the only known Supreme Court Justice to argue cases to the Supreme Court as a lawyer after he served on the Court. However, at the end of the war he was not able to immediately practice law. Due to laws passed by Congress, attorneys who had aided the Confederacy were prohibited from practicing law in Federal Court. In Ex parte Garland this law was held to be unconstitutional and Campbell was able to get back to work. Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1866) He was again recognized as one of the nation's most competent attorneys and became so busy that he argued only cases brought before the U.S. Supreme Court. John A. Campbell.\\" Oyez, www.oyez.org/justices/john_a_campbell. Accessed 24 Aug. 2020. The most famous case Campbell argued was the Slaughterhouse Case. In Slaughterhouse, Campbell represented a group of butchers who suffered business losses due to a Louisiana law which limited slaughterhouses to a single location in New Orleans. He argued that the federal Bill of Rights applied to states, and that states could not pass laws which denied those civil rights guaranteed in the US Constitution. Bogen, David S. (2009). Rebuilding the Slaughterhouse: The Cases‚Äô Support for Civil Rights. 42 Akron L.Rev. 1129 Slaughter House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36 (1873) However, Campbell lost the case. The Supreme Court held that the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment did not apply to states. This ruling had a profound effect on enabling Jim Crow laws to be enacted across the South. It took decades for the Supreme Court to unravel and effectively over-rule Slaughterhouse. Had the Supreme Court adopted Campbell‚Äôs argument, federal civil rights would have been extended to the states decades earlier. Id. Campbell was a member of the \\"Committee of One Hundred\\" that went to Washington to persuade President Grant to end his support of what they called the \\"Kellogg usurpation\\". Grant had sent troops to support Governor William Pitt Kellogg of Louisiana. Grant initially refused to meet them but later relented; he did not, however, change his position on the matter.The Ouachita Telegraph. \\"Death of a Great Jurist.\\" March 12, 1889: 1. = Death = Campbell died on March 12, 1889 in Baltimore, Maryland. He is interred at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.  Legacy and honors  During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Brunswick, Georgia, and named in his honor.

It was the primary reason for that platform's success in the market. It was also sometimes referred to as IMAGE/3000 in its initial release, and later versions were known as TurboIMAGE, and TurboIMAGE/XL after the PA-RISC migration. IMAGE is based on the network database model, in contrast to most modern systems which are based on the relational database model. A SQL (Structured Query Language) front-end processor was later added, offering users the ability to run SQL queries on existing databases. This produced IMAGE/SQL, the current name. Overview IMAGE consists of several utilities along with an API (referred to as \\"intrinsics\\" by the HP documentation): * DBSCHEMA - Compile a source schema layout. The source layout describes the tables (known as SETS) and columns (known as FIELDS). * DBUTIL - Creates and performs maintenance functions on the database. * QUERY - Generalized query tool for accessing any TurboIMAGE database. The following is a sample list of the API calls used for application development. These calls are supported by HP's compilers: COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, SPL, PASCAL and C. * DBFIND - Locates a record. * DBGET - Retrieves a record. * DBPUT - Adds a record. * DBUPDATE - Updates a record. * DBINFO - Provides information on the structure of the database. * DBOPEN - Opens the database with a specified password to provide access rights to the application.

Before the cell enters G1 phase, i.e. before the formation of the cilium, the mother centriole serves as a component of the centrosome. In cells that are destined to have only one primary cilium, the mother centriole differentiates into the basal body upon entry into G1 or quiescence. Thus, the basal body in such a cell is derived from the centriole. The basal body differs from the mother centriole in at least 2 aspects. First, basal bodies have basal feet, which are anchored to cytoplasmic microtubules and are necessary for polarized alignment of the cilium. Second, basal bodies have pinwheel-shaped transition fibers that originate from the appendages of mother centriole.Sehyun Kim (2013). Assembling a primary cilium. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 2013, 25:506‚Äì511 In multiciliated cells, however, in many cases basal bodies are not made from centrioles but are generated de novo from a special protein structure called the deuterosome.Deborah A. Klos Dehring (2013). Deuterosome-Mediated Centriole Biogenesis. Developmental Cell 27, 103‚Äì112  Function  During cell cycle quiescence, basal bodies organize primary cilia and reside at the cell cortex in proximity to plasma membrane. On cell cycle entry, cilia resorb and the basal body migrates to the nucleus where it functions to organize centrosomes. Centrioles, basal bodies, and cilia are important for mitosis, polarity, cell division, protein trafficking, signaling, motility, and sensation.Chad G. Pearson (2009). Basal Body Components Exhibit Differential Protein Dynamics during Nascent Basal Body Assembly. Mol Biol Cell. Feb 1; 20(3): 904‚Äì914.

He had a parallel career as a consultant anaesthetist. Biography Born in Collinstown, County Westmeath, Ireland, to Welsh parents, he went to Hereford Cathedral School and was a chorister at Christ Church, Oxford, and Hereford Cathedral. Because his parents opposed a career in music, he studied medicine in London, but had also pursued the study of music from an early age . He began his medical studies at the University of Aberystwyth in 1933, moving the next year to University College London. At the outbreak of World War II he was for a time house physician at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth, Hampstead. In 1942 he was called up and spent most of the war in India . He studied composition with Alan Rawsthorne and Patrick Hadley. His most successful early works included a setting of T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men (1939; rev. 1946), several ballets, including A Mirror for Witches, with choreography by Andr√©e Howard (1951) and Blood Wedding (1953), and an opera Yerma (1955‚Äì59, first staged 1961). While he introduced serial elements in his Piano Concerto (1948), it was only in 1955 that he began regularly using a more freely atonal and athematic serialism, which he continued to do until 1988 . He was influenced in this by Edward Clark, a conductor, former BBC music producer, student of Arnold Schoenberg and husband of Elisabeth Lutyens. Guitar works ApIvor is particularly well known to guitarists, as he made a major contribution to the repertoire of their instrument. Solo works include Variations (1958), Discanti (1970), Saeta (1972), and ten serial pieces included with his book Serial Composition for Guitarists (1982). He also wrote a Concertino for guitar (1954), Liaison for guitar and keyboard (1976), and Cinquefoil for flute, guitar, and viola (1984).

Microsomes can be concentrated and separated from other cellular debris by differential centrifugation. Unbroken cells, nuclei, and mitochondria sediment out at 10,000 g, whereas soluble enzymes and fragmented ER, which contains cytochrome P450 (CYP), remain in solution (g is the Earth's gravitational acceleration). At 100,000 g, achieved by faster centrifuge rotation, ER sediments out of solution as a pellet but the soluble enzymes remain in the supernatant. In this way, cytochrome P450 in microsomes is concentrated and isolated. Microsomes have a reddish-brown color, due to the presence of the heme. Because of the need for a multi-part protein-system, microsomes are necessary to analyze the metabolic activity of CYPs. These CYPs are highly abundant in livers of rats, mice and humans, but present in all other organs and organisms as well. To get microsomes containing a specific CYP or for high amounts of active enzyme, microsomes are prepared from Sf9 insect cells or in yeast via heterologous expression. Alternatively expression in Escherichia coli of whole or truncated proteins can also be performed. Therefore, microsomes are a valuable tool for investigating the metabolism of compounds (enzyme inhibition, clearance and metabolite identification) and for examining drug-drug interactions by in vitro-research. Researchers often select microsome lots based on the enzyme activity level of specific CYPs. Some lots are available to study specific populations (example: lung microsomes from smokers or non-smokers) or divided into classifications to meet target CYP activity levels for inhibition and metabolism studies. Researchers use microsomes to mimic the activity of the endoplasmic reticulum in a test tube and conduct experiments that require protein synthesis on a membrane; they provide a way for scientists to figure out how proteins are being made on the ER in a cell by reconstituting the process in a test tube.

S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia series. She appears in The Silver Chair and The Last Battle. Biography =Prior story= =\\"The Silver Chair\\"= Jill Pole first appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\". She and Eustace attend the same school, and it is from the school grounds that they travel to Aslan's Country beyond the Sun, after being chased by bullies. She and Eustace are sent to Narnia by Aslan, to find the kidnapped Prince Rilian, son of Caspian X. They accomplish this with the assistance of the marshwiggle Puddleglum, whom she initially dislikes and considers a spoilsport and wet blanket, but whom she soon admits is the bravest and wisest of all of them. She has to learn to face her claustrophobia and nyctophobia during her quest, and also is the one Aslan has tasked with remembering the four signs that will guide them on their quest. When she is distracted from doing this by temptation of good food and rest, the group loses their way and finds themselves in serious danger from the man-eating giants of Harfang. Her experience with riding and horses allows her to control the Emerald Witch's horse Snowflake, after Rillian is found and the witch is killed. She is also the first to discover the exit of the Underland that leads back to Narnia, and she saves her wonderful clothes from Narnia to wear at fancy dress balls once she is back in England. =The Last Battle= Jill and Eustace are called into Narnia to help King Tirian in his struggle against the false appearance of Aslan, and a Calormene invasion. They first free the king from where he is tied to a tree. Then the three of them steal away to a Narnian supply garrison where they put on Calormene disguises and return to Stable Hill. When they arrive they free Jewel the Unicorn. Then Jill disobeys the king's orders by entering the Stable, but in doing so, she discovers Puzzle the Donkey, the fake Aslan. Jill becomes Puzzle's friend and saves him from execution by Tirian. During the battle, Jill fights with her bow and arrow and kills several Calormene soldiers while weeping for the now-doomed Narnia (she had previously stated that she hoped Narnia would go on forever). She later goes through the stable door and comes into Aslan's Country along with the others and also becomes one of the Queens (alongside Polly and Lucy) along with Eustace who becomes a King like Digory, Peter, and Edmund. It is not known for sure whether Jill and Eustace got to Narnia because they were killed in the train crash that took the lives of everyone else or if Aslan simply brought them there by magic. Portrayal In the 1990 BBC production of The Chronicles of Narnia, Jill Pole was portrayed by Camilla Power. In the 2010 film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Jill Pole is mentioned visiting Eustace at the end, although she is not shown. This did not happen in the book, nor did it happen in the BBC adaptation 21 years earlier.

This includes the practice of creating financial reports specifically designed to track the financial progress of projects, which can then be used by managers to aid project management. Traditionally, project accounting and its principles were largely used to track and report predominantly large construction, engineering and government projects. Today, project management delivery methodologies have expanded into several other sectors, including financial, technology and legal. Subsequently, project accounting has needed to follow to cover these areas to ensure corresponding financial tracking and financial implications are understood and considered. The need for project accounting arose as a specialised field from the nature of projects being treated as separate temporary individualised entities set up for the purpose of delivering one or more business products. As the nature of each project may be different from the business-as-usual activities run by the business, existent management accounting and financial accounting skills were recognised as insufficient to accurately advise on the treatment and financial reporting of a project. Hence, a new field emerged within the accounting sphere ‚Äì project accounting. Project accounting therefore includes: * A separate accounting system or cost centre to track and report project specific transactions, with project revenues, costs, assets and liabilities identified and allocated to the project. * Frequent reporting, with the frequency often increasing as the project approaches completion. * A layer of simplified reporting, including key performance indicators relevant to whether the project is on or off track. For instance traffic lights on a dashboard. * A process for identifying project related transactions in the main accounting system and allocating or apportioning these to the project accounting system. * Forecasting of costs to complete the project. Key stakeholders are often not only focused on the costs incurred to date, but also those committed and the expected final cost. Projects differ from the day-to-day business-as-usual (BAU) activities in that they frequently cross organisational boundaries, may last for anything from a few days or weeks to a number of years, during which time budgets may also be revised many times. They may also be one of a number of projects that make up a larger overall project or program. Consequently, in a project management environment costs (both direct and overhead) and revenues are also allocated to projects, which may be subdivided into a work breakdown structure, and grouped together into project hierarchies. Project accounting permits reporting at any such level that has been defined, and often allows comparison with historical as well as current budgets. Project accounting is commonly used by government contractors, where the ability to account for costs by contract (and sometimes contract line item, or CLIN) is usually a requirement for interim payments. Percentage-of-completion is frequently independently assessed by a project manager, program management officer (PMO) and project accountant. It includes the continuous recognition of revenues and income related to longer-term projects. By doing this, the seller is able to identify some gain or loss relevant to a project in every accounting period that is ongoing active. Funding advances and actual-to-budget cost variances are calculated using the project budget adjusted to percent-of-completion. Where labor costs are a significant portion of overall project cost, it is usually necessary for employees to fill out a timesheet in order to generate the data to allocate project costs. The capital budget processes of corporations and governments are chiefly concerned with major investment projects that typically have upfront costs and longer term benefits. Investment go / no-go decisions are largely based on net present value assessments. Project accounting of the costs and benefits can provide crucially important feedback on the quality of these important decisions. An interesting specialised form of project accounting is production accounting, which tracks the costs of individual movie and television episode film production costs. A movie studio will employ production accounting to track the costs of its many separate projects.  Role of the Project Accountant  The project accountant requires the knowledge of management accounting and financial accounting. They combine the complexities of cross-functional involvement, as well as, project delivery frameworks and methodologies used by the business. Within a project delivery framework, the project accountant plays a dual role of: * Gatekeeper reporting into the business the true and fair view of how the project is tracking financially; and * Advisor advising the project team as to the financial treatment and implications of the various decisions being made, their impact on both the project and the business. The key benefit of this is the project accountant ultimately plays a Translator role between the project and other finance /accounting functions. The role of a project accountant depends on the project needs, but as a basic function, the project accountant position is accountable for monitoring the progress of projects, investigating variances, approving expenses, and ensuring that project billings are issued to customers and payments collected. In Australia, a project accountant earns an average salary of AU$81,830 per year, with salaries ranging between AU$59,769 - AU$123,896. Most people working in this field move to a different position after approximately 20 years. The jobs that normally increase pay towards this job is Budget Managing and Cost Accounting. Experience has a moderate effect on income for this job.  Percentage of Completion Method  The percentage- of-completion method permits companies to record profits as development is made toward the finishing of the project. This method is not to be used when compelling uncertainty's about the percentage of completion of the remaining costs to be incurred. The method instead works at its finest when it is rationally likely to estimate the stages of the project in process. The percentage-of-completion may be measured in any of the resulting ways: _Cost- to-cost method:_ This is an example of the contract cost acquired to date the total expected cost. The price of the products already bought for a contract however have not yet been installed should not be added in the perseverance of the percentage of completion of a project, not unless they were particularly created for the contract. Also, assign the cost of equipment over the contract course, rather than direct, unless title to the supplies is being transported to the customer. _Efforts-expended method:_ This is the share of effort consumed to date in comparison to the total effort expected for the agreement. E.g. the percentage of completion may possibly be established on direct work hours, machine hours, or material size. _Units-of-delivery-method:_ This is the portion of units delivered to the buyer to the overall number of units to be brought under the terms of a contract. It should only be in use when the builder produces a number of units to the requirements of a buyer. The recognition is established on: * For revenue, the contract price of units delivered * For expenses, the costs reasonably allocable to the units delivered However, the necessary steps are the following: # Subtract the total predicted contract costs from total approximated revenues to appear at the total estimated gross margin. # Measure the range of process toward completion, using one of the methods mentioned above. # Increase the total likely contract revenue by the estimated finishing percentage to arrive at the total amount of revenue that can be acknowledged. # Subtract the contract revenue allowed to date through the foregoing period from the complete amount of revenue that be accepted. Recognise the development in the current accounting period. # Consider the cost of the received revenue in the same manner. This means raising the same percentage of completion by the total supposed contract cost, and subtracting the amount formerly realised to arrive at the cost of collected revenue to be recognised in the current accounting period. = Calculations = The following calculation is used to determine the completion percentage: Percent Complete = Cost Incurred to Date / Total Cost Estimate The current period revenue to be recognised during production would then be: Current Period Revenue = (Percent Complete x Total Contract Revenue) - Revenue Recognised in Prior Periods  Production Accounting  Production Accounting involves the person who is essential in the film industry to manage the finances and financial records during the film production. Working in this position requires being in close association with the producer and the production office for the development of the film budget and to arrange schedules. Further into this role, as the accountant for a film, day-to-day duties are expected such as the normal accounting tasks of an office and maintaining the budget by recording the expenses accumulated to make secure they do not go over the allocated budget.

Born around 1720 probably in Fauquier County, Virginia,English, 1:107 he died in poverty while fighting Native American allies of British troops during one of the last engagements of the Revolutionary War around June 4, 1782 in Jefferson County, Virginia (now Jefferson County, Kentucky). Illinois Campaign Helm was commissioned a captain and asked to raise and lead a company of Virginians by the newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel George Rogers Clark. On January 2, 1778, Governor George Washington gave Clark Nicther the authority to raise a regiment and secret orders to attack British forces and their allies on Virginia's frontier. Leonard Helm, who had served with Clark during Dunmore's War and had spent a lot of time in Kentucky, was given command of one of the initial four companies created to form this regiment. Captain Helm recruited soldiers from the Virginia militia from both Prince William and Fauquier Counties. Clark nicther unit was later known as the Illinois Regiment and participated in the Northwest Campaign. Clark and his men captured Kaskaskia, Illinois on July 4, 1778 and Cahokia, Illinois July 6, 1778. During the capture of Kaskaskia, Clark split his force, commanding one half himself with Captain Helm commanding the other. A series of relatively peaceful conquests took place, with Helm reaching as far as Fort Ouiatenon. Vincennes Vincennes decided to support the Americans at the urging of Father Gibault, and Captain Helm was sent to command Fort Sackville(renamed Fort Patrick Henry), with a group of local French speaking militiamen and 20 soldiers from Virginia.Skaggs, 180 He requested and received support from the local Piankeshaw tribe, especially the chief known as Young Tobacco. The British retook the fort on 17 December 1778, after Helm's local militia had deserted and he had too few men to attempt resistance. When the British formed within yards of the fort, Captain Helm opened the gate and pointed a cannon at the British formation, with an artillery match in one hand and a bottle of whiskey with the other. He invited Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton to share wiskey and discuss terms as gentlemen.Helm, 4 Knowing that the British did not fully understand his tactical situation, he demanded and received favorable terms of surrender. Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton was later shocked to find only three people within the fort but honored his agreement. When Colonel Clark heard about the surrender several weeks later, he and his force made a bold march through icy winter weather and laid siege to Fort Sackville. Captain Helm was inside Fort Sackville as a prisoner during the siege, and Clark notes in his memoir that he \\"amused himself very much during the siege, and, I believe, did much damage.\\" Helm came with the British party to the 24 February negotiations to end the siege, and tried to negotiate Clark's harsh terms of surrender. Clark countered that Helm could not negotiate because he was a British prisoner, at which point Hamilton released Helm. Whether he meant to reinforce his hardline negotiations or reprimand Helm for his impropriety in seemingly negotiating for Hamilton, Clark refused to receive the captain, and informed Helm that he must return to Fort Sackville and \\"await his fate.\\"see Clark's memoir, link below Hamilton surrendered 25 February 1779, and Fort Sackville was again renamed Fort Patrick Henry. Helm's little flotilla returning to Vincennes after having captured the British boats on the Wabash. Wabash Expedition On 5 March 1779, Helm led a small force of 3 boats and 50 men up the Wabash River from Vincennes and captured a fleet of 7 boats, 40 prisoners (among whom, Clark noted in a letter to George Mason, was 'Dejeane, Grand Judge of Detroit'), supplies, and trade goods that were sent to reinforce Hamilton at Fort Sackville. The battle occurred just west of Pointe Coupee, Indiana, and is locally referred to as the westernmost naval battle of the American Revolution,Commanger, Spirit of Seventy-Six, p. 1047. despite the account of the capture in George Rogers Clark's memoir: > March 5th, Captain Helm, Majors Bosseron and Legras, returned from their > journey up the river with great success.

This was a valuable (prize) seven > boats loaded with provisions and goods to a considerable amount. Battle of the White River Forks When Clark left Vincennes for Kaskaskia on 20 March 1779, he again appointed Captain Helm as commandant of the town, as well as Superintendent of Indian Affairs. While in command, a party of five traders left Vincennes for the Falls of the Ohio, along the ancient Buffalo Trace. A small band of Delaware from a village called Lechauwitank, between the forks of the White River, ambushed the traders, killed them, and plundered their goods.Allison, 44 Helm's reaction from Vincennes was strong. Helm called up the Vincennes militia and the garrison under Lt. Brashears, and they attacked the village at night. The entire village was destroyed, the surviving men were tomahawked to death in Vincennes, and the women and children were sold into slavery.English, 1:368, quotes Clark saying he would show no mercy to the Delaware, until the Piankeshaw said they would be responsible for their future actions. Fort Nelson and death Clark later appointed Helm as commander of the fort in present-day Louisville, Kentucky. Captain Helm was killed while serving as the commander of this fort. Helm had sold some of his land for continental currency under the belief that the value of it would increase. Instead, the continental dollar became almost worthless and Helm died in poverty, his personal estate consisting only of his clothes.

It is the highest point along the Chilkoot Trail that leads from Dyea, Alaska to Bennett Lake, British Columbia. The Chilkoot Trail was long a route used by the Tlingit for trade. During the Klondike Gold Rush of the late 19th century, it was used by prospectors and packers to get through the mountains. During the gold rush, three aerial tramways and several surface hoists were constructed and operated briefly over the pass. When the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad was built in neighboring White Pass, the Chilkoot Pass route fell out of favor with miners. The Pass and the Trail are administered by the national park services of the U.S. and Canada. On the B.C. side, it is administered as Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site. On the Alaska side, it is one unit of the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. In the summer of 1998, the Site and the Park united to form Klondike Gold Rush International Historical Park. Modern-day visitors can hike the 33-mile trail after registering and paying a fee. Background Last trek over the summit, 1898 The Klondike Gold rush had begun on August 16, 1896 on Bonanza Creek. This was located near Dawson, and 50 miles east of the Alaskan border. The Chilkoot Trail is reported to have spanned between 28 miles and 33 miles from sea level at Dyea, Alaska to Lake Bennett, British Columbia. The Chilkoot Pass was an important milestone which travellers had to conquer in order to reach the Klondike. The travellers were called 'stampeders,' and some had earlier sought the riches of the 1889 gold rush in Alaska. To be allowed to enter the Klondike and take part in the gold rush, Canadian officials required that stampeders take one ton of goods with them, to try to ensure they were prepared to survive on the frontier.‚ÄúFever Pitch‚Äù, Yukon Archives This was broken down into a year's supply of food, which was half of the weight, as well as another thousand pounds of equipment. The supplies and food requirements were broken down into two lists.Premose, S. ‚ÄúChilkoot Trail Supplies, Then and Now‚Äù, University of Utah The clothing items included: a waterproof blanket, 6 pairs of wool socks, 2 flannel over shirts, and a medicine chest. The list continues with the essential clothing needed. Some of the supplies required included: rolled oats, flour, salt, and bacon. The weight ranged from between 20 pounds to 400 pounds for one ingredient. This list was taken very seriously, as there was rarely a return journey after the Klondike was reached. Park officials still require travellers to make preparation for hiking in this area. But in 1995, the list for travelling the Trail and Pass was very different, as the technologies allowed for a much smaller supply list. In addition, more creature comforts were available, such as a lightweight camp stove. No traveller could take his supplies across the pass at once, so several trips had to be made in order to transport all needed goods to the destination. Quite often the supplies had to be carried by hand in 50-60 pound packs, as the passes proved to be too narrow for wagons or draft animals.National Postal Museum. ‚ÄúThe Trails‚Äù The travel was slow and what would have taken a few hours in another environment required days to complete. It is estimated that for every mile their supplies moved, the travelers had to walk 80 miles to get it there. Only the wealthiest of stampeders could afford to hire labour to transport their supplies. Most stampeders had to carry their own. The professional packers of the time mainly consisted of Alaska Natives and First Nations people (Indians), who charged 1 cent per pound they carried. Working the market, the packers quickly moved to new customers if there was a hint of more money to be offered by someone else.Friesen, R. The Chilkoot Pass and the Great Gold Rush of 1898, Ottawa: National Historic Parks and Sites Branch, Parks Canada, Environment Canada, 1981. The packing fees charged by professional packers were subject to change as the weather changed. Ground conditions could make the packing much more difficult, and muddier ground conditions were harder to traverse as compared to frozen, snow-covered ground. The Pass The Golden Stairs (left), Peterson Pass (right), the Scales (bottom) The Chilkoot trail rose 900 feet to the base of the Chilkoot Pass to an area called the Scales. This was a rough rock-strewn area and was named because it was the last place where travelers could have their packs reweighed, and adjustments could be made to their payments. The Scales was also used as a place where travelers could store their provisions and supplies while going to lower levels to get the remainder, before continuing on their journey up the Pass. After the Scales, the ground rose about 500 ‚Äì 600 feet over a distance of approximately half a mile. The trail was covered with giant, sharp slabs of rock, which made the footing treacherous and often induced crawling during the summer months. In the winter, workers cut the ice into 1500 steps, which came to be known as the 'Golden Stairs'. The steps were too narrow for more than one person to climb up at a time, so the trek was limited to a single-file line up the mountain, as shown in the photo for this article. The workers who had carved steps into the ice of Chilkoot Pass also charged travelers to ascend the mountain, as the travelers had to use their stairs. =Tramways= Ropes were lowered along the trail to help the travelers balance and continue up the slippery slopes. After 1897 a tramway was built so that wealthy travelers could ease their last 600 feet up the Pass. The tramway was powered by two horses, and it cost 1 ¬Ω cents a pound to hire. Historians have estimated the builder of the tramway was making $150 per day by his development. On the other side of the Pass was Emerald Lake. To travel down the mountain, the travelers faced a descent of 1300 feet over the horizontal distance of approximately 9 miles. The crest through the mountain and the path down it, were often filled with snow all year round, making the trek more difficult. =Environment= There was a high risk of avalanche along the Chilkoot Pass, as snow storms were frequent and the snow could give way and speed down the summit. The wet and heavy snow of the avalanches could kill 50 to 100 men at a time. Travelers persisted in using the high-risk pass the most because it was the least expensive route, as well as the shortest route, for transporting their supplies.‚ÄúChilkoot Trail National Historic Site of Canada‚Äù, Parks Canada The weather through the Pass was unpredictable and visibility could drop to a few feet. Travelers became soaked from rain and sweat from their physical exertion; the sun's reflection against the snow could burn their skin and almost blind them. The price of provisions took a discernible downturn, as many men who had packed their year's worth of provisions to White Pass (an alternative route), had decided to turn back and sold their provisions to anyone who chose to ascend the Passes. The price of horses had increased to approximately $200 an animal at the trip's beginning. North West Mounted Police Border crossing at the top of the Chilkoot Pass At both the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass, members of the North West Mounted Police (NWMP) were assigned to collect custom duties on the supplies brought into Canada.‚ÄúThe Gold Rush and the Police of the Yukon‚Äù , Musee Virtuel These officers were also used to protect supplies.‚ÄúKlondike Gold Rush‚Äù, Royal Canadian Mounted Police As noted above, when stampeders traveled by the Chilkoot Pass, they had to leave some of their provisions at each end of the pass during the journey, as they could not manage transporting them all at once. To protect the supplies, a large detachment of the North West Mounted Police was stationed there to ensure the proper wares went to the proper traveler. The police also ensured that the rule of 1 ton of goods per person was enforced. Tensions arose between the NWMP and the Americans related to disputes about where the international borders were located. After several disputes between the governments, they decided to keep the international boundary at the Chilkoot and the White Passes. The NWMP had already built custom houses at both passes prior to the dispute being settled. Canada also used its militia, called the Yukon Field Force, to help the NWMP with guarding prisoners and protecting gold shipments. The NWMP also regulated the whisky trade along the trails. The police had wanted to build a port of entry at the summits of both the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass. This was to secure the border between Canada and the United States at these points. The endeavor would cost a small fortune, as the wood had to be taken up the tramway, and they had to bribe any offended packers. They wanted to avoid any delay in getting a cabin on the Chilkoot Pass summit. But, the cabin was not constructed well and the high winds of the Chilkoot Pass drove snow into it. As the snow melted, the interior became wet, creating mould; living conditions were so poor that blankets and bedding would not dry. The collection of custom duties on the summit of Chilkoot Pass began on February 26, 1898. Women on the Trails With rumors of some successes, both men and women viewed the Gold Rush as a chance to make a fortune and break out of poverty. Based on steam ship passenger lists, historians estimate that approximately 1500 women made the trek through the Chilkoot and White trails. This represented seven percent of all the travelers between December 1898 and September 1900. At the beginning of the gold rush stampede, only a few hundred non-native women participated. Some of these women were wives of the stampeders, while others had traveled in order to gain employment as clerks, teachers, cooks, nurses, and prostitutes. Camp Lindeman was reported to have a woman doctor.\\"Journey's End\\", Yukon Archives Women's clothing of the time made their journeys through the trails and across the passes even more difficult. The long, full skirts were ill-suited for any physical labour, and were often made with five yards (or more) of material, making them very heavy and cumbersome. Having to wear corsets and petticoats further limited women's mobility. The high collars required women to hold their heads high and, depending on the outfit, tilt their heads back. During this period, a women's movement had formed to allow women more freedom in the way they dressed. The rigors of the trail meant that many women abandoned conventional clothing and began to wear bloomers or knickers. These long, full pants were gathered at the ankle or just below the knees. Women shortened their skirts over the bloomers, generally to knee length. This was considered controversial by many men, but was more acceptable than if the women had not worn skirts. Some of the women who traveled to the Klondike had left their children behind, as few were willing to subject their children to the dangers of the trails and passes. Alternate route The trail from Skagway, Alaska to White Pass and Lake Lindeman was an alternative, but the trail was subject to outlaws. Soapy Smith and his gang centered in the port makeshift town of Skagway below the Pass were conniving and murderous thieves‚Äîif they couldn't cheat someone out of their belongings or money, they would steal valuables, and killing those that got in their way was common. The White Pass became more narrow and difficult to travel than as first presented to stampeders. Dynamite from a site above the trail caused a massive block to fall on the Dunns [their first names may have been Elizabeth and Michael], a married pair traveling with their horses. The block buried them and their horses and remains there to this day on the trail, adorned with a black Christian cross, now known as Black Cross Rock. This pass became too narrow for wagons, but men still tried to use horses along the trail. Many had little or no experience working with animals and drove the horses to death. The men would either shoot the horses or, if the horse fell and could not get up, they would just pull its horseshoes and go off, leaving the animal to die in the mud and snow. This was a common occurrence on White Pass along a stretch that was dubbed Dead Horse Trail. The men traveled back down to the beach again and purchased more horses to replace the ones that died on this trail. Most of the horses that died on the White Pass trail gave out or were killed within a two- mile stretch of slope. By 1897, 3200 pack horses had died on White Pass trail, and their bodies were left there. The bodies of the horses were often used as footing for other pack horses making their way through the trail. The horses that had fallen were not always dead, and suffered more under the hooves of others. When the horses could not work anymore, or were of no further use along the Chilkoot Trail, the animals were turned loose without feed. Many animals were left at the base of Chilkoot Pass at Sheep Camp. Most of the animals became sick and starved as they staggered through the camps trying to find food. The horses were no longer useful and had lost their value. Malnutrition was a large problem for the travelers on the Chilkoot and White Pass Trails, and many died from it.‚ÄúThe Klondike Gold Rush‚Äù Sometimes people suffering from malnutrition ate the bodies of the dead horses left on the White Pass Trail, and became violently ill as a result. It was rumoured that a traveler had used his boots as a source of food by boiling them and drinking the broth after so he could eat something. Physical illness was not the only problem to plague the travelers, as many also went insane from the conditions along the trails. Historians have suggested that the high rate of mental problems recounted were caused by the poor diets of many travelers, added to what may have been poor condition before starting the trails. In addition, along the trail the only shelter against the sometimes -40 degree temperatures were thin tents.

Early life Mrs David Josiah Brewer Elizabeth and Fannie Brewer, daughters of David Josiah Brewer Brewer was born to American missionaries Emilia Field Brewer and Rev. Josiah Brewer, who at the time of his birth were running a school for Greeks in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire; Emilia Brewer's brother Stephen Johnson Field, a future Supreme Court colleague of Brewer, was living with the couple at the time. His parents returned to the United States in 1838 and settled in Connecticut. Brewer attended college at Wesleyan University (1851‚Äì1854), where he was a member of the Mystical 7 Society, and he afterward attended Yale College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1856. While at Yale, Brewer was a classmate of Chauncey Depew and Henry Billings Brown, and was \\"greatly influenced by the political scientist-protestant minister Theodore Dwight Woolsey.\\" After graduation, Brewer read law for one year in the office of his uncle David Dudley Field, then enrolled at Albany Law School in Albany, New York, graduating in 1858. Career Upon graduating from law school, Brewer moved to Kansas City, Missouri and after attempting to start a law practice, left for Colorado in search of gold, returning empty-handed in 1859 to nearby Leavenworth, Kansas. He was named Commissioner of the Federal Circuit Court in Leavenworth in 1861. He left that court to become a judge to the Probate and Criminal Courts in Leavenworth in 1862, and then changed courts again to become a judge to the First Judicial District of Kansas in 1865. He left that position in 1869 and became city attorney of Leavenworth. He was then elected to the Kansas Supreme Court in 1870, where he served for 14 years. On March 25, 1884, Brewer was nominated by President Chester A. Arthur to the United States circuit court for the Eighth Circuit, to a seat vacated by George Washington McCrary. This court later became the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Brewer was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 31, and received commission the same day. Brewer's Supreme Court nomination After 28 years on the bench, Brewer was nominated by Benjamin Harrison to the United States Supreme Court on December 4, 1889, to a seat vacated by Stanley Matthews. Brewer was confirmed by the Senate on December 18, and received commission the same day, joining a court that included S. J. Field, his uncle. He served on the court for 20 years, until his death in 1910, being the last serving Supreme Court Justice appointed by President Harrison. In this regard, University of Texas professor and Supreme Court historian Lucas Powe has noted: \\"Brewer was one of the most influential justices [on] the court at the time. He was a vigorous defender of minority rights. In one case, he argued for stronger labor protections for women, while in other opinions he argued passionately for the rights of marginalized Chinese and Japanese immigrants.\\" Brewer was an active member of the Supreme Court, writing often in both concurring and dissenting opinions. He was, in most cases, a moderate conservative. He was a major contributor to the doctrine of substantive due process, arguing that certain activities are entirely outside government control. In his time he frequently sided with the Court's majorities that struck down property rights restrictions. Brewer was the author of the unanimous opinion of the Court in Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States (143 U.S. 457, 36 L.Ed. 226, 12 S. Ct. 511 February 29, 1892), which addressed a dispute over an employment contract between an Anglican priest and the titular church. Justice Brewer's statement in that opinion, \\"These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation\\" is often incorrectly cited as part of the controlling ruling in the matter, which is not the case. Indeed, Justice Brewer's book, The United States: A Christian Nation, published in 1905, contained the following passage: > But in what sense can [the United States] be called a Christian nation? Not > in the sense that Christianity is the established religion or the people are > compelled in any manner to support it. On the contrary, the Constitution > specifically provides that 'congress shall make no law respecting an > establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.' Neither > is it Christian in the sense that all its citizens are either in fact or in > name Christians. On the contrary, all religions have free scope within its > borders. Numbers of our people profess other religions, and many reject all. > [...] Nor is it Christian in the sense that a profession of Christianity is > a condition of holding office or otherwise engaging in public service, or > essential to recognition either politically or socially. In fact, the > government as a legal organization is independent of all religions. > Nevertheless, we constantly speak of this republic as a Christian nation‚Äîin > fact, as the leading Christian nation of the world. This popular use of the > term certainly has significance. It is not a mere creation of the > imagination. It is not a term of derision but has a substantial basis‚Äîone > which justifies its use. Let us analyze a little and see what is the basis. Justice Brewer discusses numerous evidences from public and private life including citations from the Federal and Several state Constitutions before concluding as follows: > But I must not weary you. I could go on indefinitely, pointing out further > illustrations both official and non-official, public and private; such as > the annual Thanksgiving proclamations, with their following days of worship > and feasting; announcements of days of fasting and prayer; the universal > celebration of Christmas; the gathering of millions of our children in > Sunday Schools, and the countless volumes of Christian literature, both > prose and poetry. But I have said enough to show that Christianity came to > this country with the first colonists; has been powerfully identified with > its rapid development, colonial and national, and to-day exists as a mighty > factor in the life of the republic. This is a Christian nation, ... While Justice Brewer's decision was not a binding legal pronouncement reflecting an official acceptance of Christianity and did not say that its laws or policies should reflect solely Christian concerns and beliefs, he did outline the influence Christianity had on the history and culture of the United States. It was this influence that caused Brewer to state many times that this is a Christian nation. Brewer temporarily took a leave from his Supreme Court duties to serve as president of the U.S. Commission on the Boundary Between Venezuela and British Guiana, established by Congress to arbitrate in the Venezuela Crisis of 1895. Brewer was the author of the unanimous opinion of the Court in Muller v. Oregon (1908) in support of a law restricting working hours for women. He was also the author of In re Debs, upholding federal injunctions to suppress labor strikes. Along with Justice Harlan, Brewer dissented in Giles v. Harris (1903), a case challenging grandfather clauses as applied to voting rolls. In April 1896, due to the unexpected death of his daughter, Brewer left for his Leavenworth home on the day that Plessy v. Ferguson was argued before the Court, and did not participate in that 7-1 decision. However, \\"[a]s a judge in Reconstruction era Kansas, he had authored one of the first judicial opinions upholding the right of an African-American citizen to vote in a general election, and as the superintendent of schools in Leavenworth, he had helped establish the first schools for blacks in the state.\\" In 1904, he served as president of the Universal Congress of Lawyers and Jurists held in conjunction with that year's Louisiana Purchase Exposition. In 1906, Brewer was one of the 30 founding members of the Simplified Spelling Board, founded by Andrew Carnegie to make English easier to learn and understand through changes in the English language.

An optical ring resonator is a set of waveguides in which at least one is a closed loop coupled to some sort of light input and output. (These can be, but are not limited to being, waveguides.) The concepts behind optical ring resonators are the same as those behind whispering galleries except that they use light and obey the properties behind constructive interference and total internal reflection. When light of the resonant wavelength is passed through the loop from input waveguide, it builds up in intensity over multiple round-trips due to constructive interference and is output to the output bus waveguide which serves as a detector waveguide. Because only a select few wavelengths will be at resonance within the loop, the optical ring resonator functions as a filter. Additionally, as implied earlier, two or more ring waveguides can be coupled to each other to form an add/drop optical filter .  Background  PMMA Optical ring resonators work on the principles behind total internal reflection, constructive interference, and optical coupling. = Total internal reflection = The light travelling through the waveguides in an optical ring resonator remain within the waveguides due to the ray optics phenomenon known as total internal reflection (TIR). TIR is an optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes the boundary of a medium and fails to refract through the boundary. Given that the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle (with respect to the normal of the surface) and the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary relative to the incident ray, TIR will occur and no light will be able to pass through. For an optical ring resonator to work well, total internal reflection conditions must be met and the light travelling through the waveguides must not be allowed to escape by any means. = Interference = Interference is the process by which two waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater or less amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or coherent with each other. In constructive interference, the two waves are of the same phase interfere in a way such that the resultant amplitude will be equal to the sum of the individual amplitudes. As the light in an optical ring resonator completes multiple circuits around the ring component, it will interfere with the other light still in the loop. As such, assuming there are no losses in the system such as those due to absorption, evanescence, or imperfect coupling and the resonance condition is met, the intensity of the light emitted from a ring resonator will be equal to the intensity of the light fed into the system. = Optical coupling = A pictoral representation of the coupling coefficientsImportant for understanding how an optical ring resonator works, is the concept of how the linear waveguides are coupled to the ring waveguide. When a beam of light passes through a wave guide as shown in the graph on the right, part of light will be coupled into the optical ring resonator. The reason for this is the phenomenon of the evanescent field, which extends outside of the waveguide mode in an exponentially decreasing radial profile. In other words, if the ring and the waveguide are brought closely together, some light from the waveguide can couple into the ring. There are three aspects that affect the optical coupling: the distance, the coupling length and the refractive indices between the waveguide and the optical ring resonator. In order to optimize the coupling, it is usually the case to narrow the distance between the ring resonator and the waveguide. The closer the distance, the easier the optical coupling happens. In addition, the coupling length affects the coupling as well. The coupling length represents the effective curve length of the ring resonator for the coupling phenomenon to happen with the waveguide. It has been studied that as the optical coupling length increases, the difficulty for the coupling to happen decreases. Furthermore, the refractive index of the waveguide material, the ring resonator material and the medium material in between the waveguide and the ring resonator also affect the optical coupling. The medium material is usually the most important feature under study since it has a great effect on the transmission of the light wave. The refractive index of the medium can be either large or small according to various applications and purposes. One more feature about optical coupling is the critical coupling. The critical coupling shows that no light is passing through the waveguide after the light beam is coupled into the optical ring resonator. The light will be stored and lost inside the resonator thereafter. Lossless coupling is when no light is transmitted all the way through the input waveguide to its own output; instead, all of the light is coupled into the ring waveguide (such as what is depicted in the image at the top of this page). For lossless coupling to occur, the following equation must be satisfied: : \\\\Kappa^2 + t^2 = \\\\mathbf{1} where t is the transmission coefficient through the coupler and \\\\Kappa is the taper-sphere mode coupling amplitude, also referred to as the coupling coefficient.  Theory  To understand how optical ring resonators work, we must first understand the optical path length difference (OPD) of a ring resonator. This is given as follows for a single-ring ring resonator: : \\\\mathbf{OPD} = 2 \\\\pi r n_{eff} where r is the radius of the ring resonator and n_{eff} is the effective index of refraction of the waveguide material. Due to the total internal reflection requirement, n_{eff} must be greater than the index of refraction of the surrounding fluid in which the resonator is placed (e.g. air). For resonance to take place, the following resonant condition must be satisfied: : \\\\mathbf{OPD} = m \\\\lambda_{m} where \\\\lambda_{m} is the resonant wavelength and m is the mode number of the ring resonator. This equation means that in order for light to interfere constructively inside the ring resonator, the circumference of the ring must be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light. As such, the mode number must be a positive integer for resonance to take place. As a result, when the incident light contains multiple wavelengths (such as white light), only the resonant wavelengths will be able to pass through the ring resonator fully. The quality factor of an optical ring resonator can be quantitatively described using the following formula: : \\\\mathbf{Q} = m \\\\mathcal{F} = m \\\\frac{ u_{f}}{\\\\delta u} where \\\\mathcal{F} is the finesse of the ring resonator, u_{f} is the free spectral range, and \\\\delta u is the full-width half-max of the transmission spectra. The quality factor is useful in determining the spectral range of the resonance condition for any given ring resonator. The quality factor is also useful for quantifying the amount of losses in the resonator as a low Q factor is usually due to large losses. A transmission spectra depicting multiple resonant modes (m=1, m=2, m=3, ..., m=n) and the free spectral range.  Double ring resonators  A double ring resonator with rings of varying radii in series showing the relative intensities of light passing through on the first cycle. Note that the light passing through a double ring resonator would more often travel in multiple loops around each ring rather than as pictured. In a double ring resonator, two ring waveguides are used instead of one. They may be arranged in series (as shown on the right) or in parallel. When using two ring waveguides in series, the output of the double ring resonator will be in the same direction as the input (albeit with a lateral shift). When the input light meets the resonance condition of the first ring, it will couple into the ring and travel around inside of it. As subsequent loops around the first ring bring the light to the resonance condition of the second ring, the two rings will be coupled together and the light will be passed into the second ring. By the same method, the light will then eventually be transferred into the bus output waveguide. Therefore, in order to transmit light through a double ring resonator system, we will need to satisfy the resonant condition for both rings as follows: : \\\\ 2 \\\\pi n_{1} R_{1} = m_{1} \\\\lambda_{1} : \\\\ 2 \\\\pi n_{2} R_{2} = m_{2} \\\\lambda_{2} where m_{1} and m_{2} are the mode numbers of the first and second ring respectively and they must remain as positive integer numbers. For the light to exit the ring resonator to the output bus waveguide, the wavelength of the light in each ring must be same. That is, \\\\lambda_{1} = \\\\lambda_{2} for resonance to occur. As such, we get the following equation governing resonance: : \\\\ \\\\frac{n_{1} R_{1}}{m_{1}} = \\\\frac{n_{2} R_{2}}{m_{2}} Note that both m_{1} and m_{2} need to remain integers. Optical mirror (reflector) made of a double ring system coupled to a single waveguide. Forward propagating waves in the waveguide (green) excite anti-clockwise traveling waves in both rings (green). Due to the inter-resonator coupling, these waves generate clockwise rotating waves (red) in both rings which in turn excite backward propagating (reflected) waves (red) in the waveguide. The reflected wave exists only in the part of the waveguide to the left of the coupling point to the right ring. A system of two ring resonators coupled to a single waveguide has also been shown to work as a tunable reflective filter (or an optical mirror). Forward propagating waves in the waveguide excite anti-clockwise rotating waves in both rings. Due to the inter-resonator coupling, these waves generate clockwise rotating waves in both rings which are in turn coupled to backward propagating (reflected) waves in the waveguide.  Applications  Due to the nature of the optical ring resonator and how it \\"filters\\" certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many optical ring resonators in series. This would allow for \\"small size, low losses, and integrability into [existing] optical networks.\\" Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of mechanical sensor. If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions. The tuning process can be effected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic,N.

Electro- optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q microring are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of > 50 Gbit/s at cost of a tuning power to match wavelength of the light source. A ring modulator placed in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity was reported to eliminate the tuning power by automatic matching of the laser wavelength with that of the ring modulator while maintaining high-speed ultralow-power modulation of a Si microring modulator. Optical ring, cylindrical, and spherical resonators have also been proven useful in the field of biosensing.,Fard, S. T., Grist, S. M., Donzella, V., Schmidt, S.

One of the main benefits of using ring resonators in biosensing is the small volume of sample specimen required to obtain a given spectroscopy results in greatly reduced background Raman and fluorescence signals from the solvent and other impurities. Resonators have also been used to characterize a variety of absorption spectra for the purposes of chemical identification, particularly in the gaseous phase. Another potential application for optical ring resonators are in the form of whispering gallery mode switches. \\"[Whispering Gallery Resonator] microdisk lasers are stable and switch reliably and hence, are suitable as switching elements in all-optical networks.\\" An all-optical switch based on a high Quality factor cylindrical resonator has been proposed that allows for fast binary switching at low power. material. Many researchers are interested in creating three-dimensional ring resonators with very high quality factors. These dielectric spheres, also called microsphere resonators, \\"were proposed as low-loss optical resonators with which to study cavity quantum electrodynamics with laser-cooled atoms or as ultrasensitive detectors for the detection of single trapped atoms.‚Äù Ring resonators have also proved useful as single photon sources for quantum information experiments. Many materials used to fabricate ring resonator circuits have non-linear responses to light at high enough intensities. This non-linearity allows for frequency modulation processes such as four-wave mixing and Spontaneous parametric down-conversion which generate photon pairs. Ring resonators amplify the efficiency of these processes as they allow the light to circulate around the ring.

With 19 staff members at its headquarters in Canberra and field offices in Narromine, Broken Hill and Longreach, the Commission is funded half by the Commonwealth government and half by the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland. Activities The APLC conducts regular surveys of locust populations and migrations and carries out control of locust outbreaks by means of aerial application of pesticides; traditionally these were chemicals, but more recently APLC has been a major contributor to the development of a biological pesticide in collaboration with CSIRO and LUBILOSA scientists. With CSIRO, it also conducts educational outreach and training courses for landowners, businesses, and local governments, including international consulting work in China, Africa and South America. Responsibility to control the pest species resides with the states. The APLC coordinates activities when species migrate across state borders. The establishment of the APLC allowed for the first use of remotely sensed data to forecast locust populations in Australia. In 2010, the APLC together with the states identified the potential for a significant infestation of the spur-throated locust. A coordinated effort to minimise damage was undertaken. It was estimated the activities resulted in a saving of $963 million from the expenditure of $50 million.

It was the first major Allied offensive in the Pacific Theater of Operations.  United States  = High-Level Command = 1st Marine Division shoulder patch The roles of Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA) and Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC), were both exercised by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz from his headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Since the Solomons lie in the Southern Pacific, the landings of 7 August 1942 on Guadalcanal were the responsibility of the South Pacific Fleet, led by Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley from his headquarters at Noumea, New Caledonia.Morison 1949, pp. 250-251 Adm. Ghormley's pessimism, inadequate staff work and unwillingness to visit the front led Adm. Nimitz to replace him with the much more aggressive and hands-on Vice Admiral William F. Halsey on 18 October 1942.Morison 1948, p. 183 Operational command of the invasion was assigned to Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. He also had direct command of the covering force, designated Task Force 61, where he flew his flag aboard fleet carrier Saratoga. The amphibious forces, Task Force 62, were led by Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner aboard attack transport McCawley. Bitter disputes between the two men arose during both the planning and execution of the invasion over how long Fletcher's aircraft carriers would stay in the vicinity of Guadalcanal to provide air cover for the Marines ashore. Fletcher decided the matter after multiple assaults on the Allied amphibious force by bombers from the Japanese base at Rabaul on D-Day and D+1. These attacks convinced Fletcher that his crucial aircraft carriers could not be risked in the waters of the Solomons any longer and he ordered his carriers out of the area on the night of 8 August. Unsettled by the removal of air cover and rattled the following morning by the discovery that his cruiser screen had been decimated at the Battle of Savo Island, Turner ordered his vulnerable, and still half-full, cargo ships back to Noumea around sundown 9 August. The Marine Corps forces ashore were thus left without air cover or the planned level of food and ammunition. The 1st Marine Division's struggle to take Guadalcanal from the Imperial Japanese Army achieved legendary status; the unit's insignia features a large red numeral 1 with the word \\"Guadalcanal\\" superimposed.

It is located in the Malwa region of western Madhya Pradesh, India, at 35 km from Dhar city. In the 11th century, Mandu was the sub division of the Tarangagadh or Taranga kingdom. This fortress town on a rocky outcrop about from Indore is celebrated for its architecture. History An inscription discovered from Talanpur (around 100km from Mandu) states that a merchant named Chandra Simha installed a statue in a temple of Parshvanatha located in the Mandapa Durg. While \\"Durg\\" means \\"Fort\\", the word \\"Mandu\\" is a Prakrit corruption of \\"mandapa\\", meaning \\"hall, temple\\". The inscription is dated 612 VS (555 CE), which indicates that Mandu was a flourishing town in 6th century. Mandu gained prominence in 10th and 11th century under the Paramaras. The town of Mandu, situated at an elevation of 633 metres (2,079 feet), is perched on the Vindhya Range extending for while overlooking the plateau of Malwa to the north and the valley of the Narmada River to the south which acted as natural defences for the fort-capital the Paramaras. As \\"Mandapa-Durga\\", Mandu is mentioned as the royal residence in the inscriptions of the Paramara kings starting from Jayavarman II. It is possible that Jayavarman or his predecessor Jaitugi moved from the traditional Paramara capital Dhara to Mandu, because of attacks from the neighbouring kingdoms. Balban, the general of the Delhi's Sultan Nasir-ud-din, had reached the northern frontier of the Paramara territory by this time. Around the same time, the Paramaras also faced attacks from the Yadava king Krishna of Deogiri and the Vaghela king Visaladeva of Gujarat. Compared to Dhara, which is located in the plains, the hilly area of Mandu would have offered a better defensive position. In 1305, the Muslim Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khalji captured Malwa, the Paramara territory. Ayn al-Mulk Multani, the newly appointed Governor of Malwa, was sent to expel the Paramara king Mahalakadeva from Mandu and cleanse that place from \\"the odour of infidelity\\". With the help of a spy, Multani's forces found a way to enter the fort secretly. Mahalakadeva was killed while attempting to flee, on 24 November 1305. When Timur captured Delhi in 1401, the Afghan Dilawar Khan, governor of Malwa, set up his own little kingdom and the Ghuri dynasty was established, His son, Hoshang Shah, shifted the capital from Dhar to Mandu and raised it to its greatest splendour. His son and third and last ruler of Ghuri dynasty, Mohammed, ruled for just one year till his poisoning by the militaristic Mohammed Khalji. Mohammed Khalji established the Khalji dynasty of Malwa (1436-1531) and went on to rule for the next 33 years. However, it was under his reign that the Malwa Sultanate reached its greatest height. He was succeeded by his son, Ghiyas-ud-din, in 1469 and ruled for the next 31 years. He had a large harem and built the Jahaz Mahal for housing the women, numbering thousands. Ghiyas-ud-din was poisoned at age 80, by Nasir-ud-din, his son. Mughal forces led by Adham Khan, enter the fort of Baz Bahadur of Malwa, 1561, Akbarnama ca 1590‚Äì95. In 1526, Mahmud II the sixth Khalji ruler made no resistance against the invading Bahadur Shah of Gujarat who conquered Mandu 28 March 1531. In 1530 Humayun, the second Mughal Emperor, succeeded Babur. Babur had established the Mughal dynasty. Humayun had two major rivals: Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and Sher Shah Suri. Humayun was engaged in a war with Sher Shah Suri when he learned of an imminent attack by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat who was being aided by the Portuguese. With an unusual swiftness Humayun attacked and defeated Bahadur Shah. Thus in 1534 Mandu came under Humayun's rule and he ordered large scale massacre of prisoners there.https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.99051/2015.99051.Mughal- Rule-In-India_djvu.txt Humayun fancied Mandu so he relaxed here for a brief, peaceful interludeThe Mughal Throne by Abraham Eraly pg 47 Humayun lost the kingdom to Mallu Khan, an officer of the Khalji dynasty. Ten more years of feuds and invasions followed and in the end Baz Bahadur emerged on top. By this time Humayun had been defeated by Sher Shah Suri and had fled India. Sher Shah Suri died in 1545 and his son Islam Shah died in 1553. Islam Shah's 12-year-old son Feroz Khan became the king but was killed by Adil Shah Suri within 3 days. Adil Shah appointed Hemu, also known as 'Hemof Army and Prime Minister. Hemu had a rapid rise during Sur regime. A grain supplier to Sher Shah Suri's army and then Chief of Intelligence or Daroga-i-Chowki (Superintendent of Post) under Islam Shah, he became the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan Army (Sher Shah Suri's army) under the reign of Adil Shah Suri. Adil Shah Suri was an incompetent ruler and many rebellions occurred against his rule. Hemu was sent to quell these rebellions. During this period Hemu attacked Mandu also and Baz Bahadur ran away from Mandu. Hemu appointed his own Governor here. During this period Humayun had returned to India and in 1555 was again the emperor. In 1556 Humayun died after falling while descending a staircase. Hemu was in Bengal at the time and sensing an opportunity attacked Mughals. Soon Agra, Bihar, Eastern UP, Madhya Pradesh were all won and on 6 October 1556, he won Delhi, defeating Akbar's forces, and had his coronation at Purana Quila, the next day. Akbar defeated and killed Hemu in the second Battle of Panipat on 7 November 1556. In 1561, Akbar's army led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March 1561. One of the reasons for Adham Khan's attack seems to be his love for Rani Roopmati. Rani Roopmati poisoned herself to death on hearing the news of fall of Mandu. Baz Bahadur fled to Khandesh. Akbar, soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur but he was defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa. Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a short period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army led by Abdullah Khan, an Uzbeg which finally defeated Baz Bahadur. He fled to Chittor. Baz Bahadur remained a fugitive at a number of courts till he surrendered in November, 1570 to Akbar at Nagaur. He joined Akbar's service.Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007) The Mughul Empire, Mumbai:Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.112-3 After Akbar added Mandu to the Mughal empire, it kept a considerable degree of independence, until taken by the Marathas in 1732 by Peshwa Baji Rao I. The capital of Malwa was then shifted back to Dhar by Marathas under Maharaja Pawar, re-establishing Hindu rule. Places of interest Mandu, due to its strategic position and natural defences, was an important place with a rich and varied history. It was an important military outpost and its military past can be gauged by the circuit of the battlemented wall, which is nearly and is punctuated by 12 gateways. The wall encloses a large number of palaces, mosques, Jain temples of 14th century and other buildings. The oldest mosque dates from 1405; the finest is the Jama Masjid or great mosque, a notable example of Pashtun architecture. The marble-domed tomb of this ruler is also magnificent Some of the notable places, listed in South to North direction are: Roopmati's Pavilion Roopmati's PavilionRani Roopmati 1555-1561 CE The Kapoor Talao situated in the Madu Fort A large sandstone structure originally built as an army observation post it is known today as Roopmati's Pavilion. Rani Roopmati - the love interest of Baaz Bahadur lived here and is said to have gazed at the Baz Bahadur's Palace - situated below and also at Narmada river, flowing through the Nimar plains far below, a river which the queen revered. Baz Bahadur's Palace Main court of Baz Bahadur's Palace. Built by Baz Bahadur, this 16th-century structure is famous for its large courtyards encompassed by large halls and high terraces. It is situated below Roopmati's Pavilion and can be seen from the pavilion. Rewa Kund Rewa Kund - a reservoir that supplies water to Roopmati's Pavilion. A reservoir constructed by Baz Bahadur for the purpose of supplying water to Rani Roopmati's Pavilion. The reservoir is situated below the pavilion and hence is considered an architectural marvel. Darya Khan's Tomb complex Darya Khan was a minister in the court of Mahmud Khalji II, and his tomb lies in a walled complex along with another tomb, a mosque, a pond, and an inn. At the centre of the complex is the massive sandstone tomb of Darya Khan. Hathi Paga Mahal or Elephant Leg Palace is located on the south-eastern side of the Darya Khan Complex, and is crowned with a massive dome. Shri Mandavagadh Teerth Shri Mandavagadh Teerth is dedicated to Lord Suparshvanatha. It belongs to Shwetambar sect of Jainism. The temple has been attractively constructed and looks exquisite. It underwent expansion in 14th century. The idol of Lord Suparshvanath is believed to be much older. The idol is white in complexion and is 91.54 cm (3 feet) in height. It is seated in a padmansana posture. Apart from this in this same fort there is a fine temple of smaller size of Lord Shantinath. Ruins of many temples and idols can be seen here. As per a reference once there were almost 700 Jain temples here. Jami Masjid The courtyard of the Jami Masjid. Inspired by the great mosque of Damascus, this enormous structure is striking in both its simplicity and architectural style- with large courtyards and grand entrances. At the front of Jaami Mosque, there are ruins of Asharfi Palace. There is a seven-story winning memorial at the north-east of the palace, and also a fascinating Ram Temple nearby, which was built by Maharani Sakarwar Bai Pawar in 1769 CE. Hoshang Shah's Tomb Mausoleum of Hoshang Shah Hoshangshah Gori 1406-1435 CE India's first marble structure, it is one of the most refined examples of Afghan architecture. Its unique features include the beautifully proportioned dome, intricate marble lattice work and porticoed courts and towers. It served as a template for the construction of Taj Mahal. Jahaz Mahal/Ship Palace Jahaz Mahal Situated between two artificial lakes, this two-storied architectural marvel is so named as it appears as a ship floating in water. Built by Sultan Ghiyas-ud- din-Khalji, it served as a harem for the sultan. This is The Water Palace shown in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832 together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Hindola Mahal The arches of Hindola Mahal. Hindola Mahal - meaning Swing palace is so named due to its sloping side walls. The Hindola Mahal might have been constructed during the reign of Hushang Shah about 1425 C.E. but may date to the end of the 15th century during the reign of Ghiyas al-Din.Bianca Maria Alfieri, Islamic Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent (New York:te Neues Publishing Company, 2000), 131-135. It is one of a set buildings making up the royal palace complex at Mandu, which consists of the Jahaz Mahal, the Hindola Mahal, the Taveli Mahal, and the Nahar Jharokha. The Hindola Mahal may have been used as an audience chamber. The Darwazas (Gates) The wall encompassing Mandu has 12 major darwazas or gates. The present road, through which Mandu is reached passes through many of these. Also encountered are smaller gateways built to provide protection to the above-mentioned 12 gates. = Sunset Point = This a lovely gorge on the way to the fort from Dhar.

At that time, he had 37 years of private legal practice, but had never judged a case. Shiras's only public service before he became a justice was as a federal elector in 1888, almost four years before his nomination in 1892.

In Pittsburgh, he became a prominent corporate attorney, and he was noted for his honesty and pragmatism while representing some of the nation's industrial giants.George Shiras , Biographical Directory of Federal Judges. Retrieved October 10, 2009 On July 19, 1892, Shiras was nominated by President Harrison to a Supreme Court seat vacated by Joseph P. Bradley. He was recommended for the post by his cousin, Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Shiras was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1892, and received his commission the same day. Although Shiras sat on the Court for more than 10 years authoring 253 majority decisions and 14 dissents, he is noted for his votes on just two landmark cases, Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895), and Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). He sided with the majority in the 5‚Äì4 decision in Pollock to strike down the Income Tax Act of 1894 as unconstitutional. Some historians believe Shiras was the pivotal Justice who switched his vote, while other historians suspect that it was either Justice Horace Gray or Justice David Brewer. Regardless, the ruling in Pollock led to the need for a constitutional amendment to impose a federal income tax, and in 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified. Shiras also voted with the 7‚Äì1 majority in the case Plessy v. Ferguson, a case which upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal, and which was overruled in 1954. Shiras retired from the bench on February 23, 1903, and remained in retirement until his death, in Pittsburgh, in 1924. His son, George Shiras III, served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania.

It is a part of the municipality of Waterland, and lies on the coast of the Markermeer, about southeast of Purmerend. It received city rights in 1355 and was damaged by the fires of 1500 and 1513. History Monnikendam was also the name of a number of warships - mainly built at the port of that name - during the Anglo- Dutch Wars. The town was founded by monks, the name Monnickendam translates as 'Monk's dam'. Monnickendam was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged into Waterland. Although it is a small fishing village today, it was an important port in earlier centuries. It possesses a seventeenth-century weigh house, once used by merchants and port officials, and a bell tower that dates from 1591. The fourteenth century church of St. Nicholas, renovated in 1602, is particularly notable. The synagogue was built in 1894.Synagogues of Europe: Architecture, History, Meaning, by Carol Herselle Krinsky - 1996 ,p. 68 Jewish families named Monnikendam trace their roots to this town.

Nicknamed the \\"Trident division\\" because of its shoulder patch, a vertical trident in white on a blue background, it was originally trained in amphibious assaults as preparation for deployment in the Pacific Theater. It was deployed to Europe in 1944 when casualties from the Battle of the Bulge needed to be replaced. World War I The 97th Division was one of the divisions planned to be activated in late 1918 and deployed to France in 1919 to reinforce the American Expeditionary Force. The division was organized at Camp Cody, Deming, New Mexico and activated on 5 September 1918. It included the 193rd and 194th Infantry Brigades, and the 172nd Field Artillery Brigade. The 194th was to be organized and trained at Camp Cody, the 172nd at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, and the 193rd was to be organized in France with the AEF. The division's cadre consisted of over 1,000 trained officers and enlisted men, and Colonel Carl A. Martin became its first commander on 26 September. The division was composed of National Army draftees mainly from Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire. In October, over 5,000 draftees, mainly from Oklahoma and Minnesota, were sent to the division at Camp Cody. Initial instruction at Camp Cody went relatively well, but the 172nd Brigade's training at Camp Jackson was delayed by a lack of personnel. Its regiments were at less than half strength as late as the beginning of November. In late October, the 97th was struck by the 1918 flu pandemic, which sickened over 500 soldiers and killed more than 100. On 25 October, Brigadier General James R. Lindsay became division commander as Martin became its chief of staff. The war ended with the Armistice of 11 November, and the 97th was ordered to be demobilized on 20 November. At the time, it consisted of 402 officers and 7,889 men. The demobilization was completed on 22 December, when the division was inactivated. Neptune's trident was originally adopted as the division's symbol, to represent the coastal states of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, from which recruits were drawn in 1918. The three prongs of the trident represent the three states, the blue symbolizes the states' numerous fresh water lakes, and the white of the border and trident represents the snow that covers these states' mountains. =Composition= *Division Headquarters Unit *387th Infantry Regiment *388th Infantry Regiment *622nd Field Signal Battalion *366th Machine Gun Battalion *322nd Headquarters Train and Military Police *322nd Sanitary Train 172nd Field Artillery Brigade The brigade was organized at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, under the command of Brigadier General Dennis H.

Interwar period The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921 and assigned to the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. The headquarters was organized in December 1921. World War II The 97th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 25 February 1943 at Camp Swift, Texas. Most of the cadre came from the 95th Infantry Division stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. In February 1944 the division was moved to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for additional training. During 1944 approximately 5,000 soldiers were stripped from the division and sent as replacements to other units in Europe. Division strength was eventually restored when the Army Specialized Training Program was terminated and its personnel were reassigned to Army Ground Forces. In July 1944 the division relocated to Camp San Luis Obispo, California. Under the supervision of the Navy and Marine Corps, the division began amphibious training and exercises at Camp Callan, Coronado Strand, San Clemente Island, San Nicolas Island and Camp Pendleton. In September 1944 the 97th was transferred to Camp Cooke, California, for further amphibious training. Because of the high number of American casualties during the Battle of the Bulge, all remaining divisions in the United States, including those already earmarked for the Pacific like the 97th Infantry Division, were ordered to the European Theater of Operations instead for the final assault on Germany. The strength of the division upon deployment in Europe was 600 officers and 14,000 men. *Overseas: 19 February 1945 for the ETO; *Returned to U.S.: 16 June 1945, from the ETO *Overseas: 28 August 1945, for the Pacific Theater, arriving 25 September 1945 in Yokohama *Campaigns: Central Europe *Days of combat: 41 (ETO) *Prisoners of war taken in the ETO: 48,796 *Inactivated: 31 March 1946 in Japan =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 979Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 188 *Wounded in action: 721 *Missing in action: 9 *Prisoner of war: 61 =Awards= *Medal of Honor - 1 (Joe R.

The division embarked on troopships in New York and landed at Le Havre, France on 2 March 1945, then moved to Camp Lucky Strike. After crossing France by troop train, the division passed through Maastricht and crossed the German border west of Aachen on 28 March, taking up a defensive position along the west bank of the Rhine River opposite D√ºsseldorf. As all bridges over the Rhine had been destroyed and the city was well-defended, the 97th was ordered to move south along the west bank of the Rhine, crossing over it near Bonn on 3 April and taking up a position on the southern bank of the Sieg River at Hennef. Ruhr pocket The division then entered the battle of the Ruhr pocket, crossing the Sieg river on 7 April, battling German Wehrmacht troops defending Schloss Allner.\\"Elimination of the Ruhr Pocket; XVIII Airborne Corps (First U. S. Army) 387th Infantry Regt, 97th Infantry Division.\\" Interview with Capt. Milton Ponitz and First Lt. Robert McCaffrey. According to the after action report: :\\"Machine-gun fire was strafing the crossing area from castle near ALLNER where it had a clear field of fire and from a wooded spur at a bend in the river W of the crossing, firing upriver toward the boats. Artillery fire, TD's, heavy MG fire and mortars were all brought to bear on this castle but although it crumbled, the MG fire continued. Fire was also coming from the high ground N of the river.\\" In two days the 922nd Field Artillery Battalion fired over three thousand 105mm rounds at the area around the castle.'B' Battery, 922nd F.A., 97th Infantry Division, WWII History. Pfc John Hedrick seized an abandoned assault boat while under heavy enemy fire and used the craft to help ferry troops across the river. He was awarded the Silver Star. After crossing the river, elements of the 387th Infantry Regiment assaulted the castle: :\\"The 2d Battalion hit very stiff resistance at the ALLNER Castle and on the ridge in the loop of the river. Anti-tank company and the TD's blasted the castle from the S bank of the SIEG River and G Company was able to clear it out.\\" Entering Siegburg on 10 April, troops again encountered heavy resistance at the Glockner works.The Story of the 97th Infantry Division, Orientation Branch.

Hastings of Company C, 386th Infantry Regiment, distinguished himself in action at Drabenderh√∂he, Germany while attacking an enemy position. According to his citation: :\\"[Hastings] rushed forward over 350 yards of open, rolling fields to reach a position from which he could fire on the enemy troops. From this vantage point he killed the crews of a 20mm gun and a machine gun, drove several enemy riflemen from their positions, and so successfully shielded the 1st Platoon that it had time to reorganize and remove its wounded to safety. Observing that the 3d Platoon to his right was being met by very heavy 40mm and machine gun fire, he ran 150 yards with his gun to the leading elements of that unit, where he killed the crew of the 40mm gun...[He then] advanced, firing his gun held at hip height, disregarding the bullets that whipped past him, until the assault had carried 175 yards to the objective...He was killed 4 days later while again supporting the 3d Platoon.\\" He received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions. On 14 April, intelligence officers from the 97th Division liberated approximately 800 prisoners of war, including 177 Americans, being held at a POW camp in Hoffnungstal, near Much, Germany. Pushing on toward D√ºsseldorf through difficult terrain and heavy resistance in densely wooded areas, the division captured Solingen on 17 April.The 97th Infantry Division During World War II D√ºsseldorf fell without much fighting the next day, after the German Resistance launched Aktion Rheinland, and the Ruhr pocket was eliminated by 21 April. Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp On 23 April elements of the 97th, together with members of the 90th Infantry Division, liberated Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp near Flo√ü in Bavaria. A military police patrol from the 303rd Infantry Regiment may have been the first U.S. Army unit to reach the camp, although the 2nd Cavalry Group, MechanizedFlossenburg and a colonel from the 90th Infantry Division later took credit for liberating the camp.Kurt Frank Korf, quoted in Patricia Kollander, I Must be a Part of this War: A German American's Fight against Hitler and Nazism, Fordham University Press, 2005.

While the 97th ARCOM was allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 97th Infantry Division and use its number, Department of the Army policy does not allow for the lineage of MTOE units, such as infantry divisions, to be perpetuated by TDA units, such as ARCOMs. Three medical units of the 97th were mobilized and deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In U.S. military Operations in Panama to oust dictator Manuel Noriega in 1989, the 97th deployed troops to neutralize key Panamanian Defense Forces positions on the Pacific side of the Canal Zone; civil affairs soldiers from the 97th later assisted in rebuilding the new Government of Panama.The Brigade: A History, Its Organization and Employment in the US ArmyRonald H.

It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk. Until the Noordoostpolder was drained, it was located on the coast of the Zuiderzee. Vollenhove received city rights in 1354. Later it was the main city in this region, that was formerly called Land van Vollenhove. Vollenhove was the summer residence of the bishop of Utrecht, the ruler of these parts. He lived in the castle Toutenburg, of which only some small ruins are left now. To be near their lord, quite some nobility moved to Vollenhove. They built their estates (Dutch: havezates) in the town, which was unique. Therefore, Vollenhove was called the city of palaces. Like Blokzijl, peat transport to Holland by ship caused the small city to flourish during the 17th century. Vollenhove was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became a part of Brederwiede. Between 1818 and 1942, the municipality was divided into two parts, Stad Vollenhove (the city) and Ambt Vollenhove (the countryside).Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \\"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\\", KNAW, 2006.  History  Vollenhove is already listed (as Fulnaho) in 944. The area was once a forest owned by Otto the Great. He gave Bishop of Utrecht Balderik permission to hunt there. In 1010 Emperor Henry II gave the area Sillva Fulnaho (Forest Vollenhove) to the bishop of Utrecht. In the 12th century, Bishop Godfried van Rhenen built a castle in the Almere, the Olde Huys, with a keep and a chapel. In the 14th century, the castle was repeatedly attacked by the Frisians from Stellingwerven. The village Op ten Camph was built around the castle. On 12 July 1354 it was given a city charter. After 1380 the city was designated as Vollenho. The heyday of the city Vollenhove was in the first half of the 15th century. Vollenhove was important because of the sturgeon fishing and was a bijstad of the League. Earthen walls and gates were also constructed to defend the city. In the first half of the 16th century the city flourished. Joris Schenck van Toutenburg became sheriff and later became governor of Overijssel for Karel the Fifth. Just outside the city Schenck built a castle called Toutenburg. This residence was the administrative center for the three northern provinces of Groningen, Friesland and Overijssel. Drenthe did not count because it was considered to poor. At the outbreak of the Eighty Years' War Vollenhove lost the role of administrative center, and in the following centuries, the town withered away. In 1818 was divided into Vollenhove City and Vollenhove office, the country that Vollenhove heard. In the second half of the 19th century Vollenhove flourished again briefly. The moat of the Olde Huys was fishing port and the castle was demolished. When in 1859 the island was evacuated Schokland, drew the most Schokkers in the midst of the remains of the castle. At the end of the 19th century, a new port was built and a specific fishing boat, the Vollenhovense sphere. The construction of the Dam (1932) came to an end the Zuiderzee fishing. Vollenhove was the beginning of World War II as a major port for the reclamation work of the northeast.

Corso Vollenhove takes place on the last Saturday of August. The parade has always thousands of visitors. There are about 12 floats with different subjects and roughly 100,000‚Äì200,000 flowers per float. Several quality marching bands from in and outside the Netherlands are contracted to play in the parade.  Trivia  The celebration of the 650-year anniversary as a city on 12 July 2004 was attended by Mr. Pieter van Vollenhoven, he is the husband of Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands. He was named an honorary citizen of the town. Incidentally, his surname has nothing to do with the town Vollenhove.

Cellos, often in groups of three or more, are used to create a sound, rhythm, and texture similar to that of familiar rock music, but distinctly reshaped by the unique timbres and more traditional genres of the cello (in particular) and other string instruments used. The cellos and other stringed instruments are often amplified and/or modified electronically, and often played in a manner imitative of the sound of electric guitars. They are often combined with other elements typical of rock music such as rock-style vocals and drumming. Cello rock can trace its beginnings back to the 1971 self-titled debut, known in the US as No Answer, by The Electric Light Orchestra which featured rock songs arranged for cellos, and the subsequent tour consisted of a standard rock band augmented by four cellos. Jeff Lynne made a return with this format using three cellos for their 2001 comeback album Zoom and its subsequent, but cancelled tour. Starting in 2001, the duo 2Cellos began releasing covers of many rock standards, such as AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\", and undertaking tours.

The unit is now one of the U.S. Army Reserve's training divisions, officially known as the 98th Training Division (Initial Entry Training). The 98th Training Division's current primary mission is to conduct Initial Entry Training (IET) for new soldiers. It is one of three training divisions subordinate to the 108th Training Command (IET). Following its initial organization in 1918, the 98th Training Division (IET) has experienced multiple cycles of activation, training, deployment and deactivation as well as substantial reorganizations and changes of mission. Since 1959, however, the 98th Training Division (IET) has been a unit of the U.S. Army Reserve with the primary mission of training Soldiers. Formerly headquartered in Rochester, New York with longstanding historical ties to New York and New England, the 98th Training Division (IET) was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia in 2012,98th Training Division moving from Rochester, N.Y. to Fort Benning , newspaper article by Ben Wright, correspondent for the Ledger-Enquirer (Columbus, GA), 4 Sep 2012.

World War I The 98th Division was activated at Camp McClellan, Alabama in October 1918, too late to see service in World War I. Only the headquarters was activated, demobilizing on 30 November 1918. Interwar period The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921 and assigned to the upstate portion of the state of New York. The headquarters was organized on 18 August 1921. World War II The 98th was ordered into active military service on 15 September 1942 at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, filling its ranks primarily with soldiers from New York and New England. A \\"triangular\\" division organized around a three-regiment core, the 98th spent the next eighteen months training at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, Camp Forrest, Tennessee and Camp Rucker, Alabama in anticipation of combat in the Pacific theater. =Order of battle= * Headquarters, 98th Infantry Division * 389th Infantry Regiment * 390th Infantry Regiment * 391st Infantry Regiment * Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 98th Infantry Division Artillery ** 367th Field Artillery Battalion ** 368th Field Artillery Battalion ** 399th Field Artillery Battalion ** 923rd Field Artillery Battalion * 323rd Engineer Combat Battalion * 323rd Medical Battalion * 98th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized) * Headquarters, Special Troops, 98th Infantry Division ** Headquarters Company, 98th Infantry Division ** 798th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company ** 98th Quartermaster Company ** 98th Signal Company ** Military Police Platoon ** Band * 98th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment Arriving in Oahu, Hawaii on 19 April 1944, the roughly 19,590 soldiers of the 98th relieved the 33rd Infantry Division of responsibility for the defense of the Hawaiian Islands and continued training for deployment to Asia. Slated as a participant in Operation Olympic, scheduled for 1 November 1945 as one of two planned invasions of Japan, the 98th was relieved of garrison duties by the 372nd Infantry Regiment on 15 May 1945 to train for that operation. However, the war drew to a close before the 98th was deployed to an active combat zone. Instead, the 98th Infantry Division arrived in Japan on 27 September 1945 and served in Osaka, Japan as part of the occupying force until 16 February 1946 when the unit was inactivated. Awards earned by 98th Infantry Division soldiers during this period include: Legion of Merit-1; Soldier's Medal-8; Bronze Star‚àí146. Commanding Generals during the World War II era were: *Major General Paul L. Ransom (September 1942 ‚Äì November 1943) *Major General George W.

Harper (November 1944 - 16 February 1946) Post World War II On 18 April 1947, the Iroquois Division was reactivated in Rochester, New York on reserve status and began training for combat in the new Cold War environment. It had been previously planned to be an airborne division. A note on the troop list nevertheless indicated that the unit was to be reorganized and redesignated as an airborne unit upon mobilization and was to train as such.John B. Wilson, Maneuver and Firepower , Chapter 8 The reorganization of 1 May 1959 redesignated the 98th Infantry Division as the 98th Division (Training) and set the unit on a course lasting to the present - training Soldiers. The regimental heritage was retained with the 389th, 390th and 391st Infantry Regiments organized as Basic Combat Training (BCT) regiments and the 392nd Infantry Regiment organized as an Advanced Individual Training (AIT) regiment. Additional changes occurred in 1968 with the movement toward a brigade-based structure: the 389th Infantry Regiment became the 1st Brigade (BCT), the 390th Infantry Regiment became the 2d Brigade (BCT) and the 392nd Infantry Regiment became the 3rd Brigade (AIT- Engineer), the only Engineer Pioneer training unit in the Army Reserve at the time. The 3rd Brigade/392nd Infantry Regiment was based in Hillcrest, New York and performed Engineer AIT training of Soldiers at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri during their annual two-week training periods throughout the Vietnam War. The changes of 1968 also ushered in the designation and training of Army Reserve Drill Sergeants, a significant and enduring innovation. Additional reorganization in 1994 redesignated the unit as the 98th Division (Institutional Training), a change in which the 98th retained its previous IET mission but also acquired the missions and force structure formerly associated with to the U.S. Army Reserve Forces schools. The 98th would maintain this basic organization and mission for the next 14 years. Post 9/11 On 3 September 2004, the 98th Division received mobilization orders for Operation Iraqi Freedom. This mobilization was to be the first overseas deployment for the unit since World War II. The mission, known as the Foreign Army Training Assistance Command (FA-TRAC), consisted primarily of training the new Iraqi Army and Iraqi security forces. An expeditionary force of more than 700 Iroquois warriors were trained and equipped at four sites: Camp Atterbury, Fort Bliss, Fort Hood and Fort Benning. The demands of Operation Iraqi Freedom required an accelerated training schedule which crammed as many warfighting skills as possible into a forty-one-day period. This was the 98th's first substantial exposure to the asymmetric battlefield, requiring training in counterinsurgency techniques and preparing to face an opponent who did not fight along traditional fronts. The 98th made full use of the 33,000 acres at Camp Atterbury and marched everywhere. It was at Camp Atterbury that the advisory support teams (later renamed military training teams), the heart of the FA-TRAC mission, transformed to cohesive units in long days. In fall 2004, the 98th Division arrived in Baghdad and filled the ranks of the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), the unit charged with assisting the Iraqi government in developing, training and equipping the new Iraqi security forces. The unit used its pool of drill sergeant and instructor expertise to train Iraqi soldiers and officers to prescribed standards under the constant threat of insurgent attack and under austere conditions. Instruction and support teams spread out across all points in Iraq from Al Kasik in the north to as far south as Umm Qasr. They established contact with Iraqi security units with the help of interpreters and helped build the six divisions of the new Iraqi Army. They also established officer and noncommissioned officer education schools at the Kirkush Military Training Base. They trained Iraqi police, the Highway Patrol, the special Police Commandos and the Iraqi Border Police. _Iroquois Warriors in Iraq_ , by Steven E.

In addition to a solo career and as a member of Planxty, O'Flynn recorded with: Christy Moore, D√≥nal Lunny, Andy Irvine, Kate Bush, Mark Knopfler, the Everly Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Mike Oldfield, Mary Black, Enya and Sin√©ad O'Connor. O'Flynn was acknowledged as Ireland's foremost exponent of the uilleann pipes and brought the music of the instrument to a worldwide audience. In 2007, O'Flynn was named Musician of the Year at the TG4 Gradam Ceoil Awards, considered to be the foremost recognition given to traditional Irish musicians. Early life He was born 15 April 1945 in Kill, County Kildare to musical parents. His father, Liam, was a teacher and fiddle player. His mother, Maisie (n√©e Scanlan), who came from a family of musicians from Clare, played and taught piano. From an early age, O'Flynn showed musical talent, and was encouraged to pursue his interest in the uilleann pipes by the piper Tom Armstrong. At the age of 11, he began taking classes with Leo Rowsome. He was also influenced by Willie Clancy and S√©amus Ennis. In the 1960s, he began to receive recognition of his talent, winning prizes at the Oireachtas Festival and the Fleadh Cheoil. During his early years, he was sometimes billed as Liam √ìg √ì Flynn. Music career In 1972, O'Flynn co-founded the Irish traditional music group Planxty alongside Christy Moore, Andy Irvine and D√≥nal Lunny and remained a member throughout the band's various incarnations. While Se√°n √ì Riada and The Chieftains had reinvigorated Irish traditional instrumental music in an ensemble format during the 1960s, Planxty built on that foundation and took it one step further. They brought a punch and vitality to acoustic music that drew heavily on O'Flynn's piping virtuosity. As O'Flynn grew in his skill as a musician and as he began to meet pipers like Willie Clancy and Seamus Ennis, he became acutely aware of his position in the tradition of piping. His subsequent close friendship with Seamus Ennis (which started as a Master/pupil relationship) taught him that there was much more to being a piper than playing tunes. Liam noted: \\"Seamus Ennis gave me much more than a bag of notes.\\" Following the break-up of Planxty in 1983, O'Flynn found work as a session musician with such prominent artists as the Everly Brothers, Enya, Kate Bush, Nigel Kennedy, Rita Connolly, and Mark Knopfler. He also worked on film scores, including Kidnapped (1979) and A River Runs Through It (1992). He was adventurous enough to work with avant-garde composer John Cage, but his most natural alliance was with neo- romantic composer Shaun Davey. The Bothy Band were natural successors to the original Planxty, and one of its members, Matt Molloy, who subsequently joined The Chieftains, played with The Chieftains' fiddler Se√°n Keane on O'Flynn's album, The Piper's Call, which was performed in the 1999 Proms season at the Royal Albert Hall.

Early life The son of Philo Bradley and Mercy Gardner Bradley, Bradley was born to humble beginnings in Berne, New York. He was the oldest of 12 children. He attended local schools and began teaching at the age of 16. In 1833, the Dutch Reformed Church of Berne advanced Joseph Bradley $250 to study for the ministry at Rutgers University. He graduated in 1836. After graduation, he was made Principal of the Millstone Academy, and decided to study law. He was persuaded by his Rutgers classmate Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen to join him in Newark and pursue legal studies at the Office of the Collector of the Port of Newark. He was admitted to the bar in 1839. Bradley began in private practice in New Jersey, specializing in patent and railroad law, and he became very prominent in these fields and quite wealthy. Bradley remained dedicated to self-study throughout his life and collected an extensive library. He married Mary Hornblower in Newark in 1844. Appointment to the Supreme Court As a commercial litigator, Bradley argued many cases before various federal courts, earning him a national reputation. Thus, when Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1869, creating a new seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, he was sufficiently well known by associates of President Grant to be recommended as a Supreme Court nominee. Bradley was nominated on February 7 and was confirmed by the Senate on March 21, taking his seat on the court as an Associate Justice that same day. On moving to Washington, Bradley purchased the home that had previously belonged to Stephen A. Douglas. Bradley remained on the bench until 1891, when he became greatly weakened by disease (possibly tuberculosis). He took his seat on the bench in October of that year, but was forced to retire a few weeks later by failing health. He died a few months later. Supreme Court jurisprudence Bradley took a broad view of the national government's powers under the Commerce Clause but interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment somewhat narrowly, as did much of the rest of the court at the time. He authored the majority opinion in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 but was among the four dissenters in the Slaughter-House Cases in 1873. His interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in both cases remained the basis for subsequent rulings through the modern era. Bradley concurred with the court's decision in Bradwell v. Illinois, which held that the right to practice law was not constitutionally protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bradley disagreed with the majority opinion, apparently because it rested on the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases, but concurred in the judgement on grounds that the clause did not protect women in their choice of vocation. The concurrence is noted for Bradley's description of womanhood: \\"The harmony, not to say identity, of interest and views which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and independent career from that of her husband (...) The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.\\" It was due to Bradley's intervention that prisoners charged in the Colfax Massacre of 1873 were freed, after he happened to attend their trial and ruled that the federal law they were charged under was unconstitutional. This resulted in the federal government's bringing the case on appeal to the Supreme Court as United States v. Cruikshank (1875). The court's ruling on this case meant that the federal government would not intervene on paramilitary and group attacks on individuals. It essentially opened the door to heightened paramilitary activity in the South that forced Republicans from office, suppressed black voting, and opened the way for white Democratic takeover of state legislatures, and resulting Jim Crow laws and passage of disfranchising constitutions. Bradley dissented in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota, which, though not racially motivated, was another due process case arising from the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissent, Bradley argued that the majority had in siding with the railroad created a situation where the reasonableness of an act of a state legislature was a judicial question, subjugating the legislature to the will of the judiciary. Bradley's opinion in this case is echoed in modern arguments regarding judicial activism. Bradley also wrote the opinion in Hans v. Louisiana, holding that a state could not be sued in a federal court by one of its own citizens. This is perhaps ironic in light of his dissent in the railroad case, since the Hans doctrine is entirely based on judicial activism and, as Bradley admitted in his opinion, not supported by the text of the Constitution. As an individual Supreme Court Justice, Bradley decided In re Guiteau, a petition for habeas corpus filed on behalf of Charles Guiteau, the assassin of President James A. Garfield. Guiteau's lawyers argued that he had been improperly tried in the District of Columbia because, although Guiteau shot Garfield in Washington, D.C., Garfield died at his home in New Jersey. Bradley denied the petition in a lengthy opinion and Guiteau was executed. 1876 Electoral Commission Bradley is best remembered as being the 15th and final member of the Electoral Commission that decided the disputed 1876 presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. A Republican since the early days of the party, Bradley was not an obvious first choice. The four justices charged with selecting the fifth and final justice (who, all realized, would be the deciding vote on the commission as all 14 other members were strictly partisan) initially chose justice David Davis for the job, but as Davis had just been elected to the United States Senate he was unable to join. The justices then settled on Bradley. The reasons for this are not entirely clear, though it is evident that Bradley was thought by his colleagues to be the most politically neutral; the court overall at that time had more Republicans than Democrats, however. Bradley wrote a number of opinions while on the electoral commission, and like the other members sided with his own party. The final 8-7 vote, which split along partisan lines, effectively made Hayes president, and Bradley was characterized in the press as the \\"casting vote\\", or tiebreaker. Democrats, who had hoped that Bradley might side with their candidate, focused their anger on him rather than on his fellow Republicans on the panel. Press reports that criticized the decision singled out Bradley for vilification, and he received a number of death threats. There have been detailed but unproven claims over the years that Bradley originally planned to come down on the side of Tilden, but was lobbied into changing his mind on the night before the final decision. These claims have been discussed at length in various studies of the electoral dispute. Bradley always denied that he had been improperly influenced by anyone. Death Bradley died in Washington, D.C., in 1892 and was interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Newark, New Jersey. Bradley's personal, legal, and court papers are archived at the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark and open for research.

It played a strategic role in the Battle of the Bulge when its inexperienced troops held fast on the northern shoulder of the German advance, refusing them access to the vital northern road network that led into Belgium. The 99th Readiness Division, also styled as 99th Division (Readiness), which the 99th Regional Support Command transitioned to in early 2018 which is the successor unit of the 99th Infantry Division, is a Major General command under the US Army Reserve Command (USARC). The command provides base operations support to all Army Reserve Soldiers, units, facilities and equipment for the entire Northeast Region of the Army Reserve, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine, Connecticut and New Hampshire. Base operations includes personnel administration, finance, facilities management, logistics management, maintenance, public affairs and legal support. The 99th Readiness Division is headquartered at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ. Although the 99th Readiness Division is allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia and use the number of the inactivated 99th Infantry Division, it does not perpetuate its lineage, nor is it entitled to the division's battle honors, as it is against DA policy for TDA organizations, such as Regional Support Commands, to be entitled to the lineage and honors of organizations such as divisions. World War I The 99th Division was constituted in Camp Wheeler, Georgia, on 23 July 1918. Plans called for the division to include the 393rd, 394th, 395th and 396th Infantry Regiments. Organization and training began in October, but were not complete by the time the war ended in November 1918, so the division was demobilized in early 1919. No division commander was appointed during the organization's brief existence. Interwar period The division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921 and assigned to the western half of the state of Pennsylvania. The division headquarters was organized in November 1921. World War II *Ordered into active military service: 15 November 1942 (After activation and initial training, many leaders participated in ASTP (Army Service Training Program, or \\"all safe 'till peace\\"), enrolled in various colleges/universities until ordered to deploy to Europe.) *Overseas: 30 September 1944 (nicknamed \\"Battle Babies\\" during the Battle of the Bulge, as they were new to the European Theater) *Campaigns: Rhineland, Ardennes- Alsace, Central Europe *Days of combat: 151 *Returned to U.S.: 17 September 1945 *Inactivated: 15 October 1945 =Order of battle= *Headquarters, 99th Infantry Division *393rd Infantry Regiment *394th Infantry Regiment *395th Infantry Regiment *Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 99th Infantry Division Artillery **370th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **371st Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) **372nd Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) **924th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm) * 324th Engineer Combat Battalion * 324th Medical Battalion * 99th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop (Mechanized) * Headquarters, Special Troops, 99th Infantry Division ** Headquarters Company, 99th Infantry Division ** 799th Ordnance Light Maintenance Company ** 99th Quartermaster Company ** 99th Signal Company ** Military Police Platoon ** Band *99th Counterintelligence Corps Detachment =Combat chronicle= ; Arrival in Europe Danube river near Eining, Germany The 99th Infantry Division, comprising the 393rd, 394th, and the 395th Infantry Regiments, arrived in England on 10 October 1944. Put under operational control of V Corps, First Army, it moved to Le Havre, France on 3 November and proceeded to Aubel, Belgium, to prepare to enter the front lines. ; Battle of the Bulge The division first saw action on 9 November, taking over the defense of the sector north of the Roer River between Schmidt and Monschau, a distance of nearly 19 miles. After defensive patrolling, the 99th probed the Siegfried Line against heavy resistance on 13 December. Formerly known as the Checkerboard Division, which referred to its shoulder patch, in late 1944 having not yet seen battle, it was nicknamed the Battle Babies. The US 99th Infantry Division, outnumbered five to one, inflicted casualties in the ratio of 18 to one. The division lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot. German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included more than 4,000 deaths and the destruction of 60 tanks and big guns. Historian John S.D. Eisenhower wrote, \\"... the action of the 2nd and 99th Divisions on the northern shoulder could be considered the most decisive of the Ardennes campaign.\\" The stiff American defense prevented the Germans from reaching the vast array of supplies near the Belgian cities of Li√®ge and Spa and the road network west of the Elsenborn Ridge leading to the Meuse River. After more than 10 days of intense battle, they pushed the Americans out of the villages, but were unable to dislodge them from the ridge, where elements of the V Corps of the First U.S. Army prevented the German forces from reaching the road network to their west. German Sixth Panzer Army attacked the United States' 99th Infantry Division, but could not dislodge them. The 99th Division's effective defense of the sector prevented the Germans from accessing the valuable road network and considerably slowed their timetable, allowing the Allies to bring up additional reinforcements. The inexperienced troops of the division were lodged on the northern shoulder of the Ardennes Offensive on 16 December. Although cut up and surrounded in part, the 99th was one of the only divisions that did not yield to the German attack, and held their positions until reinforcements arrived. The lines were then moved back to form defensive positions east of Elsenborn Ridge on the 19th. Here it held firmly against violent enemy attacks. From 21 December 1944 to 30 January 1945, the unit was engaged in aggressive patrolling and reequipping. It attacked toward the Monschau Forest, 1 February, mopping up and patrolling until it was relieved for training and rehabilitation, 13 February. ; Stand at Lanzerath The Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, 394th Infantry Regiment, 99th Division was the most decorated platoon for a single action of World War II. During the first morning of the Battle of the Bulge, they defended a key road in the vicinity of the Losheim Gap. Led by 20-year-old Lieutenant Lyle Bouck Jr., they delayed the advance of the 1st SS Panzer Division, spearhead of the entire German 6th Panzer Army, for nearly 20 hours. In a long fight with about 500 men of the 1st Battalion, 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, the 18 men of the platoon along with four artillery observers inflicted between 60 to more than 100 casualties on the Germans. The platoon seriously disrupted the entire German Sixth Panzer Army's schedule of attack along the northern edge of the offensive. At dusk on 16 December, after virtually no sleep during the preceding night and a full day of almost non- stop combat, with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining, about 50 German paratroopers finally flanked and captured the remaining 19 soldiers. Two who had been sent on foot to regimental headquarters to seek reinforcements were later captured. Fourteen of the 18 platoon members were wounded, while only one soldier, a member of the artillery observation team, was killed. Because the unit's radios had been destroyed, the soldiers captured, and the rapid subsequent German advance, U.S. Army commanders did not know about the unit's success at slowing the German advance, or even if they had been captured or killed. The platoon members were not recognized for their courageous deeds for thirty-seven years. On 25 October 1981, the entire platoon was recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation, and every member of the platoon was decorated, including four Distinguished Service Crosses, five Silver Stars, and ten Bronze Stars with V for Valor. ; Advance into Germany On 2 March 1945, the division took the offensive, moving toward Cologne and crossing the Erft Canal near Glesch. After clearing towns west of the Rhine, it crossed the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen on the 11th. The 99th Infantry Division was the first complete division to cross the Rhine. They continued to Linz am Rhein and to the Wied River. Crossing on the 23d, it pushed east on the Koln-Frankfurt highway to Giessen. Against light resistance it crossed the Dill River and pushed on to Krofdorf-Gleiberg, taking Giessen 29 March. The 99th then moved to Schwarzenau, 3 April, and attacked the southeast sector of the Ruhr Pocket on the 5th. Although the enemy resisted fiercely, the Ruhr pocket collapsed with the fall of Iserlohn, 16 April. The last drive began on 23 April. The 99th crossed the Ludwig Canal against stiff resistance and established a bridgehead over the Altmuhl River, 25 April. The Danube was crossed near Eining on the 27th and the Isar at Landshut, 1 May, after a stubborn fight. On 3 May and 4 May, the division liberated two labor camps and M√ºhldorf concentration camp, a sub camp of Dachau. The attack continued without opposition to the Inn River and Giesenhausen when VE-day came. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 6,553Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 993 *Wounded in action: 4,177 *Missing in action: 247 *Prisoner of war: 1,136 =Unit assignments= *4 November 1944: V Corps, First United States Army, 12th Army Group *18 December 1944: Attached to 2nd Infantry Division of the V Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group *20 December 1944: Attached, with the entire First Army, to the British 21st Army Group *7 January 1944: Relieved from attachment to the 2nd Infantry Division and assigned to V Corps, First Army (attached to the British 21st Army Group), 12th Army Group *18 January 1945: V Corps, First Army, 12th Army Group *20 February 1945: VII Corps *9 March 1945: III Corps *19 April 1945: III Corps, Third Army, 12th Army Group =Commendations and honors= *Distinguished Unit Citations: 2 *Distinguished Service Cross (United States)- 16 *Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)-1 * Silver Star- 252 *Legion of Merit- 6 *DFC- 7 *Soldier's Medal-8 *Bronze Star ‚Äì 2,127 *Air Medal- 48 *Medal of Honor-1 The Medal of Honor was awarded T/Sgt Vernon McGarity, Company L, 393rd Infantry, 99th Infantry Division, for actions taken near Krinkelt, Belgium, on 16 December 1944 during the opening phases of the Ardennes Offensive. When the Ardennes Offensive ended, Gen. Lauer received verbal commendations from Field Marshal Sir Bernard L. Montgomery, 21st Army Group Commander, and Gen. Courtney Hodges, First Army Commander, on the vigorous and effective defense contributed by the 99th. A written commendation was received from Maj. Gen. Leonard T. Gerow, V Corps Commander: =Commanding officers= *Maj. Gen. Thompson Lawrence (November 1942 ‚Äì July 1943) *Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer (July 1943 ‚Äì 18 August 1945) *Brig. Gen. Frederick H. Black (August 1945 to inactivation) Unit insignia The unit's distinctive shoulder patch consisted of a five-sided shield of black on which is superimposed a horizontal band of white and blue squares. The black represents the iron from the mills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where many of the troops were from. The blue and white are taken from the coat of arms for William Pitt for whom Pittsburgh was named. There are nine white squares and nine blue ones, signifying the number 99. Reactivation One 22 December 1967 the 99th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was activated. While the 99th ARCOM was allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 99th Infantry Division and use its number, Department of the Army policy does not allow for the lineage of MTOE units, such as infantry divisions, to be perpetuated by TDA units, such as ARCOMs. In 1975, the 99th ARCOM moved its headquarters to Oakdale, Pennsylvania. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, 22 99th units deployed to Saudi Arabia, Europe and other locations. After the Gulf War, the 99th ARCOM became the 99th Regional Support Command (RSC). The 99th RSC's mission was to provide command and control and full service support for assigned units and facility management. On 23 Dec. 1996, the 99th RSC mobilized the first of six units for deployment to Operation Joint Endeavor in support of peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. The 99th RSC continued to support operations in the Balkan Republics while providing refuge to those fleeing Kosovo as they sought temporary recovery in the United States. Following the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks, the 99th mobilized large numbers of Army Reserve Soldiers. While the 99th was fully involved in this large mobilization, the headquarters moved to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. In January 2003, the 99th RSC started mobilizing units for projected operations in Iraq. On 16 July 2003, the command was redesignated as the 99th Regional Readiness Command, placing additional emphasis on training, readiness and mobilization. The 99th RRC continued to provide command and control for assigned units and support for the ongoing deployments. In 2005, the Army Reserve began its latest transformation under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) directive and lessons learned from eight years of deployments in support of the Global War on Terrorism. The 10 geographically-based RRCs, including the 99th, were inactivated and replaced with four regional base operations commands. The 99th was selected as one of these new regional support commands. In September 2007, in preparation for the transition to Fort Dix and establishment of the new 99th RSC, the 99th RRC assumed administrative responsibility for the former regions of the 77th and 94th RRCs, which had inactivated. On 17 September 2008, the 99th Regional Support Command was activated at Fort Dix, N.J. The 99th RSC's mission was to provide base operations functions for the assigned 13-state Northeast Region. =Lineage= The U.S. Army Center of Military History states that the 99th RSC does not perpetuate the lineage and honors of the 99th Infantry Division. Army policy does not allow for the lineage and honors of a TO&E; organization, such as an infantry division, to be perpetuated by a TDA organization, such as an RSC. While an RSC is allowed to wear the insignia and use the same number of a previous infantry division, it is not entitled to its lineage and honors. = Hurricane Sandy= The 99th RSC was awarded The Army Superior Unit Award on 9 May 2016 by the US Army Human Resources Command for its role in the relief support after Hurricane Sandy, from 29 October 2012 thru 31 March 2013. Soldiers who were in direct support of the relief efforts were also awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal as a personal award.

World War II  The 106th Infantry Division's Headquarters and Headquarters Company was constituted on paper on 5 May 1942, five months after the United States entered World War II. It was actually activated on 15 March 1943 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, with a cadre from the 80th Infantry Division. Following Basic and Advanced Infantry Training, the Division moved on 28 March 1944 to Tennessee to participate in the Second Army No. 5 Maneuvers. The 106th Infantry Division relieved the 2nd Infantry Division in the Schnee Eifel on 11 December 1944, with its 424th Infantry Regiment was sent to Winterspelt. Prior to the battle, according to the US Army Service Manual, one division should be responsible for no more than of front.This can be inferred in FM 7-40, the Field Manual for Rifle Regiments. On page 154 it states that a regiment in a defensive position can defend a front of up to 4000 yards in \\"partially open, rolling terrain\\" but as little as 2000 yards in \\"broken, heavily wooded, terrain\\". Since the 106th was operating with the standard \\"2 in front, 1 in reserve\\" deployment of its regiments, a maximum of 8000 yards (4.5 miles) could be covered by the division. FM 7-40, The Rifle Regiment (1942-02-09) On the eve of the battle, the 106th, along with the attached 14th Cavalry Group was covering a front of at least .\\"The width of the sector held by the 106th Infantry Division and the attached 14th Cavalry Group was approximately eighteen air-line miles. When traced on the ground, the line these forces were responsible for defending was actually more than twenty-one miles in length.\\" In the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign, the Germans attacked the 106th on 16 December 1944. The division's 422nd and 423rd Infantry Regiments were encircled and cut off by a junction of enemy forces in the vicinity of Sch√∂nberg. They regrouped for a counterattack, but were blocked by the enemy. The two regiments surrendered on 19 December. The Germans gained 6,000 prisoners in one of the largest mass surrenders in American military history. Nearly 50% of the division's strength was brushed aside in the first days of the Battle of the Bulge. The remnants of the division were reinforced by the 112th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division and withdrew over the Our River and joined other units at Saint Vith. Along with the city of Bastogne to the south, St. Vith was a road and rail junction city considered vital to the German goal of breaking through Allied lines to split American and British forces and reach the Belgian port city of Antwerp. A scratch force of 106th Division personnel, in particular the division's 81st Engineer Combat Battalion, was organized and led by the 81st's 28-year-old commanding officer, Lt. Col. Thomas Riggs, in a five-day holding action (17‚Äì21 December) on a thin ridge line a mile outside St. Vith, against German forces vastly superior in numbers and armament (only a few hundred green Americans versus many thousands of veteran Germans). For this action, the 81st Engineer Combat Battalion was later awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for gallantry. The defense of St. Vith by the 106th has been credited with ruining the German timetable for reaching Antwerp, hampering the Bulge offensive for the Germans. The 81st and other units, including 168th Engineer Combat Battalion, pulled back from St. Vith on 21 December, under constant enemy fire, and withdrew over the Saint River at Vielsalm on 23 December. The following day, the 424th Regiment, attached to the 7th Armored Division, fought a delaying action at Manhay until ordered to an assembly area. From 25 December to 9 January 1945, the division received reinforcements and supplies at Anthisnes, Belgium, and returned to the struggle, securing objectives along the Ennal-Logbierme line on 15 January after heavy fighting. After being pinched out by advancing divisions, the 106th assembled at Stavelot on 18 January for rehabilitation and training. It moved to the vicinity of Hunningen on 7 February for defensive patrols and training. In March, the 424th advanced along the high ground between Berk and the Simmer River and was relieved on 7 March. A period of training and security patrolling along the Rhine River followed, until 15 March, when the division moved to St. Quentin for rehabilitation and the reconstruction of lost units. The division was reconstituted on 16 March when the 3rd Infantry Regiment (the Old Guard) and the 159th Infantry Regiment were attached to replace the two lost regiments. The division then moved back to Germany on 25 April, where, for the remainder of its stay in Europe, the 106th handled POW enclosures and engaged in occupational duties. In the meantime, the 422nd Infantry Regiment and the 423rd Infantry Regiment were reconstituted from replacements in France on 15 April, were attached to the 66th Infantry Division in training status, and were still in this status when the Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945. =Casualties= *Total battle casualties: 8,627Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Killed in action: 417Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Wounded in action: 1,278Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Missing in action: 235Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953) *Prisoner of war: 6,697Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistical and Accounting Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)  Order of battle  = Assigned units = 1942 (\\"Triangular\\") Organization * Headquarters, 106th Infantry Division * 422nd Infantry RegimentDestroyed in Schnee Eifel salient 19 December 1944 near Schonberg; rebuilt in France, but did not rejoin the division until 16 May 1945.

The daughter of Emperor Charles the Bald, she married the elderly King √Üthelwulf of Wessex as an adolescent and was crowned queen in contravention of the custom in Wessex. After √Üthelwulf's death in 858, Judith married his son and successor, √Üthelbald. Her marriage with her stepson, considered scandalous by her contemporaries, ended with his death in 860. Queen Judith then returned to her father, only to elope in 861 or 862 with the Flemish forester Baldwin. Having thus provoked her father's wrath, Judith and Baldwin went into exile. They were reconciled with Charles in late 862, after which Baldwin was granted the march of Flanders. Family background Judith was the eldest daughter of Charles the Bald, King of West Francia, and his first wife Ermentrude of Orl√©ans. Named after her paternal grandmother, Judith of Bavaria, her exact date of birth is uncertain, but her parents were married on 13 December 842, and Judith was their eldest child, born a little over a year later, probably in early 844. Queen of Wessex =Marriage and coronation= In 855, King √Üthelwulf of Wessex made a pilgrimage to Rome with his youngest son Alfred, who was about six years old. On the way back, in 856, he stayed at the court of Charles the Bald. Back in July, on the way to Rome, √Üthelwulf negotiated his marriage with Judith, who was twelve years old, while he was probably in his mid-fifties. It was a diplomatic alliance: both kings suffered from Viking attacks, and for √Üthelwulf, this union had the additional advantage of an alliance with the prestigious Carolingian dynasty. By contemporary and even modern historiography, the event was considered an extraordinary event: Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, and it was almost unknown for them to marry foreigners. The wedding took place on 1 October 856 at the royal palace of Verberie-sur-Oise. During the ceremony, who was celebrated by Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, the bride was put on a wedding ring and presented with magnificent gifts. Part of the ritual was Judith's coronation with the blessing of the archbishop. After the ceremony, she was anointed with myrrh. √Üthelwulf honored his bride by calling her queen after the ceremony.Annales Bertiniani The peculiarity of this step was that in Wessex it was not customary for kings' wives to be queens. According to their customs (described by Asser as \\"perverse and detestable\\") was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband‚Äîshe was merely the king's wife. However, all chroniclers pay attention to the fact that Charles the Bald insisted on the coronation of his daughter:Janet L. Nelson, √Üthelwulf, Oxford Online Dictionary of National Biography, 2004 Queen Judith Relating to Alfred the Great When a Child the Song of the Bards, Describing the Heroic Deeds of his Ancestors, by Richard Westall, 1801. Currently displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Judith was a \\"cultivated lady\\" like most Frankish princesses of the time, and her queenship probably brought the \\"aura of the Carolingian monarchy\\" to the court of Wessex. For Carolingian kings and queens was customary at that time being both crowned and anointed and Charles the Bald, with his insistence to made his daughter the first crowned Queen of Wessex, probably wanted to secure her position in her new home as the indisputable royal consort. It seems that since Judith, Wessex queen consorts weren't crowned for over a century. The next was √Ülfthryth, crowned by her husband, King Edgar the Peaceful, at Bath on 11 May 973. From that time onwards, queens were usually crowned with their husbands if they were already married, or separately if the marriage was contracted by the reigning king. With the coronation, the queens received official status. For centuries, the essence of the ceremony - anointing and wedding, accompanied by a solemn church service - remained unchanged. After the celebrations, √Üthelwulf with Judith and Alfred return to Wessex. But back in his kingdom, √Üthelwulf faced difficulties. His eldest surviving son, √Üthelbald, supported by Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, conspired to dethroned him. The marriage with Judith may have played a role in this conspiracy: √Üthelbald probably feared that his father's new young wife, the great-granddaughter of Charlemagne, will give birth to a higher-born heir than himself. In addition, some of the nobles were outraged that Judith was crowned and called queen, which was contrary to local custom. However, other Saxon Thans didn't agree to remove √Üthelwulf, because they did not want to participate in the riots. There is a version that √Üthelbald's rebellion was not provoked by his father's new marriage. According to this point of view, the prince rebelled against his father not because of his marriage, but before it. √Üthelwulf knew about this, stayed at the court of Charles the Bald and married his daughter for this very reason. The marriage with Judith was intended to demonstrate to his subjects that √Üthelwulf has strong supporters abroad. As a result, father and son negotiated a compromise under which √Üthelwulf received the eastern districts of the kingdom and √Üthelbald the western. It is not known whether this meant that √Üthelwulf took Kent and √Üthelbald Wessex, or whether Wessex itself was divided. Judith had no children from √Üthelwulf, who died on 13 January 858. =Controversial remarriage= Shortly after the death of √Üthelwulf, the new king, √Üthelbald, married his stepmother. By agreeing to this marriage, Judith may have tried to avoid the usual fate of dowagers - a nunnery. To √Üthelbald, this marriage gave weight due to Judith's belonging to the Carolingian dynasty and allowed him to enhance his status, put himself above his brothers and reign in the domain of his father. Judith's name appears in several charters during the reign of √Üthelbald, which confirms her exceptional queenly status. Her personal prestige also explains the marriage; according to Asser, who condemned this event in his Life of Alfred the Great: Asser's additional comment on the \\"great disgrace\\" was not reflected in the Frankish record of the event. Asser's assertion that marriage is contrary to even pagan practice is refuted by Bede's account of the marriage of King Eadbald of Kent his father's widow in 616 and the intervention of Augustine of Canterbury in front of Pope Gregory I with the question of the legality of Eadbald's marriage with his stepmother. As you can see, similar cases happened before. Obviously, the dowager queen was considered in some sense the embodiment of the rights of her deceased husband, and marriage to her allowed her to claim the kingdom. Judith was still childless when √Üthelbald died on 20 December 860, after a reign of two-and-a-half years. Countess of Flanders =Elopement= Meeting of Judith and Baldwin. Bruges seminary, Bruges. Baldwin I of Flanders and Judith by F√©lix de Vigne, 1849. Album du Cort√©ge des Comtes de Flandre, p.63 √Üthelbald's death left Judith with no future in Wessex. She was no more than seventeen years old, and she was still childless. According to the Annales Bertiniani and Flodoard, Presumably Charles the Bald was going to arrange another marriage for his daughter. Some historians have argued that neither Judith's first nor second marriage was consummated. There are also claims, more similar to legend, that the future count of Flanders, Baldwin (who according to tradition, would be the son of forester called OdoacreJacques Paul Migne, Nouvelle encyclop√©die th√©ologique, 1854, p. 919.), became interested in Judith even before her first marriage. But, most likely, Baldwin met Judith in 861, when he visited the monastery of Senlis; the Encyclopedia Britannica claims that Baldwin fell in love with the Wessex dowager queen during this visit.Baldwin I, Count of Flanders: Encyclopaedia Britannica Around Christmas 861 (or early 862) Judith either fled with Baldwin, or was kidnapped by him. According to the Annales Bertiniani, Judith was not abducted at all: there she is depicted not as the passive victim of bride theft but as an active agent, eloping at the instigation of Baldwin and apparently with her brother Louis the Stammerer's consent: Flodoard's description is similar: The couple probably even married in the same monastery of Senlis, before the elopement. =Excommunication= Judith's father was furious. He immediately organized search parties to bring her home and capture Baldwin. Flodoard mentioned the letter of Archbishop Hincmar to Bishop Hunger of Utrecht, where he informed Hunger about the Baldwin's excommunication because he had kidnapped Judith and married her without royal consent. Contemporary chronicles stated that in 862 Charles the Bald held a council with the bishops and nobles of his kingdom. According to Hincmar, the king ordered (or, according to Flodoard, asked) the bishops to pass a canonical verdict on Baldwin and Judith, according to the decrees of Pope Gregory II: ‚Äúif anyone marries, having kidnapped a widow, let him be anathematized himself, as well as those who contributed to this‚Äù. Judith's brother Louis was also punished: he was imprisoned in the abbey of St. Martin. Apparently, Baldwin and Judith firstly sought refuge with the Viking Rorik, ruler of Frisia, and later fled to the court of Judith's cousin Lothair II of Lotharingia for protection before going to Rome in order to plead their case to Pope Nicholas I. =Reconciliation= Having fled to Rome, Baldwin and Judith tried to come to terms with Pope Nicholas I and asked him to come out in their defense in the conflict with Charles the Bald. The Pope listened to their arguments and sent his legates to the King for negotiations: Bishops Radoald of Porto and John of Cervia. At the behest of the Pope, the legates asked Charles to recognize the marriage as legally binding and welcome the young couple into his circle; however, Charles and Hincmar were not easy to convince. In the end, in a letter dated 23 November 862, the Pope expressed to the king his fears that Baldwin, after his excommunication from the church, might joined forces with the \\"Jute prince Rorik\\". Rorik already fought against Charles the Bald on the side of his brother Lothair I, who after the conclusion of the Treaty of Verdun, tried to get rid of the dangerous assistant and imprisoned Rorik, accusing him of treason. Rorik fled and began to attack the Middle Francia kingdom. Unable to cope with the Vikings, Lothar I gave him Frisia on condition of protection from the rest of the Normans. According to Flodoard, in 863 According to the later chronicler Albert of Stade, was Bishop Hunger who turned to Rorik, urging him not to provide any support to Baldwin.

Baldwin I of Flanders and his wife Judith of France, by Jan van der Asselt, ca. 1372/73. Currently displayed at the Gravenkapel, Kortrijk, Belgium. Charles the Bald could do nothing, so in the end he reluctantly forgave the couple and allowed Judith and Baldwin to marry. They returned to France and were officially married at Auxerre on 13 December 862. The king did not want to be present (according to the Annales Bertiniani this happened in 863), but gave Baldwin the March of Flanders and shortly after Ternois, Waas and the lay abbacy of St. Peter of Ghent. Some scholars have suggested that the king had hoped for Baldwin's death by giving him land just south of the Scheldt river, a region who was frequently attacked by the Viking. Baldwin, however, managed the situation remarkably well: he succeeded in quelling the Viking threat (earning the nickname of \\"Iron\\" [Ferreum] from his contemporaries, which later generations replaced with the nickname \\"Iron Hand\\"), expanded both his army and his territory quickly, and became a faithful supporter of Charles the Bald. His possessions became known as the County of Flanders, one of the most powerful domains in France. In Flanders, Baldwin chose a small island for his residence, formed at the confluence of the Boterbeke and Roya rivers. From the earliest times there was a fortress, possibly built by Vikings and surrounded by a small number of huts. The Vikings gave this place the name \\"Bruggia\\" (Bryghia - a pier, a place for loading ships, brugge - a bridgehead). Not far from the confluence of the rivers there was a small ancient sanctuary, the construction of which was attributed to Saint Amandus. Upstream of Boterbeke there was a larger church who was said that it was built by Saint Eligius. The site had long since fallen into disrepair, and Baldwin built a new fortress with a residence, chapel, retinue houses and the a cathedral where the relics of Saint Donatian of Reims were placed. The residence of Baldwin and Judith stood on the site that is now occupied by the Palace of Justice and the Town Hall, and the cathedral was located on the north side of the current Palace of Justice. The residence was surrounded by a high wall with four gates, fortified with rising lattices and drawbridges. Remains of buildings from the time of Judith in Bruges remained, possibly in the Baptismal Chapel behind the crypt of St. Basil, and in this case they can be identified with the Amandus chapel. There was also a mint in the residence. The exact date of Judith's death is unknown. It is believed that this happened no earlier than 870. Between 893 and 899, her eldest surviving son, Baldwin II, married √Ülfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great. If Judith was alive, she probably was instrumental in the marriage negotiations due to her knowledge of the Wessex court as queen. Baldwin I died in 879 in the city of Arras. He was buried in Abbey of Saint-Bertin near Saint-Omer. Legacy Judith's marital history was considered scandalous and a violation of church prohibitions. But in the middle of the 10th century, she was described by the compilers of the genealogy of the counts of Flanders as \\"the wisest and most beautiful\\", who brought the Carolingian blood to the comital dynasty, while her scandalous stories were forgotten. Asser said that he expressed surprise to Alfred the Great at the lack of the status of the wives of the Wessex kings. In response, Alfred told him the story of Eadburh, daughter of Offa of Mercia, to explain why Wessex had no queens in the proper sense. Eadburh was queen as the wife of King Beorhtric. Eadburh's defiant behavior culminated in her alleged poisoning of her husband and subsequent escape to Charlemagne's court in search of protection. No doubt her story was embellished and exaggerated in the interests of later propaganda in Wessex against both Mercia and Beortrick, and to justify the limited role of royal wives. The anointing and coronation of Judith allowed to restore the status of queens and improve the position of the wives of the kings of Wessex. Issue From her marriage with Baldwin I of Flanders, Judith bore at least three sons:COUNTS of FLANDERS [863]-1128 in: Foundation for Medieval Genealogy (FMG) [retrieved 3 August 2020] * Charles (c. 864/865 ‚Äì died young), ostensibly named after his maternal grandfather. \\"Karolus brevis vite\\" is named as first of the three sons of Baldwin and Judith in the list of counts of Flanders recorded in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin.Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin, p. 11 It is assumed that Charles died young as no other reference to him has been found. * Baldwin (c. 865/867 ‚Äì c. 10 September 918).

This type of hitch will hold its place even when holding a substantial load on a smooth surface. One can even suspend from a tapered post (such as a marlinspike) with this knot (hence the name \\"icicle hitch\\").Brion Toss, The Complete Rigger's Apprentice (Camden: International Marine, 1998), 55‚Äì56. To tie an icicle hitch, bring the working end over the post, front to back, four or five times, working away from the end of the post (and the direction of expected pull). Bring the working end, back to front, alongside the standing end, leaving a substantial bight hanging behind the post. Bring this bight over both ends and over the end of the post. Tighten by pulling both ends perpendicular to the post. The pull on the standing end (running the direction of the post) will tighten the knot as more pull is given. This knot is similar to the Prusik knot and the Klemheist knot. This class of knots is a \\"slip-and-grip\\" friction type that will pull tight when the load is applied in the correct direction and slide easily for placement with no load. The Prusik knot can withstand load in both directions, making it ideal for climbing situations. Upon examination of the icicle hitch, one finds that it operates under the same principle as the Klemheist knot and is in fact the same knot tied only with a bight in the end instead of the more common short loop used for climbing. This knot was first demonstrated at the eighth Annual General Meeting of the International Guild of Knot Tyers in 1990.

It provides both franchised and non-franchised bus service. The franchised route network serves mainly Hong Kong Island, cross-harbour routes (between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon/New Territories), North Lantau (Tung Chung and Hong Kong Disneyland) and Hong Kong International Airport. The non-franchised routes serve mainly City One Sha Tin. It also provides bus rental services and staff bus services for some large companies such as TVB and China Light and Power. The company is wholly owned by Templewater Bravo, that also owns the third largest operator, New World First Bus.Citybus ‚Äì First Bus Company Structure, company website From 1984 to 2001 the company offered a cross- border service between Hong Kong and China using mainly Leyland Olympians, but this was discontinued due to stiff competition. However, in 2007, Citybus began operating route B3, which goes to Shenzhen Bay Port. History Citybus was founded on 5 August 1979 by former China Motor Bus employee Lyndon Rees with one Volvo B55 double deck bus, providing a shuttle service for the Hong Kong United Dockyard in Hung Hom. In 1981 it commenced operating a residential bus route between City One Shatin and Kowloon Tong MTR station.History New World First Bus In 1982, the United Transport group purchased a 49% shareholding.Hong Kong to buy British Commercial Motor 28 September 1985\\"Hong Kong Buses Part 2: Citybus Limited\\" Fleetline issue 248 May 1997 page 91 In 1984, Citybus began a cross-boundary coach service between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with ex National Trabel West and West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive Eastern Coach Works bodied Leyland Olympians. In 1985, the company introduced five air-conditioned Olympian coaches. Since then it has continued to expand its fleet of air-conditioned buses. In the late 1980s, Citybus was purchased by Tsui Tsin-tong's CNT Group. It commenced operating residential bus services with 100 new Olympians linking housing estates to MTR stations. In December 1990, Citybus launched Capital Citybus in London with an all- yellow livery for the routes in North and East London and a red and yellow livery for central London.From Hong Kong by bus Commercial Motor 10 January 1991The History of Ensignbus Ensignbus This was sold to FirstGroup in July 1998 and renamed First Capital.FirstGroup finds London bus firm is just the ticket The Herald 9 July 1998Tendered Bus Services Select Committee on Environment, Transport & Regional Affairs March 1999Annual Report Year Ended 31 March 1999 FirstGroup In 1991, the Hong Kong Government awarded Citybus its first franchised route, 12A (Admiralty Tamar Street to Macdonnell Road) on Hong Kong Island, which was originally operated by China Motor Bus and then withdrawn in the 1980s. In September 1993 Citybus took over 26 franchised routes from China Motor Bus after winning a competitive tender. These were branded as Network 26. To operate these a fleet of 101 Leyland Atlanteans was purchased from Singapore Bus Service. A further 14 franchised routes were awarded to the company in 1995 without tendering, with the fleet now expanded to more than 500 buses. During these years Citybus expanded its penetration of the Hong Kong Island market pushing nearly all China Motor Bus routes into low profitability. In 1996, with the Tsing Ma Bridge coming into operation and commencement of settlement in the Tung Chung new town, Citybus won another tender to operate 13 new franchised routes serving Tung Chung and the new Hong Kong International Airport. In 1998 the airport Cityflyer service commenced, which is part of Citybus and is solely used for Airport express routes to the city. The Cityflyer service consisted of a series of four routes: A11, A12, A21 and A22, with A10 being added in 2006. Citybus also operates various Overnight Airport routes and Airport Shuttle Routes. In 1998, following the expiry of the franchise of China Motor Bus, a further 12 routes were transferred to Citybus. Citybus's fleet was up to 1,100 buses. The remaining routes of China Motor Bus were transferred to a new operator, New World First Bus. Its business was expanded into mainland China with a joint venture operation in Beijing through Citybus (China) Limited. It was not only Beijing's first joint venture bus operation, but it also marked the introduction of air-conditioned buses for the first time in the capital city. Following the success of this route, a second urban express coach route was introduced in Beijing. However, the services in Beijing were terminated shortly after the disposal of shares of Citybus (China) Limited from Citybus to Kingsman Global Limited, another Hong Kong company, in June 2004. Citybus had also once operated a route (route 658) in Tianjin. The service is now operated by another company after Citybus disposed all its interest in Citybus (China) Limited. In July 1999, Citybus was purchased by Stagecoach Group of Scotland.Stagecoach enters Hong Kong BBC News 18 January 1999 In 2001, the cross-boundary coach service between China and Hong Kong was discontinued.

It is just north of the border with the United States state of Alaska, near the Alaskan port of Skagway. The narrow-gauge White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad connects the community of Bennett at the south end of the lake with Skagway further south and Whitehorse, Yukon on the north. It runs between Skagway and Fraser, British Columbia during the summer months. The abandoned town of Bennett, British Columbia, historically usually referred to as Lake Bennett or Bennett Lake and the town of Carcross, Yukon are on the shores of Bennett Lake. History During the Klondike Gold Rush, Bennett Lake was where the gold-seekers who had crossed the Coast Mountains from Skagway or Dyea, carrying their goods over the Chilkoot Trail or the White Pass, purchased or built rafts to float down the Yukon River to the gold fields at Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. A large tent city sprang up on its shores, numbering in the thousands and offering all the services of a major city. In late May 1898, the North-West Mounted Police counted 778 boats under construction at Lindeman Lake (located a difficult portage above Bennett Lake), 850 in Bennett and the surrounding area, and another 198 at Caribou Crossing (now Carcross) and Tagish Lake to help transport thousands of goldfield-bound travellers.

Following the Union victory in the Battle of Lookout Mountain on November 24, Union forces in the Military Division of the Mississippi under Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Missionary Ridge and defeated the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Gen. Braxton Bragg, forcing it to retreat to Georgia. In the morning, elements of the Union Army of the Tennessee commanded by Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman attempted to capture the northern end of Missionary Ridge, Tunnel Hill, but were stopped by fierce resistance from the Confederate divisions of Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, William H.T. Walker, and Carter L. Stevenson. In the afternoon, Grant was concerned that Bragg was reinforcing his right flank at Sherman's expense. He ordered the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas, to move forward and seize the Confederate line of rifle pits on the valley floor, and stop there to await further orders. The Union soldiers moved forward and quickly pushed the Confederates from the first line of rifle pits but were then subjected to a punishing fire from the Confederate lines up the ridge. At this point, the Union soldiers continued the attack against the remaining lines, seeking refuge near the crest of the ridge (the top line of rifle pits were sited on the actual crest rather than the military crest of the ridge, leaving blind spots). This second advance was taken up by the commanders on the spot, but also by some of the soldiers who, on their own, sought shelter from the fire further up the slope. The Union advance was disorganized but effective; finally overwhelming and scattering what ought to have been, as General Grant himself believed, an impregnable Confederate line. In combination with an advance from the southern end of the ridge by divisions under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, the Union Army routed Bragg's army, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, ending the siege of Union forces in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Background = Military situation = thumbupright=1.5Federal supply lines and Wheeler's October 1863 raid After their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga, the 40,000 men of the Union Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga. Confederate General Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. Bragg's troops established themselves on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, both of which had excellent views of the city, the Tennessee River flowing north of the city, and the Union supply lines.McDonough, pp. 76-94; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 158-67; Connelly, pp. 258-51; Kennedy, p. 242; Korn, pp. 90-94; Eicher, pp. 602-03; Esposito, map 116; Cozzens, pp. 61-65, 72-73, 80-101. Heavy rains began to fall in late September, washing away long stretches of the mountain roads. On October 1, Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler's Confederate cavalry intercepted and severely damaged a train of 800 wagons--burning hundreds of the wagons, and shooting or sabering hundreds of mules--at the start of his October 1863 Raid through Tennessee to sever Rosecrans's supply line. Toward the end of October, typical Federal soldiers' rations were \\"four cakes of hard bread and a quarter pound of pork\\" every three days.Eicher, pp. 577-90; Lamers, pp. 375-76; Korn, pp. 78-80; Cozzens, pp. 11, 17-19; Esposito, map 115; Eicher, pp. 596, 600. The Union Army sent reinforcements: Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker with 15,000 men in two corps from the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman with 20,000 men from Vicksburg, Mississippi. On October 17, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant received command of three Western armies, designated the Military Division of the Mississippi; he moved to reinforce Chattanooga and replaced Rosecrans with Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas.McDonough, pp. 49-54; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 151; Smith, pp. 264-65; Lamers, p. 393; Eicher, p. 595; Korn, pp. 83-89; Cozzens, pp. 18, 2-6; Esposito, map 115. Thomas launched a surprise amphibious landing at Brown's Ferry on October 27 that opened the Tennessee River by linking up his Army of the Cumberland with Hooker's relief column southwest of the city, thus allowing supplies and reinforcements to flow into Chattanooga over what was called the \\"Cracker Line.\\" In response, Bragg ordered Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to force the Federals out of Lookout Valley. The ensuing Battle of Wauhatchie (October 28-29) was one of the war's few battles fought exclusively at night. Sherman arrived with his 20,000 men of the Army of the Tennessee in mid-November. Grant, Sherman, and Thomas planned a flanking attack on Bragg's force, with an assault by Sherman against the northern end of Missionary Ridge, supplemented by two of Thomas' divisions from the center. Hooker, instead of attempting to capture Lookout Mountain and then move across the Chattanooga Valley to the break in the ridge at Rossville, Georgia, was to do nothing besides forwarding troops toward the center.Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 172; McDonough, pp. 108-09; Kennedy, p. 245; Liddell Hart, pp. 213-14. Running behind schedule, Sherman's force was ready to cross the Tennessee River early on November 24. The day before, Grant ordered Thomas to advance halfway to Missionary Ridge on a reconnaissance in force to determine the strength of the Confederate line, hoping to ensure that Bragg would not withdraw his forces and move in the direction of Knoxville, Tennessee, where Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was being threatened by a Confederate force under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. Thomas sent over 14,000 men toward a minor hill named Orchard Knob and overran the Confederate defenders. Grant changed his orders and instructed Thomas's men to dig in and hold the position.McDonough, pp. 110-13; Cozzens, pp. 128-35; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 180. Surprised by Thomas's move and realizing that his center and right might be more vulnerable than he had thought, Bragg quickly readjusted his strategy. Bragg assigned Col. Warren Grigsby's brigade of Kentucky cavalry to picket the Tennessee River northeast of Chattanooga and ordered Brig. Gen. Marcus Joseph Wright to bring his brigade of Tennessee infantry from Cleveland, Tennessee, by train to Chickamauga Station. He recalled all units he had recently ordered to Knoxville if they were within a day's march. Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division returned after dark from Chickamauga Station, interrupting the process of boarding the trains. Bragg began to reduce the strength on his left by withdrawing Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker's division from the base of Lookout Mountain and placing them on the far right of Missionary Ridge, just south of Tunnel Hill. He assigned Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee to command his now critical right flank, turning over the left flank to Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson. Bragg's concern for his right proved justified and his decisions were fortuitous. In the center, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge ordered his men to begin fortifying the crest of Missionary Ridge, a task that Bragg had somehow neglected for weeks. Unable to decide whether to defend the base or the crest of the Ridge, the divisions of Brig. Gens. William B. Bate and J. Patton Anderson were ordered to move half of their divisions to the crest, leaving the remainder in the rifle pits along the base. James L. McDonough wrote of the upper entrenchments, \\"Placed along the physical crest rather than what is termed the military crest ... these works severely handicapped the defenders.\\"McDonough, pp. 124-28, 183; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 181, 196-97; Korn, p. 143; Connelly, pp. 270-72; Cozzens, pp. 140-42; O.R.

Sherman's force crossed the Tennessee River successfully in the morning then took the set of hills at the north end of Missionary Ridge, although he was surprised to find that a valley separated him from the main part of the ridge. Alerted by Grigsby's cavalry that the enemy had crossed the river in force, Bragg sent Cleburne's division and Wright's brigade to challenge Sherman. After skirmishing with the Confederates, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on the hills he had seized. Cleburne, likewise, dug in around Tunnel Hill.Woodworth, Nothing but Victory, pp. 468-69; McDonough, 117-24; Liddell Hart, p. 215; Cozzens pp. 148-50. At the same time, Hooker's command succeeded in the Battle of Lookout Mountain and prepared to move east toward Bragg's left flank on Missionary Ridge. The divisions of Stevenson and Cheatham retreated behind Chattanooga Creek, burning the bridges behind them.McDonough, pp. 137-40, 160; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 187-88; Korn, pp. 131-36. On the night of November 24, Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand and fight. Cleburne, concerned about what Sherman had accomplished, expected Bragg to retreat. Hardee also counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight it out on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the right wing to assist in repelling Sherman.Cozzens, p. 196; McDonough, p. 182; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 188-90. Opposing forces =Union= Grant's Military Division of the Mississippi assembled the following forces at Chattanooga:Eicher, pp. 601-02. * The Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, consisting of the XV Corps under Maj. Gen. Francis Preston Blair Jr., and the 2nd Division of the XVII Corps under Brig. Gen. John E. Smith. * The Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas, consisting of the IV Corps under Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, and the XIV Corps under Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer. * The command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, which had become part of the Army of the Cumberland by this point, consisting of the XI Corps under Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard and the 2nd Division of the XII Corps under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary. (Starting with the Battle of Lookout Mountain, Hooker effectually commanded Geary's division of the XII Corps and a division each detached from the IV and XV Corps.) =Confederate= Bragg's Army of Tennessee had the following forces available in Chattanooga:Eicher, p. 602. * Hardee's Corps, under Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee, consisting of the divisions under Brig. Gen. John K. Jackson (Cheatham's Division), Brig. Gen. James Patton Anderson (Hindman's Division), Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist (Walker's Division), and Maj. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner (detached November 22 to Knoxville). * Breckinridge's Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Patrick Cleburne, Alexander P. Stewart, Carter L. Stevenson, and Brig. Gen. William B. Bate (Breckinridge's Division). During the battle, Cleburne's division operated under Hardee's control. On November 5, Bragg had seriously weakened his forces by sending Longstreet's Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, with the divisions of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws and Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins (Hood's Division), against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside near Knoxville. On November 22, Bragg had further weakened his forces by ordering Buckner's division to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville.Eicher, p. 602; Cozzens, pp. 104, 125. Battle Battles of Chattanooga, November 24-25, 1863 On November 25, Grant's plan concentrated on the attack by Sherman against Bragg's right flank at Tunnel Hill. He gave a supporting role to Thomas: Grant had no particular expectation for Hooker other than to divert Bragg's attention by continued demonstrations on Lookout Mountain, which had been evacuated by the Confederates. However, Thomas wanted support on his flank and called Hooker to cross the valley and demonstrate against Bragg's left flank directly at the Rossville Gap.Cozzens, pp. 200-03. =Sherman at Tunnel Hill= In a letter to his brother, Sherman wrote: Sherman had about 16,600 men in the three divisions of Brig. Gens. Morgan Lewis Smith, John E. Smith, and his foster brother and brother-in-law Hugh Boyle Ewing, and three regiments of Col. Adolphus Buschbeck's brigade from the XI Corps. Sherman also had Jefferson C. Davis's division guarding his rear. Around ten o'clock that morning, Grant dispatched the rest of Howard's XI corps from Thomas to Sherman. Hardee had about 9,000 Confederates in the divisions of Cleburne and Walker with another 4,000 soon to arrive in Stevenson's division. On Hardee's left, Benjamin F. Cheatham's decimated division occupied the ridge between Thomas' and Sherman's fronts. However, at dawn, when Sherman was supposed to attack, he was opposed by just three small brigades under Cleburne--about 4,000 men--and only the Texas brigade of Brig. Gen. James A. Smith was actually positioned on Tunnel Hill. But seemingly unnerved by his incorrect positioning, Sherman delayed until about 9:00 o'clock. He selected just two brigades from Ewing's division to attack. Brig. Gen. John M. Corse would approach from the north, Col. John M. Loomis from the northwest, across the open fields between the railroads.Eicher, p. 601; McDonough, p. 145; Korn, pp. 137-38; Cozzens, pp. 204-05. Sherman ordered Corse's brigade, with a detachment from Joseph A.J. Lightburn's brigade, to attack along the narrow length of Tunnel Hill. Col. John M. Loomis's brigade, supported by Buschbeck, would move across the open fields on the west of the ridge while Brig. Gen. Giles Alexander Smith's brigade would move through the valley on the east side of the ridge. The brigades of Brig. Gen. Charles L. Matthies and Col. Green Berry Raum were held in reserve to follow up any successful attack; the brigades of Cols. Joseph R. Cockerill and Jesse I. Alexander would hold the heights seized the day before. Corse drove off the Confederate skirmish line and seized some half-built defensive works at the north end of Tunnel Hill. Continuing over the crest of the hill, Corse charged Cleburne's main position but was repulsed.McDonough, pp. 144-49; Woodworth, Nothing But Victory, pp. 472-73; Korn, pp. 138-39; Cozzens, pp. 207-13; Korn, p. 138. After several attempts, Sherman gave up on attacking from Corse's position and the fighting shifted to the west side of the ridge.Korn, p. 139; Woodworth, Nothing But Victory, p. 474; Korn, p. 139; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 191; Cozzens, pp. 214-16. Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker's division. Buschbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne's salient began to feel the pressure and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson's division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman's men, who were too tired and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.Korn, p. 140; Woodworth, Nothing But Victory, pp. 475-76; McDonough, pp. 152-56; Cozzens, pp. 223-41. Sherman's attack came to a halt, a tactical failure in which he lost almost 2,000 casualtiesKorn, p. 141. but committed only a fraction of his available force in a direct assault on a strong position, rather than attempting to outflank Bragg. Military historian David Eicher called this Sherman's \\"worst experience as a commander, first miscalculating the terrain and then stumbling through a prolonged, unsuccessful, and needless attack.\\" On the other hand, Steven E. Woodworth judged that \\"Cleburne was in fine form today, deftly shifting troops around his hilltop position and skillfully judging when and where to launch limited counterattacks--often leading them himself.\\"Eicher, p. 610; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 191-92; McDonough, p. 159; Cozzens, p. 241. An alternative view has been expressed by B. H. Liddell Hart, who contends that Sherman did not commit his entire force because he was expecting Bragg to attack him to dislodge the Union force from a threatening position. He \\"gave the Confederates several hours in which to attack them and when he saw that they showed no signs of accepting the invitation, he made it more pressing by launching three brigades against their position. But his real desire is unmistakably established by the fact that he kept three brigades to hold his own ridge, with five more in reserve behind.\\"Liddell Hart, pp. 219-20. =Thomas's assault on the Confederate center= Battle of Chattanooga --Gen. Thomas' charge near Orchard Knob, November 24, 1863,The date in the title of the painting is inaccurate. There was an action advancing to Orchard Knob on November 23 and further action starting from Orchard Knob on November 25 (the Battle of Missionary Ridge), but no action on November 24. 1888 lithograph by Kurz and Allison thumbupright=1.5Battle of Missionary Ridge, November 25, 1863 Battle of Chattanooga by Thure de Thulstrup. Ulysses S. Grant uses a field glass to follow the Union assault on Missionary Ridge. Grant is joined by Generals Gordon Granger (left) and George H. Thomas. At around 2:30 p.m., Grant spoke with Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, a classmate of his from West Point. \\"General Sherman seems to be having a hard time,\\" Grant observed. \\"It seems as if we ought to go help him.\\"Cozzens, pp. 246-47. He decided to send Wood's and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan's divisions against the Confederate rifle pits at the base of the ridge, hoping to concern Bragg and relieve the pressure on Sherman. Grant suggested his idea to Thomas, but personal relations between the two generals were chilly during the campaignWoodworth, Six Armies, p. 194. and Thomas rebuffed Grant's idea--he had no intention of attacking until he was assured that Hooker was successfully attacking the enemy's flank. Meanwhile, IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger was nearby, completely absorbed in the activities of a battery of artillery.McDonough, pp. 162-64; Catton, Grant Takes Command, p. 79; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 195; Cozzens, p. 247. Irritated, Grant asked Thomas to order Granger to \\"take command of his own corps. And now order your troops to advance and take the enemy's first line of rifle pits.\\"Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 194-96; Cozzens, p. 247. At 3 p.m. Thomas passed the order to Granger, but incredibly, Granger ignored the order and resumed commanding the battery of artillery. After a further scolding from Grant, Granger finally issued orders to Wood and Sheridan. Messengers also went to Brig. Gens. Absalom Baird and Richard W. Johnson of Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer's XIV Corps, ordering them to move upon hearing the rapid, successive discharge of six artillery pieces.Catton, Grant Takes Command, p. 80; Cozzens, pp. 247-48. Thomas deployed 23,000 men in four divisions with brigades in line--from left to right (north to south), the divisions of Baird (brigades of Col. Edward H. Phelps, Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer, and Brig. Gen. John B. Turchin), Wood (brigades of Brig. Gens. Samuel Beatty, August Willich, and William Babcock Hazen), Sheridan (brigades of Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner, Col. Charles Garrison Harker, and Col. Francis Trowbridge Sherman), and Johnson (brigades of Col. William L. Stoughton and Brig. Gen. William Carlin). Each brigade consisted of two lines, one behind the other, with skirmishers leading the way.Cozzens, pp. 262, 266-67; McDonough, p. 168; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 196. There were about 20,000 Confederates defending the center of the ridge against which Thomas's men marched, overlapping the Union approach on both ends. From right to left (north to south) were Cheatham's division (brigades of Brig. Gens. Edward C. Walthall, John C. Moore, and John K. Jackson), Hindman's division (commanded by Brig. Gen. J. Patton Anderson, brigades of Brig. Gens. Alfred J. Vaughan, Zachariah C. Deas, and Arthur M. Manigault), Breckinridge's division (commanded by Brig. Gen. William B. Bate, brigades of Brig. Gen. Joseph H. Lewis, Col. R. C. Tyler, and Brig. Gen. Jesse J. Finley), and Stewart's division (brigades of Col. Randall L. Gibson, Brig. Gen. Otho F. Strahl, Brig. Gen. Marcellus Augustus Stovall, and Col. James T. Holtzclaw).Cozzens, pp. 262, 266-67; McDonough, pp. 174, 185, 228. At about 3:40 p.m.,Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 196; Cozzens, p. 262. 3:40 was the recollection of Granger, although other accounts say as early as 3 p.m. and as late as 4. the signal guns fired before Baird could brief Turchin. Some regimental officers claimed to get conflicting orders from the same brigadier. When asked where he was to stop, Willich told one officer, \\"I don't know. At Hell, I expect.\\"Cozzens, p. 261. Sheridan sent an orderly back to Granger inquiring whether the objective was the base or the top of the ridge, but the signal guns fired before he got an answer. Wagner, Turchin, and Carlin thought they were supposed to carry the ridge top. Most officers were guided only by what the units on either side of them did.Cozzens, pp. 262, 265, 268; Catton, Grant Takes Command, p. 82; McDonough, pp. 165-66, 168-69, 176-78; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 197-98. The 9,000 ConfederatesWoodworth, Six Armies, p. 197. holding the rifle pits at the base of the ridge were also plagued by conflicting orders. Some were ordered to fire a volley then retreat, others to hold their ground. Those who stayed to fight were swamped by the superior Union numbers. The Union tide was irresistible, with charging men shouting, \\"Chickamauga! Chickamauga!\\"McDonough, p. 179; Korn, p. 147. Many of the Confederates were captured while the rest started the 300-400-foot climb to the ridge top in fear of being shot in the back. Those who escaped were completely winded by the effort and in no shape to defend themselves for several minutes.Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 196-97; Cozzens, pp. 268-70. The 100 Confederate cannons lining the top of the ridgeMcDonough, pp. 171-72. initially hit few of their enemies during the Union rush, but once the Union soldiers stopped at the rifle pits, they began to zero in on them. The Confederate riflemen also poured in their fire causing several Union casualties. After several minutes, some Union unit commanders moved their men forward to get out of the worst fire. Willich's skirmishers started advancing up the ridge without orders. Deciding that following them was preferable to being massacred in the rifle pits, Willich gave orders to advance, although several of his units were already doing so. Seeing this, Hazen and Beatty also ordered their first lines up. When Wood reached the rifle pits, the men in the second line begged him to order them up as well. Wood sent them forward.Cozzens, pp. 270-76; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 200. Grant was shocked when he saw the Union troops climbing the ridge. He asked first Thomas then Granger who had given the orders. Neither general claimed responsibility, but Granger replied, \\"When those fellows get started, all hell can't stop them.\\"Cozzens, p. 282. Granger then sent a courier to Wood allowing him permission to take the ridge top, if he thought it possible. Several messengers went out at about this time with differing orders, leading to more confusion.McDonough, p. 167; Eicher, p. 612; Korn, pp. 145-46; Cozzens, pp. 282-83. On the far left, Phelps and Van Derveer captured the rifle pits and held their position. Having negotiated some rough ground, Turchin's brigade lagged behind. But as soon as his men overran the rifle pits, the \\"Mad Russian\\" immediately urged his men up the ridge. Before Baird could send his other two brigades, he received an order to halt.Cozzens, pp. 280-81. Wagner's and Harker's men started climbing soon after Wood's brigades. Wagner got halfway up before he received an order that he was to stop at the base of the ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner's brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault.McDonough, p. 177; Cozzens, pp. 283-84. Hazen's brigade was the second hardest hit and together with Wagner's suffered about 40% of all of the Union casualties assaulting Missionary Ridge (McDonough, p. 194). When Wagner and some of Harker's men returned to the rifle pits, they saw that Wood's division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second line up the ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up also. To their right, Francis Sherman's brigade faced an entrenched line about one-half of the way up the ridge and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson's two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits and were slow in starting up the ridge.Cozzens, pp. 278-79. The Confederate line first cracked at Bird's Mill Road, at about 5 p.m.Cozzens, p. 291. One of Willich's regiments, joined by two of Hazen's, worked its way within 50 yards of the Confederate breastworks. Protected by a roll of ground, they crept closer, then with a rush they leaped over the works belonging to Col. William F. Tucker's brigade. Surprised, the nearest defenders surrendered or fled for their lives. Alertly, the Union field officers swung their regiments to the right and left and began rolling up the Confederate line. Tucker bravely rallied his men, but by this time Willich and Hazen's men were flooding over the breastworks.Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 200; Cozzens, pp. 294-95. Since Bragg had not provided for a tactical reserve and the narrow ridgetop left no place for one, his defenses were only a thin crust. To seal off the breach, the Southern generals were placed on the horns of a dilemma. When they found Union troops on their flank, they had to pull regiments out of their defense line for a counterattack. This weakened the main line of resistance just as the Union brigades to their front were swarming up to the crest.McDonough, p. 205; Cozzens, p. 390; Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 197, 201. Once atop the ridge, Hazen swung his brigade south. The Confederate lines in this direction were held by Brig. Gen. Alexander W. Reynolds's brigade, whose men had to endure a hard climb from the base of the ridge. Hit in front and flank, most of Reynolds's tired men melted away. Continuing south, Hazen flanked Col. R. C. Tyler's brigade of Bate's division out of position, allowing Wagner's brigade to reach the crest. Bate's Florida brigade was soon driven away, allowing Harker's men to reach the top. Col. Randall L. Gibson's brigade was defeated by Francis Sherman's men. Dogged by tough resistance and very steep slopes, Johnson's two brigades took the longest to climb the ridge, Carlin's men finally reaching the top around 5:30 p.m. Seeing that his position was hopeless, Stewart pulled the brigades of Brig. Gens. Otho F. Strahl and Marcellus A. Stovall off the ridge.Cozzens, pp. 301-13. Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to the north and began crushing the flank of Anderson's division. Willich's success assisted Beatty's brigade to get to the top. The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault's men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing down on them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson's entire division and Cheatham's left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall's brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.Cozzens, 1994, pp. 320-42. The Army of the Cumberland's ascent of Missionary Ridge was one of the war's most dramatic events. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones contend that the Battle of Missionary Ridge was \\"the war's most notable example of a frontal assault succeeding against entrenched defenders holding high ground.\\"Hattaway and Jones, p. 461. A Union officer remembered that By 6 p.m., the center of Bragg's line had broken completely and fled in panic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat eastward to South Chickamauga Creek. The sole exception to the panicked flight was Cleburne's command, his division augmented by two brigades from another division. As the only command not in complete disarray, it was the last unit to withdraw and formed the rearguard of Bragg's army as it retreated eastward. Only Sheridan tried to pursue beyond Missionary Ridge, but he finally gave up late that night when it was clear that he was not being supported by either Granger or Thomas.Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 202; McDonough, pp. 208-09, 214-15; Cozzens, pp. 343-45, 341-42. =Hooker at Rossville Gap= After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's command left Lookout Mountain at about 10 a.m. and moved east, they encountered a significant obstacle. The bridges across Chattanooga Creek, about a mile from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. Peter Joseph Osterhaus assigned a 70-man pioneer unit to start rebuilding one bridge while men of the 27th Missouri created a rickety footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and the bulk of his force did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30 p.m.Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 193; McDonough, pp. 159-60; Korn, p. 142; Cozzens, pp. 244-45. Breckinridge was absent while the Union attack wrecked his corps. Worried about his left flank, he rode to the end of his line in the early afternoon. At 3:30 p.m., about the time Thomas launched his four- division attack on Missionary Ridge, Breckinridge visited Stewart's left flank brigade of Col. James T. Holtzclaw, whose commander pointed to the southwest where Hooker's men were busily bridging Chattanooga Creek. Concerned about Rossville Gap, which lay undefended beyond his left flank, Breckinridge ordered Holtzclaw to send a couple of regiments to hold the position. It was too late; by the time the Southerners reached the gap, Osterhaus's division had already marched through. Lt. J. Cabell Breckinridge, the general's son and aide-de-camp, rode into a group from the 9th Iowa and was captured.Cozzens, p. 315; O.R., Series 1, Vol. XXXI, Part 2, p. 615. Hooker quickly faced his troops to the north and organized a three-pronged attack. He sent Osterhaus along a trail east of Missionary Ridge, Cruft onto the ridge itself, and Geary along the western face of the ridge. Holtzclaw faced his men south and put up a fight, but Cruft and Osterhaus soon began herding the outnumbered Confederates north along Missionary Ridge. Hearing a tremendous racket to the north, Breckinridge finally rode off to find out what was wrong. As Holtzclaw retreated before Hooker's command, he eventually bumped into Col. Anson G. McCook's 2nd Ohio of Carlin's brigade, now astride the ridge. Surrounded by superior forces on four sides, approximately 700 of Holtzclaw's men surrendered, along with soldiers from the other brigades of Stewart's division.McDonough, pp. 211-12; Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 202; Cozzens, p. 319. Aftermath During the night, Bragg ordered his army to withdraw toward Chickamauga Station on the Western and Atlantic Railroad (currently the site of Lovell Air Field) and the following day began retreating from there toward Dalton, Georgia, in two columns over two routes.Cozzens, pp. 346-48. The pursuit ordered by Grant was effectively thwarted by Cleburne's rearguard defense at the Battle of Ringgold Gap.Woodworth, Six Armies, pp. 204-05; Cozzens, pp. 372-84. Casualties for the Union Army during the Battles for Chattanooga (Orchard Knob, Lookout Mountain, and Missionary Ridge) amounted to 5,824 (753 killed, 4,722 wounded, and 349 missing) of about 56,000 engaged; Confederate casualties were 6,667 (361 killed, 2,160 wounded, and 4,146 missing, mostly prisoners) of about 44,000. Southern losses may have been higher; Grant claimed 6,142 prisoners. In addition, the Union Army seized 40 cannons and 69 limbers and caissons. When a chaplain asked General Thomas whether the dead should be sorted and buried by state, in the new military cemetery, Thomas replied \\"Mix 'em up. I'm tired of states' rights.\\"Eicher, p. 613. The Confederate enthusiasm that had risen so high after Chickamauga had been dashed at Chattanooga.Hattaway and Jones, p. 462. One of the Confederacy's two major armies was routed. The Union now held undisputed control of the state of Tennessee, including Chattanooga, the \\"Gateway to the Lower South.\\" The city became the supply and logistics base for Sherman's 1864 Atlanta Campaign, as well as for the Army of the Cumberland,The Army of the Ohio was based in Knoxville, the Army of the Tennessee in Nashville. and Grant had won his final battle in the West prior to receiving command of all Union armies in March 1864.Woodworth, Six Armies, p. 213; Cozzens, p. 391; Korn, p. 155.

It was designated GL1500C in the US market and F6C (\\"Flat Six Custom\\") in other markets. The Valkyrie engine is a liquid-cooled, horizontally opposed flat-six engine transplanted from Honda's Gold Wing model, unlike the V-twin engine commonly found on \\"cruiser\\" style motorcycles. In its transplant from the Goldwing, the most notable engine changes were the camshaft and the change to six individual 28 mm carburetors, one for each cylinder, changes which increased power and torque. The Valkyrie was offered with a reverse gear in Japan. The Valkyrie was made in the United States at the Honda motorcycle plant in Marysville, Ohio. Other models =Standard, Tourer and Interstate= Honda Valkyrie Interstate Customised Honda F6 On introduction in 1997, a naked Standard and later, a Tourer model were offered. The Tourer included a windshield and lockable hard saddlebags. It was designated as a GL1500CT In 1999, the Interstate model was added to the lineup, which included a fork-mounted fairing along with a larger capacity fuel tank and a trunk at the rear of the motorcycle. It was designated as a GL1500CJ. As sales eventually dwindled, the Interstate and Tourer models were dropped after 2001, leaving only the Standard model remaining. 2003 saw the Standard offered only in black and was the last year of the original Valkyrie. =Rune= Honda Valkyrie Rune 2004 Honda introduced a limited edition model in 2003 named the Valkyrie Rune with a engine. It was a major departure from the original Valkyrie in styling and purpose. This model was produced at the Honda motorcycle plant in Marysville, Ohio. =EVO6 concept= EVO6 at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show Honda presented the EVO6 concept motorcycle at the Tokyo Motor Show 2007. Based on the flat-six engine from the Goldwing, the EVO6 produces more power than its touring ancestor. The EVO6 features Honda's Human Friendly Transmission (HFT) transmission that can be operated in a fully automatic mode or a six-speed manual mode. =Reintroduction= The Valkyrie was reintroduced in November 2013 (as a 2014 model) as a redesign of the GL1800 Gold Wing. The reintroduced Valkyrie (F6C) shared the same liquid cooled 1832cc flat six engine (117 bhp at 5,500 rpm/123 lb.-ft. torque at 4,000 rpm) as well as underlying frame and 5-speed transmission as the Honda Goldwing. However the Valkyrie loses the fairing, windshield and bags (windshield and bags are available Honda optional accessories). ABS is also available (not standard). The Valkyrie has an all digital multi-instrument dash screen. At the Tokyo Motor Show, Honda revealed their new 'naked' version of the GL1800, as the 2014 Valkyrie, using the same 1832cc six-cylinder engine as the Gold Wing but weighing less. The new Valkyrie has increased rake and trail, front and rear suspension revised for the reduced weight, 50/50 weight distribution and large tires after the fashion of sport-bikes. The Valkyrie's horsepower-to-weight ratio puts it in the muscle bike class according to some reviewers.Hod Rod Hearts: Meeting of the Muscle Motorcycles; The motorcycle superpower summit: Harley-Davidson V-Rod, Honda Magna, Honda Valkyrie, Honda VTX1800C, Kawasaki Mean Streak, Yamaha V-Max, Yamaha Warrior at MotorcycleCruiser.com It was expected to be on sale by Spring, 2014, for about $17,000 for the base model (the model with an anti-lock braking system will cost more). The reintroduced Valkyrie was only available for two model years (2014 and 2015) before Honda dropped the bike in the US market.

Retrieved February 2, 2013. \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" is most famous for its nonsensical ad libbed (\\"scat\\") lyrics (for example, \\"Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho\\"). In performances, Calloway would have the audience and the band members participate by repeating each scat phrase in a form of call and response, until making it too fast and complicated for the audience to replicate it. Released by Brunswick Records, the song was the biggest chart- topper of 1931. In 1978, Calloway recorded a disco version of \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" on RCA Records which reached #91 on the Billboard R&B; chart. \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 2019 was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress. It has been argued that the record was the first jazz record to sell a million copies.  Basis  The song is based lyrically on Frankie \\"Half- Pint\\" Jaxon's 1927 version of the early 1900s vaudeville song \\"Willie the Weeper\\" (Bette Davis sings this version in The Cabin in the Cotton). The lyrics are heavily laden with drug references. The character \\"Smokey\\" is described as \\"cokey\\", meaning a user of cocaine; the phrase \\"kick the gong around\\" was a slang reference to smoking opium. The \\"hi-de-ho\\" scat lyrics came about when Calloway forgot the lyrics to the song one night during a live radio concert.  Notable performances  \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" has been covered or simply referenced by many other performers. Its refrain, particularly the call and response, is part of the language of American jazz. At the Cab Calloway School of the Arts, which is named for the singer, students perform \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" as a traditional part of talent showcases. In 1967, the song was covered again by an Australian band, The Cherokees. A version by the Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra made number 35 in the UK Singles Chart late in 1988. Tupac Shakur and Chopmaster J made a hip hop version of the song in 1989. The song can be found on Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988‚Äì1991 from 2007. A contemporary swing band, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, recorded a cover on their 1998 album, Americana Deluxe. L.A.-based new wave/rock band Oingo Boingo has covered this song, as well as other Cab Calloway songs, during live performances throughout their career, dating back to their years as Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo. On January 19, 2001, Wyclef Jean opened his \\"All Star Jam @ Carnegie Hall\\" concert with this number, walking to the stage from the back of the audience, dressed all in white. The song \\"The Mighty O\\" by Outkast is heavily inspired by the song. The English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams is famed (and often lightheartedly ridiculed) for his frequent tendency to engage in call and response with his audience. As a tongue in cheek retort to the criticism, he performed \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" on the Take the Crown Stadium Tour, albeit changing the lyrics to be about himself. He then released a studio recording of the song on his 10th studio album, Robbie Williams Swings Both Ways. =In film and television= During a performance on the first season of American Idol, Tamyra Gray performed this song on \\"Big Band\\" night. Hugh Laurie, in a 2006 interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, stated that his charity cover band, Band from TV, has the most popular recording of \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" available on the iTunes Store. Laurie also performs a part of the song in the first episode of the British comedy television series Jeeves and Wooster, playing the role of Bertie Wooster, duetting with Reginald Jeeves, played by Stephen Fry. The episode first aired in 1990, but it is unsure exactly when it was set, as the overall setting for this show is given as the 1920s and 1930s. A recording was later released on the Jeeves and Wooster soundtrack. On an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Will Smith performs the \\"hi-de-ho\\" chorus and even references Heidi Fleiss in the process. Opera singer Grace Moore performed the song in the 1937 film When You're in Love, in a departure from her usual style. Although it is not heard, the song is mentioned by name in the 1991 Sylvester Stallone movie, Oscar. In 1992, rapper Positive K made a song called \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" for his 1992 album, The Skills Dat Pay da Bills. It is performed on screen with a video of Calloway at every New York Jets home game.  In popular culture  =Films= Calloway performed the song in the movie Rhythm and Blues Revue (1955), filmed at the Apollo Theater. Much later, in 1980 at age 73, Calloway performed the song in the movie The Blues Brothers. Calloway's character Curtis, a church janitor and the Blues Brothers' mentor, magically transforms the band into a 1930s swing band and sings \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" when the crowd becomes impatient at the beginning of the movie's climactic production number. According to director John Landis in the 1998 documentary The Stories Behind the Making of \\"The Blues Brothers\\", Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be done faithful to the original big band version. In the 1979 film Escape to Athena, Stefanie Powers sings \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" for an audience of German officers in a POW camp. The band Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo performed the song in the Richard Elfman film Forbidden Zone, with altered lyrics and titled \\"Squeezit the Moocher\\", after one of the movie's characters, Squeezit Henderson. Danny Elfman, playing a rather vaudevillian Satan, sings the song as his band (other members of Oingo Boingo at the time) respond to his calls. Oogie Boogie's song from The Nightmare Before Christmas, which Elfman composed the music for, is also similar to \\"Minnie the Moocher\\". The popular refrain is performed by a funeral band in the 1999 film Double Jeopardy The song is played multiple times in the early stages of the 2013 film Magic Magic starring Juno Temple. =Animation= In 1932, Calloway recorded the song for a Fleischer Studios Talkartoon short cartoon, also called Minnie the Moocher, starring Betty Boop and Bimbo, and released on March 11, 1932. Calloway and his band provide most of the short's score and themselves appear in a live- action introduction, playing \\"Prohibition Blues\\". The thirty-second live- action segment is the earliest-known film footage of Calloway. In the cartoon, Betty decides to run away from her parents after they insist in old-country broken English that she eat Hasenpfeffer despite her not wanting to (to the Harry Von Tilzer tune \\"They Always Pick on Me\\"), and Bimbo comes with her. While walking away from home, Betty and Bimbo wind up in a spooky area and hide in a hollow tree. A spectral walrus‚Äîwhose gyrations were rotoscoped from footage of Calloway dancing‚Äîappears to them, and begins to sing \\"Minnie the Moocher\\", with many fellow ghosts following along, during which they do scary things like place ghosts on electric chairs who still survive after the shock, and a cat feeding her kittens so much milk that they grow big immediately while the mother grows thin and dies. After singing the whole number, the ghosts chase Betty and Bimbo all the way back to Betty's home. While Betty is hiding under the covers of her bedsheets, her runaway note is torn up and the remaining letters read \\"Home Sweet Home\\". In 1933 another Betty Boop/Cab Calloway cartoon with \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" was The Old Man of the Mountain. The 1933 Pooch the Pup cartoon She Done Him Right also features the song \\"Minnie the Moocher's Wedding Day\\". It was sung by the nightclub singer whom Pooch is in love with. In \\"Blue Harvest\\", the kickoff episode of the sixth season of Family Guy, \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" is played while Han Solo (Peter Griffin) and Luke Skywalker (Chris Griffin) disguise themselves as stormtroopers to lead Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), Chewbacca (Brian Griffin), C-3PO (Glenn Quagmire) and R2-D2 (Cleveland Brown) away from the Millennium Falcon to infiltrate the Death Star, coolly walking so as not to be noticed by the stormtrooper guards. This is a direct reference to the film The Blues Brothers, as Jake and Elwood Blues try to sneak past the police officers at their concert. When Stewie Griffin is writing a song to a love interest in the season 7 episode \\"Ocean's Three and a Half\\", Brian Griffin ridicules him for choosing an unoriginal formula for songwriting. When Stewie objects and asks for examples, Brian lists the song among many others as examples. Peter also sings the song in his car in the season 12 episode \\"Finders Keepers\\".  Other references to Minnie  * Minnie herself is mentioned in a number of other Cab Calloway songs, including \\"Minnie the Moocher's Wedding Day\\", \\"Ghost of Smoky Joe\\", \\"Kickin' the Gong Around\\", \\"Minnie's a Hepcat Now\\", \\"Mr. Paganini - Swing for Minnie\\", \\"We Go Well Together\\", and \\"Zah Zuh Zaz\\". Some of these songs indicate that Minnie's boyfriend Smoky was named Smoky Joe as well. * A number of Cab Calloway albums are called Minnie the Moocher. In 1932, the Boswell Sisters did their own jazz version of \\"Minnie the Moocher's Wedding Day\\" as did Fletcher Henderson and The Mills Brothers. * In the 1935 Marx Brothers' film A Night at the Opera, Groucho Marx famously quipped, \\"You're willing to pay him a thousand dollars a night just for singing? Why, you can get a phonograph record of 'Minnie the Moocher' for 75 cents. And for a buck and a quarter, you can get Minnie.\\" * Jeffrey Lewis referenced \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" in his song \\"Mini-Theme: Moocher from the Future\\" from his 2009 album 'Em Are I. * In 1931, the same year that Calloway recorded the first version of \\"Minnie the Moocher\\", his sister Blanche (who performed as Blanche Calloway with her \\"Joy Boys\\") recorded \\"Growlin' Dan\\", in which Minnie is evoked, along with a variation on Calloway's \\"hi-di-ho\\". * In 1940, The Dandridge Sisters performed the Jimmie Lunceford song \\"Minnie the Moocher Is Dead\\". * Minnie is referenced in Clarence Williams and His Orchestra's 1934 song \\"Jerry the Junker\\": \\"Well, you've heard about Minnie the Moocher/ And about Smokey Joe / Gather 'round friends and I'll tell you a tale / Of a cat you oughta know\\".

The island is in area, making it the second-largest island in the Bering Sea and eighth-largest island in the United States. It is long and wide. It has a population of 191 persons as of the 2010 census, down from 210 in 2000. The island's entire population lived in the north coast city of Mekoryuk.Block 1038 thru Block 1044, Block Group 1, Census Tract 1, Bethel Census Area United States Census Bureau People Nunivak children, photograph by Edward S. Curtis, 1930 Nunivak has only one permanent settlement, Mekoryuk, on the north shore, with about 200 residents. In the 1880 United States Census, Ivan Petrof recorded 702 residents in nine villages on the island. An epidemic in 1900 decimated the population of the island. Emigration keeps the population small. Noted persons who have visited Nunivak include journalist Jon Lee Anderson, photographer Edward S. Curtis, Anne Makepeace, anthropologist Margaret Lantis, and the artist Muriel Hannah. Noted conservationist and outdoorsman Steven Rinella aired an episode of his television show Meat Eater in 2015 where he experienced a muskox hunt and explored the history and culture of the island and its people. MasketteNunivak Nearly all the permanent residents of Nunivak are Cup'it Eskimo, whose traditional language is a dialect of Central Alaskan Yup'ik known as Cup'ig or Nunivak Cup'ig. Cup'ig is the first language for many older islanders and is enjoying a dedicated revival among younger islanders as well, although nearly all Nuniwarmiut (Nunivak people) speak English. The people of Nunivak Island still depend to a large degree on subsistence hunting, and also commercial fishing and industrial work on the mainland.

Nunivak Island is volcanic in origin; most of the island is dominated by volcanic plateau 500 ft (160 m) or more above sea level. The island is dotted with about 60 cinder cones and four maars. Much of its surface consists of widespread, thin flows of pahoehoe lava from small shield volcanoes, which spread over sedimentary rock of the Cretaceous period. Volcanic eruptions took place during 5 periods of activity beginning 6.1 million years ago. Most of the volcanic field was formed during the two most recent eruptive periods during the Pleistocene ending about 300,000 years ago. Because of the history of volcanic activity, it is considered part of the Bering Sea Volcanic Province.The 40Ar/39Ar chronology and eruption rates of Cenozoic volcanism in the eastern Bering Sea Volcanic Province, Alaska The Ibkilwit Lava Bed is located on Nunivak Island. Tundra is the main landscape feature; the largest trees on Nunivak are dwarf willow trees, most less than 4 ft (1.2 m) tall. More than 40 rivers drain the tundra upland. Brackish lagoons ring the eastern and southern shores, and steep volcanic cliffs dominate the northwest shores. At least 89 migratory seabird and waterfowl species have seasonal homes on Nunivak Island, including several endangered and threatened species. Dense summer breeding rookeries are found on all shores of the island and in inland tundra lakes. Prehistorically, Nunivak was home to a modest herd of caribou, but these were exterminated after the introduction of firearms in the late 19th or early 20th century. United States Fish and Wildlife introduced reindeer and musk ox onto the island in the 1930s and 1940s. Large herds of these animals are maintained by the local Native Corporation of Mekoryuk. Most of the island is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Culture The art of Nunivak Island has its roots in the ancient past. The oldest known sculpture is thousands of years old. In the ancient times masks were made to sell or trade for goods needed to survive. Later masks were intended for festivities, dances, and traditional healing. This type of mask (there are many types of masks carved today) represents the life surrounding Nunivak Island. The walrus is what the loon depends on for survival. And, in turn, man depends on the loon and the walrus for survival. These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families. The walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive. It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea. The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks (Cup'ig boots), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times. The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade. Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof. Demographics Nunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents.http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1880a_v1-17.pdf In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately. It next reported in 1910 for the entire island through to 1940. Since 1950, any settlements on the island have reported separately again, though all residents now reside in Mekoryuk as of 2000 and 2010.

Rodulf of Ivry was their son and Richard's half-brother.Detlev Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 4 (Marburg, Germany: J. A. Stargardt, 1989), Tafel 694A Life Coin of Richard I With the death of Richard's father in 942, King Louis IV of France installed the boy, Richard, in his father's office. Under the influence of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, the king took him into Frankish territory and placing him in the custody of the count of Ponthieu before the king reneged and seized the lands of the Duchy of Normandy.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians; A Family who Forged Europe, trans.

Louis had protested that he had kept Richard in his domain to train him in courtliness. He subsequently addresses the mob by holding Richard up in his arms into the crowd's view and returning him.Dudo,Historia Normannorum Bernard de Senlis and Ivo de Bell√®sme had also assisted in Richard's release.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumieges, Orderic Vatalis, and Robert of Torigni, Vol. I, ed. & trans. Elisabeth M.C. van Houts (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) pp. 103, 105 In 946, at the age of 14, Richard allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders in France and with men sent by King Harold of Denmark. A battle was fought after which Louis IV was captured. Hostages were taken and held until King Louis recognised Richard as Duke, returning Normandy to him. Richard agreed to \\"commend\\" himself to Hugh, the Count of Paris, Hugh resolved to form a permanent alliance with Richard and promised his daughter Emma, who was little more than a girl, as a bride; the marriage would take place in 960. Louis, working with Arnulf, persuaded Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor to attack Richard and Hugh. The combined armies of Otto, Arnulf, and Louis were driven from the gates of Rouen, fleeing to Amiens and being decisively defeated in 947.Eleanor Searle, Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840‚Äì1066 (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988), pp. 85‚Äì6 A period of peace ensued, Louis dying in 954, 13 year old Lothair becoming king. The middle-aged Hugh appointed Richard as guardian of his 15-year-old son, Hugh Capet in 955. In 962, Theobald I, Count of Blois, attempted a renewed invasion of Rouen, Richard's stronghold, but his troops were summarily routed by Normans under Richard's command, and forced to retreat before ever having crossed the Seine river.Eleanor Searle, Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840‚Äì1066 (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988), p. 86The Annals of Flodoard of Reims; 916‚Äì966, ed. & trans.

Michael Idomir Allen (University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1993), p. 265 In 987, Hugh Capet became King of the Franks. For the last 30 years until his death in 996 in F√©camp, Richard concentrated on Normandy itself, and participated less in Frankish politics and its petty wars. In lieu of building up the Norman Empire by expansion, he stabilized the realm and reunited the Normans, forging the reclaimed Duchy of his father and grandfather into West Francia's most cohesive and formidable principality.Eleanor Searle, Predatory Kinship and the Creation of Norman Power, 840‚Äì1066 (University of California Press, Berkeley, 1988), p. 89 Richard's grave Richard died of natural causes in Fecamp, France, on 20 November 996.Fran√ßois Neveux.

His marriage to Emma of Paris connected him directly to the House of Capet. His second wife, Gunnor, from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin, formed an alliance to that group, while her sisters formed the core group that were to provide loyal followers to him and his successors.A Companion to the Anglo-Norman World, ed.

Emma married firstly √Üthelred the Unready and after his death in 1016, the invader, Cnut the Great. Her children included Edward the Confessor, Alfred Aetheling and with Cnut, Harthacnut, so completing a major link between the Duke of Normandy and the Crown of England that would add validity to the claim by William the Conqueror to the throne of England. Richard also built on his relationship with the church, undertaking acts of piety, restoring their lands and ensuring the great monasteries flourished in Normandy. His further reign was marked by an extended period of peace and tranquility.Fran√ßois Neveux.

According to Robert of Torigni, not long after Emma's death, Duke Richard went out hunting and stopped at the house of a local forester. He became enamored with the forester's wife, Seinfreda, but she was a virtuous woman and suggested he court her unmarried sister, Gunnor, instead. Gunnor became his mistress and her family rose to prominence. Her brother, Herfast de Crepon, may have been involved in a controversial heresy trial. Gunnor was, like Richard, of Viking descent, being a Dane by blood. Richard finally married her to legitimize their children:See the article by Todd A.

Background The Morning of the Streltsy Execution, by Vasily Surikov, 1881 Some Russian historians believe that the Streltsy uprising represented a reactionary rebellion against the progressive innovations of Peter the Great, who had left the country on a tour of cities in northern and western Europe at the time. Others see it as a riot against the yoke of serfdom oppression, military-service hardships and harassment. The Moscow Streltsy, who had participated in Peter the Great's Azov campaigns in 1695‚Äì1696, remained in Azov as a garrison. In 1697, however, the four regiments of Streltsy were unexpectedly sent to Velikiye Luki instead of Moscow. On their way there they were starving and carrying their ordnance by themselves, due to lack of horses. In March 1698, 175 Streltsy left their regiments and fled to Moscow to file a complaint. They secretly established contact with Sophia Alekseyevna, who had been incarcerated at the Novodevichy Monastery, and hoped for her mediation. The runaway Streltsy, despite their resistance, were sent back to their regiments, giving rise to discontent among the rest of them. Uprising On 6 June, the Streltsy removed their commanding officers, chose four electives from each regiment, and made their way to Moscow, getting ready to punish the boyars and foreign advisers and blaming them for all adversities. The rebels (approx. 2,300 men) intended to install Sophia or, in case of her refusal, her alleged lover Vasili Golitsyn, who had been in exile. Peter I ordered four regiments (4,000 men) and a cavalry unit under the command of Aleksey Shein and Patrick Gordon to attack the Streltsy.Michael C. Paul, \\"The Military Revolution in Russia 1550‚Äì1682,\\" The Journal of Military History 68 No. 1 (January 2004): 9‚Äì45, particularly se21. On 18 June, the Streltsy were defeated not far from the New Jerusalem Monastery (Voskresensky Monastery) 40 km west of Moscow. Aftermath Peter availed himself of savage tortures while investigating the incident. Many suspects were whipped to death with the knout, an extremely stout leather whip composed of numerous twisted strands. Many were stretched until their limbs broke; sophisticated iron thumbscrews were applied to the fingers and toes of some prisoners; while others had their backs slowly roasted or had their flanks and bare feet slowly torn apart with red-hot iron pincers. Peter thus induced suspect after suspect to name accomplices in a virtually unending cavalcade of forced, and likely often fake, confessions. As a result of a major investigation, 57 Streltsy were executed and the rest sent into exile. Upon his hurried return from London on 25 August 1698, Peter I ordered another investigation. Between September 1698 and February 1699, 1,182 Streltsy were executed and 601 were whipped, branded with iron, or (mostly the young ones) sent into exile. The investigation and executions continued up until 1707. The Moscow regiments, which had not participated in the uprising, were later disbanded. Streltsy and their family members were removed from Moscow.

Assaults by Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet failed to break through the defensive lines of Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, resulting in lopsided casualties, and the Siege of Knoxville entered its final days. Background The Confederacy had never had effective control of large areas of East Tennessee. Slavery wasn't practiced as widely in East Tennessee as in the other portions of the state. This led to, unlike the rest of the state, pro-Union sentiment before and after the Battle of Fort Sumter. Because of the fact that the few slaves there were in East Tennessee were household slaves for luxurious purposes, East Tennesseans felt disconnected from the economic practice of plantation slavery. Many East Tennesseans were classified as Yeoman farmers, and held a high spirit for the Union. In fact, Tennessee would furnish more volunteers for the Union than all other Confederate states combined; the majority of these volunteers were from East Tennessee. Therefore, Union forces had little trouble from the local populace when Burnside occupied Knoxville in September 1863; the Army had considerably more difficulty reaching Knoxville over the rugged mountainous roads of the region. Union engineers commanded by Captain Orlando M. Poe built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley. It was named for Brig. Gen. William P. Sanders, mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863. The fort, a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch wide and deep. An almost vertical wall rose above the ditch. Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry.Eicher, p. 615. Defenses of Knoxville. U. S. Engineers Orville E. Babcock, left, seated on a tree stump, and Orlando Poe, right, standing on a war damaged salient in Fort Sanders, Knoxville, Tennessee. As a Confederate army under General Braxton Bragg besieged Union forces at Chattanooga, Tennessee, a detachment under the command of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, a trusted subordinate of Robert E. Lee, was sent to Knoxville to prevent Burnside's Army of the Ohio from moving in support of Chattanooga. After Burnside escaped a trap at the Battle of Campbell's Station, his men took up defensive positions around Knoxville and the Siege of Knoxville began on November 17, 1863. Longstreet determined that Fort Sanders was the most appropriate place to attempt a breakthrough of the Union defenses. He initially planned an assault on November 20, but chose to delay while he received reinforcements. His eventual assault was conducted by three infantry brigades, under Brig. Gen. Benjamin G. Humphreys, Brig. Gen. Goode Bryan, and Col. Solon Z. Ruff (commanding Wofford's Brigade). On November 23, 1863, Longstreet's forces seized Cherokee Heights, a tall bluff south of the Holston River (now called the Tennessee River) from Knoxville, but only about from Fort Sanders. Longstreet's original intent was to use artillery to \\"soften up\\" Fort Sanders in preparation for a frontal assault; however, at virtually the last minute, he changed the plan to a surprise infantry assault at dawn, hoping that the benefits of surprise would outweigh those of a cannonade. Inexplicably, he squandered the element of surprise by deploying skirmishers forward hours before the assault. Although this movement placed them in good positions for sharpshooting, it clearly revealed his plans to the Union troops.Korn, p. 113. Battle The assault, conducted on November 29, 1863, was poorly planned and executed. Longstreet discounted the difficulties of the physical obstacles his infantrymen would face. He had witnessed, through field glasses, a Union soldier walking across the ditch and, not realizing that the man had crossed on a plank, believed that the ditch was very shallow. He also believed that the steep walls could be negotiated by digging footholds, rather than requiring scaling ladders.Korn, p. 112. The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack. Their attack at dawn has been described as \\"cruel and gruesome by 19th century standards.\\" They were initially confronted by telegraph wire that had been strung between tree stumps at knee height, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, and many men were shot as they tried to disentangle themselves. When they reached the ditch, they found the vertical wall to be almost insurmountable, frozen and slippery. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. Unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other's shoulders to attempt to reach the top. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi. Aftermath Longstreet undertook his Knoxville expedition, which he came to realize was far too soon, to divert Union troops from Chattanooga and to get away from General Braxton Bragg, with whom he was engaged in a bitter feud. Longstreet reevaluated what was supposed to be a surprise attack and saw how it was poorly planned and executed. Based on comparative casualties, it was one of the most lopsided Union victories of the war. From the beginning of the artillery bombardment until the Confederates broke and retreated, the attack on Fort Sanders lasted about forty minutes. About twenty minutes, or half of that time, were spent in the struggle for control of the parapet. In the brief period of 20 minutes of attacking, General Burnside‚Äôs chief engineer, Orlando M. Poe, wrote that he was unaware in the annals of military history where a storming party was so nearly annihilated. The Confederate troops sustained 813 casualties ‚Äì 129 killed, 458 wounded, and 226 missing. Federal losses inside Fort Sanders amounted to only about 20 men, while another 30 were killed and injured outside the fort by Confederate artillery. While Lieutenant Benjamin reported the Union losses in the fort as five killed and eight wounded, significantly less than their defeated opponent. About 250 prisoners and three flags fell into Union hands. While Longstreet arranged to withdraw, Burnside sent a flag of truce to allow him to recover his dead and wounded from the field. It was a humanitarian gesture much appreciated by the Confederates. The Union details pulled the dead out on blankets and carried them to a point half way across no-man‚Äôs-land for delivery to the Confederates. Many of the bodies had stiffened by this time, and the Federals temporarily leaned them up against the side of the blood-stained ditch. They recovered ninety-six bodies, mostly from inside the ditch, but also from the ground within several yards of the bastion. The Federals delivered slightly more than that number of wounded to the Confederates, for a total of 197. The Confederates identified the bodies of several high-ranking officers such as Solon Z. Ruff and Kennon McElroy. On the afternoon of November 29, Longstreet changed his mind about disengaging from the Federals at Knoxville when dispatches arrived from Joseph Wheeler. The cavalry general had reached Ringgold, Georgia, on November 25 while making his way back to the Army of Tennessee, only to find that Bragg had been severely beaten at Chattanooga. Bragg asked him to inform Longstreet of the defeat and let him know to rejoin the Army of Tennessee at Dalton or to go back to Virginia if that was not possible. On Dec. 4 Longstreet withdrew from Knoxville and headed toward Rogersville, 65 miles to the northeast. Longstreet‚Äôs failure to take Knoxville scuttled his purpose and the Knoxville Campaign was essentially over, with the city remaining in Federal hands for the remainder of the war. This Confederate defeat, plus the loss of the Battle of Chattanooga on November 25, put much of East Tennessee in the Union camp. Battlefield today The Fort Sanders area became the site of many Victorian homes that were built approximately three decades later. Several, especially those located on the uphill sides of streets, are most impressive; some have been restored in recent decades. A few were incorporated into the grounds of the 1982 World's Fair. Many more have been divided into apartments and are rented out to University of Tennessee students. The author James Agee was from this area; the exteriors for the motion picture version of All the Way Home were shot outside one of the more palatial homes, which has since burned. Agee's novel, A Death in the Family, ends with Agee (\\"Rufus\\" in the novel) and his uncle conversing while looking out over the ruins of Fort Sanders.

Image-stabilized binoculars are binoculars that have a mechanism for decreasing the apparent motion of the view due to binocular movement. Such binoculars are designed to minimize image shaking in hand-held applications. Higher-power binoculars magnify the image more, but the image shift is also increased. This means that even minor hand movements can cause huge image shifts. Image stabilization technology in binoculars ensures instant adjustment of the image to compensate for the motion. Major brands making image stabilized binoculars include Canon, Fujinon, Nikon, Carl Zeiss, and Bushnell. Several different mechanisms have been used for image stabilization. Active systems In these systems the change in attitude of the binoculars is sensed electronically, and some part of the system is changed to correct this offset. A lens group may be shifted, or the angle of a fluid filled prism may be changed. Passive systems In these systems there is no feedback from a sensor to the corrective element. The whole binocular may be stabilized by use of a gyroscope, or the binocular prisms may be disengaged from the housings, allowing them to be unaffected by binocular movement. Use Image-stabilized binoculars are frequently used when viewing from a moving object such as a boat or plane. They are also very helpful with high powered binoculars.

One of the establishments in Bennett was the Arctic Hotel, a combination saloon, restaurant, and hotel set up by Friedrich \\"Fred\\" Trump (grandfather of Donald Trump) and Ernest Levin. The establishment included a brothel, a portrayal that Donald Trump said was \\"totally false\\".

He had a reputation for great wisdom and was a pupil of Demosthenes the orator and was the only man who could be compared in skill with Demosthenes. Pyrrhus held him in high regard.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 9.40.5 Cineas was an Epicurean according to Cicero Cicero, The Letters to His Friends,With an English translation by W. Glynn Williams, London, William Heinemann Ltd, Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1952, IX, 25, pp. 278-279. and Plutarch. and Plutarch, Plutarch Lives, Vol. 9, Pyrrhus and Gaius Marius (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1920 Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus sent Cineas to many cities in Greece as an ambassador and \\"used to say that more cities had been won for him by the eloquence of Cineas than by his own arms; and he continued to hold Cineas in especial honour and to demand his services.\\" Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pyrrhus, 14.1-2 Plutarch wrote that prior to Pyrrhus undertaking the Pyrrhic War, Cineas tried to dissuade him from waging war against Rome in Italy and urged him to be satisfied with the possessions he already had. He asked Pyrrhus a series of questions: how he would use a victory against the Romans, what he would do after taking Italy, whether his expedition would stop with the taking of Sicily (according to Plutarch, Pyrrhus wanted to take Sicily as well as Italy) and, since Pyrrhus said that he would go on to take Libya and Carthage so that no enemies who threatened him would offer further resistance, he asked what he would do \\"when we have got everything subject to us\\". The reply of Pyrrhus to the last question was: \\"We shall be much at ease, and we'll drink bumpers, my good man, every day, and we'll gladden one another's hearts with confidential talks.\\" Cineas got Pyrrhus where he wanted in order to make his point and said: \\"Surely this privilege is ours already, and we have at hand, without taking any trouble, those things to which we hope to attain by bloodshed and great toils and perils, after doing much harm to others and suffering much ourselves.\\" Plutarch, Parallel Lives, The Life of Pyrrhus, 14.2-7 Cassius Dio wrote that Cineas saw the folly of Pyrrhus' expedition and tried to dissuade him. He wrote: [Pyrrhus] intended by his prowess to rule the whole earth, whereas Cineas urged him to be satisfied with his own possessions, which were sufficient for enjoyment. But the king's fondness for war and fondness for leadership prevailed against the advice of Cineas and caused him to depart in disgrace from both Sicily and Italy, after losing in all of the battles countless thousands of his own forces.\\" Cassius Dio, Roman History, 9.40.5 Pyrrhus did not listen to Cineas. Ostensibly, he waged war against Rome to support the Greek city of Tarentum, in southern Italy, in a dispute with the Romans Before sailing to Tarentum, Pyrrhus sent Cineas to that city in advance with some troops. This helped to sway the people of Tarentum from attempting a reconciliation with Rome.Appian, The foreign Wars, Samnite Wars, 18 After his victory in the Battle of Heraclea, Pyrrhus sent his ambassador Cineas to negotiate with the Romans.Cassius Dio, Roman history, 9.31-32 Cineas offered to free the Roman prisoners, also promised to help the Romans with the subjugation of Italy and asked only friendship and immunity for Tarentum in return.Plutarch Parallel Lives, the Life of Pyrrhus, 16.3-4 Many senators were inclined towards peace (in Plutarch's account) or a truce (in Cassius Dio's account) because the Romans would have to face a larger army as the Italic peoples who were allies of Pyrrhus had now joined him. However, Appius Claudius Caecus, who was old and blind and had been confined to his house, had himself carried to the senate house in a litter. He said that Pyrrhus was not to be trusted and that a truce (or peace) was not advantageous to the state. He called for Cineas to be dismissed from the city immediately and for Pyrrhus to be told to withdraw to his country and to make his propositions from there. The senate voted unanimously to send away Cineas that very day and to continue the war for so long as Pyrrhus was in Italy.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 9.39 Plutarch wrote that Cineas assessed that the Romans now had twice as many soldiers as those who fought at the Battle of Heraclea and that \\"there were many times as many Romans still who were capable of bearing arms.\\" Plutarch Parallel Lives, the Life of Pyrrhus, 19  See also  * Pyrrhic War * Pyrrhic victory Notes  References  * Cassius Dio, Roman History, Vol 1, Books 1-11, (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; * Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

It leads from Skagway, Alaska, to the chain of lakes at the headwaters of the Yukon River, Crater Lake, Lake Lindeman, and Bennett Lake. History The White Pass was closely controlled by the Chilkoot Indians and was unknown to non- natives until 1887. William Ogilvie had heard reports of a low pass from the head of Chilkoot Inlet to the headwaters of the Lewes River (Yukon River), while in Juneau. In June 1887, Ogilvie was at the head of Taiya Inlet doing a survey from Pyramid Island up through the Chilkoot Pass. William Moore, who was accompanying him, had experience building roads in mountainous areas and wanted to try this route since the Chilkoot Pass was reported to be too steep for a wagon road. Ogilvie made inquiries and learned there was such a pass, but could not induce any Chilkoots to guide Moore. Skookum Jim Mason had been through this low-altitude pass before, and with much talk and encouragement, he was induced to reveal it. Ogilvie sent Moore and Skookum Jim Mason over this low altitude pass while he continued with his surveying work on the Chilkoot Pass. Moore did a rough survey of the new pass and returned with the satisfaction that he had found the route for his wagon road. The White Pass was named for the Canadian Minister of the Interior Thomas White by William Ogilvie.Information Respecting the Yukon District, William Ogilvie William Moore and his son returned to stake a homesteader's claim in Skagua, as it was then known. They built a cabin and a wharf and surveyed a town site they called Mooresville. In 1894, the North-West Mounted Police arrived at Dyea and Mooresville on their way to Canada's Yukon Territory. The first group of prospectors hiked up Moore's crude trail over the White Pass. Once the gold rush began, the Moores were overrun. Mooresville was resurveyed by Frank Reid as Skaguay. The crude trail was made into a toll road by George A. Brackett, and the North-West Mounted Police guarded the passes and briefly maintained a post in Skaguay, which Canada claimed. =Gold rush years= White Pass trail in 1899 White Pass summit seen from train, 2002 The White Pass trail was one of the two main passes used by prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush. The White Pass was an easier route to Lake Bennett than the Chilkoot Trail a few kilometers to the west, but it harbored a criminal element that preyed on the cheechakos (newcomers to the Klondike). These con artists were believed to be members of the infamous Soapy Smith gang from Skagway, Alaska. In 1898, Smith was killed at the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf and his gang were run out of Skagway and the White Pass. So many horses died during the gold rush, the trail became known as the \\"Dead Horse Trail\\". The trail ended at Lake Bennett, where the prospectors built or purchased rafts or boats to float down the Yukon River to the Klondike gold fields near Dawson City.

The southern end of the Klondike Highway also uses the White Pass and parallels the railway. The Skagway Historic District and White Pass is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Due to the harsh climate, grueling conditions, and length of journey, travelers on both the Chilkoot Trail and White Pass suffered from widespread starvation. Many of the starving people on the White Pass made meals of dead horses they found along the road. Furthermore, some travelers were known to go insane, most likely due to rotting of bodies in the snow. References  External links  *University of Washington Libraries Digital Collections ‚Äì Eric A.

It is possible that the story of Hegetorides originates prior to the Peloponnesian War, as Thasos revolted from the Athenian alliance around 463 BC and was attacked by Athens. Unfortunately, as respects the legitimacy of the tale, the Thasians do not appear to have sued for peace.

Early life and education Steward was born in Washington, D.C., where he lived on Monroe Street, NW, and later, Macomb Street in Cleveland Park. At age 16, Steward left an unhappy childhood in Washington, D.C. to attend boarding school in Deep Springs Valley, California, in the Great Basin. Steward's experience at the newly established Deep Springs Preparatory School (which later became Deep Springs College), high in the White Mountains had a significant influence on his academic and career interests. Steward‚Äôs ‚Äúdirect engagement‚Äù with the land (specifically, subsistence through irrigation and ranching) and the Northern Paiute that lived there became a ‚Äúcatalyst‚Äù for his theory and method of cultural ecology. (Kerns 1999; Murphy 1977) As an undergraduate, Steward studied for a year at Berkeley under Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, after which he transferred to Cornell University, from which he graduated in 1925 with a B.Sc. in Zoology. Although Cornell, like most universities at the time, had no anthropology department, its president, Livingston Farrand, had previously held appointment as a professor of anthropology at Columbia University. Farrand advised Steward to continue pursuing his interest (or, in Steward's words, his already chosen \\"life work\\") in anthropology at Berkeley (Kerns 2003:71‚Äì72). Steward studied under Kroeber and Lowie‚Äîand was taught by Oskar Schmieder in regional geography‚Äîat Berkeley, where his dissertation The Ceremonial Buffoon of the American Indian, a Study of Ritualized Clowning and Role Reversals was accepted in 1929. Career Steward went on to establish an anthropology department at the University of Michigan, where he taught until 1930, when he was replaced by Leslie White, with whose model of \\"universal\\" cultural evolution he disagreed, although it went on to become popular and gained the department fame/notoriety. In 1930 Steward moved to the University of Utah, which appealed to him for its proximity to the Sierra Nevada, and nearby archaeological fieldwork opportunities in California, Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon. Steward's research interests centered on \\"subsistence\\"‚Äîthe dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work‚Äîan approach Kroeber regarded as \\"eccentric\\", original, and innovative. (EthnoAdmin 2003) In 1931, Steward, pressed for money, began fieldwork on the Great Basin Shoshone under the auspices of Kroeber's Culture Element Distribution (CED) survey; in 1935 he received an appointment to the Smithsonian's Bureau of American Ethnography (BAE), which published some of his most influential works. Among them: Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups (1938), which \\"fully explicated\\" the paradigm of cultural ecology, and marked a shift away from the diffusionist orientation of American anthropology. For eleven years Steward became an administrator of considerable clout, editing the Handbook of South American Indians. He also took a position at the Smithsonian Institution, where he founded the Institute for Social Anthropology in 1943. He also served on a committee to reorganize the American Anthropological Association and played a role in the creation of the National Science Foundation. He was also active in archaeological pursuits, successfully lobbying Congress to create the Committee for the Recovery of Archaeological Remains (the beginning of what is known today as 'salvage archaeology') and worked with Gordon Willey to establish the Viru Valley project, an ambitious research program centered in Peru. Steward searched for cross-cultural regularities in an effort to discern laws of culture and culture change. His work explained variation in the complexity of social organization as being limited to within a range possibilities by the environment. In evolutionary terms, he located this view of cultural ecology as \\"multi-linear\\", in contrast to the unilinear typological models popular in the 19th century, and Leslie White's \\"universal\\" approach. Steward's most important theoretical contributions came during his teaching years at Columbia (1946‚Äì53). Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946‚Äì1953, while teaching at Columbia University. At this time, Columbia saw an influx of World War II veterans who were attending school thanks to the GI Bill. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to have enormous influence in the history of anthropology, including Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, Roy Rappaport, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, Morton Fried, Robert F. Murphy, and influenced other scholars such as Marvin Harris. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, yet another large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in Puerto Rico. Steward left Columbia for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he chaired the Anthropology Department and continued to teach until his retirement in 1968. There he undertook yet another large-scale study, a comparative analysis of modernization in eleven third world societies. The results of this research were published in three volumes entitled Contemporary Change in Traditional Societies. Steward died in 1972. Work and influence In addition to his role as a teacher and administrator, Steward is most remembered for his method and theory of cultural ecology. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, American anthropology was suspicious of generalizations and often unwilling to draw broader conclusions from the meticulously detailed monographs that anthropologists produced. Steward is notable for moving anthropology away from this more particularist approach and developing a more nomothetic, social-scientific direction. His theory of \\"multilinear\\" cultural evolution examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This approach was more nuanced than Leslie White's theory of \\"universal evolution\\", which was influenced by thinkers such as Lewis Henry Morgan. Steward's interest in the evolution of society also led him to examine processes of modernization. He was one of the first anthropologists to examine the way in which national and local levels of society were related to one another. He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory which encompassed the entire evolution of humanity; yet, he also argued that anthropologists are not limited to description of specific, existing cultures. Steward believed it is possible to create theories analyzing typical, common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of a given culture, he pointed to technology and economics, while noting that there are secondary factors, such as political systems, ideologies, and religions. These factors push the evolution of a given society in several directions at the same time. Coming from a scientific background, Steward initially focused on ecosystems and physical environments, but soon took interest on how these environments could influence cultures (Clemmer 1999: ix). It was during Steward's teaching years at Columbia, which lasted until 1952, that he wrote arguably his most important theoretical contributions: \\"Cultural Causality and Law: A Trial Formulation of the Development of Early Civilizations (1949b), \\"Area Research: Theory and Practice\\" (1950), \\"Levels of Sociocultural Integration\\" (1951), \\"Evolution and Process (1953a), and \\"The Cultural Study of Contemporary Societies: Puerto Rico\\" (Steward and Manners 1953). Clemmer writes, \\"Altogether, the publications released between 1949 and 1953 represent nearly the entire gamut of Steward's broad range of interests: from cultural evolution, prehistory, and archaeology to the search for causality and cultural \\"laws\\" to area studies, the study of contemporary societies, and the relationship of local cultural systems to national ones (Clemmer 1999: xiv).\\" We can clearly see that Steward's diversity in subfields, extensive and comprehensive field work and a profound intellect coalesce in the form of a brilliant anthropologist. In regard to Steward's Great Basin work, Clemmer writes, \\" ... [his approach] might be characterized as a perspective that people are in large part defined by what they do for a living, can be seen in his growing interest in studying the transformation of slash-and-burn horticulturists into national proletariats in South America\\" (Clemmer 1999: xiv). Clemmer does mention two works that contradict his characteristic style and reveal a less familiar aspect to his work, which are \\"Aboriginal and Historic Groups of the Ute Indians of Utah: An Analysis and Native Components of the White River Ute Indians\\" (1963b) and \\"The Northern Paiute Indians\\" (Steward and Wheeler-Vogelin 1954; Clemmer 1999; xiv).

It is a sequel to John Wyndham's The Day of the Triffids. Clark has been commended for his success at mimicking Wyndham's style, but most reviewers have not rated his creation as highly as the original 1951 work. Clark's book is written in the first person and narrated by David Masen, the son of Wyndham's protagonist. Plot summary The story begins on the Isle of Wight, 25 years after the events from The Day of the Triffids. The community there has thrived, primarily by refining triffid oil into fuel. One morning, a solar blackout occurs and triffids once again besiege the island. Pilot David Masen (son of Bill and Josella Masen from The Day of the Triffids) takes to the skies to investigate the cause of the blackout; however, even after taking his plane into the atmosphere as high as it can go, he finds that there is no end to the absolute darkness. On David's descent, he loses communication with the control tower and is forced to make a crash landing on a floating island populated by triffids. There, he meets an orphaned young girl, Christina, who has been surviving on her own in the wild since she was a young child, primarily because she is immune to triffid stings. The pair are rescued by an American ship that takes them to Manhattan Island in New York City. Manhattan, a secure and self-contained community like the one on the Isle of Wight, appears at first glance to be a utopia seemingly untouched by the triffid catastrophe. David quickly falls in love with his tour guide, Kerris Baedekker, who is one of the hundreds of daughters of General Fielding, the primary ruler of the city. David divulges to General Fielding that the Isle of Wight has a considerable fleet of aircraft, which, using triffid oil for fuel, can fly much farther than the Manhattan fleet that runs on wood alcohol. Just before David is set to return home to the Isle of Wight, he is kidnapped by a rebel group known as the Forresters. However, David ends up siding with them when they reveal that Fielding is actually a terrible dictator named Torrence, an old enemy of David's father, and that he keeps Manhattan prosperous by using the black and blind citizens as slaves, unbeknownst to the rest of the population. The Forresters further reveal that Torrence is planning to attack the Isle of Wight in order to steal their triffid oil refining machinery and that he intends to create a race of soldiers immune to triffid poison by harvesting Christina's ovaries and implanting them into all the viable women in Manhattan. In order to rescue Christina and Kerris from Torrence's headquarters in the Empire State Building, the Forresters unleash thousands of triffids into the city, some as gigantic as sixty feet tall. Unfortunately, Torrence and his guards manage to fend off the attacks and capture David and his group. However, Torrence is defeated when thousands of slaves arrive, released from their slave camps during the triffid attack, and convince the soldiers to turn on the dictator. At the end of the story, it is revealed that the great blackout was caused by interstellar dust, and that even though it continues to wreak havoc on the global climate, people everywhere are still surviving. It is also revealed that up to 25 percent of the population is immune to triffid stings, due to repeated exposure to small amounts of the plant's poison when consuming triffids for food.

Also enforcement of a new language in legislation, education, literature, worshiping counts as forced assimilation. Unlike ethnic cleansing, the local population is not outright genocided and may or may not be forced to leave a certain area. Instead the population becomes assimilated by force. It has often been used after an area has changed nationality, often in the aftermath of war. Some examples are both the German and French forced assimilation in the provinces Alsace and (at least a part of) Lorraine, and some decades after the Swedish conquests of the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge and Halland the local population was submitted to forced assimilation, or even the forced assimilation of ethnic Chinese in Bangkok by the Siam government during World War I until the 1973 uprising. Forced assimilation is also called cultural genocide and ethnocide. Forced ethnic assimilation If a state puts extreme emphasis on a homogeneous national identity, it may resort, especially in the case of minorities originating from historical foes, to harsh, even extreme measures to 'exterminate' the minority culture, sometimes to the point of considering the only alternative its physical elimination (expulsion or even genocide). States, mostly based on the idea of nation, perceived the presence of ethnic or linguistic minorities as a danger for their own territorial integrity. In fact minorities could claim their own independence, or to be rejoined with their own motherland. The consequence was the weakening or disappearing of several ethnic minorities. Forced migrations took place after each of the two world wars. The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion. This also reflected the long history of migrations of different tribes and peoples through Europe. The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a \\"people\\" who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each \\"people\\" had a right to its own nation. Much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of \\"one people, one nation\\". Such scenes also happened in Japan and Korea, as the two countries stated themselves as a single-nation country, ethnic minorities had to hide their national identity for centuries, and many resulted in assimilation, such as Ainu and Ryukyuan people in Japan, migrants of Goguryeo, Balhae and Tungusic peoples in Korea. Much conflict would arise when one nation asserted territorial rights to land outside its borders on the basis of a common bond with the people living on that land. (Example: organized territorial rights by Russia for Georgia's breakaway province of South Ossetia to North Ossetia) Another source of conflict arose when a group of people who constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders on the ground that those people did not share a common bond with the majority of people living in that nation. It is useful to contrast the mass migrations and forced expulsion of ethnic Germans out of Eastern Europe with other massive transfers of populations, such as population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and population exchanges that occurred after the Partition of India. In all cases those expelled suffered greatly. In the United States, during the great war, the American government did burn most German books. Banned the use of german in public places and renamed a lot of places that previously had German names with more English-sounding words. The forced assimilation was highly successful. Before that, the German American community at large had refused assimilation and retained their German traditions such as beers on Sundays. German also was the mayor language in many parts of the country. https://macaulay.cuny.edu/seminars/drabik09/articles/g/e/r/German_Immigrants_and_Assimilation_0e32.html When German Immigrants Were America‚Äôs Undesirables. (2019). Retrieved 10 October 2020, from https://www.history.com/news/anti-german-sentiment-wwi In the United States and Canada, forced assimilation had been practiced against indigenous peoples through the Indian residential school system and Indian boarding schools. At least one million members of China's Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps in Xinjiang, termed \\"reeducation camps\\", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. In December 2017, Reuters reported that \\"Ukraine‚Äôs neighbors have a right to criticize a new Ukrainian law banning schools from teaching in minority languages beyond primary school level, a leading European rights watchdog said\\". Beginning in 2019, instruction in Russian language will be gradually discontinued in private colleges and universities in Latvia, as well as general instruction in Latvian public high schools. Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Alexander Lukashevich has denounced the reform as a \\"discriminatory policy with the goal of forced assimilation of the Russian-speaking population.\\" Forced religious assimilation Assimilation also includes the (often forced) conversion or secularization of religious members of a minority group. Throughout the Middle Ages and until the mid-19th century, most Jews in Europe were forced to live in small towns (shtetls) and were restricted from entering universities or high-level professions. See also Christianity in Pakistan for contemporary issues. Immigration When new immigrants enter a country, there is a tension as they adapt to new people and surroundings to fit in, while holding on to their original culture. Here, studies show that native inhabitants often expect assimilation especially from negatively viewed immigrants. Moreover, assimilation pressure seems to be particularly pronounced toward the second generation of these immigrants.

It is about from the South Korean city of Sokcho in Gangwon-do. It is one of the best-known mountains in North Korea. It is located on the east coast of the country, in Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, formerly part of Kangw≈èn Province (). Mount Kumgang is part of the Taebaek mountain range which runs along the east of the Korean Peninsula. Seasonal names Japanese map of Kong≈ç-san, or Mount Kumgang in 1939. Mount Kumgang has been known for its scenic beauty since ancient times and is the subject of many different works of art. Including its spring name, K≈≠mgangsan (, ), it has many different names for each season, but it is most widely known today in the Korean language as K≈≠mgangsan. In summer it is called Pongraesan (Î¥âÎûòÏÇ∞, : the place where a Spirit dwells); in autumn, Phung'aksan (ÌíçÏïÖÏÇ∞, : hill of colored leaves, or : great mountain of colored leavesYi I's book, ÌíçÏïÖÌñâ, refers to the mountain by this name.); in winter, Kaegolsan (Í∞úÍ≥®ÏÇ∞, : stone bone mountain).  Formation  The creation of Mt. K≈≠mgang is closely related to the unique climate and distinctive geological activity of the area. Mt. K≈≠mgang is a region where rain and snow fall relatively heavily, and the climate varies depending on altitude and even east-west location. The K≈≠mgang geological layer is composed of several types of rocks from ancient geological periods. The most widely distributed rocks are granites of two types (mica mixed and stained), with granite-gneissic fertilization zones being formed in some areas. The rocks are transversely oriented and form a joint in various directions, forming unusual terrains and strange rocks, which have been formed as a result of erosion for a long period of crustal activity and weathering, from 10 million years to the present. Geography Location of Mount Kumgang in eastern Korea K≈≠mgang Mountain ranges from Tongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to Inje-gun, Gangwon-do in the Republic of Korea. The area is up to 40 km long east-west, 60 km north-south, with a total size of 530 km¬≤ to the back of Baekdudaegan. It is divided between the 'Inner Kumgang' in the west and the 'Outer Kumgang' in the east. The area on the east side of the Yeongeum River is called 'Hae Kumgang' ('Sea Kumgang'). The main peak of Mt. K≈≠mgang is Pirobong, and there are more than 60 peaks over 1,000 meters. Combined with countless sub-peaks, they were historically called '12,000 peaks'. Many scenic spots in the area are designated as natural monuments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The southern part of the 'Outer Kumgang' is also called 'New Kumgang'. There are 11 areas in Outer Kumgang, 8 in Inner Kumgang and 3 in Hae Kumgang, although not all have been opened. = Inner Kumgang = Since ancient times, the name Kumgang has been mainly used for the 'Inner Kumgang' (), which, located in the western part of the central pole, contains the main peak of Mount K≈≠mgang. = Outer Kumgang = The path to Kuryoung Falls Kuryong Falls 'Outer Kumgang' () is located to the east of the 'Inner kumgang' and covers an area along the east coast. The Outer K≈≠mgang area is noted for the large number of peaks. Chipson Peak (literally 'rock of ten thousand forms') is known for its many waterfalls. It includes many mountain peaks including Moonjoo Peak, Ho Peak, Sangdeung Peak, etc. The 'Sea K≈≠mgang' area is known for the lagoons and stone pillars. Kuryong Falls ('Nine Dragons Falls') in Kuryongyeon is one of the three major waterfalls in Korea along with Daeseung Falls in Seoraksan. It is 74 meters in height and 4 meters in width. The waterfall cliffs and the bottom are made of one granite mass. Bibbong Waterfall is 139 meters higher, and is named for its refreshing water stream. The rocks there are associated with unique legends. =Environment= Much of the mountain is covered by mixed broadleaf and coniferous forest and protected in a 60,000 ha national park. Some 25,000 ha has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports endangered red-crowned cranes.  Climate  It belongs to the alpine region and has relatively high rainfall, with heavy rainfall in July and August. The East-West difference is severe, and the rainfall increases from Haegeumgang to Oegeumgang, but due to the phenomenon of Foehn, the rainfall decreases from Naegeumgang to Naegeumgang. It is also warm and humid in preparation for the overall climate in Korea.However, depending on the altitude, cold temperatures of minus 10 to 30 degrees Celsius will continue in the winter, and depending on the region, snow will fall as early as October. These climatic conditions lie at the intersection of the northern and southern plants. Mount Kumgang Tourist Region Mount Kumgang from the coast Starting in 1998, South Korean tourists were allowed to visit Mount Kumgang, initially travelling by cruise ship, and later more commonly by coach. In 2002, the area around the mountain was separated from Kangw≈èn Province and organized as a separately-administered Tourist Region. The land route was opened in 2003. A rail link exists on the North Korean side up to the border, but no tracks are laid between Gangneung and the border in South Korea. In 1998, there were 15,500 tourists in November and December, in 1999 there were 148,000, and in 2000 213,000. In 2001 tourist numbers dropped to 58,000 amidst disagreements over the access over land. As of 2002, almost 500,000 had visited the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region. Tourist numbers have since established themselves at about 240,000 a year. In June 2005, Hyundai Asan announced the one millionth South Korean visit to the area.Hankooki.com The Mount Kumgang Tourist Region is thought to be one way for the North Korean government to receive hard currency from abroad. Therefore, the official currency of the tour is neither the South Korean won nor the North Korean won, but the Chinese RMB and US dollar. Since 2003, food and services to South Korean tourists are provided by some North Koreans. But most of the staff in the hotels are Chinese citizens of Korean heritage with Korean language skills. The area is developed by Hyundai Asan, which plans to expand the site with a proper ski resort to complement the current sleigh course, and complete golf courses. Many plans for expansion, however, are in their earliest stages. Sea Kumgang Mount Kumgang On the morning of July 11, 2008, a 53-year-old South-Korean tourist was shot and killed while walking on the resort's beach. Park Wang-ja entered a military area by crossing over a sand dune and was shot twice by North Korean soldiers. North Korea claimed that sentries had no choice but to shoot her because, despite their order to stop, she fled. South Korea demanded an on-the-spot survey, but North Korea declined it, claiming all the facts were clear and all responsibilities were the victim's and South Korea's. Due to the shooting, South Korea temporarily suspended all trips to Mount Kumgang. In March 2010, the DPRK government warned of \\"extraordinary measures\\" if the tourism ban were not lifted. On April 23, 2010, the North Korean government seized 5 properties owned by South Korea at the resort, saying that it was done \\"in compensation for the damage the North side suffered due to the suspension of the tour for a long period.\\" In seizing the properties, North Korea also alluded to the Baengnyeong incident, showing displeasure with South Korea blaming North Korea for the sinking of the ship. Since April 2010, North Korea is now permitting companies to run tours from the North Korean side, making it appear increasingly unlikely that tours will be resumed from the South. However, on October 1, 2010, news reports said, \\"Red Cross officials from the two Koreas agreed Friday to hold reunions for families separated by the Korean War amid mixed signals from North Korea on easing tensions over the sinking of a South Korean warship. One hundred families from each country will attend the meetings from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5 at a hotel and reunion center at the North's scenic Diamond Mountain resort, Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said.\\" As of September 2011 North Korea have begun operating cruises directly from Rason in north-eastern North Korea, to the port in Mount Kumgang, offering visitors the chance to stay in the resorts previously run by the south. Although they are aimed primarily at Chinese guests, western companies are also offering the tours.  History  Koreans have perceived K≈≠mgangsan as their muse since well before the Middle Ages. Practically every poet and artist who lived during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910) made a pilgrimage to K≈≠mgangsan. The division of the Korean peninsula in 1950 resulted in the South Korean people finding themselves unable to visit this beloved mountain for the better part of 50 years. The barbed-wire fence erected as part of the DMZ (Demilitarized zone) separating the two Koreas proved to be an obstacle stronger than any other barrier. In popular culture In 1894 the British writer Isabella Bird Bishop referred to it in her travelogue as \\"Diamond Mountain\\".

The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or morphemes. Rebracketing is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or \\"bracketed\\" into a new set of supposed elements. Back-formation, creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology. The term folk etymology is a loan translation from German Volksetymologie, coined by Ernst F√∂rstemann in 1852. Folk etymology is a productive process in historical linguistics, language change, and social interaction.See, e.g.'Etymythological Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective, by Ghil'ad Zuckermann in Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi & Joshua A. Fishman, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237‚Äì258. Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to loanwords or words that have become archaic or obsolete. Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form sparrowgrass, originally from Greek (\\"asparagus\\") remade by analogy to the more familiar words sparrow and grass, or the derived word burger, created by reanalyzing the word hamburger as ham + burger, even though the true original etymology consists of Hamburg (name of city)+ -er (\\"a person from\\").  Productive force  The technical term \\"folk etymology\\" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the German term Volksetymologie, coined by Ernst F√∂rstemann. F√∂rstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in philology, there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms. Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying sound changes, the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology. Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin. This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include crayfish or crawfish, which are not historically related to fish but come from Middle English crevis, cognate with French √©crevisse. Likewise chaise lounge, from the original French chaise longue (\\"long chair\\"), has come to be associated with the word lounge.  Varieties  Rebracketing is a process of language change in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *ham in hamburger) are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ham). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the Old French word orenge (\\"orange tree\\") comes from Arabic an nƒÅranj (\\"the orange tree\\"), with the initial n of nƒÅranj understood as part of the article. Rebracketing in the opposite direction saw the Middle English a napron become an apron. In back-formation a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be affixes. For example, Italian pronuncia (\\"pronunciation; accent\\") is derived from the verb pronunciare (\\"to pronounce; to utter\\") and English edit derives from editor. Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.  Examples in English  In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation. Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete. = Loanwords = There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology. The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, andiron borrowed from Old French was variously spelled aundyre or aundiren in Middle English, but was altered by association with iron. Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include belfry (from berfrey) by association with bell, female (from femelle) by male, and penthouse (from apentis) by house. The variant spelling of licorice as liquorice comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid. Anglo-Norman licoris (influenced by licor \\"liquor\\") and Late Latin liquirƒ´tia were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ' (glycyrrhiza) \\"sweet root\\". Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word cockroach, for example, was borrowed from Spanish cucaracha but was assimilated to the existing English words cock and roach. Jerusalem artichoke, from Italian girasole, is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to artichokes and does not come from Jerusalem. The phrase forlorn hope originally meant \\"storming party, body of skirmishers\\"Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, vol. 1, A‚ÄìM. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600. from Dutch verloren hoop \\"lost troop\\". But confusion with English hope has given the term an additional meaning of \\"hopeless venture\\". Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the serviceberry, service tree, and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name sorbus. The plants were called syrfe in Old English, which eventually became service. Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter. A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of Welsh rarebit, a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it Welsh rabbit. The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 Francis Grose suggested in A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue that the dish is \\"a Welch rare bit\\", though the word rarebit was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct. = Obsolete forms = When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed. Some compound words from Old English were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include bridegroom from Old English brydguma \\"bride-man\\". The word gome \\"man\\" from Old English guma fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word groom \\"male servant\\". A similar reanalysis caused sandblind, from Old English sƒÅmblind \\"half-blind\\" with a once-common prefix sƒÅm- \\"semi-\\", to be respelled as though it is related to sand. The word island derives from Old English igland. The modern spelling with the letter s is the result of comparison with the synonym isle from Old French and ultimately Latin insula, though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related. In a similar way, the spelling of wormwood was likely affected by comparison with wood. The phrase curry favour, meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English curry favel, \\"groom a chestnut horse\\". This was an allusion to a fourteenth-century French morality poem, Roman de Fauvel, about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to favour as early as 1510. Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word shamefaced was originally shamefast. The original meaning of fast \\"fixed in place\\" still exists, as in the compounded words steadfast and colorfast, but by itself mainly in frozen expressions such as stuck fast, hold fast, and play fast and loose. The songbird wheatear or white-ear is a back-formation from Middle English whit-ers \\"white arse\\", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species. Although both white and arse are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be euphemism. Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of hangnail referred to a corn on the foot. The word comes from Old English ang- + n√¶gel (\\"anguished nail\\" or \\"compressed spike\\"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier. Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn cuticle near a fingernail or toenail.  Other languages  Several words in Medieval Latin were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word widerdonum meaning \\"reward\\" was borrowed from Old High German widarl≈çn \\"repayment of a loan\\". The l‚Üíd alteration is due to confusion with Latin donum \\"gift\\". Similarly, the word baceler or bacheler (related to modern English bachelor) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor. This was later re-spelled baccalaureus, probably reflecting a false derivation from bacca laurea \\"laurel berry\\", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror. In the fourteenth or fifteenth century, French scholars began to spell the verb savoir (\\"to know\\") as s√ßavoir on the false belief it was derived from Latin scire \\"to know\\". In fact it comes from sapere \\"to be wise\\". The Italian word liocorno \\"unicorn\\" derives from 13th-century lunicorno (lo \\"the\\" + unicorno \\"unicorn\\"). Folk etymology based on lione \\"lion\\" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal liofante \\"elephant\\" was likewise altered from elefante by association with lione. The Dutch word for \\"hammock\\" is hangmat. It was borrowed from Spanish hamaca (ultimately from Arawak am√†ca) and altered by comparison with hangen and mat, \\"hanging mat\\". German H√§ngematte shares this folk etymology. Islambol, a folk etymology meaning \\"full of Islam\\", is one of the names of Istanbul used after the Ottoman conquest of 1453. An example from Persian is the word shatranj (chess), which is derived from the Sanskrit chaturanga (2nd century BCE), and after losing the \\"u\\" to syncope, became chatrang in Middle Persian (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as sad (hundred) + ranj (worry / mood), or \\"a hundred worries\\". In Turkey, the political Democratic Party changed its logo in 2007 to a white horse in front of a red background because many voters folk-etymologized its Turkish name Demokrat as demir kƒ±rat (\\"iron white-horse\\").

When a skybox is used, the level is enclosed in a cuboid. The sky, distant mountains, distant buildings, and other unreachable objects are projected onto the cube's faces (using a technique called cube mapping), thus creating the illusion of distant three-dimensional surroundings. A skydome employs the same concept but uses either a sphere or a hemisphere instead of a cube. Processing of 3D graphics is computationally expensive, especially in real-time games, and poses multiple limits. Levels have to be processed at tremendous speeds, making it difficult to render vast skyscapes in real-time. Additionally, real-time graphics generally have depth buffers with limited bit-depth, which puts a limit on the amount of details that can be rendered at a distance. To avoid these problems, games often employ skyboxes. Traditionally, these are simple cubes with up to 6 different textures placed on the faces. By careful alignment, a viewer in the exact middle of the skybox will perceive the illusion of a real 3D world around it, made up of those 6 faces. As a viewer moves through a 3D scene, it is common for the skybox to remain stationary with respect to the viewer. This technique creates the illusion that objects in the skybox are infinitely far away, since they do not exhibit any parallax motion, whereas 3D objects closer to the viewer do appear to move. This is often a good approximation of reality, where distant objects such as clouds, stars and even mountains appear to be stationary when the viewpoint is displaced by relatively small distances. However, designers must be careful about which objects they include in a fixed skybox. If an object of known size (e.g. a car) is included in the texture, and is large enough for the viewer to perceive it as close by, the lack of parallax motion may be perceived as unrealistic or confusing. The source of a skybox can be any form of texture, including photographs, hand-drawn images, or pre-rendered 3D geometry. Usually, these textures are created and aligned in 6 directions, with viewing angles of 90 degrees (which covers up the 6 faces of the cube). Advanced skyboxes Simple texture-based skyboxes had severe disadvantages. They could not be animated, and all objects would appear equally distant at infinity. Starting in the late 1990s, some game designers built small amounts of 3D geometry to appear in the skybox to create a better illusion of depth, in addition to a traditional skybox for objects very far away. This constructed skybox was placed in an unreachable location, typically outside the bounds of the playable portion of the level, to prevent players from touching the skybox. In older versions of this technology, such as the ones presented in the game Unreal, this was limited to movements in the sky, such as the movements of clouds. Elements could be changed from level to level, such as the positions of stellar objects, or the color of the sky, giving the illusion of the gradual change from day to night. The skybox in this game would still appear to be infinitely far away, as the skybox, although containing 3D geometry, did not move the viewing point along with the player movement through the level. Newer engines, such as the Source engine, continue on this idea, allowing the skybox to move along with the player, although at a different speed. Because depth is perceived on the compared movement of objects, making the skybox move slower than the level causes the skybox to appear far away, but not infinitely so. It is also possible, but not required, to include 3D geometry which will surround the accessible playing environment, such as unreachable buildings or mountains. They are designed and modeled at a smaller scale, typically 1/16th, then rendered by the engine to appear much larger. This results in fewer CPU requirements than if they were rendered in full size. The effect is referred to as a \\"3D skybox\\". In the game Half-Life 2, this effect was extensively used in showing The Citadel, a huge structure in the center of City 17. In the closing chapters of the game, the player travels through the city towards the Citadel, the skybox effect making it grow larger and larger progressively with the player movement, completely appearing to be a part of the level. As the player reaches the base of the Citadel, it is broken into two pieces. A small lower section is a part of the main map, while the upper section is in the 3D skybox. The two sections are seamlessly blended together to appear as a single structure.

A few people live on individual small homesteads in the valley; however, it is largely abandoned. It is located at the convergence of the Taiya River and Taiya Inlet on the south side of the Chilkoot Pass within the limits of the Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska. During the Klondike Gold Rush prospectors disembarked at its port and used the Chilkoot Trail, a Tlingit trade route over the Coast Mountains, to begin their journey to the gold fields around Dawson City, Yukon, about away. Confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith, famous for his underworld control of the neighboring town of Skagway in 1897‚Äì98 is believed to have had control of Dyea as well. The port at Dyea had shallow water, while neighboring Skagway had deep water. Dyea was abandoned when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad chose the White Pass Trail (instead of the alternative Chilkoot Trail), which began at Skagway, for its route. Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site is a U.S. National Historic Landmark. Dyea is now within the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. All that remains are a number of foundations surrounded by scraps of lumber and metal, 3 cemeteries, including one where almost every person buried died on the same date in an avalanche on the gold rush trail, and the ruins of the wharf.nps.gov Visitors can usually spot brown bears, black bears, and eagles.

He was the first president of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), the first president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA), and the longest-serving president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Early life Murray was born in Blantyre, Scotland, in 1886. His father, William Murray, was a Catholic coal miner and union leader who emigrated from Ireland to Scotland prior to his son's birth. His mother, the former Rose Layden, was a cotton mill weaver. Rose died when Philip was only two years old. William Murray remarried and had eight more children. Philip was the oldest boy, and after only a few years of public education, he went to work in the coal mines at 10 to help support the family. In 1902, Philip and his father emigrated to the United States. They settled in the Pittsburgh region and obtained jobs as coal miners. Young Philip was paid for each ton of coal that he mined. By the following year, they had saved enough money to bring the rest of the family to America. UMWA Murray was working in a coal mine in 1904 when he became involved in the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Feeling that a manager had purposefully altered and lowered the weight of the coal he had mined, Murray punched the man and was fired. The other coal miners went on strike to demand his reinstatement. In response, the company threw Murray's family out of their company-owned home. Murray was shocked and angered by the company's actions. Convinced that unions were the only means workers had of protecting their interests, Murray became an avid and lifelong unionist. In 1905, Murray was elected president of the UMWA local in the Pittsburgh area town of Horning, Pennsylvania. Determined to become the best local president he could, he enrolled in an 18-month correspondence course in mathematics and science. Although he had little formal education, he completed the course in just 6 months. Murray married Elizabeth Lavery (the daughter of a miner killed in a mine accident) on September 7, 1910. They adopted a son. In 1911, Murray became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Murray, who favored co- operation with management rather than militancy, came to the attention of UMWA President John P. White. After White won the UMWA presidency in 1912, he appointed Murray to a vacant seat on the UMWA executive board. White then backed Murray in 1916 when Murray ran for president of UMWA District 5. Despite his relative conservatism, however, Murray became a close associate of John L. Lewis. He supported Lewis's bid to become a UMWA vice president in 1917, and UMWA president in 1920. In return, Lewis appointed Murray to the position of vice president. Murray became a strong supporter of and assistant to Lewis. Lewis handled relations with employers and politicians, and Murray handled relationships with UMWA members. Murray strongly supported America's entry into World War I and worked closely with government officials and employers to ensure that labor cooperated in the war effort. President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the Pennsylvania regional panel of the National War Labor Board and the National Bituminous Coal Production Committee. In the 1930s, Murray continued to serve on government committees. When General Hugh S. Johnson formed the Labor and Industrial Advisory Board in 1933 to implement Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, Murray agreed to serve on the new body. He played a key role in writing the \\"Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935\\" (also known as the Guffey-Snyder Act), later struck down by the United States Supreme Court in Carter v. Carter Coal Co.. SWOC Murray as he appeared in the summer of 1936 Murray was active both in the CIO and in SWOC, the steelworkers' organizing project. When the American Federation of Labor ejected the unions that composed the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) in 1936, Murray supported Lewis's decision to form a new labor organization and was named a vice president in the new CIO. When the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on June 7, 1936, Lewis named Murray its chair. Murray oversaw a $500,000 budget and 36 (eventually 200) organizers. Under Murray, SWOC made a dramatic breakthrough when, on March 2, 1937, it signed a collective bargaining agreement with US Steel. SWOC infiltrated the employer's company unions and turned them against the company, foregoing a traditional organizing campaign. Murray and SWOC suffered their first defeat when SWOC attempted to organize workers laboring for \\"Little Steel:\\" Republic Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, National Steel, Inland Steel and American Rolling Mills. Employers used violence, espionage, and many strikebreakers to defeat the organizing drive. Murray was elected second vice president of the CIO at its first formal convention in November 1938. Organizing slowed after the initial burst of success at US Steel. By 1939, SWOC was in debt by $2.5 million. Little Steel continued to strongly resist unionization, and SWOC made few inroads at mills in the Deep South. CIO When Lewis retired as CIO president in 1940, Murray was elected president as his successor. The CIO absorbed a large amount of UMWA's dues at a time when the ongoing Great Depression and employer resistance had stalled the influx of new members. Lewis soon broke with Franklin D. Roosevelt, over the need for war with Germany and Japan and with his CIO colleagues over the need for government protection, as embodied by the National Labor Relations Act. Lewis endorsed Wendell Willkie for president just 11 days before the 1940 presidential election and threatened to resign as CIO president if union members did not follow him, as happened. Despite a Lewis draft at the CIO convention two weeks after the November election, Sidney Hillman and other CIO leaders pushed for a Murray candidacy. Although Murray had supported Roosevelt in the election, Lewis placed Murray's name into nomination himself. Murray was elected president of the CIO on November 22, 1940. =Formation of USWA= Little Steel capitulated to SWOC in the spring of 1941. Walkouts involving tens of thousands of workers and adverse court rulings led to elections at Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel, and huge majorities voted for the union. Republic Steel quietly signed contracts soon thereafter. SWOC soon had more members than the United Mine Workers, further alienating Murray and Lewis. The victories at Little Steel led Murray to transform SWOC into a real union. SWOC was disbanded at a convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 22, 1942. A new organization, the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), was founded. Murray was USWA's first president. David J. McDonald, Murray's long- time aide at SWOC, became the number two man at SWOC, often running the union's day-to-day business. Together, they ran the union in a highly centralized manner that was not very democratic. All dues flowed to the national office in Pittsburgh, and the right to negotiate contracts and conduct job actions was strictly controlled. Such actions were justified, Murray argued, in light of the vigorous resistance to the union displayed by steelmakers. =Reform of CIO= Murray took over as president of the CIO, he found the federation in deep financial and organizational distress. He quickly instituted a series of reforms to stabilize it. He collected back dues from members and unions alike, reined in expenses, shuttered or cut off marginal organizing projects and unions, pulled organizers out of unions (who acted more like service representatives than organizers), and slowly ended the organization's dependence on subsidies from the Mine Workers. By November 1941, the CIO had a budget surplus. In late 1941, Lewis submitted a \\"bill\\" to the CIO demanding repayment for its five years of subsidies and began speaking to Murray only through intermediaries. The relationship between the two former friends soured quickly. When Murray transformed SWOC into USWA and installed himself as president, Lewis retaliated. On May 25, 1942, he forced the UMWA executive board to remove Murray as vice president and strip him of his union membership. =World War II= Murray strongly supported the Roosevelt administration and the war effort during World War II. He quickly adopted a \\"no strike pledge\\" on behalf of all CIO unions, and supported (with Walter Reuther) the establishment of industry union councils to promote increased production, quicker retooling, and overcoming design problems.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 116, 160, 231, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. . To help overcome racial tensions in war plants, Murray established the CIO Committee to Abolish Racial Discrimination (CARD). CARD quickly undertook a discrimination-awareness education program, which proved somewhat effective, at least outside the South. In 1943, Murray advocated making the Fair Employment Practice Committee a permanent government agency. Murray also served on the National Defense Mediation Board and a number of other government agencies to help promote the war effort. =Post-war strikes and Taft‚ÄìHartley= Murray lead the Steelworkers out on strike in 1946. Employers said that they were unable to meet the union's wage demands under existing federal wage and price controls. US President Harry Truman established a fact-finding board to craft a settlement, eventually approving the price increases sought by business in order to finance the wage increases. The strike, which began in mid-January, was over within a month. Murray had another fight on his hands in 1947 when the Congress enacted the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act over Truman's veto. In July 1943, Murray had established a permanent political action committee (PAC) within the CIO, the CIO-PAC, the first-ever PAC in the United States. The CIO's political efforts were only marginally effective. The Republican Party successfully passed the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act despite the vigorous opposition of Murray and the CIO. After the act passed, Murray and the CIO were indicted for violating section 304 of the act, which forbade the expenditure of union funds in federal political campaigns. The CIO had endorsed a candidate for Congress in Maryland, and the US Department of Justice prosecuted Murray and the CIO for advertising the fact on the front page of The CIO News. In United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations,. the Supreme Court overturned the indictment and found that the publicizing endorsements was not an \\"expenditure\\" under the act. Representing Murray was Lee Pressman. Murray also refused to sign the required anticommunist affidavit on the grounds that it was demeaning. Nevertheless, Murray was no radical, and he aggressively purged the CIO of 11 left-leaning unions in 1949 and 1950. In the 1948 presidential election, Murray refused to support former Vice-President Henry A. Wallace's third-party candidacy and accused Wallace and his Progressive Party of being supported and influenced by communists.(Ross p. 153) Instead, both Murray and the CIO supported Truman and the Democratic Party. Murray led the USWA through a second successful strike in 1949. Now, the issue was whether employers should bear the entire cost of workers' health benefits and pensions. Once more, the union and the employers sought the assistance of a federal factfinding board, but the board's recommendations did not prevent a strike from beginning on October 1, 1949 and lasting 31 days. Murray won a doubling of the pension benefit, with the employer continuing to pick up the entire cost. The USWA, meanwhile, agreed to pick up only half the cost of a new health and insurance benefit. =1952 steel seizures= In 1952, Murray led the USWA in its most famous strike. National wage controls had been reimposed to keep inflation in check during the Korean War. In November 1951, USWA negotiators asked US Steel for a large 30-cent wage increase, improvement in fringe benefits, and a closed shop. The company responded that it could not agree without prior government approval of commensurate price increases. Truman referred the dispute to the federal Wage Stabilization Board (WSB). Murray agreed to delay a planned January 1, 1952 walkout until the Board had made its recommendation. In March, the WSB recommended a 16.5 cent wage increase. US Steel and other steelmakers lobbied Congress, the Pentagon and the defense industry heavily, opposing any wage hike. Congress threatened to overturn any Board agreement, but Truman refused to invoke the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act's cooling-off provisions or seek an injunction against the Steelworkers. Instead, on March 8, 1952, President Truman nationalized the American steel industry. The steelmakers sought an injunction preventing the seizure. After a preliminary hearing went in the government's favor, a federal district court judge enjoined the President from seizing the steel mills. The full Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, granted a stay of the injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court to hear the case. A meeting between USWA and the steelmakers at the White House on May 3 nearly ended in agreement on a tentative contract, but the Supreme Court accepted the case and so the steelmakers backed out of the pact. On June 2, 1952, Justice Hugo Black, writing for a 6-3 majority in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, ruled that the president lacked the authority to seize the steel mills.. The government returned the mills to their owners hours later, and the Steelworkers went on strike for 51 days. The CIO, lacking a strike fund, was unable to help the Steelworkers. J Lewis triumphantly offered the union a $10 million line of credit, which humiliated Murray. Steel supplies finally began to dwindle, and Murray feared the public opinion might turn against the union for impeding the war effort. Truman began preparations to draft the steelworkers into the military under the provisions of Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948, further weakening Murray's resolve to see the strike through. An agreement was reached on July 24, 1952. The Steelworkers achieved only a limited version of the closed shop. Wages and benefits rose but not as much as the WSB had recommended, but Murray and others considered the strike a terrific win. They had avoided the crippling imposition of a Taft‚ÄìHartley injunction and its fines, and Truman had gone to significant lengths to support the union. Death Murray was unable to savor his victory. In the November presidential election, Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidential election, and Republicans swept to majorities in both houses of Congress. It was another defeat for the CIO-PAC. Murray died in San Francisco on November 9, 1952, of a heart attack. Reuther succeeded him as president of the CIO. McDonald succeeded him as president of the Steelworkers. He is buried in Saint Anne's Cemetery, in the south suburbs of Pittsburgh (Castle Shannon, PA). Other roles and publications Murray was a civic-minded individual who participated on a wide number of nonprofit organizations. From 1918 to his death, he was a member of the Pittsburgh Board of Education. He was a long- time member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and served on its executive committee.

During a long administrative career in the People's Republic of China, he served successively as Vice Premier, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), and a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Secretariat and its Politburo. Wan joined the Communist Party of China in 1936 and led revolutionary and wartime resistance activities in his native Shandong province. After the founding of the communist state in 1949, Wan served in a series of government ministries, then worked as a member of the municipal leadership in Beijing. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution, but was eventually rehabilitated and returned to work as party chief of Anhui province, where he led the implementation of successful agrarian reforms centered on the household-responsibility system. In the 1980s, Wan became one of the leading moderate reformers in China's top leadership, advocating for constitutional reforms, the strengthening of legislative institutions, and the abolition of 'lifelong-terms' of top political leaders. He was named head of the national legislature (i.e., the NPC) in 1988. He retired in 1993. Early life and education Wan was born to an impoverished family in Dongping County, Shandong province. Wan aspired to become educated from a young age, and was admitted to a provincial-run teacher's college located in Qufu in 1939. After joining the school Wan founded a book club to study Marxist‚ÄìLeninist works. After the student-led December 9th Movement, revolutionary and anti-Japanese fervour spread across campuses all over China, motivating youth to take up the cause for the country's future. Wan returned to his native Dongping County and became a part-time teacher while devoting most of his time to the revolution and agitating for resistance against Japanese invaders. Wan Li joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1936,Editorial Board, Who's Who in China: Current Leaders (Foreign Language Press, Beijing: 1989), p. 662 and served in party administrative positions, many in Shandong province, from county level on up. Wan led the party organization in his native Dongping County in between 1937 and 1938, Propaganda and Organization Department director in Taixi Prefecture in 1938-40, deputy head of propaganda for Western Shandong regional CPC committee in 1940, and Secretary of the party's 2nd, 7th and 8th Prefectural Committees in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area in 1940-47. In the last phases of the Civil War, Wan Li served as Secretary-General of the Border Area committee (1947‚Äì49). Early People's Republic After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wan was named deputy director of the finance department of the Nanjing Municipality Military Control Committee, director of the Economic Department and Chief of the city Construction Bureau, all within a few months. He served as Deputy Director of the CCP South-west Military and Administrative Committee's Industrial Department (1949‚Äì52), where he would have encountered Deng Xiaoping, who was leading the southwest bureau at the time. In 1952 Wan was transferred to begin work for the central authorities in Beijing.Leung, Pak-Wah (2002) \\"Wan Li\\" Political Leaders of Modern China: A Biographical Dictionary Greenwood Press, Westport, Connecticut, pp. 163-165, He shortly became the Vice Minister of Architectural Engineering (1953) followed by the post of Minister of Urban Construction (1955). From 1958, he was a secretary of the Beijing Municipality CPC Committee (under First Secretary Peng Zhen) and vice mayor; in 1959 he took a leading role in directing the construction of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in preparation for the 10th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Post-Cultural Revolution During the Cultural Revolution, like many of his contemporaries, Wan was purged and sent into solitary interrogation, and then took part in \\"re- education through labour\\". Wan was restored to his Beijing posts in May 1973. He was named Minister of Railways in January 1975 (to April 1976) and 1st Vice Minister of Light Industry in 1977. In May of the same year, he took over Anhui Province as CPC 1st Secretary (i.e., provincial party leader) and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee (i.e., government). In Anhui, Wan Li was responsible for the earliest post-Mao agrarian reform. He instituted the household-responsibility system whereby farmers divided communal lands and assigned them to individual farmers. However, Wan faced resistance from conservatives in Beijing who criticized his reforms as not sufficiently socialist or ineffective. However, Wan pressed on with the reforms anyway. His six guidelines (the Anhui liu tiao) relaxed controls on trading as well, permitting farmers to sell surplus produce independently. Peasants were allowed to grow vegetables on 3/10th of a mu and did not have to pay taxes on wheat and oil-bearing plants grown on private plots.Becker, Jasper, Hungry Ghosts: China's Secret Famine, John Murray (London: 1996), p. 261. The Anhui agricultural reforms were heralded as brilliant innovations by the central government. The system implemented by Wan was followed up with reform programs led by Zhao Ziyang in Sichuan province. Along with Xi Zhongxun, Hu Yaobang, and other reformists in charge of implementing wide-ranging reforms, Wan was seen as a pioneer who made significant contributions to the national reform programmes in the 1980s, winning praise from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Wan Li was immortalised by the folk saying \\"If you want to eat rice, look for Wan Li.\\" National politics Wan was elected to the 11th Central Committee in 1977, and to the Central Committee Secretariat in February 1980, where he worked under General Secretary Hu Yaobang. In April he was made Vice Premier to fellow agrarian reformer Zhao Ziyang, and in August Wan was named Minister of the State Agricultural Commission. He was also made a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September of that year.Lamb, Malcolm, Directory of Officials and Organizations in China, 1968-1983 (M.E. Sharpe, New York: 1984). Wan served as the chair of the Five Disciplines, Four Graces and Three Loves activity committee. Wan Li became the Vice Premier in 1984 and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in 1988. Wan supported Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang in arguing to spread the household responsibility system nationwide in 1979-81.Zhao Ziyang, Prisoner of the State (Simon & Schuster: London, 2009), , p. 141. He also supported Zhao in curtailing the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in the mid-1980s.Zhao, p. 163. After the January 1987 resignation of General Secretary Hu Yaobang, Wan Li was named to the interim \\"five man group\\", which essentially acted as an interim Politburo Standing Committee. Wan was one of seven individuals shortlisted as candidates for formal entry into the supreme body, due for confirmation at the 13th National Congress of the party in the autumn of 1987. However, the appointment was opposed by party elder Bo Yibo and others conservatives such as Yao Yilin. According to Zhao Ziyang's memoirs, Yao said that Wan had \\"offended too many people\\" and criticized Wan as \\"the type to stir up trouble when things go wrong.\\" Deng heeded the conservatives' opposition to Wan entering the party's foremost decision-making body, but instead suggested that Wan take on the office of the Chairman of the National People's Congress.Zhao, pp. 210-211. The legislative position, while not part of the party's apex, was still a prestigious office that carried a full 'national leader' rank. Wan initially was unsure about his taking up the office, telling Deng that he was not qualified enough since he did not have a background in law. Deng replied that Wan \\"could always learn [on the job] and find people to assist him.\\" Wan was duly elected as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in 1988, succeeding Peng Zhen. He maintained this position until he retired in 1993. =Tiananmen Square= Wan was on an official visit to Canada and the United States during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. As Wan was seen as one of the representative figures of the Communist Party's reformist wing, leading voices within the party's top leadership, particularly retired elders, believed that Wan was sympathetic to the students and would rally behind Zhao Ziyang, the leading reformer in China's top leadership. On May 12, Wan Li left on a scheduled working visit to Canada and the United States. On May 13, the protests entered its hunger strike stage. Some of the protesters planned a demonstration to welcome him back to Beijing in late May.The Tiananmen Papers, page 289 Moreover, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, of which Wan was chair, had the constitutional power to convene the National People's Congress in full session. Such an extraordinary session of the body was, legally speaking, the top authority of the state, and was seen by some scholars and political insiders as a constitutionally-sanctioned way to break the deadlock. Moreover, 57 members of the Standing Committee of the NPC had petitioned for a special convening of the body to resolve the Tiananmen crisis. On May 21, Deng met with then Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin. In addition to hinting that Jiang was slated to \\"take on a bigger role\\" in the days ahead, Deng asked Jiang to discuss the ongoing situation with Wan Li to ensure the latter's support for the decision to crack down. Upon returning from his visit on the afternoon of May 25, Wan's plane was diverted to Shanghai, where he was greeted by Jiang Zemin and others who tried to persuade him to take a stand against the student protests. While in Shanghai, Wan learned that his former ally Zhao Ziyang had already essentially been ousted from power, and that Deng and party elders had planned to use military force to put an end to the protests. Wan, fully aware that he did not have the military power nor personal clout necessary to fight the decision regardless of his 'true' political leanings, expressed support for the leadership on May 27, and specifically endorsed the provisions for martial law announced by conservative figures Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun. Apart from asking his secretary to draft a memo clarifying his position, Wan did not make any further statements of support for the position of the leadership, suggesting that he may well have acquiesced to the decision rather than being earnestly in support of it. Retirement and death Wan Li gradually faded from public view after 1993, making occasional appearances but otherwise heeding his own view that retired politicians should not interfere with the workings of the party and state. Bo Yibo died in January 2007, leaving Wan Li as the sole living pre-revolutionary party elder. Many historians have also classified Wan Li as one of the \\"Eight Immortals\\" of the Communist Party, i.e., elders with revolutionary experience who were called upon to make the most important decisions facing the Communist Party. Wan Li died on 15 July 2015 in Beijing of an unspecified illness.Wan Li In his official obituary, Wan Li was extolled as \\"an excellent Party member, a time- tested fighter for the communist cause, and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman and leader of the Party and the state.\\" It also said that Wan was \\"loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the socialist cause for his entire life [...]\\" and that \\"he observed party discipline and preserved party unity\\". Wan's official obituary numbered over 2,200 Chinese characters, half of the length of the obituary of second- generation stalwarts Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, but far higher than the word count of the obituaries of former leader Hua Guofeng, and one-time Politburo Standing Committee members Liu Huaqing, and Huang Ju, who were each given a mere few hundred words. The announcement of his death was the fifth item reported on the evening Xinwen Lianbo program; the announcement was made in the form of a \\"joint statement\\" by the top organs of the party and state, which is generally reserved for only the highest-ranked leaders. On July 22, 2015, Wan's memorial service was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. On that day, flags flown at half-mast at Tiananmen Square and at government buildings. President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and the entire Politburo Standing Committee, except for Yu Zhengsheng, attended the memorial service. Former General Secretary Hu Jintao also attended.

Alston, p24 It differs from day-age creationism, which posits that the 'days' of creation were much longer periods (of thousands or millions of years), and from young Earth creationism, which although it agrees concerning the six literal 24-hour days of creation, does not posit any gap of time.  History  Long before the modern study of geology, early church writers have examined the biblical text and considered the idea that between Gen. 1:1 and 1:2 was an indeterminate period when the created world fell into chaos. It is often linked with the idea that the angelic realm was originally entrusted with power over the earth which concluded with a betrayal of that trust when a number of them followed Satan in rebellion against God. Papias of Hierapolis (c. 60 - c. 130 AD) wrote, \\"To some of them [angels] He gave dominion over the arrangement of the world, and He commissioned them to exercise their dominion as well... but it happened that their arrangement came to nothing.\\"Papias, Fragments of Papias. From the Exposition of The Oracles of The Lord. Chap. VII, Antenicene Fathers. Twentieth century Cardinal Jean Danielou explains, \\"Andreas of Caesarea tells us that Papias taught that God had conferred on certain angels the task of administering the Earth, and that they betrayed that trust.\\"Danieliu, Cardinal Jean-Guenole-Marie, The Theology of Jewish Christianity Translated by John A. Baker, The Westminster Press, 1964, p. 47. In the 3rd century, Origen of Alexandria (c. 184 - c. 253) taught in his Homily on Genesis that there were two creations in Gen. 1:1 and Gen. 1:2, and a time gap between the two; the first was a spiritual realm, the second a physical realm, although he was not exactly sure what the prior creation was.Origen, Homilies on Genesis and Exodus, Ronald E. Heine, translator. The Catholic University of America Press, 2002, pp. 47-48. St. Jerome (c. 347 - 420) wrote that Origen taught that a world existed before our own, and another will exist thereafter, and so on, in constant succession. Ep. ad Avitum 4, as cited in Cavindi JC, editor, On First Principles, Ave Maria Press, 2013, p. 30. By the Medieval period it was apparently a familiar issue. Flemish Catholic writer Hugh of Saint Victor (1097 - 1141) wrote in reference to Gen. 1:1 and 1:2: \\"perhaps enough has already been debated on these matters thus far, if we could add only, how long did the world remain in this disorder before the regular ordering of it was taken in hand? But how long it continued in this state of confusion scripture does not clearly show.\\"Custance, Arthur C., Without Form and Void, 1970, p. 28. St. Thomas Aquinas analyzed these verses in his Summa Theologica and wrote, \\"It seems better to maintain the view that the creation of the heavens and the earth was prior to any of the days, literally before the days.\\", i.e., there was first the creation of the earth, and then the enumerated \\"days of creation.\\"Custance, Arthur C., Without Form and Void, 1970, p. 28. French Jesuit theologian Denis Petau (1583-1652), referring to the time gap implied between Gen. 1:1 and 1:2, wrote, \\"The question of how great an interval there was, it is not possible, except by inspiration, to obtain knowledge of it.\\"Custance, Arthur C., Without Form and Void, 1970, p. 29. Catholic philosopher Benedict Pereira (1535-1610) wrote, \\"even though before the last day, the heavens and the elements were made subsequent to the substance, nevertheless, they were not perfected, completely furnished until the period of six days. However long that darkest day of the world lasted, whether it lasted one day or more than one day or less than one day is not clear to me or any other mortal, unless one is divinely made so.\\"Custance, Arthur C., Without Form and Void, 1970, p. 30. In Jewish writings, the Genesis Rabbah states, \\"other worlds were created and destroyed before this present world was decided on as the permanent one\\" Genesis Rabba 2, p. 59, http://www.sacred- texts.com/jud/tmm/tmm07.htm accessed 08/02/18. and the Zohar comments on Genesis 2:4 and connects it with the Hebrew tohu va bohu (without form and void) found in Genesis 1:2 and states, \\"And these are the generations of the destruction which is signified in verse 2 of chapter 1. The earth was Tohu and Bohu. These indeed are the worlds of which it is said that the blessed God created them, and destroyed them, and on that account, the earth was desolate and empty.\\"The Sepher Ha-Zohar,or The Book of Light: Bereshith to Lekh Lekha, Chapter VIII Gap creationism became increasingly attractive near the end of the 18th and first half of the 19th centuries, because the newly established science of geology had determined that the Earth was far older than common interpretations of Genesis and Bible-based flood geology would allow. Gap creation allowed religious geologists (who composed the majority of the geological community at the time) to reconcile their faith in the Bible with the new authority of science. According to the doctrine of natural theology, science was in this period considered a second revelation, God's word in nature as well as in scripture, so the two could not contradict each other. From 1814, gap creationism was popularized by Thomas Chalmers, who attributed the concept to the 17th-century Dutch Arminian theologian Simon Episcopius. Chalmers wrote, Chalmers became a divinity professor at the University of Edinburgh, founder of the Free Church of Scotland, and author of one of the Bridgewater Treatises. Other early proponents included Oxford University geology professor and fellow Bridgewater author William Buckland, Sharon Turner and Edward Hitchcock. It gained widespread attention when a \\"second creative act\\"Scofield References Notes online, verse by verse notes on Genesis 1. was discussed prominently in the reference notes for Genesis in the influential 1917 Scofield Reference Bible. In 1954, a few years before the re- emergence of young Earth flood geology eclipsed Gap creationism, influential evangelical theologian Bernard Ramm wrote in The Christian View of Science and Scripture: This book by Ramm was influential in the formation of another alternative to gap creationism, that of progressive creationism, which found favour with more conservative members of the American Scientific Affiliation (a fellowship of scientists who are Christians), with the more modernist wing of that fellowship favouring theistic evolution.Numbers(2006) p208 Religious proponents of this form of creationism have included Oral Roberts, Cyrus I. Scofield, Harry Rimmer, Jimmy Swaggart,Numbers(2006), p11 Perry Stone, G. H. Pember, L. Allen Higley, Arthur Pink, Peter Ruckman, Finis Jennings Dake, Chuck Missler, E. W. Bullinger, Charles Welch, https://levendwater.org/analysis/a3/pleroma.htm Victor Paul Wierwille, Donald Grey Barnhouse, Herbert W. Armstrong, Garner Ted Armstrong, Michael Pearl and Clarence Larkin.Unformed and Unfilled, Weston Fields, , p43 Interpretation of Genesis Gap creationism Some gap creationists may believe that science has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Earth is far older than can be accounted for by, for instance, adding up the ages of Biblical patriarchs and comparing it with secular historical data, as James Ussher famously attempted in the 17th century when he developed the Ussher chronology. For some, the gap theory allows both the Genesis creation account and geological science to be inerrant in matters of scientific fact. Gap creationists believe that certain facts about the past and the age of the Earth have been omitted from the Genesis account; they hold that there was a gap of time in the biblical account that lasted an unknown number of years between a first creation in and a second creation in . By positing such an event, various observations in a wide range of fields, including the age of the Earth, the age of the universe, dinosaurs, fossils, ice cores, ice ages, and geological formations are allowed by adherentsThieme (1974)The Bible, Genesis, and Geology, Gaines Johnson, 1997. to have occurred as outlined by science without contradicting their literal belief in Genesis.  Biblical support  Because there is no specific information given in Genesis concerning the proposed gap of time, other scriptures are used to support and explain what may have occurred during this period and to explain the specific linguistic reasoning behind this interpretation of the Hebrew text. A short list of examples is given below: * The Masoretic Text contains a small mark at the end of Genesis 1:1, referred to as a rebhia, which acts as a \\"disjunctive accent\\", indicating that the reader is to pause before proceeding to the next verse.

(May 31, 1888 - January 18, 1951) was an American motion picture actor in both silent and sound movies, particularly Westerns. Early life Born in 1888 in the Fordham section of The Bronx, New York, the son of an Episcopal priest at St. James Church. When in Manhattan, he attended Trinity School. He was accepted into the Virginia Military Institute in 1909,http://www9.vmi.edu/archiverosters/show.asp?page=details&ID;=5590&rform;=search; viewed 1/18/2014 but expelled for misbehavior in his second semester there. Following Holt's father's death, the family moved to New York City, where Jack, his mother, and brother Marshall lived with his married sister, Frances. Holt worked at various jobs including construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad's tunnel under the Hudson River and being a \\"surveyor, laborer, prospector, trapper, and stagecoach driver, among many other jobs\\" during an almost six-year stay in Alaska.  Military service  Holt was prevented from serving in World War I because of \\"chronic foot problems\\" that resulted from frostbite that he suffered during his time in Alaska. At the start of World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army at the age of 54, at the request of General George C. Marshall so that Holt could be a horse buyer for the United States Cavalry. Film career Holt began in Hollywood with stunt work and bit parts in serials and at Universal Pictures worked as a supporting player for Francis Ford and his brother John Ford, and Grace Cunard. In his film debut, Holt rode a horse down a steep embankment into the Russian River in a scene for Salomy Jane. The stunt cracked some of Holt's ribs and injured the horse so badly that it had to be destroyed. The film, which was considered lost for years, was included in the DVD released 2011 anthology Treasures 5 The West 1898‚Äî1938 by the National Film Preservation Foundation after a print was discovered in Australia. Jack Holt, with his dapper mustache, prominent jaw, and quick-with-his-fists manner, personified rugged masculinity. Holt became Columbia Pictures' most reliable leading man, and scored personal successes in three Frank Capra action dramas: Submarine (1928), Flight (1929) and Dirigible (1931). Holt's no-nonsense characterizations were eclipsed by younger, tough-talking actors like James Cagney and Chester Morris, although he was still entrusted with tough-guy-with-a-heart-of-gold leads. Two mid-1930s features, Whirlpool and The Defense Rests, starred Holt opposite up- and-coming ingenue Jean Arthur. Exhibitors had come to associate Jack Holt with rough-and-tumble action, and so Holt continued to work in low-budget crime dramas (mostly for Columbia) through 1940. The series came to an end when he argued with studio chief Harry Cohn. Cohn thought the actor so arrogant that he assigned Holt the leading role in a lowbrow 15-chapter serial, Holt of the Secret Service (1941). Holt ‚Äî the star of longest standing with the studio ‚Äî was insulted by Cohn's demotion and, although he turned in a professional performance in the serial, he walked out on both Cohn and Columbia. Jack Holt and Seena Owen in VictoryHolt began freelancing at other studios, frequently appearing in outdoor and western fare. He would become an enduring member of the cowboy fraternity through Trail of Robin Hood (1950), a Roy Rogers western with guest appearances by Holt, Allan Lane, Tom Keene, Tom Tyler, Kermit Maynard, and Rex Allen. Jack Holt's children established their own film careers. Tim Holt succeeded George O'Brien as the star of RKO Radio Pictures' \\"B\\" westerns, and co-starred with his father in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), with Jack as a grubby vagrant. Jennifer Holt played ingenues in low-budget features, mostly for Universal Pictures. The Holt family performed together on the \\"Drifty\\" episode of \\"All Star Western Theater\\" (KNX-CBS Pacific Network, 1946/47) as a father/son/daughter trio featuring a dramatic sketch and additional entertainment by Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage.  Personal life  Holt married divorcee Margaret Wood in 1917. Her father, tycoon Henry Morton Stanley-Wood, disowned her because she married an actor; they later made up after he had lost most of his money in the Great Depression. She had a daughter when they married, and together they had a son, Charles John Holt III, and a daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Holt. Better known as Tim and Jennifer, respectively, both of them became actors in western films. Holt was a lifetime member of the Society of Colonial Wars, admitted to the California Society on July 13, 1928.General Society of Colonial Wars Index and Ancestors and Members (2011).Register of the Society of Colonial Wars in the State of California (2008) pg. 106. Death Original caption: \\"Howard C. Hickman, husband and director of Bessie Barriscale, shows leading man Jack Holt how to make love to Mrs. Hickman.\\" This appears to be a production still from Kitty Kelly, M.D. (1919). If so, the cameraman behind the Bell & Howell model 2709 is Eugene Gaudio. Jack Holt died in 1951 of a heart attack.http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star- walk/jack-holt/ Contribution Jack Holt has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6313-¬Ω Hollywood Blvd for his contribution to the motion picture industry. Holt was the visual inspiration for Chester Gould's \\"Dick Tracy\\" and Al Capp's \\"Fearless Fosdick.\\" Margaret Mitchell, although having no say in the casting for Gone With the Wind (1939), expressed her preference of Jack Holt as Rhett Butler, because her personal favorite, Charles Boyer, had a French accent.Anne Edwards, Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell (New Haven and New York: Ticknor and Fields, 1983) Filmography *Salomy Jane (1914) as Solitaire-Playing Cowboy in Saloon (uncredited) *The Master Key (1914, Serial) as Donald Faversham *The Broken Coin (1915, Serial) as Captain Williams *Jewel (1915) as Nat Bonnell *The Dumb Girl of Portici (1916) as Conde *Naked Hearts (1916) as Howard *Liberty (1916, Serial) as Captain Bob Rutledge *Saving the Family Name (1916) as Jansen Winthrop *The Chalice of Sorrow (1916) (uncredited) *The Black Sheep of the Family (1916) as Kenneth Carmont *Joan the Woman (1916) (uncredited) *Patria (1917, Serial) *The Cost of Hatred (1917) as Huertez *Sacrifice (1917) as Paul Ekald *Giving Becky a Chance (1917) as Tom Fielding *The Inner Shrine (1917) as Viscount D'Arcourt *The Little American (1917) as Karl von Austreim *The Call of the East (1917) as Alan Hepburn *The Secret Game (1917) as Maj.

Murry was a member of several bands in the early 2000s. His first appearance as a solo artist was on an album in collaboration with reclusive cult Memphis folk singer Bob Frank, World Without End, which was released on Bowstring Records in 2006.

Like Father John Misty, Mark Lanegan and Josh T Pearson rolled into one really broken dream.\\" The record featured a song called \\"Little Colored Balloons,\\" chronicling Murry's near-overdose from heroin, the video for which was directed by Chuck Mobley and premiered on Billboard.

He was a prolific author, producing more than 60 books and thousands of essays and reviews on literature, social issues, politics, and religion during his lifetime. A prominent critic, Murry is best remembered for his association with Katherine Mansfield, whom he married in 1918 as her second husband, for his friendship with D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot, and for his friendship (and brief affair) with Frieda Lawrence. Following Mansfield's death, Murry edited her work. Early life John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, the son of a civil servant. He was educated at Christ's Hospital and Brasenose College, Oxford. There he met the writer Joyce Cary, a lifelong friend. He met Katherine Mansfield at the end of 1911, through W. L. George.Carswell, p. 66. His intense relationship with her, her early death, and his subsequent allusions to it, shaped both his later life and the attitudes (often hostile) of others to him.

H. Lawrence, and became an important supporter. The next year they started a short-lived magazine together, The Signature.Lea, p. 45. In 1931, after a complex evolution of the relationship, Murry wrote in Son of Woman one of the first and most influential posthumous assessments of Lawrence as a man.Jonathan Bate, The Oxford English Literary History (2002), p. 262. Medically certified as unfit for military service, with pleurisy and possible tuberculosis,Carswell, p. 99. during the war years he was part of the Garsington circle of Ottoline Morrell. In 1919, Murry became the editor of The Athenaeum, recently purchased by Arthur Rowntree.David Goldie, A Critical Difference: T.S. Eliot and John Middleton Murry in English Literary Criticism, 1919‚Äì1928 (1998), p. 34. Under his editorship it was a literary review featuring work by T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, and other members of the Bloomsbury Group. It lasted until 1921. It had enthusiastic support from E. M. Forster,Nicola Beauman, Morgan: A biography of E. M. Forster (1993), pp. 307‚Äì8. who later wrote that \\"Here at last was a paper that was a pleasure to read and an honour to write for, and which linked up literature and life\\".E. M. Forster, Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson (1932), Harvest edition p. 176. Its fate was to be merged into The Nation, which became The Nation and Athenaeum, in the period 1923 to 1930 edited by H. D. Henderson.Edward Hyams, The New Statesman (1963), p. 119. In 1923 he became the founding editor of The Adelphi (The New Adelphi, 1927‚Äì30), in association with Jack Common and Max Plowman. The magazine continued in various forms until 1948. It reflected his successive interests in Lawrence, an unorthodox Marxism, pacifism, and a return to the land.Peter Davison (editor), George Orwell: A Kind of Compulsion 1903‚Äì1936 (1998), p. 181. According to David Goldie, Murry and the Adelphi, and Eliot and The Criterion, were in an important rivalry by the mid-1920s, with competing definitions of literature, based respectively on romanticism allied to liberalism and a subjective approach, and a form of classicism allied to traditionalism and a religious attitude. In this contest, Goldie says, Eliot emerged a clear victor in the sense that, in London during the 1930s, Eliot had taken the centre of the critical stage.David Goldie, A Critical Difference: T.S. Eliot and John Middleton Murry in English Literary Criticism, 1919‚Äì1928 (1998), pp. 2‚Äì3.Albert Gelpi, A Coherent Splendor: The American Poetic Renaissance, 1910‚Äì1950 (1987), pp. 116‚Äì7. Critic Murry reviewed for The Westminster Gazette and then The Times Literary Supplement, from 1912. Initially he was much influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, which he disavowed in 1913.Mary Ann Gillies, Henri Bergson and British Modernism (1996), p. 60. He was one of an identified group of post-World War I critics that included Richard Aldington, Robert Graves, Aldous Huxley, Herbert Read, and Edgell Rickword.Alan Young (editor), Edgell Rickword: Essays and Opinions 1921‚Äì31 (1974), pp. 1‚Äì2. Murry gave Huxley an editorial job at The Athenaeum.Nicholas Murray, Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual (2002), p. 111. Murry also helped encourage British interest in the work of Fyodor Dostoyevsky: his 1916 work Fyodor Dostoevsky: A Critical Study argued Dostoyevsky was an important novelist and philosophical thinker.Steven G. Marks, How Russia Shaped the Modern World . Princeton University Press, 2003 (pp. 73‚Äì5) Murry led the charge against Georgian poetry. A leader in the 16 May 1919 edition of The Athenaeum was an early example of a reasoned attack against the Georgian style of verse; and Murry coupled this with an adversarial attitude to The London Mercury edited by J. C. Squire.Robert H. Ross, The Georgian Revolt (1967) pp. 202‚Äì3. He reviewed quite harshly Siegfried Sassoon's Counter-Attack in 1918, despite having helped him in 1917 to draft an anti-war piece for H. W. Massingham's The Nation.Jean Moorcroft Wilson, Siegfried Sassoon 1886‚Äì1918, p. 373 and 496. In-house, however, he was not master enough to award an essay competition prize to the then-unknown Herbert Read, over the wishes of George Saintsbury and Robert Bridges, who preferred the poet William Orton.Lea, p. 67. F. R. Leavis admired and was influenced by Murry's early criticism; later he criticised Murry in the pages of Scrutiny,but continued to acknowledge a debt to him late in life. On Romanticism Murry gave his philosophy its fullest expression in his writings on Keats and Shakespeare and in an ambitiously titled volume, God: An Introduction to the Science of Metabiology. There, picking up certain concepts from his acquaintance George Santayana, Murry describes the project of Romanticism as one of inner exploration: :\\"To discover that within myself which I *must obey, to gain some awareness of the law which operates in the organic world of the internal world, to feel this internal world as an organic whole working out its own destiny according to some secret vital principle, to know which acts and utterances are a liberation from obstacles and an accession of strength, to acknowledge secret loyalties which one cannot deny without impoverishment and starvation ‚Äì this is to possess one's soul indeed, and it is not easy either to do or to explain.\\"God, p. 47) The upshot of this discovery results in the highest degree of ethical awareness, \\"an immediate knowledge of what I am and may not do.\\"God, p. 49 The awareness of one being \\"really alone\\" in the universe,God, p. 26 as he put it, marks the final point of discovery which is followed by the upward ascent to spiritual life. Murry vividly narrates this exploration as a spiritual conversion (in his 1929 book GOD) ‚Äîwhat he describes as a \\"desolation\\" followed by \\"illumination\\"‚Äîafter the death of Katherine Mansfield (who had moved to G. I. Gurdjieff's Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, where she died). The Adelphi In 1930 Max Plowman joined Murry and Sir Richard Rees in developing The Adelphi as a socialist, and later pacifist, monthly; Murry had founded it in 1923 as a literary journal (The New Adelphi, 1927‚Äì30). Rees edited it from 1930; Plowman took on the role in 1938. The Adelphi was closely aligned with the Independent Labour Party; Jack Common worked for it as circulation promoter and assistant editor in the 1930s. Throughout this period, Murry's then close friend and protege, Guernsey-born G. B. Edwards, was a regular contributor to the magazine. Thanks to Murry's support, Jonathan Cape commissioned Edwards to write a book on D.H. Lawrence but following Lawrence's death it was never completed.Chaney, passim He moved to Norfolk; to South Acre; and then, with his third marriage in 1931, to the Old Rectory, Larling. Murry told Antony Alpers the biographer of Katherine Mansfield that K.M.'s manuscripts had all been \\"dispersed to collectors\\" in the 1930s. He had the manuscripts of nine or ten completed stories, and when an admirer wrote to ask if he would sell a manuscript, he would reply that some land adjoining his farm in Norfolk was on the market or that he needed a tractor, so would sell one for the amount he required. Plowman co-founded (in 1934) and ran the Adelphi Centre. It was an early commune, based on a farm in Langham, Essex bought by Murry.Dennis Hardy, Utopian England: Community Experiments, 1900‚Äì1945 (2002), p. 42. Short-lived in its original conception, it ran a Summer School in August 1936 that was stellar: George Orwell spoke on \\"An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas\\" on 4 August, with Rayner Heppenstall in the chair. Other speakers were Steve Shaw, Herbert Read, Grace Rogers, J. Hampden Jackson, N. A. Holdaway (a Marxist theorist and schoolmaster, and a Director of the Centre), Geoffrey Sainsbury, Reinhold Niebuhr, Karl Polanyi, John Strachey, Plowman and Common.Peter Davison (editor), George Orwell: A Kind of Compulsion 1903‚Äì1936 (1998), p. 493. By 1937 the commune had collapsed, and the house, 'The Oaks', was turned over to some 60 Basque refugee children under the auspices of the Peace Pledge Union; they remained until 1939. Lodge Farm, Thelnetham In October 1942 Murry set up a new commune at Lodge Farm in the Suffolk village of Thelnetham. Murry purchased the farm and recruited fellow conscientious objectors to run the enterprise. The commune had mixed fortunes and it gradually reverted to a more conventional arrangement with Murry running the farm as a commercial enterprise. He wrote an account of his time at Lodge Farm in the book \\"Community Farm\\" which was published in 1953 and was illustrated by his brother, the artist Richard Murry.Community Farm published by The Country Book Club in 1953 Political views =Marxist= Murry had a Marxist phase in the early 1930s. With his third marriage in 1931, he moved within Norfolk, from South Acre to the Old Rectory, Larling, and wrote in two weeks his The Necessity of Communism.Lea p. 184, 193. It was this identification as \\"mystical Marxist\\" that led Bert Trick (1889‚Äì1968) to introduce Dylan Thomas to Murry, in 1933. The occasion went well enough for Richard Rees to publish Thomas in the Adelphi.Andrew Lycett, Dylan Thomas (2003), p. 89. He supported the small Independent Socialist Party, a regional breakaway from the Independent Labour Party. =Pacifist= Murry was an outspoken radical Christian and pacifist, writing The Necessity of Pacifism (1937). He was a Sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union, and editor of its weekly newspaper, Peace News, from 1940 to 1946. Murry's opinions during this period often provoked controversy. He angered many left-wingers (including George Orwell and Vera Brittain) by arguing that Nazi Germany should be allowed to retain control of mainland Europe. Murry believed even though Nazi rule was tyrannical, it was preferable to the horrors of total war.Richard A. Rempel, \\"The Dilemmas of British Pacifists During World War II\\", The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 50, No. 4, On Demand Supplement (Dec., 1978), pp. D1213-D1229.Lea, pp. 310‚Äì12. Murry later \\"renounced his pacifism in 1948 and...urged a preventative war against the Soviet Union, ending his life as a Conservative voter\\".Quoted in David Goodway,Anarchist Seeds Beneath the Snow (2006), Liverpool University Press, 2006,, p. 208.According to Alan Warwick Palmer and Veronica Palmer, Murry's 1948 book The Free Society \\"...virtually called for a preventive war against the Soviet Union\\". Alan Warwick Palmer, Veronica Palmer, Who's who in Bloomsbury, Harvester Press, 1987, , (p.122). Finally Murry's opposition to the Soviet Union was attacked by pro-Soviet elements in the peace movement. Murry's anti-feminism also drew criticism from feminist pacifists such as Brittain and Sybil Morrison.Ruth Roach Pierson, Women and Peace: Theoretical, Historical, and Practical Perspectives,(1987) p.212. =Christianity= During this period Murry was widely known as a Christian intellectual. He had in fact considered ordination as an Anglican priest, but gave up on it after a diagnosis in 1938 of Buerger's disease, coupled with doubts about his marriages (his third was then breaking up messily).Lea, p. 256. =Elitism= His views converged with those of Eliot: he supported a type of elitism foreshadowed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge's clerisy, and argued for by Matthew Arnold.Jos√© Harris, Civil Society in British History: Ideas, Identities, Institutions (2003), p. 233.Roger Kojecky, T. S. Eliot's Social Criticism (1971), p. 166. In Christianity and Culture, Eliot partially supported Murry's reasoning from The Price of Leadership (1939), though stopping short of the endorsement of Arnold.T. S. Eliot, Christianity and Culture, p. 62. Family Grave of John Middleton Murry at Thelnetham Church in Suffolk Murry was married four times: first to Katherine Mansfield in 1918; after her death in 1923 he arranged the publishing or republishing of her works. In 1924 he married Violet Le Maistre, in 1932 Ada Elizabeth Cockbaine, and in 1954 Mary Gamble. With his second wife, Violet Le Maistre, he had two children: a daughter, Katherine Violet Middleton Murry who became a writer and published Beloved Quixote: The Unknown Life of John Middleton Murry in 1986, and a son, John Middleton Murry Jr., who became a writer under the names of Colin Murry and Richard Cowper. There were also two children from the third marriage. Depictions =In fiction= Aldous Huxley portrayed him as \\"Denis Burlap\\" in Point Counter Point (1928).Donald Watt, Aldous Huxley, the Critical Heritage (1975), p. 50. He was the model for Philip Surrogate in Graham Greene's 1934 novel It's a Battlefield; Greene did not know him personally.Norman Sherry, The Life of Graham Greene volume I (1989), p. 466. David Holbrook wrote that Gudrun and Gerald in Lawrence's Women in Love were based on Mansfield and Murry.David Holbrook, Where D.H. Lawrence was Wrong about Woman (1992), p. 221. D. H. Lawrence satirised him in a number of short stories. In Lawrence's novel 'Aaron's Rod (1922), the title character is based on Murry. The relationship between Lilly and Aaron in the novel mirrors that of Lawrence and Murry. =Dramatic portrayals= Murry appears as a character in Amy Rosenthal's D.H. Lawrence biodrama On The Rocks. In the 2008 Hampstead Theatre production Murry was played by Nick Caldecott with Ed Stoppard as Lawrence and Charlotte Emmerson as Mansfield. In Leave All Fair (1985) he is portrayed by John Gielgud as a sanctimonious exploiter of Mansfield's memory who ill-treated her during their association. In Priest of Love (1981) he is portrayed by Mike Gwilym. Heron Press The Heron Press, Hampstead published Je ne parle pas fran√ßais by Katherine Mansfield in 1919; 100 copies in 1919 (July to December) and 100 in January 1920. They were printed on an Albion press in the basement of the Murry's house known as The Elephant in East Heath Road and opposite Hampstead Heath by Murry's younger brother Richard Arthur (and the second book published by Heron) or Richard.

In lead climbing using a dynamic rope, the fall factor (f) is the ratio of the height (h) a climber falls before the climber's rope begins to stretch and the rope length (L) available to absorb the energy of the fall. :f = \\\\frac{h}{L}  Impact force  The impact force is defined as the maximum tension in the rope when a climber falls. Using the common rope model of an undamped harmonic oscillator (HO) the impact force Fmax in the rope is given by: :F_{max} = mg + \\\\sqrt{(mg)^2 + 2mghk} = mg + \\\\sqrt{(mg)^2 + 2mgEqf} where mg is the climber's weight, h is the fall height and k is the spring constant of the rope. Using the elastic modulus E = k L/q which is a material constant, the impact force depends only on the fall factor f, i.e. on the ratio h/L, the cross section q of the rope, and the climber‚Äôs weight. The more rope is available, the softer the rope becomes which is just compensating the higher fall energy. The maximum force on the climber is Fmax reduced by the climber‚Äôs weight mg. The above formula can be easily obtained by the law of conservation of energy at the time of maximum tension resp. maximum elongation xmax of the rope: : mgh = \\\\frac{1}{2}kx_{max}^2 - mgx_{max}\\\\ ; \\\\ F_{max} = k x_{max} Using the HO model to obtain the impact force of real climbing ropes as a function of fall height h and climber's weight mg, one must know the experimental value for E of a given rope. However, rope manufacturers give only the rope‚Äôs impact force F0 and its static and dynamic elongations that are measured under standard UIAA fall conditions: A fall height h0 of 2 √ó 2.3 m with an available rope length L0 = 2.6m leads to a fall factor f0 = h0/L0 = 1.77 and a fall velocity v0 = (2gh0)1/2 = 9.5 m/s at the end of falling the distance h0. The mass m0 used in the fall is 80 kg. Using these values to eliminate the unknown quantity E leads to an expression of the impact force as a function of arbitrary fall heights h, arbitrary fall factors f, and arbitrary gravity g of the form: :F_{max} = mg + \\\\sqrt{(mg)^2 + F_0(F_0-2m_0g_0)\\\\frac{m}{m_0}\\\\frac{g}{g_0}\\\\frac{f}{f_0}} Note that keeping g0 from the derivation of \\"Eq\\" based on UIAA test into the above Fmax formula assures that the transformation will continue to be valid for different gravity fields, as over a slope making less than 90 degrees with the horizontal. This simple undamped harmonic oscillator model of a rope, however, does not correctly describe the entire fall process of real ropes. Accurate measurements on the behaviour of a climbing rope during the entire fall can be explained if the undamped harmonic oscillator is complemented by a non-linear term up to the maximum impact force, and then, near the maximum force in the rope, internal friction in the rope is added that ensures the rapid relaxation of the rope to its rest position. When the rope is clipped into several carabiners between the climber and the belayer, an additional type of friction occurs, the so-called dry friction between the rope and particularly the last clipped carabiner. Dry friction leads to an effective rope length smaller than the available length L and thus increases the impact force.Leuth√§usser, Ulrich (2011): Dry friction is also responsible for the rope drag a climber has to overcome in order to move forward. It can be expressed by an effective mass of the rope that the climber has to pull which is always larger than the rope mass itself. It depends exponentially on the sum of the angles of the direction changes the climber has made.  Lead climbing  A fall factor of two is the maximum that is possible in a lead climbing fall, since the length of an arrested fall cannot exceed two times the length of the rope. Normally, a factor-2 fall can occur only when a lead climber who has placed no protection falls past the belayer (two times the distance of the rope length between them), or the anchor if the climber is solo climbing the route using a self-belay. As soon as the climber clips the rope into protection above the belay, the distance of the potential fall as a function of rope length is lessened, and the fall factor drops below 2. A fall of 20 feet exerts more force on the climber and climbing equipment if it occurs with 10 feet of rope out (i.e. the climber has placed no protection and falls from 10 feet above the belayer to 10 feet below‚Äîa factor 2 fall) than if it occurs 100 feet above the belayer (a fall factor of 0.2), in which case the stretch of the rope more effectively cushions the fall.  Fall factors above two  In falls occurring on a via ferrata, fall factors can be much higher. This is possible because the length of rope between harness and carabiner is short and fixed, while the distance the climber can fall depends on the gaps between anchor points of the safety cable.

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. Post-hardcore began in the 1980s with bands like H√ºsker D√º and Minutemen. The genre expanded in the 1980s and 1990s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots. In the 2000s, achieved mainstream success with the popularity of bands like My Chemical Romance, AFI, Underoath, Hawthorne Heights, The Used, At the Drive-In and Senses Fail. In the 2010s, post-hardcore bands like Sleeping with Sirens and Pierce the Veil achieved success and bands like Title Fight and La Dispute experienced underground popularity.  Characteristics  Hardcore punk typically features very fast tempos, loud volume, and heavy bass levels, as well as a \\"do-it-yourself\\" ethic. Music database AllMusic stated \\"these newer bands, termed post-hardcore, often found complex and dynamic ways of blowing off steam that generally went outside the strict hardcore realm of 'loud fast rules'. Additionally, many of these bands' vocalists were just as likely to deliver their lyrics with a whispered croon as they were a maniacal yelp.\\" Allmusic also claims that post-hardcore bands find creative ways to build and release tension rather than \\"airing their dirty laundry in short, sharp, frenetic bursts\\". Jeff Terich of Treblezine stated, \\"Instead of sticking to hardcore's rigid constraints, these artists expanded beyond power chords and gang vocals, incorporating more creative outlets for punk rock energy.\\" British post-punk of the late 1970s and early 1980s has been seen as influential on the musical development of post-hardcore bands. As the genre progressed, some of these groups also experimented with a wide array of influences, including soul, dub, funk, jazz, and dance-punk. It has also been noted that since some post-hardcore bands included members that were rooted in the beginnings of hardcore punk, some of them were able to expand their sound as they became more skilled musicians.  History  = Origins (1980s) = The band Naked Raygun in 2012 Groups such as Saccharine Trust, Naked Raygun, and The Effigies, which were active around the early 1980s, are considered to be forerunners to the post-hardcore genre. Chicago's Naked Raygun, formed in 1981, has been seen as merging post-punk influences of bands such as Wire and Gang of Four with hardcore punk, while author Steven Blush notes the band's use of \\"oblique lyrics and stark post-punk melodies\\".Blush, Steven. American Hardcore: A Tribal History. Feral House: 2001. p. 222. Similarly, The Effigies, who also hailed from the Chicago scene, released music influenced by the hardcore of Minor Threat and the British post-punk of bands like The Stranglers, Killing Joke, and The Ruts. During the early to mid-1980s, the desire to experiment with hardcore's basic template expanded to many musicians that had been associated with the genre or had strong roots in it. Many of these groups also took inspiration from the 1980s noise rock scene pioneered by Sonic Youth. Some bands signed to the independent label Homestead Records, including Squirrel Bait (as well as David Grubbs-related Bastro and Bitch Magnet) and Steve Albini's Big Black (just as his subsequent projects Rapeman and Shellac) are also associated with post-hardcore. Big Black, which also featured former Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango, made themselves known for their strict DIY ethic, related to practices such as paying for their own recordings, booking their own shows, handling their own management and publicity, and remaining \\"stubbornly independent at a time when many independent bands were eagerly reaching out for the major-label brass ring\\". The band's music, punctuated by the use of a drum machine, has also been seen as influential to industrial rock, while Blush has also described the Albini- fronted project as \\"an angst-ridden response to the rigid English post-punk of Gang of Four\\". After the issuing of the \\"Il Duce\\" single (and between the release of their only two studio albums, Atomizer and Songs About Fucking), Big Black left Homestead for Touch and Go Records, which would later reissue not only their entire discography, but would also be responsible for the release of the complete works of Scratch Acid, an act from Austin, Texas described as post-hardcore, that, according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"laid the groundwork for much of the distorted, grinding alternative punk rockers of the '90s\\". According to Ryan Cooper of About.com and author Doyle Greene, 1980s hardcore punk band Black Flag is one of the pioneers of for the experimental style the band started playing later on in the 1980s. Post- hardcore bands Minutemen and H√ºsker D√º are prominent 1980s post-hardcore bands. H√ºsker D√º's 1984 album Zen Arcade is the band's critical breakthrough. When Zen Arcade was first released, the album received positive critical reception from The New York Times and Rolling Stone. Outside the United States, post-hardcore would take shape in the works of the Canadian group Nomeansno, related with Jello Biafra and his independently run label Alternative Tentacles, and that had been active since 1979. The magazine Dusted noted that the group's 1989's release Wrong was \\"one of the most aggressive and powerful opuses in post-hardcore ever made\\".  The Washington D.C. scene  During the years 1984 and 1985 in the \\"harDCore\\" scene,Grubbs, p. 14 a new movement had \\"swept over\\". This movement was led by bands associated with the D.C. independent record label Dischord Records, home in the early 1980s to seminal hardcore bands such as Minor Threat, State of Alert, Void and Government Issue. According to the Dischord website: \\"The violence and nihilism that had become identified with punk rock, largely by the media, had begun to take hold in DC and many of the older punks suddenly found themselves repelled and discouraged by their hometown scene\\", leading to \\"a time of redefinition\\". When The Faith put out the EP Subject to Change in 1983, it marked a critical evolution in the sound of D.C. hardcore and punk music in general. During these years, a new wave of bands started to form, these included Rites of Spring (which featured The Faith former guitarist Eddie Janney), Lunchmeat (later to become Soulside), Gray Matter, Mission Impossible, Dag Nasty and Embrace, the latter featuring former Minor Threat singer and Dischord co-founder Ian MacKaye and former members of The Faith. This movement has been since widely known as the \\"Revolution Summer\\".Grubbs, p. 22. \\"After hearing the phrase 'revolution summer' at the Neighborhood Planning Council, Dischord employee Amy Pickering had an idea. [...] With the idea of celebrating a new scene's birth, she sent out anonymous letters stating that Revolution Summer was coming and people should be ready. The summer of '85 was indeed that.\\" Rites of Spring has been described as the band that \\"more than led the change\\", challenging the \\"macho posturing that had become so prevalent within the punk scene at that point\\", and \\"more importantly\\", defying \\"musical and stylistic rule\\". Journalist Steve Huey writes that while the band \\"strayed from hardcore's typically external concerns of the timenamely, social and political dissenttheir musical attack was no less blistering, and in fact a good deal more challenging and nuanced than the average three-chord speed-blur\\", a sound that, according to Huey, mapped out \\"a new direction for hardcore that built on the innovations\\" brought by H√ºsker D√º's Zen Arcade. Other bands have been perceived as taking inspiration from genres such as funk (as in the case of Beefeater) and 1960s pop (such as the example of Gray Matter). According to Eric Grubbs, a nickname was developed for the new sound, with some considering it \\"post-harDCore\\", but another name that floated around the scene was \\"emo-core\\".Grubbs, p. 27 The latter, mentioned in skateboarding magazine Thrasher, would come up in discussions around the D.C. area. While some of these bands have been considered as contributors to the birth of emo, with Rites of Spring sometimes being named as the first or one of the earliest emo acts, musicians such as the band's former frontman Guy Picciotto and MacKaye himself have voiced their opposition against the term.Grubbs, p. 27‚Äì28 In the nearby state of Maryland, similar bands that are categorized now as post-hardcore would also emerge, these include Moss Icon and The Hated. The former's music contained, according to Steve Huey, \\"shifting dynamics, chiming guitar arpeggios, and screaming, crying vocal climaxes\\", which would prove to be influential to later musicians in spite of the band's unstable existence. This group has also been considered as one of the earliest emo acts. Fugazi during their last pre-hiatus tour, 2002. The band's influence was summarized by reviewer Andy Kellman with the following statement: \\"To many, Fugazi meant as much to them as Bob Dylan did to their parents.\\" The second half of the 1980s saw the formation of several bands in D.C., which included Shudder to Think, Jawbox, The Nation of Ulysses, and Fugazi, as well as Baltimore's Lungfish. MacKaye described this period as the busiest that the Dischord Records label had ever seen. Most of these acts, along with earlier ones, would contribute to the 1989 compilation State of the Union, a release that documented the new sound of the late 1980s D.C. punk scene. Fugazi gained \\"an extremely loyal and numerous global following\\", with reviewer Andy Kellman summarizing the band's influence with the statement: \\"To many, Fugazi meant as much to them as Bob Dylan did to their parents.\\" It has also been noted that the group's \\"ever-evolving\\" sound would signal a more experimental turn in hardcore that paved the way for later Dischord releases. The band, which included MacKaye, Picciotto, and former Rites of Spring drummer Brendan Canty along with bassist Joe Lally, issued in 1989 13 Songs, a compilation of their earlier self-titled and Margin Walker EPs, which is now considered as a landmark album. Similarly, the band's debut studio album, 1990's Repeater, has also been \\"generally\\" regarded as a classic. The group also garnered recognition for their activism, cheaply priced shows and CDs, and their resistance to mainstream outlets. On the other hand, Jawbox had been influenced by \\"the tradition of Chicago's thriving early-'80s scene\\", while The Nation of Ulysses are \\"best remembered for lifting the motor-mouthed revolutionary rhetoric of the MC5\\" with the incorporation of \\"elements of R&B; (as filtered through the MC5) and avant jazz\\" combined with \\"exciting, volatile live gigs\\", and being the inspiration for \\"a new crop of bands both locally and abroad\\". = Expansion (late 1980s and 1990s) = Post-hardcore band Girls Against Boys in 2006 The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the formation and rise to prominence of several bands associated with earlier acts that not only included the examples of Fugazi and Shellac, but also Girls Against Boys (originally a side-project of Brendan Canty and Eli Janney, which would later incorporate members of Soulside), The Jesus Lizard (formed by ex- members of Scratch Acid), Quicksand (fronted by former Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits member Walter Schreifels), Rollins Band (led by former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins), Tar (which raised from the ashes of a hardcore outfit named Blatant Dissent), and Slint (containing members of Squirrel Bait). Acts such as Shellac and Louisville's Slint have been considered as influential to the development of the genre of math rock, with the former featuring \\"awkward time signatures and trademark aggression\\" that has come to characterize \\"a certain slant\\" on math rock, while the latter presented \\"instrumental music seeped in dramatic tension but set to rigid systems of solid-structured guitar patterns and percussive repetition\\". According to reviewer Jason Arkeny, Slint's \\"deft, extremist manipulations of volume, tempo, and structure cast them as clear progenitors of the post-rock movement\\". Unwound emerged from Olympia, Washington. At the Drive-In performing at Lollapalooza 2012 AllMusic has noted that younger bands \\"flowered into post-hardcore after cutting their teeth in high school punk bands\\". In Washington D.C., new bands such as Hoover (as well as the related The Crownhate Ruin), Circus Lupus, Bluetip, and Smart Went Crazy were added to the Dischord roster. Hoover has been cited by journalist Charles Spano as a band that had \\"a tremendous impact on post-hardcore music\\". In New York City, in addition to Quicksand, post-hardcore bands such as Helmet, Unsane, Chavez and Texas Is the Reason emerged. Chicago, which alongside the Midwestern United States has been important to the progression of math rock, also saw the birth of post-hardcore acts such as the examples of Shellac, Tar, Trenchmouth, and the Jade Tree-released group Cap'n Jazz (as well as the subsequent related project Joan of Arc, which also released their work through Jade Tree). Steve Huey argues that the release of Cap'n Jazz's retrospective compilation album Analphabetapolothology helped spread the band's influence \\"far beyond their original audience\\", while also considering the group as influential for the development of emo in the independent music scene. Champaign, also in Illinois, was known for an independent scene that would give way to groups like Hum, Braid and Poster Children. The American Northwest saw the creation of acts such as Karp, Lync and Unwound, all hailing from the Olympia, Washington area. The latter's music has been considered by critic John Bush as a combination of \\"the noise of Sonic Youth's more raucous passages\\" with a \\"rare energetic flair which rivals even that of Fugazi\\". Texas saw the formation of groups such as The Jesus Lizard (later to be based in Chicago) and ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead in Austin, and At the Drive- In from El Paso. This last band was known for their energy in both performances and music, and for their \\"driving melodic punk riffs, meshed together with quieter interlocking note-picking\\". The genre also saw representation outside the United States in Refused who emerged from the Ume√•, Sweden music scene. The band, which made itself known earlier in their career for its \\"massive hardcore sound\\", released in 1998 The Shape of Punk to Come, an album that saw the group take inspiration from The Nation of Ulysses while incorporating elements such as \\"ambient textures, jazz breakdowns\\", metal and electronica to their hardcore sound.  The San Diego scene  The VSS performing in 1997. While formed in Boulder, Colorado, the group has been associated with the post-hardcore sound developed in San Diego and led by independent labels like Gravity. The early-to-mid 1990s would see the birth of several bands in the San Diego, California music scene, some of which would lead a post-hardcore movement associated with the independent label Gravity Records. This movement would eventually become known as the \\"San Diego sound\\". Gravity was founded in 1991 by Matt Anderson, member of the band Heroin, as a means to release the music of his band and of other related San Diego groups, which also included Antioch Arrow and Clikatat Ikatowi. The label's earlier releases are known for the definition of \\"a new sound in hardcore rooted in tradition but boasting a chaotic sound that showcased a new approach\\" to the genre. Heroin were known for being innovators of early 1990s hardcore and for making dynamic landscapes \\"out of one minute blasts of noisy vitriol\\". These bands were influenced by acts like Fugazi and The Nation of Ulysses, while also helping propagate an offshoot of hardcore that \\"grafted spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics\\". This movement has been associated to the development of the subgenre of screamo, while it also should be noticed that this term has been, as with the case of emo, the subject of controversy. The label also featured releases by non-San Diego bands that included Mohinder (from Cupertino, California), Angel Hair and its subsequent related project The VSS (from Boulder, Colorado), groups that have also been associated with this sound. The VSS was known for their use of synthesizers \\"vying with post-hardcore's rabid atonality\\". Outside the Gravity roster, another band that played an important role in the development of the \\"San Diego sound\\" was Drive Like Jehu. This group, founded by former members of Pitchfork, was known, according to Steve Huey, for their lengthy and multisectioned compositions based on the innovations brought by the releases on Dischord, incorporating elements such as \\"odd time signatures played an important role on its development in spite of the band's music not resembling the sound such term would later signify. In a similar manner, Swing Kids, composed of former members of hardcore bands from the San Diego scene such as Unbroken, Struggle and Spanakorzo, have been described by journalist Zach Baron as the moment in which the \\"hardcore\\" sound of bands like Unbroken effectively became \\"post-hardcore\\", known for \\"covering Joy Division songs\\" and for its sonic \\"jazz-quoting\\" and \\"guitar feedback\\" experimentation features. They were also one of the first bands released under the independent label Three One G, founded by the band's vocalist Justin Pearson and later known for releasing the works of several other post-hardcore, noise rock, mathcore and grindcore groups. Bands like At the Drive-In have acknowledged the influence of the post-hardcore sound coming from the San Diego scene, with vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala citing elements such as \\"screaming vocals with over-the-top emotions, calculated, heavy riffs, [...] offbeat rhythms\\" and an \\"incredible amount of energy, chaos and melody\\" put by these groups as crucial in the development of his band's sound.Grubbs, p. 269  Moderate popularity  According to Ian MacKaye, the sudden interest in underground and independent music brought by the success of Nirvana's Nevermind attracted the attention of major labels towards the Dischord imprint and many of its bands. While the label rejected these offers, two Dischord acts, Jawbox and Shudder to Think, would sign deals with major labels. The former's signing to Atlantic Records would alienate some of the band's long-term fanbase, but it would also help with the development and recording of the 1994 release For Your Own Special Sweetheart, considered by Andy Kellman as \\"one of the best releases to come out of the fertile D.C. scene of the '80s and '90s\\". The subsequent tour for the album and the MTV rotation of some videos would introduce the band to a handful of new crowds, but ultimately the album would remain \\"unnoticed outside of the usual indie community\\". Likewise, out of the Dischord label, Interscope Records would sign Helmet after a reportedly \\"ferocious\\" bidding war between several major record companies, and while MTV would air some videos by the group, which by the time of the release of their major-label debut Meantime, was considered then as \\"the only band close to the Seattle grunge sound\\" on the American East Coast and would be hailed as \\"the next big thing\\", these expectations would \\"never be fully realized\\" in spite of the record's later influence. In another notable case, Hum was signed to RCA in 1994, selling approximately 250,000 copies of their album You'd Prefer an Astronaut fueled by the success of the album's lead single \\"Stars\\", and while the band had established by this point a strong underground fanbase, this would prove to be \\"the pinnacle of Hum's media attention\\", as its follow-up, 1998's Downward Is Heavenward would sell poorly, resulting in the decision of RCA to drop the band from their roster. = 2000s (mainstream success) = Post-hardcore band Hawthorne Heights in 2007 Post-hardcore band The Used in 2007 Record producer Ross Robinson, who was credited for popularizing nu metal with bands like Korn, Slipknot, Soulfly and Limp Bizkit in the 1990s, helped post-hardcore achieve popularity during the 2000s. Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters suggested that Robinson's sudden focus on post-hardcore was his \\"pet project\\" designed to redeem himself of \\"the 'Nu-Metal' scourge of the late '90s\\". Robinson recorded At the Drive-In's Relationship of Command (2000), Glassjaw's Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence (2000) and Worship and Tribute (2002), and The Blood Brothers' ...Burn, Piano Island, Burn (2003); four albums that are said to \\"stand as some of the best post- hardcore records produced\\" during the 2000s. In John Franck's review of Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence for Allmusic, he stated: \\"Featuring extraordinary ambidextrous drummer Sammy Siegler (of Gorilla Biscuits/CIV fame), Glassjaw has paired up with producer/entrepreneur Ross Robinson (a key catalyst in the reinvention of the aggro rock sound) to take you on a pummeling ride that would make Bad Brains and Quicksand proud.\\" These bands allowed the genre to grow and become much more varied with At the Drive- In taking influence from art rock and rock and roll, and Glassjaw using elements of both pop music and heavy metal; furthermore, bands such as Hell Is for Heroes, Hundred Reasons, Hondo Maclean and Funeral for a Friend took significant influence from heavy metal bands like Pantera as well as hardcore bands like The Hope Conspiracy. Post-hardcore achieved mainstream success with the success of emo post-hardcore bands such as My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Alexisonfire, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Thrice, AFI, The Used, Silverstein, Thursday and Hawthorne Heights. Some bands also began to incorporate progressive elements; with bands such as Chiodos, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Circa Survive, The Fall of Troy and Dance Gavin Dance gaining significant success, and bands such as Damiera, The Sound of Animals Fighting, The Bled, Norma Jean and The Chariot being left under the wood works; as well as bands taking influence from metalcore like Ice Nine Kills, Blessthefall and Pierce the Veil, inspired by acts such as Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu. = 2010s (continued popularity) = Later forms of post-hardcore have garnered more mainstream attention with bands such as Sleeping with Sirens, whose third album Feel (2013) debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200 chart, making it one of the highest charting post-hardcore album by any band to date.[ Chart History] ‚Äì Billboard.comQueens of the Stone Age Heading for First No. 1 Album ‚Äì Billboard.com Pierce the Veil's third album, Collide with the Sky (2012), has also received much attention. While Madness (2015) and Misadventures (2016)‚Äîby Sleeping with Sirens and Pierce the Veil respectively‚Äîincorporate more elements of pop rock and pop punk, entering territory that many find to be loosely defined as post-hardcore. Seen also is the emergence of independent post-hardcore bands like The Men, Cloud Nothings and METZ, who are described as moving closer to the dynamics and aesthetics of earlier acts, whilst diverging deeper into external influences. Reviewers have also noted the incorporation of a diversity of elements like krautrock, post- rock, sludge metal, shoegaze, power pop and no wave in addition to previous hardcore, noise rock and post-punk sensibilities. Despite originally being used jokingly, the term \\"The Wave\\" began being used to describe a new wave of post-hardcore bands, with bands generally being experimental, heavily emotional, boundary pushing and disregarding of gimmicks. The term was originally only used to describe Touch√© Amor√©, Defeater, La Dispute, Make Do and Mend and Pianos Become the Teeth, however eventually grew to include bands such as Title Fight, Balance and Composure and Casey. It has also been noted that many bands have been influenced by At the Drive-In.  See also  * List of post-hardcore bands  References   Bibliography  * Andersen, Mark and Mark Jenkins (2003).

Life Princess Sophia as a young child. Princess Sophia was born in Grosvenor Street, Mayfair. Her father was Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the third son of The Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales. Her mother, the Duchess of Gloucester, born Maria Walpole, was the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole. She was privately baptized in a drawing room at her parents' London home, Gloucester House, on 26 June 1773, by Charles Moss, The Bishop of St David's. She had three godparents: The Duke of Cumberland, her paternal uncle; the Duchess of Cumberland, her aunt by marriage; and the Queen of Denmark and Norway, her paternal aunt (who was represented by a proxy). The King had been asked to stand as godfather, but he refused, upset by his brother's marriage to Maria Walpole, a commoner. Sophia was considered as a potential bride for the Duke of Clarence (who later ruled as King William IV), but she expressed no enthusiasm for the match. She lived at Gloucester Lodge on the Gloucester Road from about 1805 and remained there after her mother's death in 1807, but by 1809 she had sold the villa to George Canning. She also lived at New Lodge in Winkfield, near Windsor in Berkshire. In 1811, Sophia visited the Royal Yacht Squadron, at Northwood on the Isle of Wight with her brother the Duke of Gloucester: the Gloucester Hotel, by the Parade, was named in their honour. From 1816, she held the office of Ranger of Greenwich Park and had a home at the Ranger's House, Blackheath, London. Sophia was an early patron of the new seaside town of St Leonard's on Sea, where she stayed at Gloucester Lodge on Quarry Hill in 1831. The building was formerly named the Castellated Villa but changed to Gloucester Lodge in honour of her. She died at the Ranger's House, Blackheath, on 29 November 1844, unmarried.

Part of the district of Guarda, it is 20 km away from the city of Seia, 40 km away from Viseu, 80 km away from Guarda and 320 km from Lisbon, nestled in the Serra da Estrela mountain range. The population in 2011 was 1,053,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 36.25 km¬≤, including the two localities, the town of Loriga and the village of Font√£o. History The remaining Roman-era bridge crossing the Ribeira de Loriga Loriga was founded along a column between ravines where today the historic centre exists. The site was ostensibly selected more than 2000 years ago, owing to its defensibility, the abundance of potable water and pasturelands, and lowlands that provided conditions to practice both hunting and gathering/agriculture. When the Romans arrived in the region, the settlement was concentrated into two areas. The larger, older and principal agglomeration was situated in the area of the main church and Rua de Viriato, fortified with a wall and palisade. The second group, in the Bairro de S√£o Gin√™s, were some small homes constructed on the rocky promintory, which were later appropriated by the Visigoths in order to construct a chapel. The 1st century Roman road and two bridges (the second was destroyed in the 16th century after flooding in the Ribeira de Loriga) connected the outpost of Lorica to the rest of their Lusitanian province. The S√£o Gin√™s' neighbouhood (S√£o Gens), a local ex-libris, is the location of the chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, an ancient Visigothic chapel. =Middle Ages= Loriga was the municipal seat since the 12th century, receiving Forals in 1136 (Jo√£o Rh√¢nia, master of the Terras de Loriga for over two decades, during the reign of Afonso Henriques), 1249 (during the reign of Afonso III), 1474 (under King Afonso V) and finally in 1514 (by King Manuel I). Loriga was an ecclesiastical parish of the vicarage of the Royal Padroado and its Matriz Church was ordered to construct in 1233, by King Sancho II. This church, was to the invocation of Santa Maria Maior, and constructed over the ancient small Visigothic chapel (there is a lateral block with Visigoth inscriptions visible). Constructed in the Romanesque-style it consists of a three-nave building, with hints of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. This structure was destroyed during the 1755 earthquake, and only portions of the lateral walls were preserved. =Monarchy= The 1755 earthquake resulted in significant damage to the town of Loriga, destroying homes and the parochial residence, in addition to opening-up cracks and faults in the town's larger buildings, such as the historic municipal council hall (constructed in the 13th century). An emissary of the Marquess of Pombal visited Loriga to evaluate the damage (something that did not happen in other nearby biggest parishes, like Covilh√£) and provide support. The residents of Loriga supported the Asolutionist forces of the Infante Miguel of Portugal against the Liberals, during the Portuguese Liberal Wars. It ceased to be the seat of a municipality in 1855 after the application of a territorial planning carried out during the XIX century, interestingly the same plan that gave rise to the Districts. At the time of its municipal demise (October 1855), the municipality of Loriga included the parishes of Alvoco da Serra, Cabe√ßa, Sazes da Beira, Teixeira, Valezim and Vide, as well as thirty other disincorporated villages. Loriga was an industrial centre for textile manufacturing during the 19th century. It was one of the few industrialized centres of the region, even supplanting Seia until the middle of the 20th century. Only Covilh√£ out-performed Loriga in terms of businesses operating from its lands; companies such as Regato, Redondinha, Fonte dos Amores, Tapadas, F√¢ndega, Leit√£o & Irm√£os, Augusto Lu√≠s Mendes, Lamas, Nunes Brito, Moura Cabral and Lorimalhas, among others. The main roadway in Loriga, Avenida Augusto Lu√≠s Mendes, is named for one of the villages most illustrious industrialists. The wool industry started to decline during the last decades of the 20th century, a factor that aggravated and accelerated the decline of the region. Geography A bridge over a ravine in Loriga, with the pastures of the valley landscape Known locally as the \\"Portuguese Switzerland\\" due to its landscape that includes a principal settlement nestled in the mountains of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park. It is located in the south-central part of the municipality of Seia, along the southeast part of the Serra, between several ravines, but specifically the Ribeira de S√£o Bento and Ribeira da Nave; it is 20 kilometres from Seia, 80 kilometres from Guarda and 300 kilometres from the national capital (Lisbon). A main town is accessible by the national roadway E.N. 231, that connects directly to the region of the Serra da Estrela by way of E.N.338 (which was completed in 2006), or through the E.N.339, a 9.2 kilometre access that transits some of the main elevations (960 metres near Portela do Ar√£o or Portela de Loriga, and 1650 metres around the Lagoa Comprida). The region is carved by U-shaped glacial valleys, modelled by the movement of ancient glaciers. The main valley, Vale de Loriga was carved by longitudinal abrasion that also created rounded pockets, where the glacial resistance was minor. Starting at an altitude of 1991 metres along the Serra da Estrela the valley descends abruptly until 290 metres above sea level (around Vide), passing villages such as Cabe√ßa, Casal do Rei and Muro. The central town, Loriga, is seven kilometres from Torre (the highest point), but the parish is sculpted by cliffs, alluvial plains and glacial lakes deposited during millennia of glacial erosion, and surrounded by rare ancient forest that surrounded the lateral flanks of these glaciers. Economy Vodafone Ski Resort, Serra da Estrela, in the town of Loriga. Textiles are the principal local export; Loriga was a hub the textile and wool industries during the mid-19th century, in addition to being subsistence agriculture responsible for the cultivation of corn. The Loriguense economy is based on metallurgical industries, bread- making, commercial shops, restaurants and agricultural support services. While that textile industry has since dissipated, the town began to attract a tourist trade due to its proximity to the Serra da Estrela and Vodafone Ski Resort (the only ski center in Portugal), which was constructed totally the parish limits.

Fort Ouiatenon, built in 1717, was the first fortified European settlement in what is now called Indiana.\\"The Ouiatenon Preserve\\" Tippecanoe County Historical Association It was a palisade stockade with log blockhouse used as a French trading post on the Wabash River located approximately three miles southwest of modern-day West Lafayette.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online s. v. \\"West Lafayette,\\" http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9076617?query=Wabash&ct;= (Accessed May 17, 2006). The name 'Ouiatenon' is a French rendering of the name in the Wea language, waayaahtanonki, meaning 'place of the whirlpool'. It was one of three French forts built during the 18th century in what was then New France, later the Northwest Territory and today the state of Indiana, the other two being Fort Miami and Fort Vincennes. A substantial French settlement grew up around the fort in the mid-18th century. It was ceded to the British and abandoned after the French and Indian war. Later, it passed into Indian hands and was destroyed in 1791 by American militia during the Northwest Indian War. It was never a U.S. fort. The original site was rediscovered in the 1960s and is now an archaeological site on the National Register of Historical Places. Every year between the end of September and the month of October, a reenactment of pioneer life called the Feast of the Hunters' Moon is held at a replica of the fort built a short distance from the original site. French period Fort Ouiatenon was originally constructed by the Government of New France as a military outpost to protect against Great Britain's western expansion. Its location among the unsettled woodlands of the Wabash River valley also made it a key center of trade for fur trappers. French merchants and trappers from Quebec would arrive at Fort Ouiatenon in search of beaver pelts and to take advantage of trade relations with the native Wea Indian tribes. In 1717, Ensign Fran√ßois Picote de Beletre (related to another Picot√© de B√©lestre, see Adam Dollard des Ormeaux) arrived at the mouth of the Tippecanoe and Wabash with four soldiers, three men, a blacksmith [Jean Richard, a son of Guillaume Richard dit Lafleur and Agnes Tessier] and supplies to trade with the nearby Wea people, an Algonquian-speaking nation closely related to the Miami people. They built a stockade on the Wabash, eighteen miles below the mouth of the Tippecanoe. Fran√ßois-Marie Bissot, the Sieur de Vincennes assumed command of the fort sometime in the 1720s. The French settled on the north bank, with Wea villages on the south bank.Cayton, 5, 7. The boundary between the French colonies of Louisiana and Canada, although inexact in the first years of the settlement, was decreed in 1745 to run between Ouiatenon and Fort Vincennes. In order to convince the Wea to trade exclusively with the French, the Governor-General of New France, Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, issued permits for trade at Ouiatenon. Traders immediately began to bring a steady flow of goods to the new town.Cayton, 5. Soon the officials in Louisiana sent more men to help Vincennes to hold the Wabash River.Cayton, 18 Ouiatenon was described as \\"the finest palisaded fort in the upper country,\\" and was one of the most successful trading posts in the region.Allison, 25 At its peak level of activity during the mid-18th century, Fort Ouiatenon may have supported over 3,000 residents,Allison, 26 and it was central to a hub of five Wea and two Kickapoo villages.Allison, 25‚Äì26 British period After the surrender of New France to the British in September 1760, Robert Rogers dispatched troops to occupy Ouiatenon. A contingent of British soldiers led by Lieutenant Edward Jenkins arrived in 1761, capturing and occupying the fort.Cayton, 27. On June 1, 1763, during Pontiac's War, the Wea, Kickapoo and Mascouten peoples captured Ouiatenon.Cayton, 28. They surprised Lieutenant Jenkins and his men and captured Fort Ouiatenon without firing a shot. Seven similar posts were also captured in the widespread Indian uprising against the British presence. The British made little use of Fort Ouiatenon after the French and Indian War; it was never garrisoned. In the mid-1770s, the fort was described as 70 yards from the Wabash river. > The Ouiatenon nation of Indians is on the opposite side, & the Kiccaposses > are round the Fort, in both villages about 1000 men able to bear arms.Dunn, > V2, pp. 403‚Äì442.

A British Indian agent named Celeron controlled the fort and tried to evacuate, but was captured with a force of 40 men.*English, William Hayden, V1, pg 204 A British company arrived and hoisted \\"St. George's Ensign\\" in the fort by December of the same year.Lt-Gov. Henry Hamilton's journal describes their arrival, and is available online Shortly after the Americans captured Vincennes in 1779, Captain I. Shelby arrived in Ouiatenon and received promises of cooperation from the Wea. During the 1780s, however, local Indian tribes used it as a base of operations in resistance against the westward expansion of white American settlers. Consequently, President George Washington ordered the fort to be destroyed in 1791. In an operation dubbed the \\"Blackberry Campaign\\", Northwest Territory Governor Arthur St. Clair ordered General Charles Scott to attack villages along the Wabash River, with Ouiatenon as the primary target. Scott crossed the Ohio River in May 1791 and marched to the Ouiatenon area with 750 Kentucky militia.Allison, 77 While Colonel John Hardin led a force to the Big Pine Creek to destroy a large Kickapoo village, Scott led the main force to Ouiatenon. The American Indians who were present evacuated, and Colonel James Wilkinson led a battalion of mounted militia down to the river to fire on escaping Indians. Ouiatenon was then burned to the ground, and the militia destroyed several other nearby villages, including the large village of Keth- tio-e-ca-muck near the mouth of the Tippecanoe River.Allison, 78 38 Native Americans had been killed, and another 58 were taken prisoner, mostly women and children. The Kentucky militia had no men killed, and only five wounded.Allison, 80 Ouiatenon was never again a site of historical significance. Twentieth century The ruins of the old fort were lost, and the land became a farm in the 20th century. The site of Fort Ouiatenon was discovered and confirmed archaeologically in the late 1960s. The Ouiatenon Preserve is located about a mile west of the Fort Ouiatenon Historical Park along South River Road and the Wabash River. It contains the site of the original 1700s era Fort Ouiatenon and nearly 200 acres of land surrounding it. In 1970 the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1930, a replica of Fort Ouiatenon was built by a local physician named Richard Wetherill. Since few useful records of the original structure exist, the replica is mostly confabulation. The Daughters of the American Revolution had placed a small commemorative marker near this spot in 1909. Dr. Wetherill's blockhouse was actually patterned after those more typical of British fortifications (using horizontal logs) and does not match the style or type of construction of the original Fort Ouiatenon (with vertical logs). The replica blockhouse is now the focal point of Fort Ouiatenon Historical Park.\\"Blockhouse Museum\\" Tippecanoe County Historical Association Today, the Fort Ouiatenon Blockhouse Museum is open to tourists in the summer and is the location of the annual Feast of the Hunters' Moon. Many rare artifacts from the original Fort Ouiatenon are displayed by the Tippecanoe County Historical Association during the Feast.

Significance The bridge was constructed between 1906 and 1909 by the Erie Railroad as part of the Graham Line freight bypass and was opened for service in January of 1909. The trestle spans the valley for 3,200 feet (975 m) and is 193 feet (59 m) high at its highest point, making it the highest and longest railroad trestle east of the Mississippi River. Apart from the valley below, the viaduct crosses two roads (Otterkill Rd. and Orrs Mills Rd.), the Moodna Creek, and the Erie Railroad's now-abandoned Newburgh Branch. The open design of the trestle was used to reduce wind resistance and is a major reason why the trestle is still in service today. Current use The viaduct carries Metro-North's Port Jervis commuter line and Norfolk Southern freight trains. The Metro-North Salisbury Mills‚ÄìCornwall station sits near the north end of the viaduct. In summer 2007, timber replacement on the viaduct caused delays on the line due to slow orders placed on it, and required that service be halted during weekend days. As of October, 2009, repairs were underway to several of the concrete piers; traffic remains uninterrupted. It is also a tourist attraction for the small town of Salisbury Mills. Two major roads cross under it, the major one is Orange County Route 94. The viaduct creates a spectacular landscape when viewed from the corner of Orrs Mills Road and Jackson Avenue outside of town, frequently photographed during fall foliage season. The Moodna Viaduct appears as a prominent feature in the 2007 film Michael Clayton. Gallery Image:Moodna_viaduct_across.jpgView point across the length of the Moodna Viaduct from one of the ends.

It is related to methodologies of archaeology. Martin√≥n-Torres and Killick distinguish ‚Äòscientific archaeology‚Äô (as an epistemology) from ‚Äòarchaeological science‚Äô (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials). Martin√≥n- Torres and Killick claim that ‚Äòarchaeological science‚Äô has promoted the development of high-level theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality. In the United Kingdom, the Natural and Environmental Research Council provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.  Types of archaeological science  Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:Tite, M.S. (1991) Archaeological Science - past achievements and future prospects. Archaeometry 31 139-151. * physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with absolute and relative chronologies * artifact studies * environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and pathology of people * mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods) * remote-sensing and geophysical-survey techniques for buried features * conservation sciences, involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation Techniques such as lithic analysis, archaeometallurgy, paleoethnobotany, palynology and zooarchaeology also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science. = Dating techniques = Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological strata and artifacts. Some of the most important dating techniques include: * radiocarbon dating ‚Äî especially for dating organic materials * dendrochronology ‚Äî for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates * thermoluminescence dating ‚Äî for dating inorganic material (including ceramics) * optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ‚Äî for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of quartz within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure potassium feldspars, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications) * electron spin resonance, as used (for example) in dating teeth * potassium-argon dating ‚Äî for dating (for example) fossilized hominid remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated) = Artifact studies = Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include: * X-ray fluorescence (XRF) * inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) * neutron activation analysis (NAA) * scanning electron microscopy (SEM) * laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) Lead, strontium and oxygen isotope analysis can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study's subjects. Provenance analysis has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of exchange.  Influence of archaeometry  Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the \\"second radiocarbon revolution\\" significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the \\"first radiocarbon revolution\\" from 1949.  Locating Archaeological Sites  Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites. The use of remote sensing has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of aerial photography (including satellite imagery and Lidar) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based geophysical surveys often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.

History The run on the Montreal City and District Savings Bank. The Mayor addressing the crowd. Printed in 1872 in the Canadian Illustrated News. LBC's history began in 1846 with the founding of the Banque d'√âpargne de la Cit√© et du District de Montr√©al, or Montreal City and District Savings Bank, by Monseigneur Ignace Bourget and a group of 15 prominent people from Montreal, Quebec. The bank‚Äôs 60 honorary directors included Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, Louis-Joseph Papineau, and Sir George-√âtienne Cartier. In 1965, the bank listed its shares on the Montreal Stock Exchange. In 1980, the Montreal City and District Savings Bank obtained the right to expand its operations throughout Canada. This expansion led to the institution listing its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange three years later, and in 1987, the bank was renamed Laurentian Bank of Canada. In 1974, the bank installed an ATM system called \\"Bancaide\\". Primitive by the standards of the following decade, the nonetheless revolutionary machine dispensed cash 24 hours a day.https://www.laurentianbank.ca/en/about_lbc/my_bank/our_history.html In 1988, after more than a century (1871‚Äì1988) at 176 Saint-Jacques Street, the institution's head office moved to McGill College Avenue in Montreal. In 1993, the bank acquired General Trust Corporation and purchased most of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Fiducie‚Äôs assets from the brokerage firm BLC Rousseau, thus creating Laurentian Bank Securities (LBS). In 2000, it acquired all Sun Life Trust Company stock in a transaction that resulted in the creation of the new B2B Trust subsidiary, now known as B2B Bank. In 2016, the bank relocated all of its Montreal offices, including its headquarters on McGill College Avenue, into a single building on 1360 Rene Levesque Boulevard West in Montreal. =Mergers and acquisitions= Former Laurentian Bank branch located in Montreal, in a historical building still engraved with the bank's pre-1987 name. The bank merged with Eaton Trust Company (in 1988), purchased Standard Trust's assets (1991), acquired La Financi√®re Coop√©rants Pr√™ts-√âpargne Inc., and Guardian Trust Company in Ontario (1992), acquired General Trust Corporation in Ontario, and purchased some Soci√©t√© Nationale de Fiducie assets and the brokerage firm BLC Rousseau (1993). In 1993, the Desjardins-Laurentian Financial Corporation became the new majority shareholder of Laurentian Bank of Canada, following the merging of the Laurentian Group Corporation with the Desjardins Group. The bank purchased the Manulife Bank of Canada‚Äôs banking service network and the assets of Prenor Trust Company of Canada in 1994. In 1995, the bank acquired 30 branches of the North American Trust Company. In 1996, one of its subsidiaries acquired the parent corporation of Trust Pr√™t et Revenu du Canada. A few months later, the withdrawal of its main shareholder, Desjardins-Laurentian Financial Corporation, prompted the Laurentian Bank to become a Schedule 1 Bank under the Bank Act, on par with all the other large Canadian banks.

It is north-east of Exeter and lies on the River Culm. In 2011 the parish as a whole had a population of 8,499 while the built- up area of the town had a population of 7,439 The earliest evidence of occupation is from the Roman period ‚Äì there was a fort on the hill above the town and occupation in the current town centre. Columtune was mentioned in Alfred the Great's will which left it to his youngest son Aethelweard (c.880-922). In the past the town's economy had a large component of wool and cloth manufacture, then later leather working and paper manufacture. A large proportion of town's inhabitants are commuters but there is some local manufacturing, including flour and paper mills. It has a monthly farmers' market held on the second Saturday of every month which is the oldest event of its kind in the South West. It is home to two grade I listed buildings: the fifteenth-century St Andrew's parish church and the seventeenth-century house known as The Walronds. The centre of the town is the only conservation area in Mid Devon and there are seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings in the parish. History =Toponymy and orthography= GWR luggage labels for Cullompton, showing both spellings used. The derivation of the name Cullompton is disputed. One derivation is that the town's name means \\"Farmstead on the River Culm\\" with Culm probably meaning knot or tie (referring to the river's twists and loops). The other theory is that it is named after Saint Columba of Tir-de-Glas, who preached to West Saxons in 549 AD. The Revd Grubb also states that the parish church was probably formerly dedicated to St Columba (although for the last 500 years it has been dedicated to St Andrew) and that tradition records there was an ancient figure or image of Columba. There are 40 recorded spellings of Cullompton between the first recorded use of the name and the present day, and even as late as the mid- nineteenth century three spellings were in use: the post office spelled it Cullompton; in their 1809 first edition the Ordnance Survey map used Cullumpton and the railway station sign said Collumpton. The railway station sign was changed to Cullompton in 1874 and the Ordnance Survey used Cullompton in the edition of their map published in 1889.. This book contains details of the nineteenth-century controversy over the correct name through a series of letters published in the local papers and other documents. It is affectionately known as Cully.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 9 =Roman period= Excavations on site near Shortlands lane On St Andrew's Hill, to the north-west of Cullompton town centre, two Roman forts were discovered in 1984 by aerial photography carried out for Devon County Council. The earlier, smaller fort (the boundary ditches of which showed up in cropmarks) was later replaced by a second, larger fort. The ramparts of this second fort are preserved on two sides as modern field boundaries with substantial earthen banks with hedges on top. The banks on the other two sides were removed shortly before the site was recognised as Roman. The site was made a scheduled monument in 1986. The aerial photography also revealed two subsidiary military enclosures or annexes to each fort. In 1992 a geophysical survey was made of the fort and areas to the east and west and this was followed by a trial excavation to the west of the site. These confirmed the existence of two forts, and the ditch of the second fort was excavated. Pottery from the site was dated from around 50‚Äì70 AD, which is consistent with a previous date of before 75 AD based on finds from fieldwalking. A Roman settlement near Shortlands Lane was excavated in 2009. A large quantity of Roman pottery, burial remains and fragments of hypocaust tile from the second and third century was found. =Saxon period and middle ages= Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873‚Äì888, mentions Columtune (11th-century copy, British Library Stowe MS 944, ff. 29v‚Äì33r) Saxon settlers moved into the Culm Valley in the seventh century and Cullompton was made the site of a minster. In 872 Alfred the Great bequeathed Columtune and its lands to his son √Üthelweard. At the time of the Norman Conquest, it was held by the Lady Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir, the widow of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and mother of King Harold II. In 1067 William the Conqueror passed through the villa of Colitona on his way to besiege Exeter where Gytha was living. In 1087 William the Conqueror gave the manor to Baldwin, his wife's favourite nephew. It was subsequently held by the Earl of Devon for many years until in 1278 Amicia Countess of Devon willed it to the Abbot and Convent of Buckland Monachorum. With the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was sold to Sir John St Ledger. The five prebends of Cullompton (Colebrook, Hineland, Wiever, Esse, Upton) were presented by William the Conqueror to Battle Abbey in Sussex and were later held by St Nicholas Priory, Exeter. In 1536 St Nicholas Priory was dissolved and the last Prior gained appointment as the Vicar of Cullompton. Patronage then passed to the More family of Moorehays. In 1278 the town was granted its first market to be held on a Thursday.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 59 In 1356 the town gained its first water supply by a deed of gift of the Abbot of Buckland.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 85 The water (known as the Town Lake or watercourse) came from a stream rising at Coombe Farm and flowed into a pond near Shortlands. From there it flowed in several open channels to all parts of the town. Water bailiffs were employed to protect the interests of the town and a tradition of \\"possessioning\\" took place. This was a ceremony that took place every seven years where a group of townsfolk would inspect the channel and ensure that it was not being abused. The first recorded possessioning was in 1716.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 87 In the mid-nineteenth century the water courses were used for boiling vegetables, surface drainage and emptying cesspools. A Board of Health Inspector in 1854 concluded that \\"typhus and other epidemic diseases are so prevalent here more so than in any other parish in the Union\\". They were eventually only used to keep the streets clean and continued to flow until 1962 when the town council decided that they were not willing to pay for their upkeep. =English Civil War to the eighteenth century= During the English Civil War the Royalist Earl of Bath tried to raise troops in Cullompton but met resistance from local people. Troops passed through Cullompton on several occasions during the civil war: Sir Ralph Hopton rode with a small troop thRough the town on his way to Cornwall; Cornish Royalist forces marched through Cullompton on their way to join Prince Maurice at Chard as did The Earl of Essex and Thomas Fairfax. There were also troops on the streets of Cullompton again in 1655 during Penruddock's Uprising. In 1678 a local innkeeper, John Barnes was hanged after being found guilty of highway robbery. He had waylaid, with the help of accomplices, a coach travelling from Exeter to London and made off with about ¬£600 but he was recognised by the guards from Exeter, where he had been a taverner.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 148 Another local man called Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He inherited a farm with an annual income of ¬£80 and then married the daughter of a neighbouring farmer with a dowry of ¬£800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around ¬£60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle, who dropped in to visit him on his way home, knocked Tom Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hanged at Exeter Jail. The Cullompton Company of Volunteers (a voluntary body of soldiers) was first raised in 1794 and continued until 1810. The volunteer companies were formed following Britain's entry into the French Revolutionary Wars and continued to exist during the Napoleonic Wars. Cullompton was the first inland town to offer to raise a volunteer company (on 16 May 1794) and on 24 June the volunteers were accepted. The first commander, Captain Jarmin, was a former Marine officer. The company was formed into a battalion with 11 other volunteer companies called the Hayridge (later Highbridge) regiment. It had 1,200 men and three companies were based in Cullompton with a barracks in New Cut. Jarmin died in 1794 and was succeeded by Henry Skinner Esq. In 1801 the company became a cavalry troop and was then disbanded only to be reformed in 1805 when hostilities with France resumed. Many Cullompton men fought in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo. John Wesley preached in Cullompton on several occasions The first Nonconformist congregation began in 1662 when the vicar of Cullompton, Revd William Crompton, was ejected from the established church. He continued to preach and a Protestant Dissenters meeting house was built in 1698 which became the Unitarian Chapel. In the eighteenth century there was a prevalence of Dissent with the local vicar recording in 1736 that of a population of 3358 there were 508 Presbyterians, 133 Anabaptists and 87 Quakers. By 1743 the first Baptist Chapel had been built. John Wesley's journal records preaching near the town in 1748The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 55‚Äì8 and on numerous occasions until 1789. =Nineteenth century to present= These two shops are on the site of the former tannery owned by the Selwood family. The former health centre and magistrates court The Hayridge Centre and car park on the site of the former health centre and magistrates court. In 1805 or 1806 the last bull-baiting in the town took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire destroyed many houses in Cullompton. About two thirds of the town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 115 A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of ¬£5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged. There have been police stations in the town since 1857, when the first Police Station was rented. It had three cells and a petty session courtroom.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 113 A new police station was built in 1974, which underwent a major refurbishment in 2011, to become a police force hub for Mid Devon, with 72 staff members. The town acquired its first steam driven fire engine in 1914 which cost ¬£100 and was paid for by voluntary subscription.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 117 In April 1903 a petition objecting to the renewal of alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, was presented to the Brewsters sessions (magistrates court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 75 In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill TerryThe Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 71 and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalm√©zeau in Brittany, France.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 129 In 1920, a public company was formed to provide an electricity supply for Cullompton which merged with the Bradninch Electricity Company in 1927 to form the Culm Valley Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. A gasworks was set up in Cullompton in 1865 for the Cullompton Gas Light and Coke Co. This was taken over by the Devon Gas Association and nationalised in 1949. The gasworks was closed in 1956 and Cullompton was then supplied from Exeter.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 58 Another serious fire occurred on 17 October 1958, when Selwood's tannery in Exeter Street was gutted by fire; the site was subsequently used by a series of supermarkets. It was run as a Gateway store and then as a Somerfield before closing in 2010. Aldi re-opened on the site in April 2014 following a major refurbishment of the store. The town saw a major expansion in the 1970s as the construction of a bypass in 1969, and its conversion into part of the M5 in 1974, made it a popular commuter town,The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 81 and it continued to expand during the closing years of the 20th century and the first few years of the 21st century. The Mid Devon Local Development Framework Proposals include plans to erect 95 new dwellings a year, and to build of new employment floorspace a year between the start of the plan and 2026. The first Cullompton town website was set up in 1998The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 145 and a new website was created in 2011. CCTV was installed in the main street in 2000.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 146 In March 2010, it was announced that the town's magistrates' court was to be closed due its poor facilities and lack of rooms. It had been suggested that the site might be developed as a town hall or the site used as a car park. but this plan was prevented when a group formed to oppose the proposal to purchase the site for a new town hall were elected to two thirds of the council seats in May 2011. In June 2011, it was announced that two local businesspeople had purchased the site and the building was demolished in March 2012 to make space for a car park. The town got its first permanent library in 1938 in a building on Exeter Hill. In September 2011, a new library opened on a new site, which was four times the size of the old one and cost three million pounds. This was followed shortly afterwards, in December 2011, by the opening of the Cullompton Community Centre, costing 1.5 million pounds. The Tiverton Dramatic Society used the new venue to stage the first pantomime to be performed in Cullompton for 20 years. =Historic estates= Hillersdon House Langford Court, a grade II* listed building Within the parish of Cullompton are situated various historic estates including: * The church of Cullompton and its land was given to Battle Abbey by William the Conqueror. The manor contained five sub-manors called Upton, Weaver, Ash, Colebrook and Henland (now in the parish of Kentisbeare). This manor later passed to St Nicholas Priory in Exeter. * Cullompton. At the time of the Doomsday Book this manor was part of the royal manor of Silverton and so not recorded separately. Before the conquest it was held by King Edward. In 1291 this manor was given to Buckland Abbey by Isabella Countess of Devon. * Padbrook and Newland were also smaller parts of Silverton in Doomsday. * Colebrook was also a Doomsday manor. William Cheever was the tenant-in-chief and it was held by Manfred. Alward held it before 1066. It was given to Ford Abbey by Henry de Tracey. * Hillersdon, was held by Sherwold before 1066. Reginald held it from Odo FitzGamelin at the time of Doomsday and was later held of the Honour of Torrington. * Two manors named Ponsford were recorded in the Doomsday Book and were both held by William from Baldwin the Sheriff. Before 1066, one of the manors was held by Sidwin and one by Edwin. * Langford was also held from Baldwin by Rainer at the time of Doomsday. The manor was previously held by Brictmer. Along with Ponsford it later formed part of the Honour of Okehampton and was held by the Courtneys. * There are two estates named Aller in the Doomsday Book. One of these lay within the Parish of Cullompton and was held by Ralph Pagnell. Within the manor were Whitheathfield and an unidentified place named Frieland. Bolealler may have also been part of this manor. Along with Kerswell, Aller was granted to Montacute Priory by Matilda Peverel and a cell was established at Kerswell Priory. * Moor Hayes, for many centuries the seat of the prominent Moor (alias Moore) family, which was responsible for the Moore Chantry / Moor Hayes Chapel at the east end of the north aisle of Cullompton Church. = Economic history = Cullompton has a long history of manufacturing, first with wool and cloth manufacture, and then later with leather working and light industry.  Cloth trade  In the 15th century the weaving of fine kersies and later serges was introduced to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane was one of the best known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below).The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 89 In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts.The National Archives of the UK, Census Returns of England and Wales 1911, Class RG14, Piece13223, Schedule Number 254 Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.  Mills powered by the town leat  Lower Mill as it is today A leat runs to the east of the town's main street but it is uncertain when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, the southern end of the leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 8, 10, 11 The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.  Tanning  Tanning in Cullompton goes back to at least the sixteenth century and in the nineteenth century there were three tanneries: Crow Green, Lower King's Mill and Court Tannery. The tannery at Higher King's Mill was active between about 1830 and 1875 and employed 12 labourers in 1851 and 9 a decade later. Court Tannery was established by 1871 and had closed by 1906. It was located at the north end of the town behind Court House, which was the residence of the owners of the tannery. In 1871 it employed 21 men and was probably steam-powered. A local tanner, James Whitby, along with George Bodley and John Davis patented an improved bark mill (used to grind bark for producing tanbark used in the tanning process). The Crow Green tannery was situated at the south-west end of the town and was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood's tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm. The building to the north-west of Exeter Hill, which formerly housed the water-powered bark mill, is now an antiques warehouse and the remains of the leat and tail race can still be seen. This side of the site was also the location of the lime yard. The other half of the site, to the south-east of Exeter Hill, which was the location of the tan yard, is now the site of an Aldi supermarket. In addition to tanning, the leather industry included a leather dressing works (founded in 1921 and which closed in 1982)The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 94 and a glove maker, Drevon and Brown.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 92 Higher Kingsmill in 2010  Paper making  The first paper mill in Cullompton dates from 1729, with mills being set up near by at Hele and Higher Kensham in 1767, at Lower Kensahm c1788 and Langford c 1788. These would have been small water-powered vat mills, where paper was made by hand, generally by women and children. Records show that the mill in Cullompton was owned by a Mr Simon Mills in 1757 and was taken over by a Mr Theodore Dart in 1799. There followed a number of different owners of whom one of the most significant was Albert Reed who purchased the mill in 1883. His brother, William Reed, established a partnership with a Mr C King Smith. The Reed & Smith group (which acquired New Taplow Mill in 1950) became one of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and boards.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 91 It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.  Cabinet making  Luxtons cabinet makers was founded in 1800 and grew until it employed 50 people, with workshops at Cockpit Hill and Duke Street. After World War I a retail shop was opened by the firm in Fore Street and it kept going doing retailing and repairs until the mid-1960s. A former employee of Luxtons, William Broom, started his own cabinet making business in 1920 and employed 7 or 8 workmen until the 1930s when the Great Depression meant that by the start of the Second World War, William Broom was the only worker in the firm. After the war, the firm concentrated on repair work and antiques restoration. The firm closed in 1990 with the retirement of Sid Russ who had taken the firm over after William Broom retired.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, pp. 93‚Äì94  Haulage  Mark Whitton founded Whitton's in the early 1900s carrying timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the gas works and local paper mills. In 1923 they bought their first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport and after the war were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 84  Bell foundry and clock making  The bell in the stable block at Killerton was made by Thomas Castleman Bilbie in 1782. A Cullompton man called Chubb travelled widely to repair bells during the reign of James I. In 1745 a vestry meeting determined that in order to reduce the cost of having the church bells repaired, the bells should be cast in some part of the almshouses, and a bell founder be found to work there. In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, created a new bell foundry (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of ¬£1/13/4 (¬£1.67) for premises in the Almshouse building. He recast the six bells of Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas's eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton to take over the bell foundry. Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who moved it to Exeter in 1850. St Michael's and All Angel's in Alphington has a peal of 8 bells cast by Bilbie in Cullompton, at a cost of ¬£108 12 shillings and 8 pence (¬£1.63) in 1749. The bell in the Chapel at Killerton House was made by W. Pannell and Son in 1845. The Bilbie family were also involved in clock making. In 1749 Thomas Biblie (senior) was asked to make a set of chimes for Cullompton church. Thomas II worked on clock mechanisms to play tunes on church bells at East Coker and also at Beaminster. Thomas Castleman is recorded as having made a clock for Cullompton Church in 1811 at a cost of ¬£55.  Other industries  There was also a jam factory, 'Devon Dale Jam' in the 1930s and a foundry.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 11  Governance  The town and civil parish of Cullompton has three wards: North (6 councillors), South (7 councillors) and Outer (2 councillors). The town council first met on 1 December 1894 when it took over from the Parochial Committee,The Second Book of Cullompton, 2007, p. 51 and since 1995 the town has had a mayor elected by the councillors.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 12 It is part of Mid Devon District Council and there are three Cullompton wards in the district council North (2 councillors), South (2 councillors) and Outer (1 councillor). The total population of the wards at the 2011 Census was 9,835. It is also part of Devon County Council and is represented through the Cullompton Rural ward. From Saxon times it was part of the hundred of Hayridge. From 1894 to 1935 it was part of Tiverton Rural District and prior to that it was part of Tiverton Sanitary District and Tiverton Poor Law Union. It may have been a borough in the 17th century but this status was not sustained. It is part of the Tiverton and Honiton constituency and its MP in 2012 was Neil Parish. It was formerly part of the Northern Parliamentary Division of Devon (1831‚Äì67), the North Division (1867‚Äì85), the North Eastern Division (1885‚Äì1918) and the Honiton Division.  Geography  Ordnance Survey street view of Cullompton Cullompton is south- east of Tiverton, north-north-east of Exeter and west-south-west of London. It is at about 70 m above sea level. The parish covers nearly and stretches for along the Culm valley.  Demography  Population of Cullompton Parish 1801‚Äì2010 At the 2011 Census the parish of Cullompton had a population of 8,499. The wards of Cullompton North and Cullompton South contain the urban area and had a combined population of 7,643. In 2011 there were 6,153 people aged 16 to 74 living in the parish. 4,591 were economically active of whom 177 were unemployed and 1,562 were economically inactive of whom 867 were retired. Figures in 2011 on ethnic composition for Cullompton were: White English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British 94.2%, White other 3.6% and White Irish 0.3%. The parish's religious composition was 61.8% Christian, 28.7% no religion and 8.5% religion not stated. = Population trends = In 1660 the population of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town's population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 - only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little from the start of the 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton's population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon's core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.  Economy  Mole Valley Farmers, Cullompton Kingsmill industrial estate In 2001 the proportion of people living and working in Cullompton was 43% with 19% of the town's working population employed in Exeter. = Retail = In 2001 the retail sector in Cullompton met fairly local needs only. The town currently has two supermarkets, Tesco, which opened in September 2008 and Aldi which opened in April 2014. Mole Valley Farmers has a store in the town which sells a wide range of goods including farm requirements, garden supplies and hardware. The Cullompton street market came to an end in the late 1950s but it was revived for a trial period of seven weeks starting on Saturday 28 June 2008. Although in the initial few weeks trading was good, overall takings for the traders were disappointing. The town also has an indoor market in the town hall every Wednesday. A farmers' market held in Cullompton is the oldest event of its kind in the South West. It was Tracey Frankpitt's idea, and after much work, the first market was held on 13 June 1998. She was later consulted by the producers of the long running radio soap opera The Archers and the Cullompton farmers' market was mentioned in one of the episodes. It is held monthly on the second Saturday of the month. There is an active traders group (Cullompton Traders Association) which holds a range of events. The Bullring Market has been relaunched since Dec 2012 and continues into 2013 every Wednesday and Saturday. = Kingsmill industrial estate = Mid Devon District Council owns 11 industrial units at the Kingsmill industrial estate which are let by a variety of businesses. Business based on the estate include Gregory Distribution, who have of temperature controlled storage which they use for a contract to deliver chilled and frozen goods to Spar stores in the southwest. There is also a flour mill, milk depot, marketing and advertising agency and an industrial clothing shop as well as Higher Kings Mill.  Culture and community  The Hayridge Centre in Cullompton which contains the library and also the adult learning services. The town has an annual Christmas parade to celebrate the switching on of the town's Christmas lights and a festival week in the summer which includes the annual town fayre (formerly known as the Cullompton Town Picnic and Classic Car Show). Community facilities improved during 2011, with the completion of two projects. The first was a 'community hub' called 'The Hayridge', which opened in September. The facility, which is open six days a week, has a public lending library and cafe with free Wi-Fi access, IT suites and conference facilities. The office space is used by Cullompton Adult Community Learning which was previously based at the local secondary school. Cullompton Adult Community Learning is run by Devon County Council and offers a range of courses for adult learners ranging from Indian Head Massage to French for Beginners. Courses are run in the Hayridge's learning suites on the first floor. The second major project completed in 2011 was the Cullompton Community centre, which opened in December. This is a building created for community use with sponsorship from St Andrew's church and with grants from Devon County Council and Uffculme Environmental Fund, donations from church members, and money from the South West of England Regional Development Agency. The main meeting area has seating capacity for 180 people, and there are five further meeting rooms as well as offices, kitchens and toilets. A major recreational area for the town is the Cullompton Community Association's fields which cover in the centre of the town. The fields are used for a variety of events, which include a circus, whippet racing and a firework display. The Association is a registered charity which was formed in 1970 to provide a recreation area for the town. It purchased the fields, which are next to the riverside walk along the leat, for ¬£11,500. The site was chosen as the water meadows needed to be maintained to help prevent flooding and it was also close to the cricket and bowling clubs.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 134 Youth activities have been provided by a youth centre called the John Tallack Centre since it opened in 1988.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 36 In February 2008 the Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health opened in Cullompton. The services provided at the site include: the College Surgery Partnership which is a large general practice with ten doctors; complementary therapies provided by Culm Valley Natural Health; self care groups a health food caf√©, a physic garden and a pharmacy run by Alliance Boots. Health care is also provided by the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust, which has run a residential centre called 'The Woodmill' since May 1998. It is the most southerly residential assessment and rehabilitation centre run by the Trust in the United Kingdom, and provides rehabilitation for up to 23 adults with acquired brain injury. Cullompton United Charities provides a number of charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott's almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 135 There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents over the age of 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to ¬£100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items. They also own a building called Community House in the town centre, where local organisations can hire meeting rooms.  Landmarks  The street plan of the town still reflects the medieval layout of the town. Most shops lie along Fore Street with courts behind them linked by alleyways. The length of the high street reflects the prosperity of the town from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century when it was a centre of the cloth trade. The street plan is still fundamentally the same as shown on a map of 1663, with a wider area at the North end where markets were held, roads to Tiverton and Ponsford and a small lane leading down to a mill (now known as Lower Mill). This map has only two buildings with roofs coloured blue (conventionally meaning they were of slate) ‚Äì St Andrew's church and the Walronds. There are two grade I listed buildings in Cullompton: the fifteenth century parish church (St Andrew's) and the Walronds at 6 Fore Street. There are also seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 39 The centre of the town is a conservation area ‚Äì the only one in the Mid Devon area. Hillersdon House, a Victorian manor house is near to the town centre and within the parish. = The Walronds = The Walronds before renovation The Walronds after renovation The Walronds was probably built in 1605 which is the date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys and there are two wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century. It is now owned by Cullompton Walronds Preservation Trust which was registered as a charity and as a private company limited by guarantee in the spring of 1997. It inherited half the building in 2005 from Miss June Severn and bought the other half. In 2008 the building became the only building in Mid Devon to be put on English Heritage's Buildings at Risk Register and received ¬£250,000 from Devon County Council and ¬£100,000 from Mid Devon District Council for restoration work. Emergency repairs costing ¬£15,000 were carried out during 2008. In July 2010 the Heritage Lottery Fund announced that it would provide a grant of ¬£1.75 million to help complete the restoration. Work began with the erection of scaffolding in August 2011. Restoration including restoring the rendering on the house. This had been removed in 1898 causing water to penetrate the fabric of the building. The house re-opened to the public following the restoration on 29 March 2014 with a display of kersey cloth and costumes made by the Walronds Costume making group. The upper floors of the house, the inner garden and car park will be leased to the Vivat Trust for holiday lettings. The trust will retain the three rooms adjoining the path from Fore Street for public use. These comprise a meeting room, a kitchen and a lavatory. Additionally, the Trust plans to convert the garden which stretches back to Shortlands Lane into a park for the people of the town. = St Andrew's Church = St Andrew's Church from the South West. Lane's Aisle can be seen at the side of the churchSt Andrew's church dates from the fifteenth century and is set back from the main street but despite this its tower is a landmark which is highly visible from the surrounding area. The tower is tall with pinnacles on top which add a further to its height. On the west face are the badly damaged remains of a Crucifixion scene with figures of Edward VI and St George to either side. The tower also has a large clock face by Norman of Ilfracombe dating from about 1874. Despite being the first part of the church to be seen when approaching from the main street, it is however the most recent part of the church, being built 1545‚Äì1549. The tower is built in the local red sandstone with carved parts in Beer and Ham Hill stone. The nave and chancel are carried on five pairs of piers and the interior has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At the time of the construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William Froude ‚Äì the engineer given responsibility for this section of the line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel ‚Äì inserted iron stringers to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains. A screen runs across the whole width of the church. At the end of the nave is a Jacobean gallery with four oak pillars about tall. It dates from 1637 and there are sixteen figures carved on it. These figures are typical of the Stuart period and represent the twelve apostles and the Four Evangelists (meaning that Matthew and Mark appear twice). At the centre are Saint Andrew (with an X cross), Saint Peter (with a key) and Saint John (with the chalice). The central window of the North Aisle is a World War II memorial and a World War I memorial is on the other side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (alias Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard. On the south side of the church is the first major addition to the church: Lane's Aisle. This was built 1526‚Äì1529 by a local cloth merchant, John Lane (d.1529). It is fan vaulted in a style inspired by the Dorset aisle at Ottery St Mary and some of the carvings are similar to John Greenway's Chapel at Tiverton. John Lane and wife are buried at the east end of the aisle. = Cullompton Manor House = Cullompton Manor House. The building just in the left of the shot is the adjacent house, VeryardsCullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed building with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock on the top corner of the front of the house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 78The Second Book of Cullompton, 2007, p. 127 The building is currently on the Heritage at Risk Register following a serious deterioration in its condition which led to concerns for public safety, and the issuing of a repairs notice under section 48 of Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 by Mid Devon District Council. =Cullompton Leat= Running parallel to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but the south end of the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.  Transport  = Roads = Cullompton High Street ‚Äì this is the former route of the A38 and is now one of the areas with air quality problems A Virgin CrossCountry train crosses a bridge over the river Culm near Cullompton and heads north for Taunton. To the left is the M5 motorway Junction 28 of the M5 lies within the parish of Cullompton and a short distance from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completedThe Second Book of Cullompton, 2007, p. 62 but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of ¬£1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton. There are two routes for relief roads being considered by Mid Devon District Council ‚Äì a western route and an eastern route. If a lower growth option is chosen it is proposed that only the western route would be constructed. An alternative Outer Eastern Relief Road crossing the M5 at Old Hill was rejected as the existing bridges would need rebuilding, making the cost prohibitive. There is some opposition to both routes ‚Äì a group called Cullompton Against Western Relief Road has been formed to oppose one route and there is also opposition to the eastern route which passes through the Cullompton Community Fields. =Railways= The Bristol & Exeter Railway opened Cullompton railway station when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 the lines were widened to provide two passing loops and a new goods shed and waiting room were constructed. It closed to passengers on 5 October 1964, the site now being used for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is now Tiverton Parkway opened by British Rail in May 1986. Despite reopening plans, Cullompton is only 4.5 miles from Tiverton Parkway as the crow flies.https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/UK_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Cullompton%2C%20United%20Kingdom&toplace;=Tiverton%20Parkway%20Station%2C%20United%20Kingdom&dt1;=ChIJy6MXATCMbUgRUeJA9RLRSMk&dt2;=ChIJqza6fFmUbUgRfl4uN7xZOWk Railway station reopening Devon County Council's Travel Transport Plan includes the reopening of Cullompton railway station, and in July 2016 Mid Devon District Council announced that it would spend ¬£40k on engineering design work to test the viability of their concept for a new station. This matched a previous commitment by Taunton Deane Borough Council of ¬£40,000 and ¬£10,000 contributions from the Town Councils of Cullompton and Wellington. =Buses= The 1, 1A and 1C buses run by Stagecoach South West provide regular bus services to Tiverton and Exeter. There is also a town circular bus run by Dartline. An express bus from Plymouth to Bristol, branded the SW Falcon and run by Stagecoach, stops at Cullompton.  Education  Cullompton has two primary schools: St Andrews Primary School which is a medium-sized primary school with approximately 230 pupils in Key Stages 1 & 2, and nine classes and Willowbank Primary School. The secondary school is Cullompton Community College. It opened in 1964 on the present siteThe Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 17 and became fully comprehensive in 1979. It is now a co-educational comprehensive school for students aged between 11 and 16 with approximately 650 students on roll and in December 2003 it secured sponsorship of ¬£50,000 from The Co-operative Group to enable it to become a Business and Enterprise college. It 2017 it was described as being in the top 10% of schools in the country by Offsted. There was also good support for pupils who have special educational needs and/ or disabilities and the most able pupils were reaching high standards.  Religious sites  The Catholic Church of Saint Boniface As well as the Parish church, St Andrew (see #Landmarks), there are several other religious sites. The Roman Catholic church, Saint Boniface, was built in 1929 by Manuel de las Casas who was descended from the uncle of Bartolom√© de las Casas.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 57 The church served a separate parish until 2014 when the parish merged with that of Tiverton to become the Parish of St Boniface and St James Mid Devon. The Methodist church in New Cut is the third chapel on the site. The first was started in 1764 and the current building was built following a fire in 1872 which did serious damage to the chapel built in 1806. The Unitarian chapel on Pound Square dates from 1913 following the collapse of the previous building in 1911. It is the oldest nonconformist congregation in Cullompton. Hebron Evangelical Church was built in 1962. The Baptist Church is the site of a meeting house erected in 1743 on High Street.The Book of Cullompton, 2001, p. 55  Sports and leisure  Padbrook Park golf course =Local teams and clubs= Cullompton Rugby Club was formed in 1892 and played on thirteen different grounds in and around the town before their current ground ‚Äì Stafford Park ‚Äì was purchased in 1980. In 2008-9 the senior 1st XV team won the Western Counties West League finishing the season unbeaten. On Saturday 9 May 2009 they won the EDF Energy Senior Vase by beating Tyldesley 8-7 at Twickenham. Exeter Chiefs prop Ben Moon formerly played for Cullompton and is now an England International. Ladies rugby started at Cullompton in 1997 and by 2009 the team had two qualified coaches. They currently play in the National Challenge South West South 2 league. Former Cullompton flanker Izzy Noel Smith, currently playing for Bristol has been capped for England. Abbie Brown is another former player who captained England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games where they won a bronze medal in the Rugby Sevens competition. The local football team is Cullompton Rangers who were formed in 1945 and play in Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League. Their ground is called Speeds Meadow. There was also a women's football team ‚Äì Cullompton Rangers L.F.C. who were formed when Exeter City L.F.C. amalgamated with Cullompton Rangers AFC but in 2011 the women's team folded when the manager was forced to leave and a replacement could not be found. Cullompton cricket club was established in 1892 and they play at Landspeed Meadow, by the Cullompton Community Association Fields. There are also a variety of other clubs including several bowls clubs and badminton, running, squash, and Taekwondo martial arts clubs. =Sports and leisure facilities= Culm Valley Sports Centre The town has a sports centre, Culm Valley Sports Centre, which is currently run by Mid Devon District Council. It was opened in 1985 and facilities include a fitness studio, an all-weather pitch, a sports hall, squash courts and a sauna. The town is also home to Padbrook Park ‚Äì a golf course and sporting and recreational centre which first opened in March 1992.The Second Book of Cullompton, 2007, p. 136 The facilities include a Parkland Golf Course, a Golf School, a 40-bedroom hotel, conference suites, health & fitness centre, indoor bowls, fishing lake, beauty salon, restaurants and a sports bar Notable people * Painter and architect John Shute was born in Cullompton. * Architect Charles Fowler was born in Cullompton. * Richard Crosse, painter, was born in Knowle, a hamlet in the parish. * The puritan clergyman Thomas Manton was town lecturer around 1644. * The engineer William Froude lived in Cullompton and was churchwarden in 1842‚Äì44. * WG Hoskins died in the town on 11 January 1992. * The singer Joss Stone lives near Cullompton. *John Lane (d.1528), cloth merchant, builder of the Lane Chapel in St Andrew's Church, Collumpton.

There is no evidence it is beneficial to health. In a number of studies Essiac either showed no action against cancer cells, or actually increased the rate of cancer growth. The Essiac variation, \\"Flor Essence\\" in particular has shown evidence of being harmful, with laboratory tests demonstrating that it increased the growth of breast cancer cells. Background While the formulations can vary, most Essiac formulations contain burdock root, turkey rhubarb root, sheep sorrel and slippery elm. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse who invented the formula. Caisse claimed at some times that the formula had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated, and at other times that she had learned the formula from an unnamed \\"medicine man\\". Neither story has ever been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy.Smith, Huron H. 1932. Ethnobotany of the Ojibwe Indians. Bulletin of the Public Museum of Milwaukee 4:327-525 (p. 361). Slippery Elm is listed; Burdock is mentioned as a plant that is in use \\"among white men.\\" No mention of the other ingredients in Essiac, Essiac itself, or an Essiac-like formula. However, there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American or First Nations culture. Notably, in the original recipe, only one of the plants in the mixture, slippery elm, is indigenous to the Americas; none of the other herbs are native to North America. Caisse changed her story about the origins of the remedy, as well as the ingredients in the formula, several times, and was said to be fond of cultivating \\"an air of mystery\\" around it. The name \\"Essiac\\", which Caisse gave to the tea, is Caisse's name spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective. In 1977, Caisse sold her Essiac formula and trademark rights to Respirin Corporation (a Canadian company and predecessor in title to Essiac Products Inc.), which attempted to commercialize the product. However, the company was unable to show any efficacy of Essiac against cancer. Repeated laboratory tests showed that Essiac failed to slow tumor growth and, in large doses, killed test animals. In a number of studies, Essiac actually increased the rate of cancer growth. As a result, both the U.S. and Canadian governments refused to approve Essiac as a medical treatment. Essiac was instead marketed by Essiac Products Inc. and others as a dietary supplement, subject to much looser regulation and not required to show any proof of effectiveness. Effectiveness Essiac's purported effect on cancer has been reviewed by several major medical and scientific bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society states that \\"Reviews of medical records of people who have been treated with Essiac do not support claims that this product helps people with cancer live longer or that it relieves their symptoms.\\" The NCI states \\"Essiac and Flor Essence have not reported clear evidence of an anticancer effect\\", and the FDA described Essiac as a \\"Fake Cancer 'Cure' Consumers Should Avoid\\". Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center have written that Essiac continues to be a popular cancer therapy despite unsubstantiated claims of its effectiveness. Cancer Research UK also notes that there is \\"no scientific evidence that Essiac can help to treat cancer\\" and cautions \\"Always ask your doctors and nurses about whether any complementary or alternative cancer therapy you are thinking of using might interact with your other treatments.\\" Side effects \\"Essiac may cause headache, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, low blood sugar, liver damage, and kidney damage. Allergic rashes are possible. Rarely, serious allergic reactions have been reported.\\" See also * List of ineffective cancer treatments  References  Further reading * Clinic of Hope: The Story of Rene Caisse and Essiac, by Donna Ivey, 2004, Category:Alternative cancer treatments Category:Health fraud Category:Herbal tea ","title":"Essiac"},{"id":"912562","text":"Africa *Bosha ‚Äì Magela, ruled 1600‚Äì1630 *Ethiopian Empire ‚Äì *#Yaqob (1597-1603 and 1604-1606) *#Za Dengel (1603-1604) *Sennar (sultanate) ‚Äì Abd al-Qadir II (1603/4 -

Sudbury Star, January 30, 2013. was a Canadian politician. She represented the riding of Sudbury in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 2008, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chr√©tien. Marleau was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. She was married to Paul Marleau, a prominent businessman in Sudbury who ran for mayor of the city in the 2003 municipal election. Early life and career Marleau was born Diane Paulette Lebel\\"Friends, rivals remember Marleau\\". Sudbury Star, January 31, 2013. in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, one of three children raised by a single mother in a low-income household. She was a childhood friend of Marie-Paule Charette, who later became a Senator and president of the Liberal Party. She studied Commerce at the University of Ottawa, but left after three years when she married fellow student Paul Marleau, with whom she had three children: Brigitte, Donald and St√©phane, and moved to Sudbury. She worked as the secretary to a medical doctor for five years, prior to the introduction of Medicare. She later said that this experience made her realize the importance of a publicly funded health system, saying \\"I was the one who had to collect the bills. It gave me an understanding of what it means when people are obliged to pay to see a doctor.\\" Marleau returned to Laurentian University as a mature student, and completed a Bachelor's Degree in Economics (1976).\\"Diane Marleau\\", Canada Votes '97, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. She worked as an accountant, managed an office for a firm of chartered accountants (Thorne and Riddell and then with Collins, Barrow-Maheux Noiseux), and operated a restaurant she co-owned with her husband. She also served on the boards of Laurentian University and Laurentian Hospital.William Johnson, \\"\\"Average Canadian' : Health minister exudes determination and competence\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 3 December 1993, A9; Rosemary Spiers, \\"A defender of medicare: 'Ordinary' Diane Marleau has an extraordinary task\\", Toronto Star, 9 December 1993, A25. Marleau worked on Judy Erola's campaign in the 1980 federal election, and later credited Erola as a role model for her own career in public life.Trish Crawford, \\"Erola revs up for another challenge\\", Toronto Star, 19 April 1987, D1. Municipal politics Marleau entered politics at the municipal level, serving as a Sudbury alderman and a Regional Municipality of Sudbury councillor from 1980 to 1985. She chaired the city's Finance Committee, and backed a \\"pay as you go\\" debt-elimination plan that prohibited borrowing on capital investments.Marleau also supported a one-tier regional government. John Sewell, \\"Sudbury's albatross\\", Globe and Mail, 9 July 1985, P13; Rosemary Spiers, \\"A defender of medicare: 'Ordinary' Diane Marleau has an extraordinary task\\", Toronto Star, 9 December 1993, A25; \\"Influential women of North Ontario: Diane Marleau\\", Northern Ontario Business, 1 September 1998, p. S10. She served on the board of governors of Cambrian College, and was a member of the Ontario Advisory Council on Women's Issues.Mick Lowe, \\"Labor boss angered by college governors\\", Globe and Mail, 23 January 1985, M6; Robert Stephens, \\"Window-dressing Liberal team not real power, insider says\\", Globe and Mail, 1 June 1985, P5. In 1983, she chaired the Canadian Games for Physically Disabled.Canada Votes 2006: Sudbury, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, accessed 12 March 2008. After the 1985 provincial election, Ontario Liberal Party leader David Peterson appointed Marleau to a ten-member transition team that assisted the party as it formed government for the first time in 42 years.Robert Stephens, \\"Liberals appoint transfer team\\", Globe and Mail, 31 May 1985, P1. She ran for Mayor of Sudbury in the 1985 municipal elections, and lost to incumbent Peter Wong.Rudy Platiel, \\"Leaders defeated all over the province\\", Globe and Mail, 13 November 1985, A1. She was asked to run for the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1987 provincial election, but declined.\\"Influential women of North Ontario: Diane Marleau\\", Northern Ontario Business, 1 September 1998, p. S10. Marleau was considered to be on the right- wing of the Liberal Party in this period, although she later identified with a more left-wing position.Edward Greenspon, \\"Bird on a wire\\", Globe and Mail, 27 August 1994, D1. Member of Parliament Marleau was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1988 federal election. The Progressive Conservative Party under Brian Mulroney won a majority government in this election, and Marleau served in the Official Opposition as critic for Energy, Mines and Resources. She supported Jean Chr√©tien's successful bid for the party leadership in 1990, and was appointed to a five-person working group to design the party's tax policy.Patricia Poirier, \\"Chr√©tien would scrap GST\\", Globe and Mail, 29 October 1990, A1; Paul Adams, \\"Caucus revolt brewing as Liberals convene\\", Globe and Mail, 15 March 2000, A4. She was named deputy Liberal whip in 1991, and became associate finance critic in 1992.Rosemary Spiers, \\"Chr√©tien names Copps deputy Liberal leader\\", Toronto Star, 31 January 1991, A4; \\"Marchi, Tobin take on Liberal campaign role\\", Toronto Star, 16 January 1992, A12. Marleau criticized Bank of Canada governor John Crow during this period, arguing that his high interest rate policy was driving the economy into a recession.Shawn McCarthy, \\"Can't just cut interest rates to spur economy, Crow insists\\", Toronto Star, 3 June 1993, F1. =Cabinet minister= ;Minister of Health The Liberals won a majority government in 1993 federal election, and incoming Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien appointed Marleau as Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of Amateur Sport on November 4, 1993. This came as a surprise to many political observers, as Marleau did not have the national profile normally associated with Health portfolio. Some have speculated that Chr√©tien originally planned to appoint Marleau as Minister of National Revenue, and assigned her to Health as a late replacement for Sheila Copps and/or Hedy Fry.Ross Howard, \\"Health Minister took turn for the worse, critics say\\", Globe and Mail, 10 February 1994, A6; Edward Greenspon, \\"Bird on a wire\\", Globe and Mail, 27 August 1994, D1. ;;Public health care Marleau is a vocal supporter of public medicare. As Health Minister, she once said that she opposed user fees on the grounds that they discourage poor people from seeking medical treatment until the advanced stages of illness.William Johnson, \\"\\"Average Canadian' : Health minister exudes determination and competence\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 3 December 1993, A9; Rosemary Speirs, \\"'No tax on sickness' federal Liberals vow\\", Toronto Star, 29 January 1994, A1. She intervened on more than one occasion to ensure that provincial governments upheld the principles of the Canada Health Act. Marleau withheld $750,000 in transfer payments to British Columbia in April 1994, after some doctors in that province extra-billed their patients for services.Derek Ferguson, \\"The federal government is cutting health-care payments to [...]\\", Toronto Star, 27 April 1994, A11; Scott Feschuk, \\"Marleau renews threat to Alberta\\", Globe and Mail, 29 November 1994, A1. She defended this decision by arguing that it was inappropriate for taxpayers to subsidize private medicine.Diane Marleau, letter, Globe and Mail, 3 May 1994, A22. The British Columbia government supported her decision, and pledged to work with her in the future against extra-billing.Rosemary Speirs, \\"Ottawa withholds health funds\\", Toronto Star, 19 May 1994, A3. Marleau also expressed concern about Ontario's cuts to out-of-country hospital insurance in the same period, though she added that her government could do little to intervene in this particular situation.See \\"Controversial cuts in OHIP taking place on schedule\\", Toronto Star, 30 June 1994, A8; William Walker, \\"Snowbirds file suit over cuts in OHIP\\", Toronto Star, 17 August 1998, A8. See also Thomas Walkom, \\"Excuse me, is there a health minister in the house?\\", Toronto Star, 18 August 1994, A21 and Diane Marleau, letter, Toronto Star, 25 August 1994, A22. Marleau later took action to stop provincial governments from funding semi-private clinics that required patients to pay facility fees. This was primarily directed against Alberta, where the provincial government of Ralph Klein argued that such fees were not in violation of the Canada Health Act.Tu Thanh Ha and Scott Feschuk, \\"End extra health fees, Marleau demands\\", Globe and Mail, 7 June 1995, A1; John Dafoe, \\"Punishing Alberta\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 January 1995. Perhaps surprisingly, Andrew Coyne came out in support of Marleau's position. See Andrew Coyne, \\"If you're in the medicare system, you play by medicare rules\\", Globe and Mail, 16 January 1995, A12. In 1995, Marleau warned the Alberta government that it would face transfer cuts if it did not shut down its private eye and diagnostic clinics before a federal deadline.Derek Ferguson, \\"Health care under the knife\\", Toronto Star, 13 July 1995, A17; Rosemary Speirs, \\"Marleau plans to crack down on Alberta\\", Toronto Star, 29 August 1995, A17; Craig McInnes, \\"Deadline firm to stop funding private clinics\\", Globe and Mail, 20 September 1995, A3. Alberta agreed to develop a new policy shortly before time expired.The province also called for the deadline to be extended, a demand that Marleau rejected. Alanna Mitchell, \\"Alberta surrenders in clinic dispute\\", Globe and Mail, 12 October 1995, A2; Shawn McCarthy, \\"Deadline passes for penalties on clinics\\", Toronto Star, 16 October 1995, A3. Marleau later indicated that her standoff with Alberta was opposed by some in the Prime Minister's Office, who worried about encroaching on a provincial jurisdiction during the period of the 1995 Quebec referendum.Brian Laghi, \\"Pay for MRI and jump the queue: Who will object?\\", Globe and Mail, 6 December 2002, A14. For his part, Chr√©tien described Marleau's stand against the Klein government as \\"courageous\\" in his 2007 memoirs.Jean Chr√©tien, My Years As Prime Minister, (Toronto: Alfred A. Knopf Canada), 2007, p. 271. After Marleau left the Health portfolio, the Chr√©tien government allowed Alberta doctors to work in both the public and private sectors by selling services not deemed \\"medically necessary\\". This did not technically constitute extra billing, as the services were not covered by medicare. Marleau opposed this decision.Thomas Walkom, \\"Back from the grave\\", Toronto Star, 4 December 1999, p. 1; Thomas Walkom, \\"Liberals are all talk no action on medicare\\", Toronto Star, 21 March 2000, p. 1; Thomas Walkom, \\"PM is no champion of medicare\\", Toronto Star, 28 March 2000, p. 1. Walkom originally wrote that Marleau approved Chr√©tien's compromise plan with Alberta; he corrected himself in the March 28th article. ;;Federal spending The Chr√©tien government's 1995 austerity budget reduced transfer payments to the provinces, and provided lump-sum financing for health and social spending in place of separate budgetary envelopes. Marleau argued that the new approach would free the provinces to spend more money on health, and allow them to better carry out the Canada Health Act's provisions. Some critics argued that the change put medicare at risk, while others suggested it would jeopardize other social programs in favour of health spending.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"Health standards now easier to maintain, Marleau says\\", Globe and Mail, 4 March 1995, A1; Thomas Walkom, \\"Martin's budget has indeed put medicare at risk\\", Toronto Star, 7 March 1995, A21; Susan Delacourt, \\"Copps' new book stranger than fiction\\", Toronto Star, 23 October 2004, A6. ;;Anti-smoking policy The Chr√©tien government introduced a significant tax cut on tobacco in early 1994, to counter powerful smuggling rings that had emerged in Quebec. This decision was opposed by health professionals, on the grounds that it would lead to increased smoking rates among youth. Marleau personally opposed the strategy but could not prevent its implementation, a fact that undermined her reputation in the health community.Hugh Winsor, \\"The political odds are against Chr√©tien\\", Globe and Mail, 9 February 1994, A4; Ross Howard, \\"Health Minister took turn for the worse, critics say\\", Globe and Mail, 10 February 1994, A6; Rosemary Speirs, \\"Minister backs health groups on tobacco tax\\", Toronto Star, 28 January 1994, A3. She argued that the Chr√©tien government still favoured high tobacco taxes as a long-term strategy, and would seek to mitigate the cuts with a youth education program on the dangers of tobacco.\\"Gradual rise in cigarette prices seen\\", Toronto Star, 1 May 1994, A5. In April 1994, Marleau announced plans for legislation requiring that cigarettes be sold only in plain packages without corporate logos. This was strongly opposed by the tobacco industry, and ran into delays in the federal health committee.Martin Mittelstaedt, \\"Marleau aiming for plain-packaged cigarettes\\", Globe and Mail, 8 April 1994, A3; Martin Mittelstaedt, \\"Health Minister's move shocks tobacco industry\\", Globe and Mail, 9 April 1994, A5; Doug Fischer, \\"Committee backs off on plain-package smokes\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 13 April 1994, D8; Ross Howard, \\"Marleau faces fight on plain packages for cigarettes\\", Globe and Mail, 4 May 1994, N3; Barrie McKenna, \\"Hearing finds no evidence plain packages curb smoking\\", Globe and Mail, 13 May 1994, B2; Shawn McCarthy, \\"Plain-pack smokes scheme postponed\\", Toronto Star, 14 June 1994, A10. In June 1994, committee chair Roger Simmons issued a report indicating that Marleau's proposal was viable, but should be deferred pending research as to whether it would actually reduce smoking levels.Peter Morton, \\"Go slow on plain packs: report\\", Financial Post, 22 June 1994, 8. Simmons also raised concerns about possible legal implications. See \\"Plain cigarette packs delayed\\", Hamilton Spectator, 19 November 1994, A17. A May 1995 report found no conclusive proof that plain packaging would reduce smoking, but suggested it would be effective in deterring children from starting the habit.Barrie McKenna, \\"Smoking probe hazy on packs\\", Globe and Mail, 18 May 1995, B1; \\"Teens would puff less if cig packs plain: study\\", Hamilton Spectator, 18 May 1995, C7. Marleau's plans suffered a setback later in 1995, when the Supreme Court of Canada unexpectedly struck down a law against tobacco advertising that had been passed by the Mulroney government in 1988. She expressed disappointment at the ruling,Barrie McKenna, \\"Tobacco ad ban struck down\\", Globe and Mail, 22 September 1995, A1. but later introduced a blueprint for new legislation that would ban all tobacco advertising and severely restrict tobacco companies from sponsoring arts and cultural events. The latter measure was opposed by some in the arts community,Elizabeth Renzetti and Christopher Harris, \\"Smokeless-sponsorship plan shocks artists\\", Globe and Mail, 12 December 1995, D1; Barrie McKenna, \\"Total tobacco ad ban sought\\", Globe and Mail, 12 December 1995, A1; Bronwyn Drainie, \\"Arts community hit by ill-conceived attacks\\", Globe and Mail, 14 December 1995, C1. although polls showed that most Canadians supported the proposal.Craig Sumi, \\"Canadians support government's plan to ban tobacco ads, poll suggests\\", Kitchener-Waterloo Record, 3 February 1996, A7; Dennis Bueckert, \\"Ban backed on tobacco advertising\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 10 July 1996, B1. Marleau left the Health portfolio before the legislation was introduced, and it was left to her successor David Dingwall to introduce modified legislation in late 1996.Scott Feschuk, \\"Ottawa delays tobacco law while finishing 'homework'\\", Globe and Mail, 4 June 1996, B7; \\"Smoke free and free speech\\" [editorial], Globe and Mail, 30 November 1996, D8. The resulting Tobacco Act was passed in early 1997. ;;Women's health Marleau established a section of Canada's Health department specifically devoted to women's issues, and introduced Canada's first Centre of Excellence focused on Women's Health. She brought forward a pilot project to better inform women about breast cancer in 1994,Paul Mooney, \\"Breast-cancer information plan touted\\", Canadian Press, 25 March 1994; \\"Centres selected for Phase 2 funding\\", Canadian Chemical News, 1 June 1994, p. 8. and later introduced a program to ensure that low-income pregnant women would have access to proper nutrition and prenatal care.Jane Coutts, \\"Ottawa allots $85-million to boost newborns' health\\", Globe and Mail, 27 July 1994, A5. In 1995, she announced the first conference on women's health issues sponsored by both Canada and the United States.Greg Coleman, \\"Canada, U.S. to hold women's health forum\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 November 1995, B1. Marleau received a report on new reproductive technologies shortly after her appointment as Health Minister, and welcomed its primary thesis that conception and child-bearing should not become for-profit industries.Doug Nairne, \\"Souls confront science\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 December 1993. She reiterated this view in late 1994, when speaking about the need for legislation to prevent the sale of human sperm and eggs.Derek Ferguson, \\"Ottawa may ban human eggs sale\\", Toronto Star, 13 December 1994, A1. She called for a voluntary moratorium on commercial surrogate motherhood contracts the following year, as a first step toward greater regulation. Some believed this approach fell short of the 1993 report's recommendations, and expressed concern that it would be ineffective.David Vienneau, \\"Moratorium sought on surrogacy contracts\\", Toronto Star, 27 July 1995, A3; Michael Valpy, \\"Creepy genetics unchecked\\", Globe and Mail, 28 July 1995, A15; \\"Fertility clinics indifferent to Marleau's moratorium\\", Globe and Mail, 29 July 1995, A5. Marleau later acknowledged that the voluntary approach was not successful, and indicated that legislation banning the sale of human eggs was forthcoming.David Vienneau, \\"Human egg sales denounced\\", Toronto Star, 17 January 1996, A2. Her successor introduced the legislation in June 1996.Dennis Bueckert, \\"Bill puts limits on technology\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 June 1996, B1. ;;Other In March 1994, Marleau announced that her government would legalize cannabis for commercial hemp production.\\"Cannabis to be legal for hemp\\", Globe and Mail, 21 March 1994, A5. In the same year, however, she introduced a bill to create a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act that would increase penalties for simple possession of marijuana. This was criticized by many in the Liberal caucus.David Vienneau, \\"Confronted by fierce opposition from its own benches ...\\", Toronto Star, 2 June 1994, A14. The bill passed committee hearings more-or-less intact, but was withdrawn from the House of Commons agenda in July 1995.Dennis Bueckert, \\"Small-l Liberals fail in attempt to soften anti-drug bill\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 July 1995, A9; \\"Drug bill pulled from Commons agenda\\", Toronto Star, 16 June 1995, A17. Marleau introduced some programs to alleviate health problems in aboriginal communities during her tenure as Health Minister.\\"Ottawa to spend more on native health\\", Globe and Mail, 26 September 1994, A4; Jim Carr, \\"Healthier lifestyles\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 30 October 1994. A deal between the federal government and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs was delayed in early 1995, as the result of disagreements on whether First Nations health care was a treaty right.Bill Redekop, \\"Natives watch health pact die\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 17 February 1995. The Chr√©tien government set up a 22-member National Forum on Health in 1994, with Chr√©tien as chair and Marleau as vice-chair. They were joined by twenty health professionals and private citizens, with a mandate that focused on matters such as the health costs associated with an aging society, patient choice and responsibility, and research priorities.Rod Mickleburgh, \\"Tax cut threatens health forum\\", Globe and Mail, 8 February 1994, A4. Some provincial governments criticized the structure of the panel, and some in the media argued that Roy Romanow would have been a better choice for chair.Tu Thanh Ha, \\"National forum faces two-fold challenge\\", Globe and Mail, 21 October 1994, A13. In addition to serving as Health Minister, Marleau also served on a committee of cabinet that focused on jobs and the economy.\\"PM calls job creation\\", Globe and Mail, 10 November 1995, A4. ;;Media coverage Marleau's performance as Health Minister was frequently criticized in the national press. A Globe and Mail report in April 1994 argued that the government's tobacco tax cuts had made her the most undermined minister in Chr√©tien's cabinet. Throughout 1994 and 1995, there was frequent speculation that she would be shifted to another portfolio.Susan Delacourt, \\"Performance review\\", Globe and Mail, 16 April 1994, D1. One of the few occasions in which the national media supported her was during her stand against Alberta's semi- private clinics.Edward Greenspon and Susan Delacourt, \\"Where the cards may fall\\", Globe and Mail, 23 June 1995, A11; Andrew Coyne, \\"Health Minister's strong stance calls premiers' bluff\\", Globe and Mail, 16 October 1995, A14. An October 1995 review by Inside Ottawa described her office as the most poorly managed in the Chr√©tien administration. See \\"National notebook\\", Globe and Mail, 21 October 1995, A4. Marleau later acknowledged that she was regarded as a weak minister after failing to stop the tobacco tax cut, but defended her overall performance by saying that she consistently stood up for public health care against powerful opposition.Dennis Bueckert, \\"Ottawa can stop Alberta: Ex-minister\\", Toronto Star, 13 March 2000, 1. ;Minister of Public Works Marleau was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Supply and Services on January 25, 1996. During her term, these positions were amalgamated into the position of Minister of Public Works and Government Services. Her first major act in this portfolio was to introduce Canada's newly minted two-dollar coin at a Montreal civic landmark in February 1996.Alan Freeman, \\"$2 coin to provide windfall profit\\", Globe and Mail, 19 February 1996, A1. ;;Canada Post In late 1996, George Radwanski submitted a report to the federal government on the future of Canada Post. Although he opposed privatisation, he argued that the crown corporation was \\"needlessly and unfairly\\" competing with the private sector in some areas. Marleau accepted Radwanski's primary findings, and said that Canada Post would withdraw from delivering most store fliers and unaddressed junk mail. Canada Post responded by announcing that it would need to dismiss almost 10,000 part- time workers, and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers held a series of protests against the government.\\"10,000 part-timers to lose jobs as post office gets out of junk mail ...\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 October 1996, B1; Gay Abbate, \\"CUPW protests at MPs' offices\\", Globe and Mail, 5 December 1996, A5; Shawn McCarthy, \\"Ad mail not post office business, minister says\\", Toronto Star, 10 December 1996, D9. Several government backbenchers also opposed Marleau's decision. See Gord McIntosh, \\"Marleau facing bankbench revolt\\", Globe and Mail, 13 December 1996, N21. Marleau did not endorse Radwanski's recommendation that Canada Post should concentrate solely on delivering regular mail, and also disagreed with his call for the government to sell Purolator Courier.John Geddes, \\"Report says post office should get out of the courier business and stop delivering flyers\\", Financial Post, 9 October 1996, 1l; Marleau reiterated her opposition to privatization in 1997. See \\"Marleau Outlines Plan For Canada Post\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 23 April 1997, 10:10; Laura Eggertson, \\"Ottawa promises no hikes in stamp prices for two years\\", Globe and Mail, 24 April 1997, B4. Shortly before the 1997 federal election, Marleau announced that the federal government would review Canada Post's urban and rural delivery services and appoint an ombudsman to oversee the corporation.Laura Eggerston, \\"Ottawa promises no hikes in stamp prices for two years\\", Globe and Mail, 24 April 1997, B4. ;;Sponsorship program In November 1996, Marleau and Jean Chr√©tien sought and received $34 million from the Treasury Board of Canada for sponsorship spending earmarked toward national unity. This followed a narrow federalist victory in the 1995 Quebec referendum, and was intended to reduce the threat of Quebec separatism. The program continued under Marleau's successor, Alfonso Gagliano. Some of these funds were later discovered to have been misappropriated, leading to a national controversy known as the sponsorship scandal.Andrew McIntosh, \\"Chr√©tien sought $61.8-million in sponsorship cash\\", National Post, 25 February 2004, A5. Marleau subsequently testified before a public inquiry that she did not personally oversee the program, and that she had declined on procedural grounds to receive direct reports from sponsorship head Chuck Guit√©. Her account was confirmed by others involved in the program, and she was cleared of any wrongdoing by a commission led by Justice John Gomery.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Gagliano deeply involved, MPs told\\", National Post, 26 March 2004, A1; Chantal H√©bert, \\"9 weeks later, still no smoking gun\\", Toronto Star, 23 April 2004, A21; Gloria Galloway and Ingrid Peritz, \\"Defiant Gagliano considers running as an Independent\\", Globe and Mail, 2 November 2005. Guit√© subsequently went over Marleau's head and reported to Jean Pelletier, chief of staff to the prime minister. See Campbell Clark, \\"Ministers gave ‚Äòinput,' Guit√© says\\", Globe and Mail, 23 April 2004, A9. Guit√© testified to a parliamentary committee, \\"Mme. Marleau, she didn't have the feel for what we were doing, so I basically got a comment from PMO, ‚ÄòWell, look, over the next little while, deal with us.'\\" See John Ibbitson, \\"The $100-million that simply disappeared\\", Globe and Mail, 15 May 2004, F2. ;;Other Marleau privatized the Canada Communications Group's printing, warehousing and distribution operations in 1996, but took steps to ensure that jobs, wage levels and benefits would be protected after the sale.\\"Ottawa's printing arm placed on sales block\\", Toronto Star, 23 May 1996, D8; Neville Nankivell, \\"PRIVATIZATION PLANS MEET OPPOSITION FROM UNLIKELY SOURCE: REFORM PARTY\\", Financial Post, 5 October 1996, 23; \\"Toronto firm buys Queen's Printer\\", Toronto Star, 14 December 1996, B7. She later warned the Ontario provincial government of Mike Harris against its plans to download social housing to the municipalities, arguing that any such move would require Ottawa's concurrence.Edward Greenspon and James Rusk, \\"Ottawa, Ontario at odds over social-housing plan\\", Globe and Mail, 7 June 1997, A1. Her successor formally rejected the Harris government's plan in July 1997.Derek Ferguson, \\"Ottawa rejects plan on housing\\", Toronto Star, 24 July 1997, A6. Marleau announced that the Department of Public Works would tighten its anti- discriminatory regulations in 1996, after an employee working on repairs at the Peace Tower complained of sexual discrimination.\\"Rules tougher on bias at job sites\\", Toronto Star, 14 September 1996, A10; \\"Steps to minimize discrimination on federal construction projects announced\\", Canadian Occupational Health & Safety News, 23 September 1996. One of her last major acts as Public Works Minister was to officially open Confederation Bridge, a permanent land link between Prince Edward Island and the rest of Canada.Kevin Cox, \\"Bridge opening marks sad day for ferry crews\\", Globe and Mail, 2 June 1997, A8. In June 1996, Marleau's office released a five-year financial plan on the future of Toronto's Harbourfront. The proposal recommended financial support from both the Government of Canada and the City of Toronto government, and was welcomed by Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall. See H.J. Kirchhoff, \\"Harbourfront plan 'tough, but do-able'\\", Globe and Mail, 5 June 1996, C1. Reflecting on Marleau's tenure as Public Works Minister in 2002, journalist Edward Greenspon wrote that she did not fit the profile of the \\"pork barrel\\" politician usually assigned to the portfolio and that her term in office was necessarily brief.Edward Greenspon, \\"The party's not over for Alfonso Gagliano\\", Globe and Mail, 10 January 2002, A21. ;Minister of International Cooperation Marleau was re-elected without difficulty in the 1997 federal election, in which the Liberals won a second consecutive majority government. On June 11, 1997, she was appointed as Minister for International Co-operation and Minister responsible for La Francophonie.Hugh Winsor and Edward Greenspon, \\"PM bets on familiar faces\\", Globe and Mail, 12 June 1997, A1. Shortly after her appointment, she called on Canada to take a stronger role in developing information technology services in the global south.Diane Marleau, \\"Stop the information revolution, they want to get on\\", Globe and Mail, 19 June 1997, A19; Paul Knox, \\"Developing nations urged to use the Internet\\", Globe and Mail, 24 June 1997, A14. She later wrote a piece supporting microcredit loans, arguing that they would promote women's rights in under-developed countries.Diane Marleau, \\"Plight of millions of women desperate\\", Toronto Star, 6 March 1998, A24. Marleau announced in late 1997 that she would try to convince her cabinet colleagues not to proceed with a scheduled $150 million cut in international aid. She argued that the cut was initially planned as part of a deficit-fighting strategy, and said that Canada's improved financial situation made it unnecessary.Paul Knox, \\"Unicef pushes nutrient programs\\", Globe and Mail, 17 December 1997, A16. The budget cuts were eventually held to $60 million, and Marleau expressed hope that no further reductions would occur in the future.Juliet O'Neal, \\"Foreign aid cuts almost over\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, 27 February 1998, A2. Marleau introduced several aid programs during her tenure as International Cooperation Minister. She committed two million dollars to land mine removal in Afghanistan and Cambodia,Allan Thompson, \\"Canadian cash backs anti-mine campaign\\", Toronto Star, 25 March 1998, A8. and announced $23.8 million for infrastructure, water and environmental projects in Bangladesh.\\"Canada to finance Bangladeshi projects\\", Agence France Presse, 6 April 1998; \\"Canada To Support Bangladesh In Its Efforts To Improve Quality Of Life\\" [press release], Canada NewsWire, 6 April 1998, 09:16. She pledged $500,000 to promoting dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in June 1998,Martin Regg Cohn, \\"Canada invests cash in Middle East peace\\", Toronto Star, 9 June 1998, A12. and promised $100 million over three to four years for Central American rebuilding efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Mitch.\\"Canada pledges $100-million to aid devastated Central America\\", Globe and Mail, 16 November 1998, 16. She also committed over fifty million dollars in new money for Kosovar refugees in March 1999.Jeff Sallot, \\"Canada increases its commitment to the war effort\\", Globe and Mail, 31 March 1999, A14; Brian Laghi and Murray Campbell, \\"Ottawa tops up Kosovo relief\\", Globe and Mail, 23 April 1999, A15. Marleau gave permission for Canadian organizations to send direct famine relief to North Korea in 1997, during a period of widespread starvation in that country. Direct aid to North Korea is normally prohibited for geopolitical reasons, but Marleau and others argued that humanitarian intervention was necessary in this instance.Leslie-Ann Boctor, \\"Hunger's haunting images: North Korea is trying to fight off famine\\", Hamilton Spectator, 18 August 1997, C5. In April 1998, Marleau said that Canada would consider restoring foreign aid to Burma after ten years of sanctions for human rights abuses. She argued that Canada was often able to bring about quiet diplomacy with repressive regimes, after earning their trust through development work.Rod Mickleburgh, \\"Ottawa may resume Burma aid\\", Globe and Mail, 22 April 1998, A1. Her comments about Burma were widely criticized, and she later indicated that the restoration of foreign aid was conditional on improved human rights conditions.Jeff Sallot, \\"Burma gaffe hooks junior minister\\", Globe and Mail, 23 April 1998, A2. =Out of cabinet= Marleau was dropped from cabinet on August 3, 1999. She became increasingly critical of Jean Chr√©tien's leadership after being sent to the backbenches, and developed a reputation as a party maverick.Mark MacKinnon, \\"Marleau fills maverick's role\\", Globe and Mail, 8 April 2000, A4. In 2000, she argued that Chr√©tien was not doing enough to protect medicare and called on the government to block Alberta's plans to allow public funding for private, for-profit clinics.Mark MacKinnon, \\"Ex-minister blasts PM on medicare: Marleau assails her own party's inaction\\", Globe and Mail, 6 April 2000, p. 1; Dennis Bueckert, \\"Ottawa can stop Alberta: Ex-minister\\", Toronto Star, 13 March 2000, 1. Some Liberal MPs were unhappy with Marleau's remarks; when asked about the matter, Chr√©tien remarked, \\"It looks like [bitterness], but I don't know\\". Prior to the 2000 federal election, Marleau aligned herself with a group of Liberal MPs who supported Paul Martin's ambition to succeed Chr√©tien as party leader.\\"Who are you calling a nervous Nellie?\\", National Post, 30 August 2000, A7. Nothing came of this in the short term, and Chr√©tien led the Liberals to a third consecutive majority government. Marleau ran to become Speaker of the House of Commons in January 2001, but was eliminated on the first ballot.Tim Harper, \\"New Speaker Milliken fulfils dream\\", Toronto Star, 30 January 2001, p. 1. In July 2002, she became one of the first sixteen Liberal MPs to openly call on Chr√©tien to resign as party leader.Anne Dawson, \\"16 Liberal MPs willing to declare PM should resign\\", National Post, 25 July 2002, A1. Marleau criticized Chr√©tien's ethics reform package later in the year, arguing that it did not provide sufficient oversight of cabinet ministers. See Diane Marleau, \\"Let rules be the same for all\\", Toronto Star, 14 October 2002, A15. In May 2003, Marleau introduced the first-ever Older Adults Justice Act in Canada. It called for the creation of a national ombudsman on the rights of older Canadians, and sought to amend the Criminal Code to make it a criminal offence to knowingly target the elderly for criminal purposes.Diane Marleau: Biography, Diane Marleau website, accessed 12 March 2008. The legislation died at committee when parliament was dissolved for the 2004 federal election, and was re-introduced by Lloyd St. Amand in the next Parliament. Paul Martin succeeded Jean Chr√©tien as Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister of Canada in December 2003, and led the Liberals to a minority government in the 2004 election. Marleau was re-elected to a fifth term, and was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Treasury Board and the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. There was speculation that she would be returned to cabinet in late 2005, but nothing came of this.Susan Delacourt and Les Whittington, \\"Ottawa hit by political shakeups\\", Toronto Star, 7 September 2005, A2. The Liberals were defeated in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives under Stephen Harper won a minority government. Marleau ran for Speaker again at the start of the new parliament, arguing that she would work to restore decorum during Question Period.Bill Curry, \\"Old schoolmarm' required for raucous MPs, Marleau says\\", Globe and Mail, 24 March 2006, A4. She was defeated by incumbent speaker Peter Milliken. Marleau endorsed Bob Rae in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership contest, and moved to the camp of St√©phane Dion when Rae was eliminated on the next-to-last ballot.Linda Diebel, \\"Dion hunts Ontario support\\", Toronto Star, 31 October 2006, A6. She later became a prominent supporter of Dion's Green Shift plan within the Liberal Party.Diane Marleau, \\"Green Shift a 'Win-Win' for Sudbury, Canadians\\", Sudbury Star, 10 July 2008, A11. Marleau chaired the House Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates in the 39th parliament,Jim Brown, \\"Gomery readies new blast at Tories for sponsorship response\\", Canadian Press, 11 March 2008, 14:57. and was also elected chair of the Liberal Women's Caucus in March 2008.\\"Diane Marleau Elected Chair of Liberal Womens' Caucus\\", Diane Marleau official website, accessed 12 March 2008. Marleau was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Glenn Thibeault in the 2008 federal election. She later said that comments made by Sudbury Member of Provincial Parliament Rick Bartolucci shortly before election day played a \\"crucial\\" role in her defeat.Bartolucci, who is also a Liberal, had responded to Marleau's apparent criticism of his aggressive political style by saying \\"I'll compare styles with Diane Marleau any time and I'll compare results with Diane Marleau any time. I want somebody in Ottawa who is not going to be a deadbeat person. I want someone who is going to ensure that we stand up and fight for our community.\\" Marleau said that these comments reinforced the New Democratic Party's criticism of her record in office. Bartolucci responded that Sudbury residents had wanted a change, and that his remarks did not play a significant role in the result. See Angela Scappatura, \\"MPP's comments hurt campaign: Marleau\\", Sudbury Star, 22 October 2008, A3. Bartolucci's comments were originally reported in Bob Vaillancourt, \\"She took a shot at me: Bartolucci\\", Sudbury Star, 7 October 2008, A2. Marleau later said that she would probably not seek re-election to the House of Commons.Angela Scappatura, \\"MPP's comments hurt campaign: Marleau\\", Sudbury Star, 22 October 2008, A3. The Conservative Party won a second minority government in the 2008 election. In December 2008, the Liberals and New Democrats announced plans to defeat the Conservatives on a motion of non-confidence and form a new coalition government. Marleau was a supporter of the proposed coalition, which dissolved when Stephen Harper prorogued parliament and Michael Ignatieff replaced Dion as Liberal leader.Angela Scappatura, \\"Dion gone, coalition in doubt\\", Sudbury Star, 9 December 2008, A1. After politics Marleau was awarded the Bernadine Yackman Award from the Business and Professional Women's Club of Greater Sudbury in March 2009.Harold Carmichael, \\"Marleau wins a Yackman\\", Sudbury Star, 18 March 2009, A3. She died on January 30, 2013, following a battle with colorectal cancer. Following her death, statements of tribute were issued by a variety of political figures in the Sudbury area, including former mayor and former Nickel Belt MP John Rodriguez, incumbent mayor Marianne Matichuk, incumbent Sudbury MP Glenn Thibeault and provincial MPPs Rick Bartolucci and France G√©linas, as well as by Paul Martin,\\"Former PM mourns Marleau\\".

A different bank operated under that name in the early 1980s. First Continental Bank The first Continental Bank had its origins in 1925 when the Industrial Acceptance Corporation was founded. It became IAC, a financing company, in 1970. Continental Bank of Canada was chartered in 1977 when IAC decided to expand the scope of operations, and began business in June 1979. It had its head office at 130 Adelaide St. West, Toronto. In 1981, it was Canada's ninth-largest bank with 70 branches across the country, and assets at June 30 of $1.6 billion.\\"Continental Bank of Canada Shifts\\", New York Times, September 1, 1981 Also in that year, Continental Bank absorbed its parent company, IAC. In 1985, after a loss of depositor confidence and a run on deposits that affected several small banks, the bank received a line of Credit from the Bank of Canada. The bank and its remaining 55 branches were then acquired by Lloyds Bank Plc of the United Kingdom and became \\"Lloyds Bank Canada\\" in 1986. Continental Bank continued to exist as a chartered bank until 1996 because of a dispute with Revenue Canada. Lloyds Bank sold its Canadian operations to HongKong Bank of Canada in 1990, which became HSBC Bank Canada. Second Continental Bank In 2013 a new bank named \\"Continental Bank of Canada\\" was chartered. Before being chartered, the company had been operating as Continental Currency Exchange. It continues to operate under that name and focus on providing foreign exchange services through its 19 branches across Ontario.

He did show an ability to put the ball in play with a low strikeout rate (one for 13 at-bats). Some of his great contributions came when going to the opposite field in hit and run situations and with infield hits. An avid bunter, he led the league in sacrificial hits in 1991 (19). Though not a threat as a base stealer, he was a competent base runner. In the field, Sojo had a good range and a good arm, showing quick hands and slick moves. Highlights * Hit a two-outs bases-clearing broken-bat double against California Angels Mark Langston to lead Seattle to its very first AL West division title, with four runs scoring on the play: Sojo took third on the throw to the plate, and scored after the frustrated Langston's relay ended up in the backstop (1995) * Hit .400 with one RBI in 10 post-season games [.800 in the WS] (1996) * Batted a career-high .307 in his first full season as a Yankee (1997) * Tied for second on the team with nine RBI in 15 post-season games (2000) * Drove in the World Series winning run (2000) *Became the first man ever to manage a minor league team to a championship and later resume his Major League career. * Five batting titles in the Venezuelan Winter League (.351, 1989‚Äì90; .362, 1990‚Äì91; .375, 1993‚Äì94; .376, 1994‚Äì95; .346, 1999‚Äì2000) * Was called 'The best .200 hitter ever\\" by Yankees radio announcer John Sterling * Reached 1000 hits on Dec. 14/15 (around midnight) in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League (LVBP) with his team, Cardenales de Lara.

She graduated from Meiji University, and became an announcer of Fukushima Central Television. She is married to professional wrestler Kenzo Suzuki. Professional wrestling career =World Wrestling Entertainment (2004-2005)= On June 10, 2004, Hiroko made her debut as the geisha valet and translator for her real-life husband Kenzo Suzuki on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s SmackDown! brand. Her trademark phrase was \\"You cheer Kenzo Suzuki on to the victory!\\" (pronounced vic-to-wee). In November 2004, Hiroko began feuding with Torrie Wilson and numerous catfights took place between the two female wrestlers and Hiroko even wanted to fight her in a bra and panties match. The bra and panties match Hiroko wanted was later changed to a kimono match. In December 2004, backstage during a photo shooting, Torrie Wilson was given a bouquet of flowers from Kenzo.

She married her first cousin, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, when both were 40, and was his widow in later life. In her last years, her niece Queen Victoria was on the throne as the fourth monarch during Mary's life, after her father and two of her brothers, George IV and William IV of the United Kingdom. Dying aged 81 at Gloucester House, Weymouth, Mary was the longest-lived and last survivor of George III's fifteen children (of whom thirteen lived to adulthood). Early life Princess Mary aged six. Princess Mary was born on 25 April 1776, at Buckingham Palace, London. Her father was the reigning British monarch, George III. Her mother was Queen Charlotte, the daughter of Charles, reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Mary was baptized on 19 May 1776, in the Great Council Chamber at St. James's Palace, by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were: *Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel (her first cousin once-removed, for whom The Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain stood proxy) *The Duchess of Saxe- Gotha-Altenburg (wife of her first cousin once-removed, for whom The Duchess of Argyll, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, was proxy) *Princess Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her third cousin once-removed, for whom The Dowager Countess of Effingham, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, stood proxy). Sophia and Amelia in 1785. Painted by John Singleton Copley The King was a devoted father, finding time to regularly visit the royal nursery. Engaging in active play with his young children, he behaved quite informally in contrast to the dignified Queen Charlotte, who had more difficulty abandoning the formal behaviour expected of their class. Despite her outer reserve, however, Charlotte took a role as conscientious as her husband in their children's upbringing. For the royal princesses, the Queen carefully oversaw their welfare, education, and development of moral values. Faced with less time due to her public duties and close marriage to the King, she appointed Lady Charlotte Finch to manage the royal nursery and administer her ideas. According to Flora Fraser, Mary was considered to be the most beautiful daughter of George III; Fraser calls her a \\"bland beauty\\". Mary danced a minuet for the first time in public at the age of sixteen in June 1791, during a court ball given for the king's birthday. In the spring of 1792 she officially debuted at court. Around 1796 Mary fell in love with the Dutch Prince Frederick, while he and his family lived in exile in London. Frederik was a son of William V, Prince of Orange, the Dutch stadholder, and younger brother to the future King William I of the Netherlands. However Frederik and Mary never wed because George III stipulated that her elder sisters should marry first. In 1799 Prince Frederik died of an infection while serving in the army, and Mary was allowed to go into official mourning. Mary's youngest sister and beloved companion Princess Amelia called her \\"Mama's tool\\" because of her obedient nature. Amelia's premature death in 1810 devastated her sister, who had nursed her devotedly during her painful illness. Marriage Mary's upbringing was very sheltered and she spent most of her time with her parents and sisters. King George and Queen Charlotte were keen to shelter their children, particularly the girls. Mary, however, married on 22 July 1816, to her first cousin, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the son of George III's brother, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. On their wedding day, Mary's brother, The Prince Regent, raised the bridegroom's style from Highness to Royal Highness, an attribute to which Mary's rank as daughter of the King already entitled her. William Frederick had initially sought to marry Mary's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales. The historian A. W. Purdue suggests that Mary's motive for marrying her cousin sprang from her dislike of Queen Charlotte's restrictive household. Princess Charlotte observed that the duke \\"is much in love, & and tells me he is the happiest creature on earth. I won't say [Mary] does as much, but being her own mistress, having her own house, & being able to walk in the streets all delights her in their several ways.\\" 1856 daguerreotype of Princess Mary (seated far right). Sitting to her left are Queen Victoria and Princess Alice. Standing is the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). Daguerreotype by Antoine Claudet The couple lived at Bagshot Park, but after William's death she moved to White Lodge in Richmond Park. They had no children together. Mary was the last surviving child of George III, and was said to be the favourite aunt of her niece, Queen Victoria. Princess Mary was quite close to her eldest brother, and she shared his dislike toward his wife, their cousin Caroline of Brunswick. When the latter left for Italy, Princess Mary congratulated her brother \\"on the prospect of a good riddance. Heaven grant that she may not return again and that we may never see more of her.\\"John van der Kiste: George III's Children, p. 106 Death Princess Mary died on 30 April 1857 at Gloucester House, London, aged 81. She was the last surviving child as well as the longest-lived child of King George III and Queen Charlotte.

Chard in the South Somerset district close to the border with Dorset. The civil parish of West Crewkerne includes the hamlets of WCoombe, oolminstone and Henley. The town lies on the River Parrett, A30 road and West of England Main Line railway. The earliest written record of Crewkerne is in the 899 will of Alfred the Great who left it to his youngest son √Üthelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 was described as a royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in the fifteenth century Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy. Local ecological sites include the Bincombe Beeches Local Nature Reserve and the Millwater biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Crewkerne railway station is served by South Western Railway on the main south western railway line. There are local supermarkets and local shops, and some local industry. The town is the birthplace of several notable people and has varied cultural and sporting facilities including those at Wadham Community School. History Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873‚Äì888, mentions land at Crucern (11th-century copy, British Library Stowe MS 944, ff. 29v‚Äì33r)Charter S 1507 at the Electronic Sawyer The name Crewkerne is thought to be derived from Cruc-aera; from the British cruc - a spur of a hill, and the Old English aera - a house, especially a storehouse. The town was known as Crocern, or Cruaern in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son √Üthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy. In the Domesday Survey of 1086 it was described as a royal manor. In 1499, John de Combe, a precentor of Exeter Cathedral and former vicar of Crewkerne, founded Crewkerne Grammar School. The school survived until 1904. The parish was part of the hundred of Crewkerne. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle on a mound to the north-west of the town, which is known as Castle Hill.Fry, Plantagenet Somerset, The David & Charles Book of Castles, David & Charles, 1980. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in its fifteenth century parish church. It later prospered as a coaching stop in the Georgian period. The Manor Farmhouse in Henley was built from hamstone in the early 17th century, but possibly incorporates medieval fragments. The building is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy. Governance The Town Hall The town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town falls within the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been Crewkerne Urban District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. This electoral ward includes Misterton and at the 2011 Census had a population of 7,826. The Town Hall occupies the lower part of the Victoria Hall in the Market Square. The Hamstone building was rebuilt around 1742, altered in 1836, when a south piazza was added after the demolition of the shambles. In 1848-9 it became a museum, reading room and library and was remodelled in 1900 by Thomas Benson of Yeovil to create shops and offices. It is a Grade II listed building. Crewkerne Fire Station Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. It is also part of the Yeovil county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Geography War memorial in Severalls Park The town lies west of the River Parrett. The main residential areas are around the town centre with Kithill and Park View to the South and Wadham Park to the North. In the northern outskirts of the town is the Bincombe Beeches Local Nature Reserve. which is managed by the town council and includes a line of beech trees, some of which are between 150 and 200 years old. Between 2002 and 2005 grants were obtained to improve access to the site and support the planting of new trees. The Millwater biological Site of Special Scientific Interest consists of a complex mosaic of pasture, wet grassland, tall-herb fen, standing and running water, Alder and Willow carr. =Climate= Along with the rest of South West England, Crewkerne has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

Railway Station Crewkerne railway station, in nearby Misterton, is served by South Western Railway on the main south western railway line. Trains operate to London Waterloo (two and a half hours away) via (70 minutes), and in the opposite direction to (under an hour). The station was opened by the London and South Western Railway on 19 July 1860. It was designed by Sir William Tite and has been designated as a Grade II listed building.

Economy Falkland Square Crewkerne is a small market town centre with many cafes, shops and supermarkets. Crewkerne also has a wide selection of public houses. The largest supermarket is the Waitrose store which is around and opened in November 2008. All of the large supermarkets are situated around the South Street multi-storey car park. The other smaller supermarket is Lidl. Ariel Motor Company is based in Crewkerne, and is one of the UK's smallest automobile companies, with just seven employees, producing fewer than 100 cars per year. It was founded in 1991 and changed its name from Solocrest Ltd in 2001. The company's flagship car is the Ariel Atom, an extremely light, high performance car. Religious sites St Peter's Church, shared by Methodists and Roman Catholics St Bartholomew's Parish Church stands on high ground to the west of the town. The first Saxon church was founded before the end of the 9th century as a \\"minster\\", or main church of a Saxon royal estate that included an area which later became the parishes of Seaborough, Wayford and Misterton. This church was replaced after the Norman Conquest with a larger stone cruciform building, with a central tower. This was almost completely rebuilt and enlarged in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This is, for the most part, the church building visible today. It is an excellent example of the Perpendicular style with many unusual and individual features. These include the west front, the nave, the six-light aisle windows and the Tudor-style chapels and windows in the north east corner. The building material is golden-coloured Ham Hill stone, quarried nearby. There is a notable pair of 'green man' carvings within the church. No major alterations have been made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, but there have been many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. Crewkerne also contains one of very few Unitarian chapels left in the West Country, Crewkerne Unitarian Church, a tiny chapel tucked away on Hermitage Street. The Methodist church on South Street is shared by Roman Catholic and Methodist congregations, following the closure and proposed redevelopment of St Peter's Catholic Church. Christ Church, a chapel of ease to St Bartholomew's, was built on South Street in 1852-54. It was declared redundant in 1969 and demolished in 1975. It is now the site of the residential Christchurch Court. Education Wadham Community School The two primary schools within Crewkerne are St. Bartholomew's first school which is located on Kithill, and Ashlands which is located in North Street. The middle school is called Maiden Beech Academy which is located on the B3165 Lyme Road. The school has students from ages 9 to 13 and this is where they do their Key Stage 2 SATS. Crewkerne Grammar School was situated at DeCombe House, until it closed in the late 1960s, before the Grammar school was combined into St Martins School of Abbey Street. St Martins used to be situated in the High Street, until it moved to its current position in the late 1970s. The Senior and Juniors School section closed in 2003, and now serves as a pre-school nursery only. The School Gymnasium was located along Gouldsbrook Terrace, and is still undergoing repairs to the floor and roof. Wadham School has students from 13 to 18 years old and includes those travelling from surrounding villages. In November 2005, Wadham was placed into Special measures after failing an Ofsted inspection. In June 2007 Wadham successfully left Special Measures, after a full Ofsted inspection showed the school had sufficiently progressed. Culture The Henhayes Centre provides conference facilities and has also featured exhibitions. Crewkerne and District Museum is part of a wider heritage centre which includes local archives and a meeting room. The museum opened in 2000 in an old house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council. The development of Crewkerne during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular emphasis on the flax and linen industry is illustrated with a permanent display. Other collections relate to local archaeology, Coins and Medals, Costume and Textiles, Fine Art, Music, Personalities, Science and Technology, Social History, Weapons and War. Sport The Crewkerne Aqua Centre also provides swimming pool and fitness gym facilities to the town, located on the grounds next to Henhayes Park, which used to be the Grammar Schools Playing fields. St. Martins School retained the use of the playing fields until the junior section was closed in 2003, as regular sports days were a tradition dating back to the Grammar school era in the town. A further sports centre is situated on the Wadham School campus. Crewkerne Cricket Club play in the Somerset Cricket League whilst Both Crewkerne Town F.C. and Crewkerne Rangers F.C. play in the Perry Street and District League. Notable residents Thomas Coryat a traveller and writer of the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean age was born in Crewkerne around 1577. Mathematician John Caswell was also born here. A later traveller Colonel Joshua Fry was born in the town in 1699 before becoming a surveyor, adventurer, mapmaker, soldier, and member of the House of Burgesses, the legislature of the colony of Virginia. Another Englishman from Crewkerne who emigrated to the American Colonies was William Phelps who was born around 1599 and became one of the founders of both Dorchester, Massachusetts and Windsor, Connecticut, foreman of the first grand jury in New England, served most of his life in early colonial government, and played a key role in establishing the first democratic town government in the American colonies. Ralph Reader CBE an actor, theatrical producer and songwriter, best known for staging the original Gang Show, a Variety show for members of the Scouting Movement, was born in Crewkerne in 1903. The cricketer Michael Barnwell was born in the town in 1943. Twin towns Crewkerne is twinned with Igny, Essonne and Bures-sur-Yvette in France.

It lies south of London, north of Brighton, and east northeast of the county town of Chichester. Nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the southeast and Burgess Hill to the south. It is surrounded on the other sides by the parish of Ansty and Staplefield formerly known as Cuckfield Rural. Aumale in Normandy has been a twin town since 1993 and Karlstadt in Bavaria since 1998. Cuckfield is known locally for its idiosyncratic system of mayoral voting; unlimited numbers of votes can be purchased for the price of one penny each, with the winner receiving the most votes. The position is purely honorary and the money raised supports local charities.  History  Before the modern local government system came into operation in the late 19th century it was described as being \\"in the hundred of Buttinghill, in the rape of Lewes\\". The civil parish covers an area of 431.58 ha (1066 acres), and had a population of 3,266 persons in the 2001 census, increasing to 3,500 at the 2011 Census. The origin of the name, Cuckfield (earlier spelled Kukefeld, Cucufeld, and Cucufelda), is debated but it is generally associated with the cuckoo which is the village emblem. The village grew as a market town; and an important coaching stop between London and Brighton, since it lay on the turnpike. In 1820, 50 coaches a day were passing through; but when the railway to Brighton was to be constructed in the 1840s, local landowners objected to its projected route: it was therefore built through neighbouring Haywards Heath instead. The village lost its importance as a result. Today the A272 road also bypasses the village centre. It became an urban district in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, and was greatly enlarged in 1934 under a County Review Order by adding part of Chailey Rural District, Cuckfield Rural District (including the parish of Lindfield) and Haywards Heath Urban District. The Parish Council, Cuckfield Museum and village library reside within the Queen's Hall, built in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. The parish church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, has Norman foundations, although the building itself is 13th century. The lych gates are listed buildings and several of the stained glass windows as well as the pulpit and the ceiling's painting were designed by Charles Eamer Kempe (1837‚Äì1907). In 1822, Mary Ann Mantell, wife of Dr. Gideon Mantell, found the first known iguanodon fossils among many others close to Cuckfield at Whitemans Green, where a monument to him now stands though the quarry from where he acquired them is long gone. The author writes: It is also of note here that there is a great deal of material collected by Mantell recorded in museum catalogues simply as having come from Tilgate Forest. It is highly likely that all of this came from Cuckfield (S.D. Chapman, pers. comm.). The fact that this has not been specifically recorded may reflect the fact that in his publications Mantell was habitually no more specific, perhaps because he did not consider it necessary. By saying that his fossils had come from Tilgate Forest, Mantell was actually being quite specific about the stratigraphic unit and area they had come from. The strata exposed in the quarry at Whiteman‚Äôs Green were collectively referred to by Mantell as ‚ÄòStrata of Tilgate Forest‚Äô. He also features in the town's museum. Other attractions include the Elizabethan stately home, Cuckfield Park, to the west of the village. Cuckfield Park is reputedly haunted by its former resident Anne Pritchard Sergison, who was known to the locals as 'Wicked Dame Sergison', and who died in 1748. Bonfire Night celebrations are held here. Another Elizabethan house, Ockenden Manor, is a hotel and restaurant which has had one star from the Michelin Guide in 2001 and again 2004-2016.  Schools  Cuckfield is home to Warden Park Secondary Academy, one of the main secondary schools serving the Haywards Heath area and to Holy Trinity CE (A) Primary School,Holy Trinity Church of England (Aided) Primary School Cuckfield. The latter is one of the oldest schools in the country; it was founded in the early 1500s as the local grammar school. The founder was Edward Flower, a London merchant tailor in about 1512 and endowed by his will in 1521 with lands in Westerham and ¬£100 to be laid out in other lands. Other endowments were added, but in 1589, the original endowment was leased at a perpetual rent of ¬£20. In consequence in 1819, the schoolmaster had an income of a mere ¬£28.8s.0d. In 1844, as a result of local discontent, the Court of Chancery made a scheme reorganising the school like a National School and the existing National School (established in 1812) was discontinued. The teaching of Latin and Greek were discontinued and the fees fixed at a maximum of a shilling. The teacher no longer had to be a clergyman. In 1886, the National Society gave ¬£15 and the school formally became a National School. A proposal to rebuild the school between 1935 and 1950, and money collected for this was returned to the donors. The school was reorganised again in 1964 under the Chichester Diocesan Board of Finance. In 1991, the school was rebuilt on a new site. The old school was acquired by the church in 1992 for use as a church hall.

In 1872, Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet of Kilmaron, left a bequest for the establishment of a mechanics' institute in Dundee and the Dundee Institute of Technology was formed in 1888. As early as 1902 it was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as an educational hub, and was one of the first to be designated a central institution, akin to an 'industrial university'. Abertay gained University status in 1994. Abertay launched the world's first computer games degree in 1997 and in 2017 held a programme of events celebrating 20 Years of Games. Abertay was also the first to offer a degree in Ethical Hacking, starting in 2006. History The following history to 1988 provides a summary account that relies primarily on the book published by Dundee Institute of Technology in 1989, 'The First Hundred Years: 1888-1988'. Where additional sources have been used, post 1988, these have been cited accordingly. =The Baxter bequest (1872)= In 1872 Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet of Kilmaron, died and bequeathed ¬£20,000 (¬£1,581,200 adjusting for inflation) for the establishment of a mechanics' institute in Dundee. The Baxter bequest was intended to create an educational establishment permitting young (male) working mechanics and other craftsmen to better themselves. After some years of delay the trustees finalised a scheme and met the conditions of the bequest and the Dundee Technical Institute opened on 15 October 1888 in grounds, purchased from University College, Dundee, adjacent to Small's Wynd, Dundee. Initially 238 students enrolled and classes were conducted based on the syllabus of the Government Science and Art Department of South Kensington and the City & Guilds of London Institute. Subjects were primarily scientific and technical although applied art was also taught, and jute spinning and textile design were soon added to the portfolio. In 1901 the Dundee Technical Institute enrolled 723 part-time students and was one of the first education hubs to be recognised as a 'central institution' by the Scotch Education Department. In 1906 a new site in Bell Street, Dundee was purchased to build a larger complex to accommodate a growing student population. In 1911 the completed complex was formally opened as the Dundee Technical College & School of Art. The portfolio had by now expanded again to include marine engineering and navigation. The First World War retarded enrolments and growth but the vocational nature of the institute meant that its classes were highly relevant to the war effort. Records show that the first women students enrolled in 1914. After the war, the institute continued to expand adding a new school of pharmacy, and more specialist classes in engineering and building. Commercial classes in finance, economics and accounting were added to support trade at home and abroad. =The Duncan of Jordanstone bequest (1909)= In 1909 James Duncan of Jordanstone left ¬£60,000 (¬£4,993,263 adjusting for inflation) to establish an art college in Dundee. It was only after a lengthy legal battle surrounding this bequest and the right of the existing college to spend the money, that a new scheme was entered into in 1933 permitting the establishment of the Dundee Institute of Art and Technology. The scheme allowed for separate technical and art colleges under a single governance framework. Plans for a new art college were drawn up in 1937. However, owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, plans were delayed and construction did not begin until 1953. The college of art became a formally separate institution, known as the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, in 1975, remaining independent until 1994 when it became part of the University of Dundee. =First degrees (1951)= After the Second World War enrolments and the scope of delivery continued to expand, as did the reputation of the institute. By 1951 the institute was teaching courses that led to examinations for the external degrees of the University of London in pharmacy, mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. In 1955 the National Council for Technological Awards was established and validated diplomas in technology which were equivalent in standard if not in name to honours degrees. In 1963 the Robbins Committee on Higher Education set out the principle that higher education should be available to all who wanted it and were suitably well qualified. The Committee recommended that the government should expand higher education in the UK, particularly in science and technology. =University status (1994)= Abertay University was created in 1994, under government legislation granting the title \\"University of Abertay Dundee\\" to the Dundee Institute of Technology. Since 2014 the University has promoted itself as Abertay University. The university's name was formally changed to Abertay University by an Order of Council on 1 September 2019.Abertay University (Scotland) Order of Council 2019 Abertay was the first university in the world to offer a \\"computer games\\" degree in 1997. Abertay was the UK's first University to be recognised as a Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, and is associated with a business support programme for computer game startups. Campus Kydd Building The Bernard King library Abertay University is situated in the centre of Dundee. The campus buildings include the historic Old College buildings of Dundee Business School, the Bernard King Library, scenes of crime teaching facilities, specialist Ethical Hacking labs designed for research into computer hacking and misuse, and modern computer games labs in the UK Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education. The Bernard King Library in Bell Street opened to learners in February 1998 and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 June 1998. The library was voted best new building in Scotland in the 1998 Scottish Design Awards competition. The building has a stone rectangular 'spine' and a curved glass front mimicking an open book. The Library houses an English Language learning centre, a specialist Law library, and an EU funded IT suite. The library was designed with the digital age very much in mind, and although the traditional books still feature, the emphasis was and is very much on providing access to digital information through online subscriptions. The Student Centre building in Bell Street opened in 2005 providing a home to the Students' Association as well as a trading centre with an art gallery (Hannah Maclure Centre), cinema, student bars, food, and retail trading outlets. Academic reputation Logo of Abertay University on the side of the Bernard King Library Abertay is a small university that receives the majority of its funding for teaching rather than research. Nevertheless, according to the results of the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF2014) published on 18 December 2014, Abertay was the highest ranked modern university in Scotland for 'research intensity'. The University submitted an increased proportion of staff in REF2014 compared to RAE2008 and achieved an average score of 2.15 - which in REF terms means 'quality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality, significance, and rigour'. This was an improvement from the average score of 1.83, 'national recognition', achieved in RAE2008. Submissions were made in: *Unit 4 Psychology, Psychiatry and Neurosciences *Unit 5 Biological Sciences *Unit 7 Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences *Unit 15 General Engineering *Unit 20 Law *Unit 23 Sociology *Unit 26 Sport and Exercise Sciences, Leisure and Tourism Abertay submitted 30% more staff in REF 2014 than in RAE 2008, in seven Units of Assessment (UoAs) compared to six in 2008. Abertay submitted to three Units of Assessment for the first time: Sports Science, Sociology, and Biological Sciences. Abertay scored a proportion of research as 4* in six of the seven UoAs in 2014, compared to only two out of the six units submitted in 2008. Abertay submitted 36% of its academic staff to the REF. Abertay was the first university in the world to offer a \\"computer games\\" degree in 1997. In 2009 it established the UK's first Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, and a business support programme. Abertay runs five of the 25 interactive and games degree courses accredited in the UK by Creative Skillset, the industry skills body for the creative sector, more than any other institution.. =External accreditation= Abertay is externally peer reviewed under the Enhancement-led Institutional Review (ELIR) method by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, Scotland (QAAS), on behalf of the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). All provision is benchmarked to the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). In addition, Modules and Programmes offered at Abertay currently have been accredited by the following professional bodies: Association of Chartered Certified Accountants; Association of International Accountants; British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy; British Computer Society; British Council; British Psychological Society; Chartered Institute of Management Accountants; Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development; Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management; Counselling and Psychotherapy Scotland; Faculty of Advocates; Forensic Science Society; Health and Care Professions Council; Higher Education Academy; Institute of Biomedical Science; Joint Audio Media Education Services; Joint Board of Moderators; Law Society of Scotland; Nursing and Midwifery Council; Royal Society of Chemistry; Skillset Research organisation =Research themes= Research at the University is organised into four main themes. * Creative Industries * Environment * Security * Society Each theme is associated with areas of expertise. The creative industries research theme focuses on: games research; digital cultures; and digital living. The environment research theme focuses on: environmental science and engineering; food science and innovation; environmental and systems biology; and sustainable technology. The security theme on: cyber security; forensic psychobiology; forensic sciences; and law. The society theme on: business, economics and management; the law of employment; media and culture; mental health and wellbeing; psychology; sociology; and sport performance and exercise. Governance The University was established by a statutory instrument The University of Abertay Dundee (Scotland) Order of Council 1994. The Order sets out the objects of the University and the general functions of the University Court to 'conduct the affairs of the University and carry out and promote its objects'. The Order requires that the University Court makes arrangements for a Principal to be appointed to 'discharge the functions of the University Court (other than those delegated to Senate by virtue of article 36(3) of the Order) relating to the organisation and management of the University and to the discipline therein'. The Order requires that the University Court appoints and maintains a Senate, delegating to it 'the functions of the University Court relating to the overall planning, co-ordination, development and supervision of the academic work of the University; and such other functions of the University Court as may be assigned to the Senate by the University Court'. Notable features =Computer games education= Abertay was the UK's first University to be recognised as a Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education. The Centre for Excellence is accredited by Skillset and has strong links with industrial partners from across the broadcast, interactive and wider digital media sectors. These partners include BBC Scotland, BBC Vision, BSkyB, Channel 4, Electronic Arts, Codemasters, Blitz Games Studios, Rare, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, Microsoft and Disney Interactive. = Ethical Hacking and Cyber-Security = Abertay was the first university in the world to have a degree in Ethical Hacking, differentiating from its other cyber-security degree counterparts by taking a more offensive approach to security. The university began to offer this degree in 2006. The university is also home to the Ethical Hacking society, which hosts the Securi-Tay conference, the largest student-run security conference in Europe. = Sport = Abertay University has a wide group of sports teams competing under the university banner. It ranges from Tennis to Hockey who compete in the BUCS (British Universities & Colleges Sport) leagues, which competes against other universities and colleges in Scotland. The Football, Hockey and Basketball teams have their 1st teams competing in the highest league (BUCS 1A). The University has a fierce rivalry with Dundee University, competing in a yearly Varsity competition. There are numerous notable athletic alumni that have undertaken their degrees in the University with the University facilitating elite sports men and women, who have either represented their country or compete at a high level. =Electives for the 21st century= An electives scheme provides opportunities, from 2015/16, for all early years students to broaden their intellectual horizon beyond the standard single or joint Honours degree combinations on offer. Symbols =Coat of arms= Prior to 1953 no coat of arms was registered in the name of the college. The original Ensigns Armorial were recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland on 25 July 1953, in the name of Dundee Technical College. They were subsequently transferred to Dundee College of Technology in 1977, then to Dundee Institute of Technology in 1988 and, finally, to the University of Abertay Dundee on 25 April 1994. The arms are described as: \\"Party per fess, in chief tierced in pale: 1st, Ermine, a chevron engrailed between three mullets Gules; 2nd, Azure, three chevronels Or; 3rd, Argent, a spray of oak Proper fructed Or between three pheons Azure; in base Azure, a pot of three flowering lilies Argent between two flanches Or each charged with a book Gules.\\" The top left sector is taken from the arms of Sir David Baxter of Kilmaron, who bequeathed a significant sum of money in order to establish the original Dundee Technical Institute in 1888. The top right sector is taken from the arms of Sir William Dalgleish, who was the senior trustee of what by then was known as Dundee Technical College and School of Art, and who opened the first building ‚Äì Old College ‚Äì on Abertay's present campus on Bell Street in 1911. The top middle sector of three chevrons is the heraldic symbol for \\"technical\\". The pot of lilies in base is taken from the arms of the City of Dundee, with the books on either side representing education. =Motto= Beatus homo qui invenit sapientiam (Blessed is the one who finds wisdom). =Tartan= Aaron McCauley, a graduate of Abertay, designed and registered the Abertay tartan in 2003. The tartan is based on Abertay's promotional colours of dark blue, red, gold and green from its coat of arms. Student life =Accommodation= *Lyon Street *Meadowside Hall *Keiller Court *Parker House - iQ Student Accommodation =Students' centre= The student centre building was constructed in 2005 at a cost of ¬£6 million. It provides a focal point for student entertainment and recreation and contains numerous outlets including Aroma coffee bar, the Common Room E-Bar and Campus Shop. The Abertay Students' Association (Abertay SA) is based in the second floor of the Kydd building.

Pegasus-class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility, and carried a powerful armament for their size. Naming Named for the constellation, Pegasus was originally intended to be named Delphinus, but during development and discussion it was feared it could be nicknamed 'dull-penis', so the name was dropped. In service it earned the nickname 'Pegasorous'. As this vessel was constructed several years before the rest of the class, there are some minor differences, notably in the fire- control systems of the respective craft. Purpose Pegasus-class hydrofoils were designed to operate offensively against hostile surface combatants and other surface craft; and conduct surveillance, screening and special operations. The six PHMs of the Pegasus class formed a single squadron which operated from Key West. They were the Navy's fastest ships when foil borne and driven by their single gas turbine. They had good range on their diesels, excellent sea keeping qualities, good acceleration, and a potent punch. They established an unusually high availability rate while participating in a variety of missions, including significant involvement in the national drug interdiction program. Project The PHM project was started in early 1970 by CNO Admiral Elmo Zumwalt in an effort to increase the Navy's number of surface combatants. The project called for a cost-effective hydrofoil boat designed to operate in coastal waters and equipped to fulfill the missions of destroyers and frigates in those areas so that these larger ships could be deployed to areas where they are needed most. These missions included surface surveillance as well as immediate responses such as surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) to any hostile actions conducted by enemy navies. The PHM project was not only a US project. Other countries involved included Italy, Germany, Canada and Great Britain. During the initial phase of the project it was planned to build up to 100 hydrofoil boats for the NATO navies. Following the retirement of Admiral Zumwalt the Navy reduced funding for the PHM project. Due to the lack of money it was decided to use available monies for larger fleet units instead. The increasing costs of the PHM project finally resulted in the completion of only one PHM, Pegasus, although the construction of this ship had to be stopped for a while in 1974 again due to the lack of funds. At that time, the ship was only 20% completed. Although PHM 3 - 6 had already been funded in FY 74 (PHM 2 in FY 73), construction of these ships did not start until 6 April 1977, when Secretary of Defense Harold Brown announced that the whole project (with the exception of USS Pegasus) was suspended. Congress now insisted on the completion of the last five ships since they had already been funded. In August 1977, Secretary of Defense Brown reactivated the PHM project and construction of the ships resumed, but the four countries involved in the project had lost interest in the PHM program. The last of the US Navy's hydrofoil boats was commissioned in 1982. Collision On 30 September 1981, Pegasus was involved in a collision with , but was later repaired.

Pegasus class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility. Despite being small in size, they carried a large 76 mm gun. Aries was named for the constellation. Aries was laid down on 7 January 1980 at Renton, Seattle, Washington, by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, launched on 5 November 1981, sponsored by Mrs. Earl B. Fowler, the wife of Vice Admiral Earl B. Fowler, Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, and was commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 18 September 1982, Lieutenant Commander Carl E. Weiscopf in command. Service history Aries operated in Puget Sound until 23 November 1982 when she got underway for Key West, Florida, her assigned home port. She made calls at San Francisco and San Diego on her way down the California coast. The guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat transited the Panama Canal on 11 December and arrived in Key West on the 15th. After the holidays, the warship began operations from her base. Acceptance trials came late in January 1983, and, in February, she carried out her first law enforcement operation against drug smugglers in cooperation with the Coast Guard. March and April brought training duty out of Key West and two more missions assisting the Coast Guard in its efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. In each instance, Aries embarked a detachment of Coast Guardsmen and carried out the assignment under the operational control of the Commandant, Coast Guard District 7, based at Miami, Florida. Early in May, she entered the yard at Atlantic Drydock in Jacksonville, Florida, for six weeks of post-shakedown repairs and modifications. Halfway through June, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat returned to Key West and resumed a normal schedule of duty out of her home port. Though the bulk of her operations for the rest of the year consisted of routine training evolutions, tests, and equipment calibrations and checks, Aries participated in another anti- smuggling sweep during the second week in August and visited Nassau in the Bahamas later that month. Normal duty in the waters near Key West kept Aries busy for the remainder of 1983 and during the first few weeks of 1984. In February 1984, the warship expanded her sphere of operations to include the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of Central America. Late in April, she participated in Exercise \\"Ocean Venture 84\\". Aries returned to Key West for normal operations at the end of May and the beginning of June. On 11 June, however, she departed Key West for the waters around Puerto Rico to participate in the initial phase of UNITAS XXV, the 1984 edition of the annual series of multilateral exercises carried out with units of various Latin American navies. At the end of June, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat proceeded back to Key West to resume normal duty. In August, Aries took part in maneuvers conducted off the east coast of Central America. Back at Key West at the end of August, she began operating again on a training schedule. The guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat spent the rest of 1984 and the first part of 1985 engaged in operations in the immediate vicinity of Key West. In March, she traveled to Puerto Rico to participate in a readiness exercise, READEX 1-85. More duty out of her home port occupied the warships time in April. At the beginning of May, she voyaged to Onslow Beach, where she took part in Exercise \\"Solid Shield 85.\\" The middle of June found Aries in the waters near Puerto Rico again for the initial phase of UNITAS XXVI. During July and early August, the warship carried out normal operations from her base at Key West. Her third fleet readiness exercise occupied the last half of August. In September, Aries resumed local operations from Key West and remained so occupied for the rest of 1985. At the end of the first week in January 1986, she moved to Mayport, Florida, for a three-month availability. At the end of April, she proceeded back to Key West where she operated until late in July. At that time, she embarked upon a cruise that took her to the Caribbean for another UNITAS exercise during which she made port calls at La Guaira, Venezuela, and at St. Johns, Antigua. Aries returned to Key West on 14 August and carried out local training missions until mid-October. On 14 October, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat set sail for Little Creek, Virginia, to take part in a special project for the Chief of Naval Operations. Over the next two months, she divided her time between her home port and operations off the Virginia Capes. She concluded her development work for 1986 on 12 December and headed back to Key West on the 16th. Aries reentered her home port on 17 December and spent the remainder of the year in that vicinity. Aries was decommissioned on 30 July 1993. =Memorial= USS Aries PHM-5 Hydrofoil Memorial, Inc obtained Aries for rehabilitation as a memorial located on the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri at in 1996. However, , museum founder Eliot James has said that the museum may not remain in Missouri and that he will probably move Aries and the museum south, near the Gulf of Mexico. Dedicated to preserving hydrofoils of all types, the museum is centered around Aries. James, knowing nothing about hydrofoils, bought the 133-foot Aries for scrap in 1996. Finding it in good shape, he sailed from Charleston, South Carolina to Missouri and decided to restore it. He has since added more hydrofoils and hopes to create a national hydrofoil museum, with the vessels moving around under their own power to waterfront festivals and other events. ‚ÄúOur intention is not to just have static displays,‚Äù said Eliot. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all about making hydrofoils fly.‚ÄùKitsap Sun (Washington) article by Ed Friedrich dated 8 June 2010, as extracted from 9 Jun 2010 US Navy Chief of Information \\"CHINFO Clips.\\" Currently located on the bank of the Gasconade River, upstream from the confluence with the Missouri River.

Pegasus class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility, and carried a powerful (for their size) armament. Named for the constellation, Aquila (\\"Eagle\\") was laid down on 10 July 1979 at Seattle, Washington, by Boeing Marine Systems; launched on 16 September 1981; sponsored by Mrs. John D. Bulkeley, the wife of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley, World War II, PT-boat hero; and commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 26 June 1982, Lieutenant Commander David M. Lee in command. Service history After completing her fitting out, Aquila got underway from Bremerton, Washington, on 15 July in company with and and shaped a course for her home port, Key West, Florida. Frederick escorted the two guided-missile hydrofoil gunboats as far as Rodman in the Canal Zone where took over. Aquila and her traveling companions transited the Panama Canal on 8 August and arrived in Key West three days later. The warship spent the remainder of 1982 conducting shakedown and other training out of her base at the Trumbo Point Annex, Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida. During the first quarter of 1983, post-shakedown repairs occupied her time. That spring, Aquila embarked upon a schedule of normal training duties out of Key West that occupied her time through the summer and into the all of 1983. From 10 to 20 October, she joined Taurus and for special operations in the Caribbean Sea. In mid-November, Aquila and Taurus joined at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to test the feasibility of operating guided-missile frigates and guided-missile hydrofoil gunboats together in the same task organization. However, demands attendant to the American presence in Grenada forestalled the experiment. Aquila, Taurus, and Aubrey Fitch headed for Grenada where they performed patrol duties and relief work until the middle of December. Aquila returned to Key West on 16 December and spent the last two weeks of the year in port. Holiday leave and upkeep ended early in January 1984, and Aquila reembarked upon normal operations out of her base at Key West. In May, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat added another duty to her busy training schedule, helping the Coast Guard to interdict the traffic in illicit drugs. That fall she joined Taurus in a special mission to the Caribbean coast of Central America. The two warships returned to Key West at the end of the first week in November, and Aquila resumed her program of training missions and drug traffic interdiction. She continued so occupied through the end of 1984 and during the first half of 1985. Late in July 1985, the warship began a restricted availability that lasted until the middle of October. Following post-overhaul trials, Aquila rejoined the effort against drug smugglers in mid-December. Law enforcement duties occupied her during the first two months of 1986. In March, she carried out post-overhaul refresher training and, late in April, participated in FLEETEX 1-86 staged in the West Indies. Immediately thereafter, Aquila joined in another exercise, Operation \\"Ocean Venture 86,\\" that simulated an attack on an enemy fleet attempting to force the Mona Passage between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. At the beginning of the second week in May, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat returned to normal operations out of Key West. She interrupted those operations twice that summer‚Äîonce early in July and again early in August‚Äîto conduct special tests with A-7E Corsair II aircraft for the Chief of Naval Operations. Otherwise, she carried out normal duties from her base at Key West through the end of the year. In April 1991, The USS Aquila hit a whale that suddenly breached in front of PHM-4 while she was flying on her foils in the Straights of Florida. The front foil skipped off the back of the whale, while the stern foils stuck the whale cutting it into 3 pieces. The whale strike caused tremendous stress on the hull; visible warping of the stern hull section could be easily seen. Several crew men including the Captain required medical attention and evacuation. The event caused the radios to fall on the radioman resulting in loss of communications. The captain issued a mayday using a handheld radio. The engine room was flooding due to the raw water intake being broke loose from the hull. Being the largest compartment the pumps could not maintain sufficient removal of water. A coast guard falcon dropped two P250s which saved the ship. What a sight to see! Additionally the impact caused such force that the rafts self deployed in mid air and floated next to the ship. https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2018/01/cgc- bear-celebrates-35-years/ Aquila was decommissioned in 1993 and sold in 1996.

The hymn begins with the words that the angels sang when announcing the birth of Christ to shepherds in (in Latin). Other verses were added very early, forming a doxology. An article by David Flusser links the text of the verse in Luke with ancient Jewish liturgy.English translation of an article that originally appeared in Unser Vater: Juden und Christen im Gespr√§ch √ºber die Bibel: Festschrift f√ºr Otto Michel zum 60. Geburststag (ed. Otto Betz, Martin Hengel, and Peter Schmidt; Leiden: Brill, 1963), 129-152 History Gloria in excelsis Deo is an example of the psalmi idiotici (\\"private psalms\\", i.e. compositions by individuals in imitation of the biblical Psalter) that were popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Other surviving examples of this lyric poetry are the Te Deum and the Phos Hilaron. In the 4th century it became part of morning prayers, and is still recited in the Byzantine Rite Orthros service. The Latin translation is traditionally attributed to Saint Hilary of Poitiers (c. 300‚Äì368), who may have learned it while in the East (359‚Äì360); as such, it is part of a loose tradition of early Latin translations of the scripture known as the Vetus Latina. The Vulgate Latin translation of the Bible was commissioned only in 382. The Latin hymn thus uses the word excelsis to translate the Greek word ·ΩëœàŒØœÉœÑŒøŒπœÇ - hyps√≠stois (the highest) in , not the word altissimis, which Saint Jerome preferred for his translation. However, this word is used near the end: tu solus Altissimus, Iesu Christe (you alone the Most High, Jesus Christ). Present-day Greek text Present-day Latin text Liturgical use Angel with the words \\"Gloria in Excelsis Deo et in terra pax\\" by Dalziel Brothers =Byzantine Rite= In the Byzantine Rite (used by the Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholic Churches), the Gloria is referred to as the Doxology, and there are two forms: the Greater Doxology and the Lesser Doxology. The Greater Doxology is always sung, whereas the Lesser Doxology is read. There are certain textual differences between the two, and the order is somewhat altered in the two forms. The Greater Doxology is used in the Orthros (Matins) on Sundays and feast days. The Lesser Doxology is used at Matins on simple weekdays and at the Apodeipnon (Compline), but not in the Divine Liturgy. =Roman Rite= By contrast, in the Roman Rite this hymn is not included in the Liturgy of the Hours, but is sung or recited at Mass, after the Kyrie, on Sundays outside of Lent and Advent, during the octaves of Easter and Christmas, and on solemnities and feasts. In Masses celebrated in accordance with the 1962 Roman Missal (still authorized as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Gloria is sung much more frequently: the 1960 Code of Rubrics require it at Mass when in the corresponding Office of the day the Te Deum is said at Matins. It is thus used not only on I and II-class feasts (corresponding to solemnities and feasts in the post-Vatican II Mass) but also on III-class feasts (corresponding to memorials in the later form). In the 1962 form it is also said on ferias of Christmastide and Paschaltide even outside the octaves, but is omitted during the Septuagesima season, which does not exist in the post-Vatican II liturgy. The Gloria is also sung in both the pre-Vatican II and in the later form of the Roman Rite at the Mass of the Lord's Supper in the evening of Maundy Thursday and at the Easter Vigil. In the Church of England's 1549 edition of the Book of Common Prayer, it was used in the same position as in the Roman Rite but was later moved to the end of the service, immediately before the concluding blessing. Revisions to the Prayer Book occurred in 1552 and 1662, but this placement was retained by the Anglican Communion until the 20th century. The recently published Common Worship provides two Orders, one of which places the hymn in the earlier position. The 1928 United States Episcopal Prayer Book also placed the Gloria at the end of the Eucharist service (like the 1662 Prayer Book). This edition, still the standard in the breakaway Continuing Anglican churches, allows the hymn to be used in place of the Gloria Patri after the psalms and canticles at Evening Prayer. The Episcopal Church's 1979 Book moved it to the beginning, after or in place of the Kyrie in Rite One. In a Rite Two (i.e., contemporary language) service of Holy Eucharist, the Gloria, or another song of praise, is sung or said on all Sundays except those in Advent or Lent. It may also be used at other times as desired excepting Lent and Advent. The hymn is also used in the Divine Service of the Lutheran Church,Birkholz, Mark. \\"The Gloria in Excelsis\\", Lutheranreformation.org., December 24, 2016 and in the services of many other Christian churches. A tradition recorded in the Liber Pontificalis attributes to Pope Telesphorus (128-139?) the use of the hymn at the Mass of Christmas Day and to Pope Symmachus (498‚Äì514) its use on Sundays and the feasts of martyrs, but only by bishops; the right to use it was later extended to priests, at first only at Easter and on the day of their ordination, but by the end of the 11th century priests, as well as bishops, used it in the Mass on Sundays and feasts outside of Lent and Pre-Lent. After the 12th century Advent began to be considered a penitential period in imitation of Lent, to the exclusion therefore of the Gloria in excelsis Deo. Gloria in the Mass ordinary Associated ceremonial =Roman Rite= In the Tridentine Mass, the priest is instructed, when saying the opening phrase \\"Gloria in excelsis Deo\\", to extend his hands and raise them to shoulder height and, at the word \\"Deo\\", to join them and bow his head. He is then to continue the recitation standing erect with hands joined and bowing his head to the cross at the words \\"Adoramus te\\", \\"Gratias agimus tibi\\", \\"Iesu Christe\\" (twice), and \\"Suscipe deprecationem nostram\\", and at the concluding phrase (as also at the concluding phrase of the Nicene Creed and the Sanctus), to make a large sign of the cross on himself.Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, IV, 3 (page LVI of the 1962 typical edition) At High Mass the priest intones the opening phrase, while the deacon and subdeacon stand behind him; then they join him at the altar and together with him quietly recite the rest of the hymn,Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae, IV, 7 (page LVI of the 1962 typical edition) after which they sit down and wait for the choir to finish its singing of the same text. The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 simplifies this, saying: \\"The Gloria is intoned by the priest or, if appropriate, by a cantor or by the choir; but it is sung either by everyone together, or by the people alternately with the choir, or by the choir alone. If not sung, it is to be recited either by all together or by two parts of the congregation responding one to the other.\\" No particular ritual gestures are prescribed. =Byzantine Rite= In the usage of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the Great Doxology is one of the high points of the festal Matins service. The priest puts on his phelonion (chasuble). When it comes time for the Great Doxology the deacon opens the Holy Doors, and the priest raises his hands orans and exclaims: \\"Glory to Thee, Who hast shown us the Light!\\", and the choir begins chanting the Doxology, while all of the oil lamps and candles in the temple are lit. The Great Doxology concludes with the chanting of the Trisagion and leads into the chanting of the Troparion of the Day. If the bishop is present he vests in his full pontifical vestments for the Great Doxology, and the subdeacons stand behind the Holy Table (altar) holding the lit dikirion and trikirion. When the Lesser Doxology is called for, it is simply said by the reader, the priest does not put on his phelonion, the Holy Doors remain closed and no lamps or candles are lit. The Lesser Doxology does not end with the Trisagion and is followed by an ektenia (litany). The traditional Orthodox Sunday (Lord's Day) Greek text of the Greater Doxology translated into English has been set for unaccompanied choir by the English composer Clive Strutt as section 12 of his All-night Vigil (2010). Musical settings The Gloria has been and still is sung to a wide variety of melodies. Modern scholars have catalogued well over two hundred of them used in the medieval church. The Roman Missal indicates several different plainchant melodies. In addition, several \\"farced\\" Glorias were composed in the Middle Ages and were still sung in places when the Roman Missal was revised by order of Pope Pius V in 1570. These expanded the basic Gloria by, for instance, adding to mentions of Jesus Christ a mention of some relationship between him and his mother. The use of these additional phrases in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary was so common that in editions of the Roman Missal earlier than the 1921 revision, the text of the Gloria was followed by the rubric: \\"Sic dicitur Gloria in excelsis Deo, etiam in Missis beat√¶ Mari√¶, quando dicenda est\\" (When the Gloria in excelsis Deo is to be recited, it is recited in this way, even in Masses of Blessed Mary).See, for instance, page 216 of the 1862 printing by Pustet Almost all polyphonic settings of the Mass include the Gloria. In addition, there are a number of settings of the Gloria alone, including: * Antonio Vivaldi, who wrote two, the widely recorded RV 589, and the less famous RV 588 * George Frideric Handel, whose setting for solo soprano and strings was re-discovered in 2001: Gloria * Camille Saint-Sa√´ns * Francis Poulenc: Gloria * William Walton * John Rutter: Gloria * Mike Anderson: Gloria * Karl Jenkins, who interpolates other texts alongside the standard Gloria text: Gloria A paraphrase of the text in German, the early Lutheran hymn , has also been commonly set to music, in the form of chorale preludes or as part of larger compositions. The Gloria features prominently in the popular song \\"Silence\\" by Delerium, a trance song as well as in Gina's and Elvira's theme from the Scarface soundtrack.

The classification is used for the most part by amateur astronomers to denote visually observed faint naked eye and telescopic objects such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. This distinction is practical and technical, implying a variety of instruments and techniques appropriate to observation, and does not distinguish the nature of the object itself. Origins and classification Classifying non-stellar astronomical objects began soon after the invention of the telescope. One of the earliest comprehensive lists was Charles Messier's 1774 Messier catalog, which included 103 \\"nebulae\\" and other faint fuzzy objects he considered a nuisance since they could be mistaken for comets, the objects he was actually searching for. As telescopes improved these faint nebulae would be broken into more descriptive scientific classifications such as interstellar clouds, star clusters, and galaxies. \\"Deep-sky object\\", as an astronomical classification for these objects, has its origins in the modern field of amateur astronomy. The origin of the term is unknown but it was popularized by Sky & Telescope magazine's \\"Deep-Sky Wonders\\" column, which premiered in their first edition in 1941, created by Leland S. Copeland, written for the majority of its run by Walter Scott Houston, and currently penned by Sue French. Houston's columns, and later book compilations of those columns, helped popularize the term, each month giving the reader a guided tour of a small part of the sky highlighting well known and lesser known objects for binoculars and small telescopes. Observations and activities Cygnus marking the location of bright and more challenging deep-sky objects There are many amateur astronomical techniques and activities associated with deep-sky objects. Some of these objects are bright enough to find and see in binoculars and small telescopes. But the faintest objects need the light-gathering power of telescopes with large objectives, and since they are invisible to the naked eye, can be hard to find. This has led to increased popularity of GoTo telescopes that can find DSOs automatically, and large reflecting telescopes, such as Dobsonian style telescopes, with wide fields of view well suited to such observing. Observing faint objects needs dark skies, so these relatively portable types of telescopes also lend themselves to the majority of amateurs who need to travel outside light polluted urban locations.The Observer's Handbook, Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, p. 63 To cut down light pollution and enhance contrast, observers employ \\"nebular filters\\" designed to admit certain wavelengths of light, and block others. There are organized activities associated with DSOs such as the Messier marathon, which occurs at a specific time each year and involves observers trying to spot all 110 Messier objects in one night. Since the Messier catalog objects were discovered with relatively small 18th-century telescopes, it is a popular list with observers, being well within the grasp of most modern amateur telescopes. A much more demanding test known as the Herschel 400 is designed to tax larger telescopes and experienced amateur astronomers. List of deep-sky object types There are many astronomical object types that come under the description of deep-sky objects. Since the definition is objects that are non-Solar System and non- stellar the list includes: *Star clusters **Open clusters **Globular clusters *Nebulae **Bright nebulae ***Emission nebulae ***Reflection nebulae **Dark nebulae **Planetary nebulae *Galaxies See also *Amateur telescope making *Celestial cartography *Shallow sky *Star catalogue *Star hopping References * Neil Bone, Wil Tirion, Deep Sky Observer's Guide.

Background Born at Sehore, Bhopal, India, he was the son of Sir Henry Marion Durand, the Resident of Baroda and he was educated at Blackheath Proprietary School, and Tonbridge School.John F. Riddick, The history of British India, p258 Career Durand entered the Indian Civil Service in 1873. During the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878‚Äì1880) he was Political Secretary at Kabul. From 1884 to 1894, he was Foreign Secretary of India. Durand was appointed Minister plenipotentiary at Tehran in 1894 although despite being a Persian scholar and speaking the language fluently he made little impression either in Tehran or on his superiors in London. He left Persia in March 1900, by which time owing to the illness of his wife Ella he had withdrawn from social life and the legation was in a depressed and disorganised state. From 1900 to 1903 he served as British Ambassador to Spain, and from 1903-1906 as Ambassador to the United States. He was appointed a CSI in 1881London Gazette, 1 March 1881 knighted a KCIE in 1888 and a KCSI in 1894London Gazette, 2 January 1894 and appointed a GCMG in 1900.London Gazette, 1 June 1900 Literary works From 1906, after his return to England, he devoted his time to writing. He also published the biography of his father, General Henry Marion Durand (1812‚Äì1871), and also had ambitions as a novelist, often with his wife, Lady E. R. Durand (1852‚Äì1913), as a co- author. Some of his publications are: * An Autumn Tour in Western Persia (1902) * Nadir Shah: An Historical Novel (1908) * The Life of Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall (1913) * The Life of Field-Marshal Sir George White, V.C. (1915) *The Thirteenth Hussars in the Great War (1921) Legacy =Durand Line= The Durand Line is named after Sir Mortimer and remains the international border between Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan that is officially recognized by all countries apart from Afghanistan. The border is an ongoing point of contention between the two countries, as Afghanistan unilaterally disputes the legitimacy of the border. In 1884 Durand informed Abdur Rahman Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, the frontier between modern-day Pakistan (the successor state of British India) and Afghanistan that the garrison of Pandjeh had been slaughtered on the orders of the Russian General Komarov. The Russians wished to stop British occupation of Herat, so Durand was despatched to prevent \\"the strained relations which then existed between Russia and ourselves, wrote the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, might in itself have proved the occasion of a long miserable war.\\" Tensions at home in British newspapers heightened the urgency of the incident, threatening war in Central Asia, which Rahman was desperate to avoid. A telephone line was kept open between Lord Granville and Count Giers in St Petersburg.Hopkirk, The Great Game, pp.430-1 Sir Mortimer was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for the purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the Joint Boundary Commission between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions along the same lines as in 1873, except for the southward salient at Pandjeh. The British made it clear that any further extension towards Herat would be amoun to a declaration of war. Rahman showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. A Royal Commission was established to demarcate the boundary between Afghanistan and the British-governed India. The two parties camped at Parachinar, now part of FATA Pakistan, near Khost Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, the Political Agent for Khyber. The Afghans were represented by Sahibzada Abdul Latif and Governor Sardar Shireendil Khan representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.http://www.aaiil.org/aaiil/ra/jalsa/2003/sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed100anniversary/08sahibzadazahoorahmad_sahibzadaabdullatifshaheed.mp3 The territorial exchanges were amicably agreed upon; the relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed. The Durand Road in Lahore is also named after him. Death Durand died at Quetta, Baluchistan Agency, British India, in 1924. According to Abdus Sattar, a high school headmaster at D.I.Khan, His grave is in Christian graveyard near NOL Bagh tank Adda Dera Ismail Khan. However, his father is buried in a Church at Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (now a province of Pakistan).

His interests focused on childhood development and evolutionary theory. Hall was the first president of the American Psychological Association and the first president of Clark University. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Hall as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with Lewis Terman. Biography = Childhood = Born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, Hall grew up on a farm with his parents, Granville Bascom Hall, who served on the Massachusetts legislature, and Abigail Beals, who attended school at Albany Female Seminary and went on to become a teacher herself. During his time as a child he spent much of his time reading and taking advantage of the educational advantages he could gain from his parents and the local schools. At a young age he was interested in animals and bodily skills. At the age of 16 he began to teach other students, most of whom were older than he was. = Family = Hall‚Äôs first wife was Cornelia Fisher. They were married September of 1879 and produced two children. Daughter, Julia Fisher Hall, born May 30,1882, who along with her mother died of accidental asphyxiation at eight years of age in 1890. And a son, Dr. Robert Granville Hall, born February 7, 1881, who he raised from age four on his own. His second marriage was to Florence E Smith, July 1899. His second wife was determined to have ‚Äúarteriosclerosis of the brain‚Äù and was institutionalized after years of eccentric behaviors. =Teacher= Hall attended Williston Seminary and graduated from Williams College in 1867, then studied at the Union Theological Seminary. Inspired by Wilhelm Wundt's Principles of Physiological Psychology, Hall pursued doctoral studies at Harvard University where he met William James, an adjunct professor who had just taught the nation's first psychology class. In 1878, Hall earned the first psychology doctorate awarded in America.Thorne, B. Michael & Henley, Tracy B. (2001). Connections in the History and Systems of Psychology. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. . After Hall graduated with his doctorate, there were no academic jobs available in psychology, so he went to Europe to study at the University of Berlin, and spent a brief time in Wundt's Leipzig laboratory in 1879. He began his career by teaching English and philosophy at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and then teaching history of philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts. Following successful lecture series at Harvard and Johns Hopkins University, Hall secured a position in the philosophy department at Johns Hopkins, teaching psychology and pedagogy. He remained at Johns Hopkins from 1882 to 1888 and, in 1883, began what is considered by some to be the first formal American psychology laboratory. There, Hall objected vehemently to the emphasis on teaching traditional subjects, e.g., Latin, mathematics, science and history, in high school, arguing instead that high school should focus more on the education of adolescents than on preparing students for college. Hall was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory =New discipline of psychology= In 1887, Hall founded the American Journal of Psychology, and in 1892 was appointed as the first president of the American Psychological Association. In 1889 he was named the first president of Clark University, a post he filled until 1920. During his 31 years as president, Hall remained intellectually active. He was instrumental in the development of educational psychology, and attempted to determine the effect adolescence has on education. He was also responsible for inviting Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to visit and deliver a lecture series in 1909 at the Clark Conference. Hall promised Freud an honorary degree from Clark University in exchange. Hall and Freud shared the same beliefs on sex and adolescence. This was Freud's first and only visit to America and the biggest conference held at Clark University. It was also the most controversial conference, given that Freud's research was based on theories that Hall's colleagues criticized as non-scientific. In 1888, when he was tapped for the Clark presidency from the faculty of Johns Hopkins University, the 44 year-old Hall was already well on his way to eminence in the then emerging field of psychology. His establishment of experimental laboratories at Johns Hopkins, the first in the discipline, quickly became the measure of the fully modern psychology department. Over his 32 years as a scholar/teacher president at Clark, he had an influence over the future shape of the field of psychology. What attracted some to Hall and his ideas, and alienated others, were his \\"music man\\" propensities. He was the promoter, the impresario par excellence. Hall could \\"put on a party\\", as he did with the extraordinary celebrations in 1899 and 1909, on the occasions of the 10th and 20th anniversaries of the opening of Clark University. He did so with an incomparable sense of daring‚Äîinviting major figures with unconventional, unpopular, or even scandalous ideas, and then promoting them with the press. He seemed always to be founding new journals or scholarly associations to disseminate his ideas and those of scholars whose perspectives were consistent with his own. Among his creations were the widely respected American Journal of Psychology and the American Psychological Association. He also helped found the Association of American Universities. Ross described this side of Hall as journalist, entrepreneur, and preacher. In 1917, Hall published a book on religious psychology, Jesus the Christ in the Light of Psychology. The book was written in two volumes to define Jesus Christ in psychological terms. Hall thoroughly discussed all that is written about Christ, and the probable mental mechanisms of Christ and all of those who believed in him and wrote about him. He analyzes the myths, the magic, etc., built up about the name and life of Christ. He dissects the parables and discusses the miracles, the death and the resurrection of Jesus. He endeavors to reduce all possible expressions or trends which he finds in Jesus and his followers to their genetic origins, and with that aid in comparative psychology, especially the knowledge of anthropology and childhood tendencies, he points out here and there certain universal trends which are at the bottom of it all. This was his least successful work. In 1922, at the age of 78, he published the book Senescence, a book on aging. Group photo 1909 in front of Clark University. Front row: Sigmund Freud, Granville Stanley Hall, C. G. Jung; back row: Abraham A. Brill, Ernest Jones, S√°ndor Ferenczi. Darwin's theory of evolution and Ernst Haeckel's recapitulation theory were large influences on Hall's career. These ideas prompted Hall to examine aspects of childhood development in order to learn about the inheritance of behavior. The subjective character of these studies made their validation impossible. He believed that as children develop, their mental capabilities resemble those of their ancestors and so they develop over a lifetime the same way that species develop over eons.^ Wegner, Daniel L. Schacter, Daniel T. Gilbert, Daniel M. (2010). Psychology (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers. . Hall believed that the process of recapitulation could be sped up through education and force children to reach modern standards of mental capabilities in a shorter length of time. His work also delved into controversial portrayals of the differences between women and men, as well as the concept of racial eugenics. While Hall was a proponent of racial eugenics, his views were less severe in terms of creating and keeping distinct separations between races. Hall believed in giving \\"lower races\\" a chance to accept and adapt to the \\"superior white civilization\\". Hall even commended high ranking African Americans in society as being \\"exception to the Negro‚Äôs diminished evolutionary inheritance\\". Hall viewed civilization in a similar fashion he viewed biological development. Humans must allow civilization to \\"run its natural evolution\\". Hall saw those who did not accept the superior civilization as being primitive \\"savages\\". Hall viewed these civilizations in a similar fashion as he viewed children, stating that \\"their faults and their virtues are those of childhood and youth\\". Hall believed that men and women should be separated into their own schools during puberty because it allowed them to be able to grow within their own gender. Women could be educated with motherhood in mind and the men could be educated in more hands-on projects, helping them to become leaders of their homes. Hall believed that schools with both sexes limited the way they could learn and softened the boys earlier than they should be. \\"It is a period of equilibrium, but with the onset of puberty the equilibrium is disturbed and new tendencies arise. Modifications in the reproductive organs take place and bring about secondary sexual characteristics. Extroversion gives way slowly to introversion, and more definitely social instincts begin to play an increasing role.\\" Hall was also influenced by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and his theory of evolution. Hall found the idea of passing on memories from parent to offspring was a plausible mode of inheritance. =Gerontology Contributions= Hall published his book on aging, Senescence, in 1922. This work called for a better understanding of the aging process and recognition of the discrimination towards the elderly in society. He draws attention to the way one lives the first part of their life as if in a race to get to where they feel society drives them to be. Only to find that at time of retirement, they are worn out and aging poorly, dismissed by the younger generations that are taking their place in the workforce and social society. This particular work is referred to as prophetic, because it addresses many of the topics studied today in gerontology. Researchers are starting to make distinctions between active life expectancy, living to a healthy old age, and dependent life expectancy, simply living a long life. The first being what Hall felt that one should strive for. The second being the result of performing for society. The topic of sleep and the internal clock of the elderly being rewired as to confuse night and day, napping throughout the day and not getting a full nights rest is referenced in Hall‚Äôs book along with the lack of consistently good sleep as affecting the mental status of a person. Lack of sleep can lead to confusion and inability to process with logical connections to problem solve. Today gerontologist conduct research in regard to memory, such as how we process incoming information, our attention to the sensory input, and the way our brains compensate for deficiencies, as well as fatigues toll on memory. He addresses the weather and how the elderly do not regulate body temperature well. Referring to winter as the most difficult to navigate and statistically there are more deaths. This is a topic that is discussed with elderly today, helping them to recognize that they can easily lose body temperature, leading to hypothermia and rapidly gain it as well in the summer heat and humidity, leading to heat exhaustion or heat stroke. The topic of the body‚Äôs ability to regulate temperature as we age, has been expanded upon and other processes that decline are being addressed and researched. Hall touches on the lifespan increasing and retirement age changing, increasing the length of senescence, which in turn taxes society as a whole. This is referred to as the dependency ratio, which is the number of people in a population between the ages of 15-64 years, who are responsible for generating the financial support of those younger than 15 and older than 64 years. With people living longer, gerontology has also focused on what will be needed to continually care for the aging population. Several housing plans and resources specific to the elderly‚Äôs needs have been initiated and put into place. In studying the aging process, suggestions as to how to age well have been developed and promoted to the elderly. Eating well, continuing to exercise, having checkups and screenings, maintaining social outlets, and maintaining financial stability are all said to help promote healthy aging. Gerontology also promotes that a person‚Äôs state of mind greatly affects the way we age and adapt as we do so. Hall talks about the stage of life in which you reflect back on what you have accomplished and decide if you contributed to society and lived a life worth living in the first part of life. This is similar to one of Eric Erickson life stages, which is Ego Integrity vs. Despair. Ego integrity versus despair is the eighth and final stage of Erik Erikson‚Äôs stage theory of psychosocial development. This stage begins at approximately age 65 and ends at death. It is during this time that we contemplate our accomplishments and can develop integrity if we see ourselves as leading a successful life. Hall believed that the elderly had more to give to society, than society allowed for in the form of wisdom. That the elderly could still contribute and have meaning in their lives and not feel discarded by younger generations. Gerontology has made many advances with these ideas and continues to be a growing area in research in a multitude of other areas affecting our aging population today. =Anomalistic psychology= Hall was one of the founding members and a vice President of the American Society for Psychical Research.Eugene Taylor.

Personal views =Social views= Hall was deeply wedded to the German concept of Volk, an anti- individualist and authoritarian romanticism in which the individual is dissolved into a transcendental collective. Hall believed that humans are by nature non-reasoning and instinct driven, requiring a charismatic leader to manipulate their herd instincts for the well-being of society. He predicted that the American emphasis on individual human right and dignity would lead to a fall that he analogized to the sinking of Atlantis. Hall was one of the founders of the child-study movement in the 1880s. A national network of study groups called Hall Clubs existed to spread his teaching. He is popularly known today for supervising the 1896 study Of Peculiar and Exceptional Children, which described a series of only child eccentrics as permanent misfits. For decades, academics and advice columnists alike disseminated his conclusion that an only child could not be expected to go through life with the same capacity for adjustment that siblings possessed. \\"Being an only child is a disease in itself,\\" he claimed.One and Done by Lauren Sandler, TIME July 19, 2010, pp. 35-41. Hall argued that child development recapitulates his highly racialized conception of the history of human evolutionary development. He characterized pre-adolescent children as savages and therefore rationalized that reasoning was a waste of time with children. He believed that children must simply be led to fear God, love country, and develop a strong body. As the child burns out the vestiges of evil in his nature, he needs a good dose of authoritarian discipline, including corporal punishment. He believed that adolescents are characterized by more altruistic natures than pre-adolescents and that high schools should indoctrinate students into selfless ideals of service, patriotism, body culture, military discipline, love of authority, awe of nature, and devotion to the state and the well being of others. Hall consistently argued against intellectual attainment at all levels of public education. Open discussion and critical opinions were not to be tolerated. Students needed indoctrination to save them from the individualism that was so damaging to the progress of American culture. Hall popularised the phrase \\"storm and stress\\" with reference to adolescence, taken from the German Sturm und Drang movement. His colleague William Burnham had published this phrase in relation to adolescence in an 1889 article titled 'Economy in Intellectual Work'. The concept's three key aspects are conflict with parents, mood disruptions, and risky behavior. As was later the case with the work of Lev Vygotsky and Jean Piaget, public interest in this phrase, as well as with Hall's role, faded. Recent research has led to some reconsideration of the phrase and its denotation. In its three aspects, recent evidence supports storm and stress, but only when modified to take into account individual differences and cultural variations. Currently, psychologists do not accept storm and stress as universal, but do acknowledge the possibility in brief passing. Not all adolescents experience storm and stress, but storm and stress is more likely during adolescence than at other ages. Hall had no sympathy for the poor, the sick, or those with developmental differences or disabilities. A firm believer in selective breeding and forced sterilization, he believed that any respect or charity toward those he viewed as physically, emotionally, or intellectually weak or \\"defective\\" simply interfered with the movement of natural selection toward the development of a super-race. Hall's major books were Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime and Religion (1904) and Aspects of Child Life and Education (1921). In his book Adolescence, which was based on the results of the child-study movement, Hall described his system of psychology (which he called \\"genetic psychology\\") and the evolutionary benefits of development from the womb to adolescence. The book comprises six sections: biological and anthropological standpoint, medical standpoint, health and its tests, nubility of educated women, fecundity of educated women, and education. Hall hoped that this book would become a guide for teachers and social workers in the education system. His most direct influence in shaping our view of humankind came from his theories about adolescence. In 1904, Hall published \\"Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relation to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion, and Education\\". In this 2-volume study, based on the idea that child development recapitulates human evolution, Hall took on a variety of issues and synthesized scholarship from a wide range of disciplines. After his retirement in 1920, Hall wrote a companion volume on aging. This important account has been labeled \\"prophetic\\" in its recognition of an emerging \\"crisis of aging\\" in the 20th century, in which longer lifespan, narrowing family roles, and expulsion from the workforce combined to dramatically isolate the elderly and restrict their active participation in public life. Hall railed against this process, arguing that the wisdom conferred by old age meant that the elderly had valuable and creative contributions to make to society. Yet, the stigma of aging meant that, instead, many were engaged in the foolish pursuit of youth, trying to avoid being excluded from full participation in their communities. In the conclusion of the book, Hall expressed a tangible sense of personal anger against this form of discrimination. His stirring call for a better understanding of the aging process anticipated the development of gerontology, and his critique of the marginalization of the elderly still resonates today. Hall was a transitional figure between Victorian conservatism and early 20th Century modernism‚Äîreflecting major intellectual characteristics of each. As might be expected, that combination was not always well received by advocates from either camp. His controversial Adolescence was banned from some libraries because of its lengthy and sometimes lyrical treatment of sex. Yet, the book was also characterized by urgent religious strictures on behavior. A contemporary of Hall, E.L. Thorndike, described him as a man \\"whose doctrines I often attack, but whose genius I always admire.\\" When commenting on Adolescence to another noted psychologist, Thorndike said that Hall's magnum opus was \\"chock full of errors, masturbation, and Jesus. He is a mad man.\\" Hall viewed masturbation as an immoral act and a blemish of the human race that interfered with moral and intellectual growth. Hall discussed masturbation in reference to men and did not discuss it in terms of women. It is not known whether he knew this act occurred in women or that Hall believed adolescent boys must go through what he described as \\"conversion\\". This conversion releases the boys from biological sins that were passed onto them by their ancestors. This passing on of sins through generations is guided by Lamarckian evolution. He claimed that conversion occurred as naturally as a \\"blossoming flower\\". Instead of masturbation, Hall viewed spontaneous emissions as a natural and acceptable alternative to forced ejaculation. Hall believed that he went through conversion during his freshman year at Williams College. Hall also coined the technical words describing types of tickling: knismesis, or feather-like tickling; and gargalesis, for the harder, laughter inducing type. Hall's voracious appetite for learning and prodigious work habits, his insistence on building theory from experience, and his penchant for bringing different fields of study together, would themselves have made him a formidable figure. But the force of his personality, his taste for controversy, and his untiring will added to the mix. Dorothy Ross, his biographer, wrote that from his extraordinary efforts came the \\"formative impulses of progressive education, child development, educational psychology, clinical psychology, school hygiene, and mental testing.\\" Among his many students who made significant future contributions in fields he stimulated were the philosopher John Dewey (when Hall was at Johns Hopkins) and the famous psychologists Lewis Terman, Henry Goddard, and Arnold Gesell (when Hall was at Clark). By his very prominence and productivity, Hall created a demand for the scientific study of children and the field of child psychology. Hall is best remembered for his contributions to psychology, for his support of applied psychology, and for his success in advising many doctoral students who have made great contributions to psychology. Hall also mentored the first African American to get a PhD in psychology, Francis Cecil Sumner in 1920. =Religious views= Hall is listed in the Cambridge Companion to Atheism as having been an atheist. Hall was a pioneer in the school of religious psychology. He was exposed to Christianity by his pious mother as a child. While he attended Williston Seminary School, he joined the college church and instructed adult bible classes. He is quoted as saying, ‚Äúhighest choice of free will is self surrender to the service of God‚Äù, as well as ‚Äúlove fixed in the highest being, God‚Äù. He moved on to attend Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1867. Interested in comparative religion, he took a position at the city missionary society and attended multiple types if religious services. After graduation, Hall served at a small church in Pennsylvania for a short while, before leaving to further his studies. Hall promoted religion as the reinstatement of the individual into their true place in the world. A return to health and wholeness. Hall would later teach religious psychology at Johns Hopkins and Clark School of Religious Psychology. He also founded a library department for religious psychology. =Views on eugenics= Hall expressed openly eugenic views in many of his writings. He was listed in numerous American eugenic organizations as its leader. The Eugenical News (1916‚Äì1922) celebrated the development of new American eugenic scholarly organization by highlighting that its roster included such as in the following announcement about \\"new active members of Eugenics Research Association... C. C. Brigham, Psychological Laboratory, Princeton, N. J., G. Stanley Hall, Clark University, C. E. Seashore, State University of Iowa, Lewis, M. Terman, Stanford University, Calif., John B. Watson, Johns Hopkins Hospital\\" (p. 53). Although Hall is credited with bringing notable psychoanalytic scholars to the U.S., including S. Freud and C. Jung, Hall expressed openly anti-psychoanalytic views in his writings that emphasized his eugenic commitments. For example, in the first issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology, of which Stanley G. Hall (1917) was an editor, his opening article proclaimed that the U.S. psychology had to \\"draw any lesson... from the present war, in which the great Nordic race which embraces the dominant elements of all the belligerent nations is committing suicide\\" (p. 9) The most significant of these lessons, according to Hall, was for American psychology to fight against the \\"revisionary conceptions of Freud...that it is... normal for man at times to plunge back and down the evolutionary ladder\\" (p. 12). Hall included openly anti-Semitic statements in his writings such as in his book On the Aspects of German Culture in which he discussed the supposed destruction of Western civilization by \\"rapacious Jews.\\" Consistent with typical anti-Semitic stereotypes promoted by eugenicists such as Charles Davenport Hall remarked that the psychoanalytic focus on \\"sex\\" in addition to this approach's \\"rapid growth... found outside the circle of specialists [academic experimental psychologists]\\" made psychoanalysis and \\"the number of out-and-out disciples\\" to be a form of a \\"cult\\" (p. 412). Moreover, Hall stated that the \\"Freudian theory of therapy... is mistaken\\" (p. 12), giving a warning example of how an individual's culturally unacceptable sexual desires and behaviors could be justified through psychoanalytic interpretations rather than \\"cured by the very modesty\\" based on cultural or religious norms (p. 13). Hall held Victorian moral positions in regard to sexuality which regarded all divergent sexual experiences as amoral, including masturbation, same-sex sexuality, sex outside of marriage, and so forth. Hall claimed that psychoanalytic treatment would \\"destroy\\" this religious \\"morality\\" during the process of analysis (p. 13). In his book Jesus, the Christ, In the Light of Psychology Hall openly praised eugenics and discussed that the presence of supposedly evolutionary unfit people (i.e., the poor, racial minorities, immigrants) served the purpose of teaching the evolutionary fit people (i.e., Nordic wealthy Whites) virtues of caring for the lower classes. Other openly eugenic writings by Hall include his 1903 article entitled \\"The White Man's Burden versus Indigenous Development of the Lower Races\\" in The Journal of Education. A majority of American eugenic organizations listed Hall as its leader (e.g., American Eugenic Society, American Eugenic Research Organization). His students included many notable eugenicists, including H. H. Goddard, Robert Yerkes, Lewis Terman, and many others. Literary activities An important contributor to educational literature, and a leading authority in that field, he founded and was editor of the American Journal of Psychology. In addition, he edited the Pedagogical Seminary (after 1892), the American Journal of Religious Psychology and Education (after 1904), and the Journal of Race Development (after 1910). Hall was, from his student days to his death, interested in philosophy, psychology, education and religion in every one of their aspects which did not involve detailed experimentation, intricate quantitative treatment of results, or rigor and subtlety of analysis. There was, however, an order of emphasis, the years from '80 to '90 being devoted to problems of general psychology and education, those from 1890 to 1905 being especially devoted to the concrete details of human life, particularly the life of children and adolescents, and those from 1905 on being more devoted to wide-reaching problems of man's emotional, ethical and religious life.  Legacy and honors  Hall contributed a large amount of work in understand adolescent development, some of which still holds true today. Hall observed that males tend to have an increase in sensation seeking and aggression during adolescence. Hall also observed an increase in crime rates during the adolescent years. He noted that in terms of aggression there are two types; relational aggression and physical aggression. Relational aggression relates to gossiping, rumor spreading, and exclusions of others. Hall noted that relational aggression occurs more frequently in females while physical aggression occurs more often in males. Much of the mark that Hall left behind was from his expansion of psychology as a field in the United States. He did a lot of work to bring psychology to the United States as a legitimate form of study and science. He began the first journal dedicated only to psychology in the United States of America, called the American Journal of Psychology. He was also the first president of the American Psychological Association. All of the work that Hall did in the field of psychology and for psychology in the United States of America allowed for all the other psychologists to follow in his foot steps and to become psychologists in the United States. Without the effort from Hall it could have taken many more years for psychology to become a field in the United States. The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

It was directed by Jonathan Miller, then best known for his appearance in the satirical revue Beyond the Fringe. Miller's production is unique among live-action Alice films in that he consciously avoided the standard Tenniel-inspired costume design and \\"florid\\" production values. Most of the Wonderland characters are played by actors in standard Victorian dress, with a real cat used to represent the Cheshire Cat. Miller justified his approach as an attempt to return to what he perceived as the essence of the story: \\"Once you take the animal heads off, you begin to see what it's all about. A small child, surrounded by hurrying, worried people, thinking 'Is that what being grown up is like?'\\" The play featured a number of prominent British actors including Michael Redgrave (as the Caterpillar), John Gielgud (as the Mock Turtle), and Peter Sellers (as the King of Hearts), as well as two of Miller's fellow cast members from Beyond the Fringe, Peter Cook and Alan Bennett as the Mad Hatter and the Mouse, respectively. The title role was played by Anne-Marie Mallik, the 13-year-old daughter of a Surrey barrister, this being her only known acting performance. Wilfrid Brambell played the White Rabbit, Michael Gough (who later appeared in Tim Burton's 2010 film adaptation) and Wilfrid Lawson were the March Hare and the Dormouse, Alison Leggatt was the Queen of Hearts, and Leo McKern did a drag turn as the Ugly Duchess. The journalist and broadcasting personality Malcolm Muggeridge was The Gryphon. John Bird played the Fish Footman. The play also featured a young Eric Idle, several years before Monty Python brought him notice, uncredited as a member of the Caucus Race. David Battley appears briefly as the Executioner. Interior scenes were shot at Netley Hospital, a mid-19th-century building that was demolished not long after the film was made.Also known as the Royal Victoria Military Hospital, Netley Hospital was the world's longest building at the time it was completed.

Her father, Richard Paul \\"Dick\\" Komando served in the Army during the Korean War and was a management employee for United Airlines. Her mother, Virginia Komando was a Senior Systems Analyst with Bell Laboratories. Kim is the youngest of four, a brother Richard and two sisters, Christine and Kathleen. Kim says in her profile that she first used a computer at nine years of age. She graduated eighth grade from Watchung's Valley View School in 1978. She attended the nearby Catholic private high school for girls, Mount St. Mary Academy, where she was elected to the McAuley Chapter of the National Honor Society in 1981. After graduating from high school in 1981, one year ahead of schedule as a Junior, and having skipped a grade, she attended Arizona State University. While in school, she started her own business to train people how to use their computers. Kim graduated from Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business in 1985, at the age of 19, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems. She is frequently asked if \\"Kim Komando\\" is her real name, which it is.

A fully connected mesh network is where each node is connected to every other node in the network. A mesh network (or simply meshnet) is a local network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data from/to clients. This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self- organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs. Mesh topology may be contrasted with conventional star/tree local network topologies in which the bridges/switches are directly linked to only a small subset of other bridges/switches, and the links between these infrastructure neighbours are hierarchical. While star-and-tree topologies are very well established, highly standardized and vendor-neutral, vendors of mesh network devices have not yet all agreed on common standards, and interoperability between devices from different vendors is not yet assured.  Basic principles  Mesh networks can relay messages using either a flooding technique or a routing technique. With routing, the message is propagated along a path by hopping from node to node until it reaches its destination. To ensure that all its paths are available, the network must allow for continuous connections and must reconfigure itself around broken paths, using self-healing algorithms such as Shortest Path Bridging. Self-healing allows a routing-based network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable. As a result, the network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations, this concept can also apply to wired networks and to software interaction. A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Fully connected wired networks have the advantages of security and reliability: problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it. However, in such networks, the number of cables, and therefore the cost, goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases. Wired mesh Shortest path bridging allows Ethernet switches to be connected in a mesh topology, and it allows for all paths to be active. Wireless mesh =Development history= Wireless mesh radio networks were originally developed for military applications, such that every node could dynamically serve as a router for every other node. In that way, even in the event of a failure of some nodes, the remaining nodes could continue to communicate with each other, and, if necessary, serve as uplinks for the other nodes. Early wireless mesh network nodes had a single half-duplex radio that, at any one instant, could either transmit or receive, but not both at the same time. This was accompanied by the development of shared mesh networks. This was subsequently superseded by more complex radio hardware that could receive packets from an upstream node and transmit packets to a downstream node simultaneously (on a different frequency or a different CDMA channel). This allowed the development of switched mesh networks. As the size, cost, and power requirements of radios declined further, nodes could be cost-effectively equipped with multiple radios. This, in turn, permitted each radio to handle a different function, for instance, one radio for client access, and another for backhaul services. Work in this field has been aided by the use of game theory methods to analyze strategies for the allocation of resources and routing of packets. =Examples= * Packet radio networks or ALOHA networks were first used in Hawaii to connect the islands. Given the bulky radios, and low data rate, the network is less useful than it was envisioned to be. * In 1998‚Äì1999, a field implementation of a campus-wide wireless network using 802.11 WaveLAN 2.4 GHz wireless interface on several laptops was successfully completed. Several real applications, mobility and data transmissions were made. * Mesh networks were useful for the military market because of the radio capability, and because not all military missions have frequently moving nodes. The Pentagon launched the DoD JTRS program in 1997, with an ambition to use software to control radio functions - such as frequency, bandwidth, modulation and security previously baked into the hardware. This approach would allow the DoD to build a family of radios with a common software core, capable of handling functions that were previously split among separate hardware-based radios: VHF voice radios for infantry units; UHF voice radios for air-to-air and ground-to-air communications; long-range HF radios for ships and ground troops; and a wideband radio capable of transmitting data at megabit speeds across a battlefield. However, JTRS program was shut down in 2012 by the US Army because the radios made by Boeing had a 75% failure rate. * Google Home, Google Wi-Fi, and Google OnHub all support Wi-Fi mesh networking. * In rural Catalonia, Guifi.net was developed in 2004 as a response to the lack of broadband Internet, where commercial Internet providers weren't providing a connection or a very poor one. Nowadays with more than 30,000 nodes it is only halfway a fully connected network, but following a peer to peer agreement it remained an open, free and neutral network with extensive redundancy. * In 2004, TRW Inc. engineers from Carson, California, successfully tested a multi- node mesh wireless network using 802.11a/b/g radios on several high speed laptops running Linux, with new features such as route precedence and preemption capability, adding different priorities to traffic service class during packet scheduling and routing, and quality of service. Their work concluded that data rate can be greatly enhanced using MIMO technology at the radio front end to provide multiple spatial paths. * ZigBee digital radios are incorporated into some consumer appliances, including battery-powered appliances. ZigBee radios spontaneously organize a mesh network, using specific routing algorithms; transmission and reception are synchronized. This means the radios can be off much of the time, and thus conserve power. ZigBee is for low power low bandwidth application scenarios. * Thread is a consumer wireless networking protocol built on open standards and IPv6/6LoWPAN protocols. Thread's features include a secure and reliable mesh network with no single point of failure, simple connectivity and low power. Thread networks are easy to set up and secure to use with banking-class encryption to close security holes that exist in other wireless protocols. In 2014 Google Inc's Nest Labs announced a working group with the companies Samsung, ARM Holdings, Freescale, Silicon Labs, Big Ass Fans and the lock company Yale to promote Thread. * In early 2007, the US-based firm Meraki launched a mini wireless mesh router. The 802.11 radio within the Meraki Mini has been optimized for long-distance communication, providing coverage over 250 metres. In contrast to multi-radio long-range mesh networks with tree-based topologies and their advantages in O(n) routing, the Maraki had only one radio, which it used for both client access as well as backhaul traffic. * The Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey CA, demonstrated such wireless mesh networks for border security. In a pilot system, aerial cameras kept aloft by balloons relayed real time high resolution video to ground personnel via a mesh network. * SPAWAR, a division of the US Navy, is prototyping and testing a scalable, secure Disruption Tolerant Mesh Network to protect strategic military assets, both stationary and mobile. Machine control applications, running on the mesh nodes, \\"take over\\", when Internet connectivity is lost. Use cases include Internet of Things e.g. smart drone swarms. * An MIT Media Lab project has developed the XO-1 laptop or \\"OLPC\\" (One Laptop per Child) which is intended for disadvantaged schools in developing nations and uses mesh networking (based on the IEEE 802.11s standard) to create a robust and inexpensive infrastructure. The instantaneous connections made by the laptops are claimed by the project to reduce the need for an external infrastructure such as the Internet to reach all areas, because a connected node could share the connection with nodes nearby. A similar concept has also been implemented by Greenpacket with its application called SONbuddy. * In Cambridge, UK, on 3 June 2006, mesh networking was used at the ‚ÄúStrawberry Fair‚Äù to run mobile live television, radio and Internet services to an estimated 80,000 people. * Broadband-Hamnet,www.broadband-hamnet.org a mesh networking project used in amateur radio, is \\"a high-speed, self-discovering, self-configuring, fault- tolerant, wireless computer network\\" with very low power consumption and a focus on emergency communication. * The Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network (CUWiN) project is developing mesh networking software based on open source implementations of the Hazy-Sighted Link State Routing Protocol and Expected Transmission Count metric. Additionally, the Wireless Networking Group in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are developing a multichannel, multi-radio wireless mesh testbed, called Net-X as a proof of concept implementation of some of the multichannel protocols being developed in that group. The implementations are based on an architecture that allows some of the radios to switch channels to maintain network connectivity, and includes protocols for channel allocation and routing. * FabFi is an open- source, city-scale, wireless mesh networking system originally developed in 2009 in Jalalabad, Afghanistan to provide high-speed Internet to parts of the city and designed for high performance across multiple hops. It is an inexpensive framework for sharing wireless Internet from a central provider across a town or city. A second larger implementation followed a year later near Nairobi, Kenya with a freemium pay model to support network growth. Both projects were undertaken by the Fablab users of the respective cities. * SMesh is an 802.11 multi-hop wireless mesh network developed by the Distributed System and Networks Lab at Johns Hopkins University. A fast handoff scheme allows mobile clients to roam in the network without interruption in connectivity, a feature suitable for real-time applications, such as VoIP. * Many mesh networks operate across multiple radio bands. For example, Firetide and Wave Relay mesh networks have the option to communicate node to node on 5.2 GHz or 5.8 GHz, but communicate node to client on 2.4 GHz (802.11). This is accomplished using software-defined radio (SDR). * The SolarMESH project examined the potential of powering 802.11-based mesh networks using solar power and rechargeable batteries. Legacy 802.11 access points were found to be inadequate due to the requirement that they be continuously powered.Terence D. Todd, Amir A. Sayegh, Mohammed N. Smadi, and Dongmei Zhao. The Need for Access Point Power Saving in Solar Powered WLAN Mesh Networks . In IEEE Network, May/June 2008. The IEEE 802.11s standardization efforts are considering power save options, but solar-powered applications might involve single radio nodes where relay-link power saving will be inapplicable. * The WING projecthttp://www.wing-project.org WING (sponsored by the Italian Ministry of University and Research and led by CREATE-NET and Technion) developed a set of novel algorithms and protocols for enabling wireless mesh networks as the standard access architecture for next generation Internet. Particular focus has been given to interference and traffic-aware channel assignment, multi- radio/multi-interface support, and opportunistic scheduling and traffic aggregation in highly volatile environments. * WiBACK Wireless Backhaul Technology has been developed by the Fraunhofer Institute for Open Communication Systems (FOKUS) in Berlin. Powered by solar cells and designed to support all existing wireless technologies, networks are due to be rolled out to several countries in sub-Saharan Africa in summer 2012. * Recent standards for wired communications have also incorporated concepts from Mesh Networking. An example is ITU-T G.hn, a standard that specifies a high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) local area network using existing home wiring (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables). In noisy environments such as power lines (where signals can be heavily attenuated and corrupted by noise), it is common that mutual visibility between devices in a network is not complete. In those situations, one of the nodes has to act as a relay and forward messages between those nodes that cannot communicate directly, effectively creating a \\"relaying\\" network. In G.hn, relaying is performed at the Data Link Layer.

It is surrounded on three sides by the Mexican states of Campeche, Tabasco and Veracruz. The area of the bay is and maximum depth of the bay is approximately . It was named by Francisco Hern√°ndez de C√≥rdoba and Ant√≥n de Alaminos during their expedition in 1517. Oil resources The Cantarell Complex of five oil fields lies beneath the Bay of Campeche. In 2003, it was the second most productive oil field in the world, then supplying about two thirds of Mexico's crude oil output, but it went into a steep decline soon thereafter. On June 3, 1979, Ixtoc I, an exploratory oil well located in the bay, suffered a blowout that caused a catastrophic explosion, resulting in what has been ranked as the third largest unintentional oil spill in history. Climate Bay of Campeche During the months of June and July, the Bay of Campeche is considered one of the \\"hot\\" breeding spots for Atlantic hurricanes. On the other hand, the bay is also known for being a hurricane \\"graveyard\\", with unusually weak steering currents in the area causing hurricanes to slow down and meander, starving themselves (for example, Hurricane Roxanne in 1995). The bay is also considered the eastern border on the main migration routes for birds in the Americas.

Phinney, lumber mill owner and real estate developer. Phinney died in 1893, and in 1902, the Olmsted Brothers firm of Boston was hired to design the city's parks, including Woodland Park. The park is split in half by Aurora Avenue N. (State Route 99). Its western half is given over to the Woodland Park Zoo. Its eastern half, which is connected to the zoo by arched bridges over the highway and often called Lower Woodland Park, consists of trails, an off-leash dog park, a picnic area, ballfields, a miniature golf range, horseshoe pits, BMX bike course, and lawn bowling, and is contiguous with Green Lake Park. Wildlife in the park The park is home to many species of birds and mammals as well as a few reptile and amphibian species. The most notable species are the western coyote, rabbit, barred owl, and red eared slider (released turtle). The most common bird species are: American crow, American goldfinch, American robin, Anna's hummingbird, bald eagle, barn owl, barred owl, Bewick's wren, black-capped chickadee, bushtit, European starling, house finch, hairy and downy woodpeckers, northern flicker, Oregon junco, rock dove, spotted towhee, Steller's jay, various gulls, various sparrows, various swallows, and various waterfowl. The most common mammal species are: coyotes, coypus, feral rabbits, brown rats, western gray squirrels, mountain beavers, and North American beavers. The most common reptile and amphibian species are: red eared sliders, spring peepers and garter snakes. Warren G. Harding memorial In 1925, a memorial was erected in the park to commemorate the July 27, 1923 speech delivered by President Warren G. Harding before a crowd of over 30,000 Boy Scouts who were gathered at Woodland for a national jamboree. It was one of the last speeches the president would give; he died six days later in San Francisco. The memorial was demolished in 1977, and the site now lies buried beneath the Woodland Park Zoo's African Savanna exhibit. The memorial's only surviving elements‚Äîtwo life-sized bronze statues of Boy Scouts that once saluted the image of Harding‚Äîwere relocated to the headquarters of the Chief Seattle Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

Kate first appears in the episode \\"Lonely Hearts\\". She is a young, skeptical detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. Gradually, she becomes more hardened as she learns of the supernatural world. Characterization and storylines Kate Lockley is a young police detective working for the LAPD, initially unaware of the supernatural. She first appears in \\"Lonely Hearts\\", investigating a case involving the brutal murders of several patrons of D'Oblique, a popular singles bar. After encountering Angel as he leaves the site of another murder, she instantly suspects him to be the killer, unaware that Angel had actually been attempting to stop the real killer. Angel escapes, and Kate becomes obsessed with finding him to the point that she searches the Angel Investigations offices without a warrant. After she is attacked by the real killer and saved by Angel, she helps him to bring the killer down. Kate subsequently clears Angel of all charges, and Angel offers his services to her whenever she needs them. Kate's subsequent encounters with Angel lead her to trust him as a helpful stranger, and she, in turn, assists him, using her position on the police force to provide him with information when Angel approaches her for information. Kate was raised by her widowed father, Trevor, who is also a police officer and taught her to put her emotions aside and to take care of herself at all costs. Through her father, she develops a complete devotion to her occupation, later on saying that being a cop is all she's ever known and that she wouldn't know what else to do. When she discovers that Angel is really a vampire and subsequently discovers his past as Angelus before his soul is restored, her black and white view of the world is shaken, and she delves into the darker side of Los Angeles. On one such investigation, Kate finds her father's lifeless body‚Äîcompletely drained of blood by vampires. After her father's death, Kate's relationship with Angel becomes strained and eventually adversarial. She becomes obsessed with ridding the city of vampires and other demons. Kate is the first to investigate any calls matching the \\"otherworldly\\" profile, even if it is out of her jurisdiction. She has an intense dislike for Wolfram & Hart and the clients the law firm represents. When a resurrected Darla frames Angel for murder and goes on a killing spree with Drusilla, Kate shows up as his arresting officer and lets him go as she believes he is the only one who can stop them. Although Angel catches them, he allows them to murder 13 lawyers, which causes Kate to distrust him again after she figures out that he not only let them murder but facilitated them by locking the doors. Her obsession with supernatural cases becomes her own undoing: after Angel attacks a police captain who had brought back deceased police officers as zombies in an attempt to cut down on crime, along with her increasingly erratic and obsessive behavior, she is fired from the LAPD. Kate calls Angel and blames him for ruining her life, then attempts suicide by taking prescription pills with hard liquor. Angel hears her call and later goes to Kate's apartment. When she doesn't respond to his energetic knocks, he breaks down her door, finds her lifeless body on the floor, picks her up and holds her under a cold shower to resuscitate her. After her life is saved, she thanks him and then tells him to leave. That evening, Kate and Angel talk and she forgives him, believing there is a higher power at work and they're not alone in the never-ending battle against the forces of darkness. When Angel asks her why, she replies that she never invited him into her apartment. She never appears on the series again, due to Elisabeth R√∂hm joining the cast of Law & Order. However, she is mentioned again in \\"Dead End\\" soon after her last appearance-Angel mentions to his friends that they no longer have a friend in the LAPD.2.18 \\"Dead End\\" Kate reappears in the seventh issue of Angel: After the Fall, saving Connor from a group of demons, unaware that Connor is Angel's son. She establishes an antiquities business after her departure from the LAPD, and uses her business connections to learn more about the supernatural and the occult. She stocks her hideout with an arsenal of ancient to modern weapons. She is seen leaving to blow up a demon army. This actual event takes place the same night as \\"Not Fade Away.\\" Some time later, after LA was restored to normal, she once again encounters Angel and reopens Angel Investigations. However, there are several difficulties due to Angel's new fame status (since many clients are actually fans and admirers rather than people who need help), plus an upheaval in demonic activity. The current Angel Investigations consists of Angel, Kate, Connor and Gwen. In the Angel & Faith series, it is briefly mentioned by Gunn that Kate is back with the LAPD leading their new supernatural investigations unit, as the existence of the mystical world has since become public knowledge following the events of \\"Chosen\\" and \\"Not Fade Away\\". Writing and acting * Kate was originally conceived as a much darker character. In the unproduced episode \\"Corrupt,\\" she was a detective deep undercover as a prostitute and addicted to drugs. *Elisabeth R√∂hm said \\"I thought Kate was this incredibly powerful young woman who is fantastic at what she does, but at the same time, just a girl. There's a great line in Notting Hill when Julia Roberts says 'I'm just a girl wanting a boy to love me.' I think that's a part of Kate and a part of everyone who is really great at what they do. They're actually just the girl or boy who's real and has the same problems as everybody else. She's this tough, smart cookie, but she just wants to be loved and she doesn't know how to do it.\\"Stokes, Mike, \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\", from Buffy the Vampire Slayer magazine #19 (UK, April 2001), pages 20-24. *R√∂hm on the relationship between Kate and Angel: \\"I think that Kate and Angel are kind of meant for each other but in a way, you can see them become best friends.\\" * R√∂hm on her character's departure from Angel: \\"Well, I was the first season of the show, I was part of the original cast and loved doing it, but by the second season, I had my own show on TNT called Bull so I had to go back & forth between my show & recurring on Angel, and then after that I was offered Law & Order and Joss & I decided it would be impossible for me to go from New York (where I was a regular on Law & Order) to Los Angeles for Angel and we had a great opportunity for it to end dramatically, and it was very satisfying for both of us.\\" Appearances =Canonical appearances= Kate appeared in 15 episodes of Angel and one unaired episode.

He was elected as the first elected African-American mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. He was subsequently re-elected to an unprecedented five consecutive terms. During his tenure, Herenton worked to bridge the deep racial divide in Memphis. Under his leadership, the city experienced an economic boom that put it on solid financial footing, resulted in the redevelopment of downtown and the arrival of professional sports teams: the Memphis Grizzlies and Memphis Redbirds. Herenton ran for a sixth term as Memphis mayor in 2019, but lost to incumbent Jim Strickland. Biography Willie Wilbert Herenton was born to Ruby Lee Harris in Memphis, Tennessee. Raised by a single mother, Herenton was encouraged at a young age to pursue his dreams of becoming a Golden Gloves boxer. Known as a driving force in his life, Ruby Harris fostered her son's passion for education; eventually leading to Herenton graduating from Le Moyne-Owen College with a bachelors of science in Elementary Education and from the University of Memphis (formerly Memphis State) with a masters in Educational Administration. However, segregation forced Herenton to leave Memphis to attain his doctorate in education at Southern Illinois University. Dr. Herenton served as the first African- American superintendent of Memphis City Schools for 12 years and the first elected African-American mayor of Memphis, Tennessee for 17 years.  From Teacher to Superintendent  After graduating from Le Moyne-Owen, Herenton began working at Memphis City Schools as a fifth-grade teacher in Memphis. During the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike, Herenton marched in solidarity with the sanitation workers; however, the choice to march with Martin Luther King, Jr. and wear the sign declaring \\"I AM A MAN\\" resulted in threats of termination and ostracization from school district leadership and fellow teachers. But in 1969 Herenton was appointed principal of Bethel Grove Elementary and at 28 became the youngest principal ever hired in Memphis. Three years later, he completed his Ph.D. degree at Southern Illinois University. A year after returning from the Rockefeller Foundation Superintendent Training Program, Dr. Herenton became the Deputy Superintendent of Memphis City Schools. In 1979, Herenton became the first African-American superintendent of the Memphis Public Schools. During Dr. Herenton's 12-year tenure as MCS superintendent, ambitious programs aimed at creating opportunities and services to disadvantaged youth, as well as expanding teacher freedoms, were implemented.  1991 Mayoral Election and Tenure as Mayor  In April 1991, more than 3000 predominantly African-American citizens of Memphis gathered in the Mid-South Coliseum and selected Dr. Herenton as the consensus candidate for the 1991 mayoral election. On October 3, Dr. Herenton became the first African-American to be elected mayor of Memphis. Herenton won his first term by defeating incumbent mayor Richard Hackett in 1991 by 146 votes. In earlier history, an African-American had been appointed to the position. Herenton went on to be reelected five consecutive times. He was elected to his fifth term in office on October 4, 2007. Herenton was selected to the long list for the 2008 World Mayor award; however, he was not selected for this honor.CityMayors profile = End of Tenure as Mayor = On March 20, 2008, Herenton announced that he would be stepping down from his position as Memphis' mayor, effective July 31, 2008. This move angered many politicians in the city including Councilwoman Carol Chumney, a candidate he beat for mayor of Memphis in October 2007. He made this announcement just a little over 90 days after his re-election. Herenton stated his early departure was to seek the position again of superintendent of Memphis City Schools, dispelling speculation that he was stepping down because of a run for Congress or impending legal troubles from an ongoing criminal investigation at City Hall. He later stated that he would not leave the office of mayor unless he got the position as the superintendent of schools. Herenton said that he ran for re- election only in order to protect the city of Memphis from the other main candidates, Herman Morris and Councilwoman Carol Chumney. When the day came, Herenton failed to step down as Mayor and said he would serve out his term until 2011. In April 2009, however, Herenton formed an exploratory committee to run in the 2010 US Congressional Election for the 9th District of Tennessee, presumably in the Democratic primary against incumbent Steve Cohen. On June 25, 2009, Herenton announced his resignation as Mayor, effective July 10. On July 6, he announced that he would delay his retirement until July 30. He resigned from office on July 30, 2009. Memphis City Council Chairman Myron Lowery was appointed as mayor pro tempore. 2010 Democratic Primary In 2010, Herenton announced that he would run against Congressman Steve Cohen in the Democratic Primary for Tennessee's 9th congressional district‚Äîa historically majority African-American and heavily Democratic district. In September 2009, Herenton attracted controversy with his statement in a radio interview that Congressman Steve Cohen \\"really does not think very much of African-Americans\\" and that \\"[Cohen]'s played the black community well.\\" Herenton's campaign manager Sidney Chism, who is also African American, told the New York Times that the Memphis-area congressional seat Cohen holds \\"was set aside for people who look like me. It wasn't set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation.\\" The National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) criticized Herenton for these remarks, stating that his comments were \\"unacceptable in a Democratic primary or anywhere in our political discourse.\\"Ex-Mayor of Memphis Starts Bid for Congress, Invoking Race in Campaign by Robbie Brown, New York Times, September 13, 2009.NJDC defends Cohen, Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), September 18, 2009. Despite Herenton's attempts to isolate Cohen from the African-American voting demographic, Cohen received endorsements from both President Barack Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus. Cohen won the Democratic primary election, and Herenton gained only 20% of the vote.Luttrell Cohen Win Most- Watched Races  2019 Mayoral Race  On April 5, 2018 Dr. Herenton announced his intention to run for mayor of Memphis for a 6th term. Just over a year later, Herenton kicked off his 2019 campaign with several hundred supporters at a rally at his campaign headquarters. At the kickoff, Herenton told supporters that he intended to complete an agenda of justice left unfinished and combat the elitist power structure driving city policy. The Memphis Police Union endorsed Dr. Herenton for mayor for the first time at the campaign kickoff. On July 27, AFSCME local 1733 endorsed Herenton for Mayor. During the press conference, Dr. Herenton noted how in 1968 he marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Local 1733 in the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike, and now for the first time in 2019 AFSCME is standing with him and endorsing him for mayor. On August 1, IBEW Local 1288 (the union that represents the city's utility workers at MLGW) endorsed Dr. Herenton for mayor. At the announcement, union leaders praised Herenton for looking out for workers during his initial tenure as mayor. On October 3, as the results came in, Herenton conceded to Strickland. Personal life Dr. Herenton has four children; he and his first wife are divorced.
