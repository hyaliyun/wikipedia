It rises in the hills north of Painscastle, flowing initially to the southeast before turning to the southwest at Rhos-goch, assuming a more westerly direction at Painscastle then wrapping around the western end of the Begwns as it drops into a wooded gorge to join the River Wye as a left-bank tributary near to Erwood. Rain falling on the southern slopes of Llanbedr Hill and the northern slopes of the Begwns makes its way into the Bachawy. Much of the Bachawy's valley is developed in Silurian age mudstones and siltstones and parts are aligned with the Church Stretton Fault Zone. The lower gorge is cut in part through late Silurian age Raglan Mudstone Formation which forms the lowest part of the Old Red Sandstone. At the eastern end of its catchment is Rhos Goch Common National Nature Reserve. Another notable nature reserve within its catchment is Llan Bwch-llyn Lake, a stream draining which, enters the Bachawy as a right-bank tributary below Llanddewi. The lake is the largest natural water body in the old county of Radnorshire and is a site of special scientific interest. It is managed on behalf of Dwr Cymru Welsh Water by the Radnorshire Wildlife Trust as a reserve both for its wetland plants and its birdlife. Some notable plants found here include bogbean, lesser skullcap, devil's bit scabious and globe flower. There are northern pike, European perch and common rudd in the lake and breeding birds include sedge warbler, Eurasian reed warbler and common reed bunting, as well as coot, moorhen and water rail. Winter visitors include teal, tufted duck, mallard, pochard and goldeneye. The lake is mentioned by the famed curate from Clyro, the Reverend Francis Kilvert in his diary.

The first wave of flooding occurred in November 2019, mainly affecting Yorkshire and the Humber, the East Midlands and the West Midlands. Further isolated flooding incidents were reported in December and January, before the second main wave of flooding, caused by Storms Ciara and Dennis, occurred in February 2020. The excessive rainfall led to the wettest February since records began, in 1766, in England and Wales with beating the record from 1833.https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadukp/data/ranked_monthly/HadEWP_ranked_mly.txt  Background  Most of England received above average rainfall during October 2019, with some catchments receiving over double the average monthly total. Soils were wetter than average for the time of year across most of the country by the end of October. Monthly mean river flows were classed as exceptionally high at just over a third of indicator sites. Early on 8 November, heavy and prolonged rainfall fell on these saturated catchments across the southern Peak District causing flash floods and rivers to burst their banks. A week later on 14 November a further low pressure system brought more heavy rain to areas further south, raising water levels along on the rivers Severn and Avon.  Mid-November flooding  = Yorkshire and the Humber = Sheffield The Met Office reported that Sheffield had of rain in just over the 36 hours which preceded the flood. This is almost the same as the monthly average for November. On 7 November Supertram services were terminated at Meadowhall South/Tinsley tram stop over fears that floodwater would put the Tinsley tram bridge in danger. On 8 November, shoppers spent the night inside Meadowhall shopping centre as floods surrounded the complex. Rain continued overnight leading to a major incident being declared in Sheffield. Millhouses public park, where in the 2007 floods a boy was swept to his death, was closed, due to concerns about the level of the River Sheaf, a tributary of the Don. On 8 November junction 34 of the M1 was closed. Flooding throughout the Regions had a significant impact on rail services from Sheffield. On 7 November flooding at Denby Dale resulted in trains being unable to run between Huddersfield and Sheffield via Penistone. On 14 November train services between Sheffield and Worksop were cancelled because of floods as was the East Midlands Trains service from Sheffield to London St Pancras via the Midland Main Line. On 15 November the TransPennine Express services between Sheffield and Scunthorpe was suspended because of floods in Kirk Sandall, Doncaster. The Hope Valley line service was also disrupted due to flooding at nearby Edale. Flooding of railway lines in Rotherham also affected train services from Sheffield. On 17 November the Met Office reported its Sheffield weather station had recorded its wettest ever autumn, \\"With 15 days [of November] still to go, the site has already recorded 427.6 mm of rain. The previous record was set in 2000 with 425.2 mm of rain falling between 1 September and 30 November that year.\\"  Rotherham  The railway tracks at Rotherham Central railway station, used by both Arriva Rail North railway services and the Sheffield Supertram tram-train, were flooded. Trains were unable to run between Sheffield and Gainsborough Central or Lincoln Central. The Sheffield to Leeds (via Moorthorpe) route was also suspended. On 7 November M1 junction 32, the M18 turn-off was reduced to two lanes due to floodwater. On 12 November flooding led to an oil spillage which led to the RSPCA having to rescue 60 swans. On 15 November it was reported that all Supertram services were operating as normal with the exception of the tram-train. Plans to switch on the Christmas lights in Rotherham were cancelled until further notice because of the floods. Rotherham Parkgate retail park was also closed because of flooding with 85% of the shops re- opening on 16 November.  Doncaster  The Don flooded in Doncaster, reaching record levels with severe flood warnings continuing into 12 November. On 11 November there were 5 severe flood warnings in place for Kirk Bramwith, South Bramwith, Willow Bridge, Bentley and Fishlake, with residents of Fishlake, Thorpe in Balne, Trumfleet and Bentley being asked to evacuate their homes. Fishlake local resident, Grant Berry appeared on BBC News stating, \\"The village had not flooded in over 100 years\\" as he evacuated his home. On 11 November the Environment Agency deployed four pumps at Fishlake in an attempt to reduce the depth of flood-water and an RAF Chinook was used to convey aggregate to shore-up the banks of drainage channels east of Bentley. Fishlake residents were critical of the Environment Agency which had stated that on Friday 8 November at 5:00 pm there was no flood warning. Even when the village had flooded by 9:00 pm the Environment Agency had still not issued a flood warning. On 15 November John Curtin, executive director of flood and coastal risk management at the Environment Agency, said 38 pumps had been used in homes in Fishlake to reduce the inundation. Arriva Rail North told customers not to travel on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe route. CrossCountry diverted its trains away from Doncaster. The floods resulted in the closure of 39 roads in the Doncaster area on 11 November. On 15 November Doncaster Council issued a list of 26 roads still closed due to the flood.  Barnsley  On 7 November the River Dearne burst its banks, flooding the pub and restaurant, The Mill of the Black Monks, thought to be Barnsley's oldest pub. The building mostly dates back to 1150 AD, with some parts dating back to 700 AD. Other nearby residences were also flooded. On 7 November, within Barnsley twelve roads were closed due to floodwater. Residents and businesses in the Lundwood and Low Valley areas of Barnsley were flooded and the B6096, Station Road at Wombwell was affected by severe flooding. On 15 November three roads remained closed due to floodwater, New Road (from Tingle Bridge Lane junction to the roundabout at Lions Lodge) and Smithy Bridge Lane at Hemingfield, and Birds Nest Lane at Penistone.  Hull  On 14 November run-off from fields closed the A63, the only link between Hull and the M62 motorway. The road re- opened on 15 November although a significant number of roads remained closed in the Hull area, including sections of the A164.  Leeds and West Yorkshire  On 8 November flooding of railway lines on part of the East Coast Mainline led to delays on the Leeds to London service, with all LNER electric locomotive hauled services being cancelled. At least seven roads in West Yorkshire were closed, including the M606 Northbound main carriageway at junction 3, part of the A641 and some of the A646 Halifax to Burnley route. The moveable weir at Knostrop, part of the River Aire flood alleviation scheme, was lowered to reduce the water level upstream. = East Midlands = River Derwent and Derbyshire The Derwent flooded, and parts of Matlock were submerged as a month's worth of rainfall fell in a day. A woman swept away when wading through fast moving floodwaters and found dead later the same day was named as a former High Sheriff of Derbyshire, Annie Hall. During a visit to Matlock, Boris Johnson, the British prime minister said the floods were \\"not like something we need to escalate to the level of a national emergency\\". On 12 November a number of car parks at Chatsworth House were closed, with access to the Christmas market restricted to pre-booked customers and 'Friends of Chatsworth'. Also on 12 November, flooding at Edale led to the closure of the Hope Valley rail service from Sheffield to Manchester Piccadilly. Services resumed later that day. On 14 November the railtracks at Draycott flooded, leading to delays on journeys from Derby to Long Eaton on the Midland Main Line, and the Matlock to Newark Castle lines were also affected.  River Trent and Nottinghamshire  On 7 November the River Ryton burst its banks resulting in major incidents being declared in Worksop. Residents and Bassetlaw District Council leader, Simon Greaves, were critical of the Canal and River Trust (CRT) for not opening The Canch sluice gate. This sluice feeds excess water to the Chesterfield Canal via a channel. The sluice was eventually opened by a firefighter. The initial response of the CRT to requests to open the gate was to say no flood alert had been issued for the Ryton, according to a resident of the Riverside Caravan Park. When CRT engineers visited the sluice gate they refused to enter the building housing the sluice, saying the building was 'unsafe'. The CRT is responsible for the sluice gate though the building is owned by the council. On 15 November the CRT released a statement stating that the sluice was not designed to drain the river. It said \\"Definitively, it would not have alleviated the flooding in the town. The water would have stayed in the area as the feeder, canal and river all run in parallel a very short distance apart\\". Residents of mobile homes in Newark were evacuated on 9 November over fears that the River Trent would burst its banks. The Environment Agency issued a flood warning for Retford and moved pumps into the Redtford Beck area in an attempt to prevent the flooding of homes. In Mansfield the heavy rain also caused a mudslide which resulted in 35 homes being evacuated. Transport was affected in the county with road and rail closures. East Midlands Railway services on the Nottingham to Mansfield and Worksop routes were disrupted due to flooding on the railway line. More than seven roads were closed in the Nottinghamshire area. The rail service between Shirebrook and Worksop, on the Robin Hood Line was also disrupted. On 14 November East Midlands Railway said a flooded railway line near Loughborough had disrupted services between Lincoln, Nottingham and Leicester. The bus operator, Nottingham City Transport reported that flooding had affected fourteen of its routes, with some bus stops not being served.  Lincolnshire  More than in Lincolnshire were underwater when the Barlings Eau burst its banks. Twelve flood warnings were issued in the county and some farms were cut off. About 30 residents were evacuated from the Short Ferry Caravan Park near to Bardney, which is close to the Barlings Eau. On 8 November homes in the Cherry Willingham area of Lincoln were inundated as the River Witham burst its banks, and the area around the Brayford Pool in the centre of Lincoln was flooded. A number of roads were closed in the county including parts of the A1 (northbound), parts of the A46 and parts of the A631. Bransby Horses, an animal sanctuary near Lincoln, was told by the Environment Agency to close their drain valves and flood their site. The sanctuary, which is located on the River Till washlands has long-standing agreement with the agency to do so in order to reduce flooding in Lincoln. The washlands help protect 7,000 homes and businesses in and around Lincoln. The Bransby Horses site has seen human sewage and four feet of water on their fields with 40% of the grazing land unsafe for at least the next six months (from November 2019). Over one hundred of the four hundred and fifty horses, donkeys, ponies and mules were moved to the sanctuary's site in Barlings, which was bought specifically to deal with emergency evacuations of the Bransby site. In Grimsby the River Freshney reached record levels flooding homes in nearby Healing. Riverhead pumping station, operated by Associated British Ports attempted to pump as much of the Freshney's water into Alexandra Dock as was possible using all three Archimedes screws at the pumping station simultaneously. Lade Bank pumping station On 14 November nine roads in Lincolnshire remained closed because of flooding. On the same day an embankment supporting Fodderdyke Bank, a road at New Leake, near Boston, collapsed into the adjacent drain. The drain takes excess rainfall to pumping stations at Lade Bank and Hobhole where it is discharged into The Wash. Peter Bateson, Chief Executive at Witham Fourth District Internal Drainage Board said, \\"We are seeing many slips in the area, but the one at Fodderdyke is the largest.\\" Work to repair the embankment, which requires a specialist piling tool as the bedrock is so hard, is expected to be finished by mid-December. By 15 November Environment Agency data from monitoring station at Brigg had recorded 104.6 mm of rainfall since 1 November, more than twice the 50 mm average for the month. Both the New River Ancholme (constructed in 1635) and the Old River Ancholme had over-topped their banks flooding parts of Brigg. Fifty homes across North Lincolnshire were flooded, according to figures released by North Lincolnshire council. = West Midlands =  Birmingham  On 14 November the River Cole burst its banks causing flooding in the Hall Green area. West Midlands Railway services between Birmingham Snow Hill and Stratford-Upon-Avon were cancelled.

Shropshire  On 14 November in Shropshire nine schools were closed because of floods. The Environment Agency issued three flood warnings for the county, two on the River Severn and one on the River Teme. Sections of the A49 and A488 were closed as were a number of minor roads, particularly in the south of the county. On 15 November four schools remained closed. On 15 November rail services between Shrewsbury and Welshpool did not run due to flooding.  Herefordshire  On 14 November the A438 at Portwaym was flooded with the local authority asking drivers to avoid it if possible and the A417 at Maund Bryan was closed after cars became stranded in floodwater. Eighteen schools in Herefordshire were closed due to the floods. West Midlands Trains reported that the railway line between Great Malvern and Hereford was closed because of flooding. A landslip led to the closure of the B4234 between Kerne Bridge and Walford. On 14 November the Environment Agency issued flood warnings on all rivers in Herefordshire and the Lugg, the Teme and the Frome burst their banks, affecting a small number roads in the north of the county. Settlements affected by flooding included the Greyfriars area, Leintwardine, Walford, Little Hereford, Ashford Carbonel, Ross-on-Wye and Hereford with the A4103 and A4113 roads also affected.  Worcestershire  On 14 November Worcestershire County Council closed sixty one schools because of the floods. The Environment Agency deployed a pump at Upton-upon-Severn, Worcestershire, to remove standing water. Parts of the A38 were closed in both directions at Stoke Heath because of flooding. A mudslide occurred on the road at Wilden Lane, Stourport-on-Severn although the road remained open. In Wychavon, on 14 November thirty eight roads were closed, including parts of the, A44, A449 and A4133, with one road at Hartlebury being closed due to a mud slide.

On 14 November West Midlands Trains' services between Worcester and Birmingham were cancelled because of flooding in Bromsgrove. On 15 November train services between Moreton-in-Marsh and Worcester Shrub Hill did not run because to flooding. Floods caused major disruption to transport on 15 November with over 125 roads being closed in Worcestershire, including sections of the A38, A44, A442, A443, A448 and A449. Bus services between Tenbury and Worcester were cancelled as were many school bus services. In Evesham, river levels were at their highest since the 2007 United Kingdom floods. The Environment Agency reported that between twenty five and thirty properties close to the Avon in Evesham were flooded. On 16 November over twenty five roads remained closed throughout the county. The Three Counties Farming Conference at the Three Counties Showground, Malvern was cancelled on 15 November due to road conditions.

Flooding on the tracks disrupted rail services to Leamington Spa. Twenty seven schools across the county were closed on 14 November due to flooding. On 14 November the Shipston river gauge on the River Stour reached a high level which prompted the Environment Agency to issue flood alerts for Halford, Crimscote, Alderminster, Preston-on-Stour, Ailstone, Atherstone-on-Stour and Clifford Chambers. The Agency said three flood warnings have been issued for the River Dene and Stour with a total of 20 flood alerts in place in the county. On 15 November the River Avon broke its banks causing flooding across Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The Environment Agency issued flood warnings for Stratford-upon-Avon, Evesham, Bidford-on- Avon, Warwick, and Leamington Spa. In Stratford-upon-Avon, temporary flood barriers were installed near the town centre. Floodwater reached the road outside Anne Hathaway's Cottage in Shottery, Stratford-upon-Avon. = South East England =  Oxfordshire  On 14 November the CrossCountry trains services to Banbury were affected by surface water on the line to Leamington Spa. Oxfordshire County Council announced that flooded roads were impassable between Woodeaton, Elsfield, and Marston, and that the road between Waterperry and Worminghall was flooded. Vehicle drivers were turned away from Wendlebury due to flood water. On 14 November there were 20 flood alerts in place across the county. On 14 November flood alerts were issued for the River Thames and River Cherwell through Oxford.  Buckinghamshire  Surface water flooding in the Beachampton area of Buckinghamshire led to vehicles being stranded. = South West England =  Gloucestershire  On 14 November nine roads were closed in the county, with many more affected by surface water flooding.

Twelve roads remained closed on 17 November, with the B4234 at Kerne Bridge being closed due to a landslip.  December flooding  Flooding was reported across southern England from 18‚Äì22 December, caused by repeated intense cold fronts moving across the area, accumulating high rainfall totals. In total, 91 flood warnings and 237 flood alerts were issued by the Environment Agency. In many areas, more than of rain fell in less than 36 hours. Flooding caused widespread travel disruption during the pre- Christmas rush, which is traditionally the busiest time of year for public transport in the United Kingdom. In Buckinghamshire, there were reports of cars becoming stranded on flooded roads, and a mother and her three sons had to be rescued from a stranded vehicle. The River Great Ouse burst its banks in St Ives, Cambridgeshire. Flooding was also reported in Reading after the River Loddon burst its banks and the River Thames reached high levels. Great Western Railway and South Western Railway services were suspended between Guildford and Godalming after a collapsed embankment blocked a tunnel entrance. Minor surface flooding of roads and railways was also reported in Norfolk and Suffolk. The M23 motorway was closed in both directions between junctions 10 and 11 in West Sussex after becoming blocked by floodwater. In neighbouring East Sussex, the River Cuckmere burst its banks and fast-flowing floodwaters inundated the village of Alfriston, causing severe damage including washing away parked cars; the Brighton Main Line railway was also closed as a result of flooding, affecting Govia Thameslink Railway services. The River Medway in Kent burst its banks, flooding the town of Maidstone and nearby Yalding and Teston. In Yalding, visitors to a caravan site were rescued by boat after it became cut-off by rising waters. Trains operated by Southeastern between Maidstone West and Strood, and between Tunbridge Wells and Hastings, were suspended as a result of downed trees, track damage and electricity failures. In South West England, the Somerset Levels witnessed widespread flooding. Up to of rainfall was recorded in Devon and Cornwall, causing serious flooding in numerous towns and villages, particularly Hayle where a major incident was declared by police. Up to 60 properties in Hayle were flooded. Roads including the main A30 and railways including Great Western Railway services between Exeter St David's and Taunton were closed or suspended, isolating much of the region from the rest of the country for several days. = Chertsey tornado = A weak tornado was reported in Chertsey, Surrey on 21 December; it was filmed by a vehicle dashcam crossing both carriageways of the M25 motorway before striking a residential area, damaging homes, gardens and vehicles. Several houses suffered severe roof damage as a result of the tornado and many cars were damaged beyond repair. Subsequent damage assessment rated the tornado as an F1 on the Fujita scale according to the European Severe Weather Database.https://eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi  Storm Ciara (8‚Äì11 February)   Storm Dennis (15‚Äì19 February)  = East Midlands = By daybreak on 16 February, severe flooding was reported across the East Midlands, including Ilkeston and Lowdham; a major incident was declared by the local council in the latter village. Across Leicestershire, dozens of roads were flooded. In Loughborough, the River Soar and its tributary the Wood Brook both burst their banks, flooding residential areas of the town. Flooding was also reported in nearby Sileby, where the flood siren was sounded. Flooding near Draycott in Derbyshire resulted in the temporarily closure of the Midland Main Line between Derby and Long Eaton, affecting East Midlands Railway services between Sheffield and London St Pancras. The Nottingham City Transport bus depot at Gotham was flooded, disrupting some routes as they had to be operated out of the company's other garages; further flooding in the Nottingham area, including in Woodborough, compounded disruption to their services as well as those of rival operator Trentbarton. Flooding of homes was also reported in nearby Rainworth and Radcliffe-on-Trent. Later on 16 February, the main road through the Derbyshire village of Repton was closed after floodwaters made it impassable, and passing cars had been splashing water into homes and businesses. There was also some minor flooding from the River Derwent in Derby itself, including at the Derby Rugby Club. Pumps were deployed to protect the town of Retford from flooding. = London & South East England = At around 07:30 local time on 16 February, the 06:41 Thameslink service from Cambridge to Potters Bar, operated by a Class 700 unit, struck a tree on the railway that had been downed by high winds near Royston in Hertfordshire. There were no injuries in the incident, and the train suffered only minor damage. The tree was removed by 08:45, allowing the train to continue to its destination, after which it was taken out of service and returned to the depot for safety inspections. Rail services subsequently resumed on the Thameslink line with heavy delays due to storm-related speed restrictions as a safety precaution following the Royston incident. In the London area, adverse weather conditions resulted in the postponement of the Women's FA Cup football matches between Arsenal and Lewes and between Crystal Palace and Brighton & Hove Albion; the latter is contested as the M23 derby. In the New Forest area of Hampshire, a DPDgroup delivery van was washed away from a swollen ford, with the driver making a lucky escape after the van became lodged under a tree. In nearby Romsey, temporary flood barriers were erected to protect more than 200 at-risk properties from flooding. = South West England = Severe flooding was reported in the Dartmoor area on 16 February, with the surrounding towns and villages of Bovey Tracey, Heathfield, Newton Abbot, Littlehempston and Highweek particularly affected. Part of the South West Coast Path near Swanage in Dorset was closed after it was blocked by a landslide, and nearby cliffs were deemed to be dangerously unstable. = Wales = Storm Dennis brought historic flooding to South Wales, particularly to areas of the Valleys covered by the Met Office red severe weather warning for rain; many areas saw more than a month's worth of rainfall within a period of less than 48 hours. In Maerdy, Rhondda, more than of rain was recorded in a 48-hour period starting at midday on 14 February. As a result of widespread serious flooding and landslides, South Wales Police declared a major incident across the region, and the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service responded to more than 1,400 calls in a 12-hour period. Hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged, and one person was killed after falling into the River Tawe near Swansea. Natural Resources Wales issued two severe flood warnings, meaning an imminent danger to life was occurring, during the course of Storm Dennis ‚Äì these covered the River Neath around Aberdulais and the River Taff around Pontypridd. More than 80 lower-level flood warnings were issued across Wales. Large-scale evacuations of villages in the River Usk and River Wye floodplains were co- ordinated by emergency services on 16 February in anticipation of serious flooding. Further evacuations took place in Monmouthshire and Neath Port Talbot, with the entire village of Tonna being evacuated by bus. The levels of the River Wye at Monmouth reached a record high on 18 February. At Whitebrook beside the Wye, a woman was rescued after spending 12 hours on the roof of her submerged car. Hundreds of people were evacuated from Nantgarw. Emergency services were also stretched by the need to carry out rescues from vehicles and properties as people were caught out by rapidly rising floodwaters, including from homes in Crickhowell, Powys. Additionally, the main road bridge in Crickhowell was severely damaged. Severe flooding occurred in the town of Pontypridd and in parts of Cardiff as the River Taff reached its highest level in recorded history, flooding homes and businesses and disrupting transport. Houses in Pontypridd were inundated by more than of water, with residents being rescued from the upper floors; riverside walls collapsed and parked vehicles were washed away, adding damaging debris to the fast-flowing waters and exacerbating the situation in Pontypridd. The town centre was completely inundated, and a major emergency was declared across the wider Rhondda Cynon Taf council area. Some of the other badly affected settlements were Cwm in Blaenau Gwent and Argoed in Caerphilly, where emergency services spent considerable time unsuccessfully trying to pump floodwaters away from houses. Further flooding of homes and businesses was reported in the settlements of New Tredegar, Bedwas, Newbridge, Risca and Llanbradach. Transport for Wales reported severe disruption to rail services across Wales and beyond into England, including key routes from Cardiff Central, Aberystwyth, Holyhead and Carmarthen to Birmingham New Street and Manchester Piccadilly. In addition to flooding, dozens of landslides were reported across Wales. Debris from landslides in the upper valleys, including mud and large rocks, was carried down into the town of Mountain Ash by floodwaters, worsening the damage from flooding there. In Tylorstown, a large mudslide on a steep hillside above the village was caught on video; on the other side of the same mountain in Llanwonno, more than of hillside suddenly collapsed, damaging telecommunications equipment. = West Midlands = Flooding started causing issues across the West Midlands on 16 February, when a major incident was declared in Worcestershire as rising waters swept a woman into the River Teme near Tenbury in her vehicle; severe flooding hampered the search for her, and her body was found downstream several days later. A man was also swept into the Teme near Tenbury Wells, but was later rescued; more than 130 homes in the village were flooded, where waters peaked higher than the previous historic floods of 2007. In Hereford, the River Wye reached its highest level in recorded history, and the major incident declaration was subsequently expanded to cover Herefordshire and Shropshire. Across Herefordshire, landslides and high river levels damaged roads and bridges. In Ludlow, Shropshire, more than 50 homes were flooded. Properties were also flooded in the centre of Shrewsbury as the River Severn burst its banks. The Environment Agency described the flooding across parts of the West Midlands as \\"unprecedented\\", and warned that excess runoff from the upper reaches of the Severn in Wales meant that the flooding in the lower Severn valley would likely be prolonged for at least three days. = Yorkshire and the Humber = In Bradford on 16 February, the M606 motorway was closed in both directions due to flooding on one of the carriageways, which persisted despite efforts overnight to pump the road clear. Flooding in the Calder Valley, which had been severely impacted by Storm Ciara the weekend before, was less than initially anticipated. The River Calder rose to very high levels but did not break its banks in Todmorden, Hebden Bridge or Mytholmroyd, unlike the previous weekend, and only minor surface water flooding was reported across Calderdale in general. Voluntary flood wardens in the Calder Valley described it as \\"an unexpectedly steady night\\". There was flooding in Boroughbridge as the River Ure peaked at , breaking its banks in several places. In the Leeds area, new flood defences were operated for the first time on the River Aire at Crown Point and Knostrop, considerably lowering the level of the river in a short period of time and reducing the flooding risk for the city; these particular defences were built at a cost of ¬£50 million, protecting more than 3,500 vulnerable homes and businesses. Flooding was reported in the Sheffield area. Surface water flooded sliproads onto the Sheffield Parkway in Handsworth, which then had to be closed as a car became stranded in the water. River levels were very high, especially along the River Don, resulting in some minor riverside flooding in the Lower Don Valley between the city centre and Meadowhall. In Rotherham, the Don and Rother burst their banks, flooding the railway around Rotherham Central station and resulting in the suspension of Arriva Rail North and Sheffield Supertram services. Additionally, the Snake Pass road to Manchester was closed as a result of landslides. Response On 11 November Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a Cobra meeting over the governments response to the flooding which came after leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn sent a letter to Johnson calling on him to hold a Cobra meeting. On 13 November the Prime Minister visited Stainforth, South Yorkshire, as 100 soldiers from the Light Dragoons and 2 Royal Anglian were deployed to the area. Johnson was heckled by local residents. On 11 November Corbyn said, \\"Under the Tories, front-line flood response and Environment Agency staff have been slashed by a fifth, and our fire-and-rescue service by nearly a quarter.\\" The BBC scrutinized these figures and found they were supported by statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office. On 11 November the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government initiated the Bellwin scheme, designed to provide compensation to local authorities for some of the initial costs they incur as a result of flooding in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. On 14 the Environment Agency estimated that 830 properties had been flooded. This figure was challenged by The Guardian, which had contacted local authorities in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire, and found that at least 1,758 properties had been flooded. On 15 November the Prime Minister announced households and business owners significantly affected by recent floods would receive relief on their council tax and business rates for at least the next three months. Chris Read, leader of Rotherham Council was critical of the lack of consultation with local authorities. A reporter from the Rotherham Advertiser sought clarity from the Government on how the relief would work, including eligibility criteria. A spokeswoman for the government admitted the criteria are \\"yet to be decided\\". On 21 February Prince Charles visited Pontypridd and met with local residents. Rock band the Manic Street Preachers donated ¬£3,000 towards those dealing with the flood damage, and a fundraising page, set up by local MP Alex Davies-Jones, raised more than ¬£20,000. 0n 12 June 2020 Dan Jarvis, Mayor of Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, wrote to Boris Johnson and government ministers asking for action on improving flood defences in \\"close collaboration with devolved authorities.\\" The government had made promises for action seven months earlier. The government responded by saying it was working to \\"identify suitable arrangements\\" for a \\"Yorkshire floods roundtable\\". Many residents and businesses in the Fishlake area were still not able to return home or were in need of repair work.

History The level crossing site at Pontyates Station. Pontyates station was opened on 1 February 1909 by the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway on the Kidwelly and Cwmmawr section of the line and was closed by the Great Western Railway in 1953 with the last passenger train on the line running on Saturday 19 September 1953.

The railway was originally a freight only line,1:1 million - 1:1 10K, 1900s built on the route of the old Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and prone to flooding, but stations were established due to pressure from the public, Pontyates being a significant size due to the number of collieries in the area.

October 1940. Orembai or Arombai is a type of plank boat from the Maluku Islands of Eastern Indonesia. It is mainly used for fishing and transport. This vessel is used as far as Batavia, where in the 17th century it became popular to go out \\"orembaaien\\" on an evening rowing on the river or city canals.  Etymology  At the bend of Piroe, Seram, 1892. The name orembai or arumbai is probably comes from degenerated Malay word rembaya, which means state ship, with portuguese prefix 'o'. In other variants of language they are also called orembaai, arambaai, arobail, arubai, arubaillo, arumbai, arumbae, oranbai, oranbaik, orang-bays, and corambay.Friederici, G. \\"Beitrage zur Volker und Sprachenkunde von Deutsch-Neuguinea.\\" Mitteil. aus den Deutsch. Schutzgeb., Erganzungsheft Nr. 5, 1912. Martin says that the name orembai is a contraction for orang baik (\\"good man\\") and comes from the era of the Hongi voyages, i.e. these boats are the opposite of Hongitocht kora kora, which is a war vessel.  Description  It is characterized by being equal-ended, with the prow and the stern both rising up abruptly into a sharp point about from the ground giving it a crescent shape. It is widest at the middle, tapering gradually towards both ends. It usually has three strakes attached to a narrow keel which in turn is joined to a stem-post at each end. The stempost is broader and lower than the sternpost. Traditional orembai uses the tanja or lete sail, but more modern orembai adopted european-style rigging, such as pinisi rig and schooner rig. Orembai is built using planks, joined with lashed-lug construction. The orembai is very similar to the mon of the North Solomons. It also resembles the kora kora, but differs in that, like most large Austronesian ships, the orembai does not have outriggers (likely due to their inherent stability).

It is the second-highest point of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated east of Pemberton, and northeast of Lillooet Lake. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Matier, to the south. The mountain supports the Matier Glacier on the southwest slope, and the Anniversary Glacier on the southeast slope. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Cayoosh Creek. The first ascent of the mountain was made on July 19, 1957 by Dick Chambers and Paddy Sherman, who were members of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club. The first ascent party named this peak for its position at the head of Joffre Creek. The mountain's name honors Marshal Joseph Jacques C√©saire Joffre (1852‚Äì1931), a French general who served as Commander-in-Chief of French Armies in World War I. The name was officially adopted on June 22, 1967, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Joffre Peak should not be confused with Mount Joffre in the Canadian Rockies which is also named for the same person. Climate Joffre Peak in winter Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Joffre Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Joffre Peak. Mt.

The Syrian-American community is centered in East Baltimore. While Syrian- Americans have had a presence in Baltimore for over a century, most Syrians in Baltimore are recent immigrants and refugees who have fled the Syrian Civil War. Demographics A 1913 report on Eastern Orthodoxy from the Episcopal Church claimed that there were no Syrians in Baltimore and only a few wealthy Syrians in nearby Washington, D.C. In 1920, 29 foreign-born white people in Baltimore spoke the Syrian or Arabic languages. As of 2015, about 200 Syrian refugees lived in the Baltimore metropolitan area. History According to the Baltimore City Community College Refugee Youth Project, 650 to 750 Syrian refugees were being settled in Baltimore each year as of 2015. The Syrian community in Baltimore grew in size following the beginning of the Syrian Civil War in 2011. Following the Obama administration's order to accept at least 10,000 Syrian refugees, some were resettled in Baltimore. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Senator Ben Cardin, and other Maryland politicians urged to Obama administration to do more for Syrian refugees. Rawlings-Blake and 17 Baltimore politicians sent President Obama a letter urging for more Syrians to be resettled in Baltimore. The Baltimore branch of the International Rescue Committee office in Highlandtown has helped to settle Syrian refugees in the city. In 2015, the IRC helped 26 Syrian refugees settle in Baltimore, 11 of whom were children. The Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has also been active in supporting Syrian immigrants and refugees in Baltimore. Catholic Relief Services, Lutheran World Relief, and other Christian organizations in Baltimore have assisted Syrians and Syrian-Americans by building safe shelters for refugees, sending supplies to Syria, and resettling refugees. Most Syrian refugees in Baltimore come to the city due to family connections. The Jewish-American community in Baltimore has been active in supporting the resettlement of Syrian refugees. The Union for Reform Judaism, the American Jewish Council, Jewish Community Relations Council, and groups representing the Conservative and Orthodox movements have vocalized support for Syrian refugees. Rabbi Daniel Cotzin Burg of Beth Am, a Conservative synagogue in Baltimore, has expressed support for Syrian refugees in Baltimore. Beth Am congregants have voiced concerned about stereotypes of Syrian Muslims and Islamophobia following the January 2015 √éle-de-France attacks. Beth Am congregants have cooperated with the International Rescue Committee to assist Syrian refugees. However, some Jewish-Americans have opposed resettlement of Syrian refugees due to concerns about Muslim antisemitism. Morton Klein, President of the Zionist Organization of America, published an opinion piece in the Baltimore Jewish Times denouncing HIAS, the Anti-Defamation League, and other Jewish-American organizations for what he called \\"supporting dangerous Syrian immigration\\", writing that \\"The violence perpetrated by Muslim immigrants in Europe ‚Äî especially toward European Jews ‚Äî portends what America has in store if we bring more such immigrants here.\\" HIAS had collected the signatures of 80 rabbis from the Baltimore-Washington area that was sent to Congress urging members of Congress to learn from Jewish history and welcome all refugees. Culture =Cuisine= Kosher Syrian Jewish cuisine is available in Baltimore through a catering service called Mazza From Heaven. The catering service is run by two Syrian-Jewish mothers and offers traditional Syrian-Jewish and Persian-Jewish dishes. There is a Baltimore-based Syrian-American catering collective known as Aleppo Kitchen. The group is run by 20 Syrian refugee women and is supported by the Muslim Social Services Agency of Baltimore. =Media= In her books A Country Called Amreeka: Arab Roots, American Stories and The Home That Was Our Country: A Memoir of Syria, Syrian-American journalist Alia Malek has written about growing up in Baltimore as the daughter of Syrian immigrants. In 2018, a documentary about Syrian-Americans in Baltimore premiered titled This Is Home: A Refugee Story, directed by Alexandra Shiva. =Religion= Syrian-Americans in Baltimore are predominantly Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Due to the small numbers of Sephardi Syrian Jews in Baltimore, some have opted to study at Ashkenazi learning centers because of the shortage of Sephardi hakhamim and yeshivot.

The terminals are served by a shuttle bus. Unlike other airports which do not have physical airside connections between any terminal, NAIA's terminals are built on separate lots in the same site and airside shuttle buses between terminals are also provided for passengers with connecting flights. In addition to these terminals, there are cargo facilities at the airport. A heliport is located on a lot between Terminals 2 and 4, near Nayong Pilipino. Terminal 1 NAIA Terminal 1. January 2018 Terminal 1 check-in hall in 2015, post-renovation. Terminal 1 (also known as Ninoy Aquino Terminal) has an area of and was opened in 1981. It is the first higher- capacity airport terminal in the Philippines and the second oldest-terminal in the NAIA complex after Terminal 4, or the Manila Domestic Passenger Terminal. With the airport complex located along the border between the cities of Pasay and Para√±aque, Terminal 1, along with the main cargo terminal, are the only structures to be under the latter city's jurisdiction. The terminal originally had a design capacity of 4.5 million passengers per year,TERMINAL 1 but it was further expanded to accommodate 6 million passengers. Terminal 1 is currently used by numerous major international airlines, including Philippine Airlines, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Royal Brunei Airlines, and Saudia. =Early years= Following the destruction of the original structure of Manila International Airport by a fire on January 22, 1972, a slightly smaller terminal, designed by Philippine National Artist for Architecture, Leandro Locsin, Sr. and his firm L.V. Locsin and Associates, was built to replace it. This airport terminal would serve as the main terminal of Manila International Airport from that year until 1981. =Conception= The development of the Manila International Airport was approved through the promulgation of Executive Order No. 381. In 1973, a feasibility study and airport master plan were completed by Airways Engineering Corporation through a US$29.6 million loan from the Asian Development Bank. The Detailed Engineering Design of the New Manila International Airport Development Project was done by Renardet- Sauti, Transplan, and F. F. Cruz Consultant while the terminal's Detailed Brutalist Architectural Design was prepared by Leandro Locsin's L.V. Locsin and Associates.Airport : Terminal 1 Manila International Airport Authority Accessed September 7, 2006 In 1974, the detailed designs were adopted by the Philippine Government. The designs were subsequently approved by the Asian Development Bank on September 18, 1975. The government chose an area close to the original site of the former Manila Airport, deciding on an area of land governed by Para√±aque City, which was at the time a municipality of Metro Manila. Actual work on the terminal began during the second quarter of 1978. =Opening= The terminal was completed in 1981 and began operations in 1982. On April 2, 1982, a PAL Boeing 747-200B arriving from San Francisco via Honolulu became the first aircraft to dock at the terminal. During its opening, NAIA Terminal 1 was viewed as one of the world's most modern airports. =Assassination of Benigno, Aquino Jr.= China Airlines Flight 811 was a regularly scheduled flight from Taipei to Manila. On August 21, 1983, the flight utilized a Boeing 767-200 with the registration B-1836. On board this flight was Filipino politician Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., known by the nickname, Ninoy, who used a forged passport with the name \\"Marcial Bonifacio\\" for the final leg of his trip to the Philippines to avoid identification. Upon landing in Manila, the aircraft docked at Gate 8 (present-day Gate 11). Aviation Security Command (AVSECOM) personnel escorted Aquino out of the plane to the tarmac where a van owned by the agency awaited him. A single gunshot was heard, which was then identified as the shot that killed Aquino. Several shots burst out, killing the alleged assassin, Rolando Galman. Seconds later, a barrage of gunfire erupted, causing chaos in the plane, the tarmac, and the terminal. The bodies of Aquino and Galman lay on the tarmac; Aquino's body was loaded onto the van, which then sped away. Ironically, Flight 811 was the same flight number that had been involved in an accident in 1980 at the same airport, albeit with a different aircraft used (a Boeing 707). Four years after Aquino's assassination in 1983, the airport was given its present name by virtue of Republic Act No. 6639. Presently, a body mark of Aquino's assassination is on display at the departure parking lot. The spot at Gate 8 where he was killed has a memorial plaque. =Capacity breach= In 1989, a Master Plan Review recommended the construction of two new terminals (NAIA 2 and NAIA 3), as well as many other facility improvements. In 1991, the terminal reached capacity when it registered a total passenger volume of 4.53 million. Since 1991, the terminal has been over capacity and has been recording an annual average growth rate of 11%, but improvements to the airport increased its capacity to 6 million passengers yearly. =The terminal today= The terminal currently serves foreign carriers operating in Manila, except for All Nippon Airways, Cathay Pacific, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, KLM, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines, and United Airlines, which uses Terminal 3. It also serves Philippine Airlines flights to and from Toronto, Vancouver, New York, Auckland, Phnom Penh, Hanoi and the Middle East, except Dubai flights.https://www.philippineairlines.com/TravelInformation/BeforeYouFly/AtTheAirport/KnowYourTerminal/PALInternationalAirports Compared to international terminals in other Asian countries, NAIA 1 has been consistently ranked at the bottom due to limited and outdated facilities, poor passenger comfort, and crowding due to operating above designed capacity.Reviews of Manila Ninoy Aquino Airport with Passenger reviews about Manila Ninoy Aquino Airport standards airlinequality.com. From 2011 to 2013, NAIA 1 was ranked first on the lists of Asia's worst and the world's worst airports by the travel website \\"The Guide to Sleeping In Airports\\". Transport authorities planned to give NAIA 1 a makeover; the plans were approved by President Benigno Aquino III. The makeover and upgrade includes the expansion of the arrival area, the addition of parking spaces, and the improvement of other terminal facilities. The Transportation and Communications Department previously announced that as soon as Terminal 3 becomes fully operational, NAIA 1 was eyed by Cebu Pacific with the intention rehabilitating the terminal into an \\"Airport City\\" and serve as an exclusive terminal for their aircraft. On January 23, 2014, NAIA 1 started the process of upgrading and modernizing the 32-year-old passenger terminal building, planned to be finalized and operational by May 2015. The renovation project was divided into six phases and had 40 percent completion on December 16, 2014. The project included the installation of buckling restrained braces to strengthen the structural integrity of the building, as well as a facelift in the interior design of the terminal. From August 1 to October 1, 2014, five international airlines‚ÄîDelta Air Lines, KLM, Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Cathay Pacific‚Äîwere transferred to Terminal 3 in an effort to decrease the congestion of the terminal. On October 28, 2018, United Airlines and Qantas were also relocated to Terminal 3.http://philippineairspace.blogspot.com/2018/10/naia-terminal- rationalization-takes.html Qatar Airways was also relocated to Terminal 3 on December 1, 2018, while Turkish Airlines was transferred to Terminal 3 on January 1, 2019. = Airlines and destinations = Terminal 2  The NAIA Centennial Terminal 2 departure hall Terminal 2 (NAIA-2) also known as Centennial Terminal, has an area of , and is located at the Old MIA Road. It began construction in December 1995 and was inaugurated on May 1, 1999 and began operations in 1999. It has been named the Centennial Terminal in commemoration of the centennial year of the declaration of Philippine independence. The terminal was originally designed by A√©roports de Paris to be a domestic terminal, but the design was later modified to accommodate international flights. It has a capacity of 2.5 million passengers per year in its international wing and 5 million in its domestic wing. It is able to be modified to accommodate nine million passengers per year if needed. Terminal 2 is exclusively used by Philippine Airlines and PAL Express for both its domestic and international flights. It is divided into two wings: the North Wing, for international flights, and the South Wing, which handles domestic operations. It currently has 12 jet bridges. There are several cafes and restaurants in the Terminal post-security. There is also a small duty-free section in the north wing. The need for two more terminals was proposed by a Master Plan Review of the Airport that was undertaken in 1989 by A√©roports de Paris (ADP). The study was facilitated by means of a grant from the French Government. The review cost 2.9 million French francs and was submitted to the Philippine Government for evaluation in 1990. In 1991, the French government granted a 30 million franc soft loan to the Philippine government, which was to be used to cover the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design of the NAIA Terminal 2. ADP completed the design in 1992 and in 1994, the Japanese Government granted an 18.12 billion yen soft loan to the Philippine Government to finance 75% of the terminal's construction costs and 100% of the supervision costs. Construction of the Centennial Terminal began on December 11, 1995, and was formally turned over to the government of the Philippines on December 28, 1998. The terminal became fully operational by 1999. In August 2014, DOTC formally announced the plan of expanding of Terminal 2. The plan also considers to build a structure interconnecting Terminals 1 and 2. It also includes the demolition of the unused Philippine Village Hotel complex beside the terminal awaiting the fixing of certain issues. A fuel depot located between the terminals will be transferred to the demolished area to give way for the expansion. The 26 comfort rooms are being renovated, in which 16 are located in a passenger movement area. 4 of the 7 Air handling units are being repaired and 21 additional units are expected to be installed to improve the temperature in the Terminal. Terminal 3 NAIA Terminal 3's check in counters Terminal 3 (NAIA-3) is the newest and largest terminal in the NAIA complex. Construction started on it in 1997. Since construction, the terminal has been at the center with legal battles, red tape, and arbitration cases in both the United States and Singapore, as well as technical and safety concerns which delayed its opening several times. Terminal 3 is built on a lot that sits on Villamor Air Base. The terminal building has a total floor area of and has a total length of . A four-level shopping mall connects the terminal and parking buildings. The parking building has a capacity of 2,000 cars and the outdoor parking area has a capacity of 1,200 cars. The terminal is capable of servicing 33,000 passengers daily at peak or 6,000 passengers per hour. A 220-meter long footbridge that opened in April 2017, known as Runway Manila, connects the terminal with Newport City. The bridge contains moving walkways and can accommodate about 2,000 persons at any given time. Its apron area has a size of . The terminal has 34 jet bridges and 20 contact gates with the ability of servicing 28 planes at a time. The terminal has 70 flight information terminals, 314 display monitors, and of fiber optic I.T. cabling. It also has 29 restroom blocks. The departure area has five entrances all equipped with X-ray machines with the final security check having 18 X-ray machines. Its baggage claim has 7 large baggage carousels, each with its own flight display monitor. The terminal officially opened to selected domestic flights from July 22, 2008 (initially Cebu Pacific only, then Philippine Airlines' subsidiaries Air Philippines and PAL Express), with Cebu Pacific international flights using it from August 1, 2008. All international operations, except for those from PAL, are intended to operate from Terminal 3 in the future, originally proposed to move in fourth quarter of 2010,Bright future for rural banks ‚Äì Business Mirror Accessed May 14, 2009. however domestic carriers Cebu Pacific and PAL Express (then Air Philippines and became Airphil Express) remained the only tenants for the first two years of its operation. The vast majority of international flights still operate from Terminal 1, but All Nippon Airways became the first foreign-based carrier to operate out of Terminal 3 starting February 27, 2011. The terminal underwent a rehabilitation under the contractor Takenaka Corp. of Japan to improve its facilities and utilize the whole terminal. Previously, it only operated at half of its capacity awaiting the completion of the remaining system works. The terminal became fully operational on August 1, 2014, leading to the transfer of five international airlines to Terminal 3 to ease congestion at Terminal 1 starting with Delta Air Lines on that day, followed by KLM on August 4, Emirates on August 15, Singapore Airlines on September 1, and Cathay Pacific on October 1. Both United Airlines and Qantas are relocated to Terminal 3 from Terminal 1 on October 28, 2018. Middle Eastern carriers Qatar Airways was also relocated to Terminal 3 on December 1, 2018, while Turkish Airlines was also transferred to Terminal 3 on January 1, 2019. Terminal 4 Exterior of NAIA Terminal 4 Terminal 4 named as Manila Domestic Passenger Terminal, and still known as the Old Domestic Terminal, is the oldest of the four existing terminals, having been built in 1948. It is host to all domestic flights within the Philippines that are operated by Cebgo, among others. There are no jet bridges and passengers walk to and from the aircraft or are occasionally bussed. Twenty-six check-in counters are located in the terminal. The departure hall has the seating capacity for 969 people at a time. Several food stores and a book and magazine stall are also available. Five baggage carousels are located in the terminal while domestic airline offices, banks, restaurants and a grocery store are also located right beside the domestic passenger terminal.Domestic Terminal The Domestic Terminal is on the old Airport Road near the north end of Runway 13/31. An old hangar has since been annexed to the terminal.

Samm. The family's publishing house, √âditions Durand, published works by many of Durand's contemporaries, including Claude Debussy, Paul Dukas, Gabriel Faur√©, Jacques Ibert, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Ravel and Camille Saint-Sa√´ns.  Life  Born in Paris, Durand was a fellow student of Paul Dukas and Claude Debussy at the Conservatoire de Paris, where his only reward was an honourable mention (2e accessit) in harmony in 1884. Jacques Durand was first associated with his father Auguste Durand in 1886 as director of the music publishing house Durand-Sch√∂newerk & Cie at 4, Place de la Madeleine in Paris. On 19 November 1891, the company changed its name to √âditions A. Durand & Fils. In 1909, after his father's death, he took over the management of the publishing house. On 23 November of that year, the company changed its name again to √âditions Durand & Cie. From then on, Durand was associated with his cousin Gaston Choisnel (1857‚Äì1921) and then, from April 1921, with another cousin, . Among the main composers published under the direction of Jacques Durand were many of his contemporaries such as Louis Aubert, Andr√© Caplet, Debussy, Dukas, Gabriel Faur√©, Jacques Ibert, Vincent d'Indy, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Ravel, Albert Roussel, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, and Florent Schmitt. In 1914, under his direction, √âditions Durand launched the important collection √âdition classique Durand & Fils, with the French editions of 19th century works by renowned composers: piano sonatas and sonatas for violin and piano of Beethoven by Dukas, piano works of Fr√©d√©ric Chopin by Debussy, violin sonatas of Haydn by Schmitt, piano works of Felix Mendelssohn by Ravel, chamber music of Mendelssohn by Roussel, and piano works of Robert Schumann by Faur√©. Durand led an initiative to organise chamber music concerts, and sometimes even orchestral music concerts, to promote the authors of his publishing house's catalogue: in 1910, 1911, 1912 and 1913 and later in 1927. In 1924, Durand made a major donation of Claude Debussy's musical manuscripts to the library of the Conservatoire de Paris. Durand was also a patron of musicians; in 1927, he made a donation of 100,000 francs to the Acad√©mie des beaux-arts to establish a biennual musical composition prize for a symphonic or chamber music work. His untimely death in 1928 prevented him from seeing the realisation of this gift. Durand was the owner of the manor house of Bel √âbat in Avon, the former hunting lodge of King Henry IV of France, not far from Fontainebleau. In 1889, he married Augustine Marcotte, daughter of his adoptive mother. They had no children. On 22 August 1928, Durand died of a stroke at the age of 63. Notified by his widow, Ravel, then in the middle of the orchestration of the Bolero, came from Montfort l'Amaury the next day to Avon, and returned for the funeral celebrated in private: \\"Yes, I went to Avon on Thursday [23 August 1928]. The other week, a telegram from Ms. Durand told me that poor Jacques had a stroke and died within a few hours. I went back there on Saturday [25 August 1928].\\"The funeral having taken place on the 26th, Ravel probably slept in Bel Ebat. \\"For the funeral, very simple, no church. Few people: only relatives and friends. So much more moving than the great ceremony in Paris that one might have feared.\\" The press confirmed Maurice Ravel's testimony: \\"The funeral of Mr. Jacques Durand, the well-known music publisher, was celebrated in the strictest privacy on the 26th of this year in Avon (Seine-et-Marne). No announcement has been sent.\\"  Publications  * √âl√©ments d'harmonie √† l'usage de d√©butants,suivis d'exemples explicatifs tir√©s d'≈ìuvres anciennes et modernes on WorldCat * Cours professionnel √† l'usage des employ√©s du commerce de musique.

The Ottoman army, under Grand Vizier Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha, aided by the fleet under Kapudan Pasha Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed Pasha conquered the Morea peninsula in southern Greece, which had been captured by the Republic of Venice in the 1680s, during the Sixth Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War. The Ottoman reconquest inaugurated the second period of Ottoman rule in the Morea, which ended with the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence in 1821.  Background  Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Second Siege of Vienna in 1683, the Holy League of Linz gathered most European states (except for France, England and the Netherlands) in a common front against the Ottomans. In the resulting Great Turkish War (1684‚Äì1699) the Ottoman Empire suffered a number of defeats such as the battles of Moh√°cs and Zenta, and in the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), was forced to cede the bulk of Hungary to the Habsburg Monarchy, Podolia to Poland-Lithuania, while Azov was taken by the Russian Empire. Further south, the Republic of Venice had launched its own attack on the Ottoman Empire, seeking revenge for successive conquests of its overseas empire by the Turks, most recently (1669) the loss of Crete. During the conflict, Venetian troops seized the island of Cephalonia (Santa Maura) and the Morea peninsula, although they failed to retake Crete and expand their possessions in the Aegean Sea. The Ottomans were from the outset determined to reverse their territorial losses, especially the Morea, whose loss had been particularly keenly felt in the Ottoman court: a large part of the income of the Valide Sultan (the Ottoman queen-mother) had come from there. Already in 1702, there were tensions between the two powers and rumours of war because of the Venetian confiscation of an Ottoman merchant vessel. Troops and supplies were moved to the Ottoman provinces adjoining the Venetian \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\". The Venetian position there was weak, with only a few thousand troops in the whole peninsula, plagued by supply, disciplinary and morale problems. Nevertheless, peace was maintained between the two powers for twelve more years. In the meantime, the Ottomans began a reform of their navy, while Venice found itself increasingly isolated diplomatically from the other European powers: the Holy League had fractured after its victory, and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) and the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721) preoccupied the attention of most European states. The Ottomans took advantage of the favourable international situation and secured their northern flank by defeating Russia in 1710‚Äì1711. After the end of the Russo-Turkish war, the emboldened Ottoman leadership, under the new Grand Vizier, Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha, turned its attention to reversing the losses of Karlowitz. Profiting from the general war weariness that made any intervention by the other European powers unlikely, the Porte turned its focus on Venice. Preparations and opposing forces Map of the Venetian \\"Kingdom of the Morea\\", with its provinces and major settlements =Venice= The inability of the Venetians to effectively defend the Morea had been apparent already during the latter stages of the Great Turkish War, when the Greek renegade Limberakis Gerakaris had launched dangerous raids into the peninsula. The Republic was well aware of the Ottoman ambitions to recover the Morea, both for reasons of prestige and because of the potential threat to the Ottoman possessions in the rest of Greece posed by Venetian possession of the peninsula: with the Morea as a springboard, the Venetians might seek to reclaim Crete, or foment anti-Ottoman rebellions in the Balkans.{{sfnHatzopoulos2002pp=40‚Äì41} Consequently, from the beginning of its rule, Venice's officials toured the fortresses to ascertain their state and their capacity to resist. However, the Venetians' position was hampered by problems of supplies and morale, as well as the extreme lack of troops available: in 1702, the garrison at the Acrocorinth, which covered the Isthmus of Corinth, the main invasion route from the mainland, numbered only 2,045 infantry and barely a thousand cavalry. The peacetime Venetian military system, which consisted of a small permanent army and spread it among small garrisons (presidi) in the colonies, also proved a problem, as it prohibited a rapid mobilization and concentration of a large force. Furthermore, such a force was essentially an infantry army, short in cavalry and hence forced to avoid pitched battles and concentrate on sieges. The Venetian militia (cernide) system was problematic as well, being plagued by money shortages and the reluctance of the colonial subjects to serve in it. For example, out of 20,120 men deemed fit for duty in 1690, only 662 actually joined the militia in the Morea. The Venetian army in the Morea particularly lacked cavalry. Only three dragoon regiments of five companies each, and the Croat cavalry regiment of Antonio Medin, with eight companies, were stationed in the Morea. The quality of both the men and their horses was judged as extremely poor, and peacetime losses through desertion or disease meant that they were never at full strength. View of the Palamidi fortress today View of the Acrocorinth fortress today In light of these facts, the Venetian governors in the Morea quickly concentrated their attention to the fortifications. However, although a detailed survey in 1698 found serious deficiencies in all the fortresses of the Morea, little seems to have been done to address them. In 1711, Daniele Dolfin, charged with inspecting the situation in the peninsula, warned that unless the many deficiencies were addressed soon, it would be lost in a coming war. He also recommended that, given the lack of funds and men, and the inability of either the available army or the navy to stop an Ottoman invasion over land, the defence of the Morea should be limited to a handful of strategically important fortresses: the capital Nauplia, the Acrocorinth, the Castle of the Morea at the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf, and the coastal castles of Modon and Monemvasia. It was hoped that by concentrating the available resources in strengthening these, they could be made impregnable. Almost the only major new fortification undertaken by the Venetians during their rule in the Morea was the new citadel for Nauplia, built in 1711‚Äì1714 on the height of Palamidi overlooking the city and the approaches to it. The forces available to the Republic in the Morea on the eve of the war were fewer than 5,000 men, and dispersed among the various fortresses. According to a contemporary register preserved in Montreal, the total strength of Venetian regular troops in the Morea was 4,414 men: * Nauplia: 1,716 men (370 for Palamidi), under the provveditore generale Alessandro Bon * Acrocorinth (Corinth): 330 men, plus 162 Albanians for covering the Isthmus, under the provveditore straordinario Giacomo Minotto * Castle of the Morea (Rio): 786 men, under the provveditore straordinario Marco Barbarigo * Monemvasia: 261 men, under the provveditore straordinario Federgo Badoer * Kelefa: 45 men, under the provveditore Paulo Don√† * Zarnata: 83 men, under the provveditore Bembo * Coron: 282 men, under the provveditore Agostin Balbi * Modon: 691 men, under the provveditore straordinario Vincenzo Pasta * Aigina: 58 men, under the provveditore Francesco Bembo Apostolos Vakalopoulos gives similar, but slightly different numbers: 1747 (397 cavalry) at Nauplia, 450 at Corinth, 466 infantry anf 491 at Rio and its region, 279 at Monemvasia, 43 each at Kelefa and Zarnata, 719 (245 cavalry) at Coron and Modon, and 179 infantry and 125 at Navarino, for a total of 4,527 men. The strength of the cernide militias is unknown. These forces were clearly inadequate to confront an Ottoman army of 200,000 men, as the various reports received by the Venetian commanders claimed. The Venetian government also delayed ins ending reinforcements to the Morea: the first convoy, under Lodovico Flangini, arrived in the peninsula in late March, but comprised only two ships carrying ammunition. As a result, in March 1715 the Venetians decided to concentrate their defence on Nauplia, the Acrocorinth, the Castle of the Morea, and Monemvasia. The Venetian commanders hoped to be able to hold Navarino and Coron as well, but already in April, Dolfin judged that these would have to be abandoned as well. On the outbreak of the war, the Venetians called for aid from the other European states, but due to the Republic's diplomatic isolation and the preoccupation of the European powers with other conflicts, response was slow: apart from the Pope and the Crusading orders of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights of St. Stephen, who immediately dispatched a few warships, the major European powers offered help only after the loss of the Morea. Even after the arrival of these auxiliary squadrons, in July 1715 Dolfin only possessed 22 ships of the line, 33 galleys, 2 galleasses and 10 galliots, and was at a considerable disadvantage against the Ottoman fleet, which forced him to maintain a rather passive stance. Venetian appeals to the local Greek inhabitants were also ineffective, especially in continental Greece: most of the Greeks remained either neutral or actively joined the Ottomans. The Ottomans actively encouraged this with proclamations that life, property, and privileges of ecclesiastical and administrative autonomy would be respected. News that the Patriarch of Constantinople had excommunicated anyone helping the Venetians in whatever manner also influenced the Greek attitudes. This was a severe blow to the Venetians: many leaders of armed bands joined the Ottoman army, bolstering the latter instead of the numerically much inferior Venetian forces, while the Ottomans were able to dominate the countryside, where the Greek peasantry readily provided food and supplies to the Ottoman forces. Even where some Greek leaders, notably in the Mani Peninsula, decided to assist the Venetians, they made this conditional on the Venetian providing arms and supplies. In the event, the rapid Ottoman advance and the absence of an effective Venetian response persuaded them to remain neutral. =Ottomans= The Ottoman army in 1714 was still organized in the \\"classical\\" manner of the previous centuries, with a core of elite kapikulu troops, notably the Janissaries that formed the core of any expeditionary army, augmented by provincial levies and timariot cavalry. Ottoman armies were distinguished by the presence of large numbers of cavalry, which formed about 40% of a field army, but its effectiveness against European regular infantry had diminished much in the previous decades, as shown in the Great Turkish War. Still, it retained its tactical mobility, whereas the Ottoman infantry was a far more static force, capable either of last-stand defence or mass attack, but not much else. The indiscipline of the Janissaries also proved a constant headache for the Ottoman commanders. During the early months of 1715, the Ottomans assembled their army in Macedonia under the Grand Vizier Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha. On 22 May, Grand Vizier marched south from Thessalonica, arriving at Thebes on 9 June, where he held a review of the troops. Although the accuracy of his figures is open to doubt, Brue reports 14,994 cavalry and 59,200 infantry as present at Thebes on 9 June, with the total number of men involved in the campaign against the Morea placed at 110,364 (22,844 cavalry and 87,520 infantry). The cavalry numbers given by Brue are about half those expected for an Ottoman force of this size, indicating that likely the Ottoman commanders had to begin the campaign before their entire army was assembled. The army's artillery park comprised 111 light field guns, 15 larger siege guns, and 20 mortars. The army was aided by the Ottoman fleet, which operated in close coordination with it. Like the Venetians, the Ottoman navy was a mixed force of sailing ships of the line and rowed galleys. The Ottomans also secured the assistance of their North African vassals, the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers, and their fleets. Commanded by the capable Kapudan Pasha Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed Pasha, the fleet that sailed from the Dardanelles in June 1715 numbered 58 ships of the line, 30 galleys, five fireships, and 60 galliots, along with cargo vessels. The Ottoman view on the campaign is known mostly through two eyewitness accounts, the diary of the French embassy interpreter Benjamin Brue (published as Journal de la campagne que le Grand Vesir Ali Pacha a faite en 1715 pour la conqu√™te de la Mor√©e, Paris 1870), and that of Constantine the \\"Dioiketes\\", a guard officer to the Prince of Wallachia (published by Nicolae Iorga in Chronique de l‚Äôexp√©dition des Turcs en Mor√©e 1715 attribu√©e √† Constantin Dioik√©t√®s, Bucarest 1913). Attack on the Morea After a war council on 13 June, 15,000 Janissaries under Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha‚Äîgovernor of Diyarbekir Eyalet and nephew of the namesake Grand Vizier who led the Siege of Vienna in 1683‚Äî were sent to capture Lepanto, and thence cross into the northwestern Morea to attack the Castle of the Morea and Patras, while the main body of the army under Yusuf Pasha and the Agha of the Janissaries moved onto the Isthmus of Corinth, and thence to the Argolid and southwest, across the central Morea, to Messenia, assisted by supplies from the fleet. At the same time, the Ottoman fleet had captured the last Venetian possessions in the central Aegean, the islands of Tinos (5 June) and Aigina (7 July), and proceeded to blockade the Venetian positions in the Morea. The Ottomans operated with impunity as the Venetian fleet remained in the Venetian Ionian Islands. According to a report by Minotto, the Ottoman advance guard entered the Morea on 13 June. The first Venetian fortress was the citadel of Acrocorinth, held by little over 300 Venetian and about 110 Greek and Albanian auxiliaries. The Venetian garrison was weakened by maladies, and the artillery was badly maintained and with insufficient ammunition. By 2 July, the Ottomans had breached the walls in two places. As the fortress was about to fall, the large number of civilian refugees began pressuring Minotto to capitulate. Terms were arranged for the safe passage for the garrison to Corfu, and the garrison began leaving the citadel on 5 July. However, some Janissaries, eager for plunder, disobeyed Damat Ali's orders and entered the citadel. A large part of the garrison and most of the civilians were massacred or sold to slavery (including Minoto). Only 180 Venetians were saved and transported to Corfu. These tragic events later inspired Lord Byron's poem The Siege of Corinth. After Corinth, the Ottomans passed by Argos on 9 July, which they found abandoned, and arrived before Nauplia three days later. Nauplia, the main stronghold of Venetian power in the Morea, was the best-fortified overseas possession of the Republic. With ample stores, a garrison of about 3,000 men, and an artillery complement of at least 150 guns, the city was expected to hold for at least three months, allowing for the arrival of reinforcements over the sea. On 20 July, after only nine days of siege, the Ottomans exploded a mine under the bastions of Palamidi and successfully stormed the fort. The Venetian defenders panicked and retreated, leading to a general collapse of the defence. The Ottomans then advanced to the southwest, where the forts of Navarino and Koroni were abandoned by the Venetians, who gathered their remaining forces at Methoni (Modon). However, being denied effective support from the sea by Delfin's reluctance to endanger his fleet by engaging the Ottoman navy, the fort capitulated. The remaining Venetian strongholds, including the last remaining outposts on Crete (Spinalonga and Souda), likewise capitulated in exchange for safe departure. Within a hundred days, the entire Peloponnese had been re-taken by the Ottomans. According to the Ottomanist Virginia Aksan, the campaign had been \\"basically a walkover for the Ottomans\\". Despite the presence of sufficient materiel, the Venetian garrisons were weak, and the Venetian government unable to finance the war, while the Ottomans not only enjoyed a considerable numerical superiority, but also were more willing \\"to tolerate large losses and considerable desertion\\": according to Brue, no less than 8,000 Ottoman soldiers were killed and another 6,000 wounded in the just nine days of the siege of Nauplia. Furthermore, unlike the Venetians, the Ottomans this time enjoyed the effective support of their fleet, which among other activities ferried a number of large siege cannons to support the siege of Nauplia. On 13 September, the Grand Vizier began his return journey, and on the 22nd, near Nauplia, received the congratulations of the Sultan. A week of parades and celebrations followed. On 10 October, the Standard of the Prophet was ceremonially placed in its casket, a sign that the campaign was over. The troops received six months' worth of pay on 17 October near Larissa, and the Grand Vizier returned to the capital, for a triumphal entrance, on 2 December.

It is listed as a Historic Monument. History Dalon Abbey was founded in 1114 by Gerald of Salles (or Salis) under the Rule of Saint Benedict thanks to donations by Gerald of Lastours and his brother Gouffier, who attended the abbey's foundation day alongside Eustorge, the Bishop of Limoges, and several local lords. The successor of Gerald of Salles, the hermit Roger, developed the abbey and established several monasteries and priories (Aubignac, B≈ìuil, Loc-Dieu, the Palais Notre-Dame, Pr√©beno√Æt), thereby forming the Order of Dalon. In 1142, Dalon was not a Cistercian community, but several other abbeys had already adopted the Cistercian Rule. On that year, Stephen of Obazine, abbot of Obazine, followed the advice of Aymeric, bishop of Clermont, and requested Roger to send monks to introduce the Rule in Dalon. Upon Roger's death in 1159, the monks of Dalon requested the general chapter of Pontigny to send other instructors, since both orders were following the same Benedictine rule. In 1162, just after the election of the third abbot, Dalon joined the Order of Cistercians alongside its daughter houses B≈ìuil, Bonlieu, Loc-Dieu, le Palais and Pr√©beno√Æt. Dalon became the third daughter house of Pontigny and received protection from Henry Plantagenet, Eleanor of Aquitaine and Richard the Lionheart. The well-known troubadour and lord of Hautefort Bertran de Born withdrew as a monk into Dalon and died there in 1215. Dalon Abbey owned several granges in P√©rigord, as well as the Priory of Saint-Blaise in the parish of Milhac. Moreover, the order founded the bastide of Puybrun in the Quercy region. In the 17th century, the remains of the abbey (the monks' building, the chapter house and the two chapels of the right-hand side of the transept) were integrated into the northern side of the newly-established dwellings. In 1784, the Bishop of Castres, Jean-Marc de Roy√®re, was appointed as commendatory abbot of Dalon.

The major part of its area is approx. with some areas elevated up to approx. 1800m a.s.l., although its actual elevation has never been accurately measured and as for now can only be estimated from satellite imagery. The plateau belongs to the westernmost area in Guyana and is also one of the highest mountains in the country.  Biology  Cloud forest vegetation is present on Waukauyengtipu on its upper slopes and summit plateau. The plateau hosts typical Pantepui vegetation including large amounts of plants such as Brocchinia tatei, Brocchinia acuminata, Clusia sp., Didymiandrum stellatum or Philodendron insigne. Cloudforest on the summit plateau of Waukauyengtipu In the central part of the mesa there are scattered occurrences of tepui scrub forests with Bonnetia sessilis and occasional transitions into peat wetlands dominated by Stegolepis ptaritepuiensis. The peat wetlands host other species like Orectanthe sceptrum or Drosera roraimae, making Waukauyengtipu one of just few locations in Guyana where such plants can be observed. Pantepui peat wetland dominated by Stegolepis ptaritepuiensis plants on the summit plateau of Waukauyengtipu.  History of exploration  The first recorded ascent of the mountain was completed during a Smithsonian botanical expedition led by H. David Clarke between in July 1997, during which extensive herbarium material was collected. The second successful ascent and short botanical exploration of the summit plateau took place in January 2019.  Nomenclatural inaccuracies  Waukauyengtipu is often synonymized with Mount Venamo, although given the scarcity of information regarding the massif and few recorded attempts on the exploration of its areas this claim is difficult to legitimize. Most of the information about the true location and elevation of Cerro Venamo are taken from the results of Julian A. Steyermark's and Galfrid Dunsterville's botanical exploration of the mountain in Venezuela in 1963 and 1964. Due to the assumptions regarding the true elevation and area of the massif having been made with only the instrumentation available at that time, some information proves to be inaccurate when compared to modern satellite data. Moreover, the exploration history of both Mount Venamo and Waukauyengtipu is limited to a few overland expeditions and short helicopter landings, all of which had succeeded in studying only isolated, scattered areas of the plateaus. More extensive research of the massif is required to prepare a decisive verdict.

He was the first to identify microalbuminuria as a predictor of kidney disease in diabetics, and was an international authority on diabetes. Early life Keen was born in 1925 in London to a Jewish family; his parents were Sydney Keen, a tailor, and Esther (n√©e Zenober), a teacher who had migrated to the United Kingdom from Poland. He attended St Ann's School in Hanwell and Ealing County Grammar School for Boys. He studied medicine at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, graduating on 5 July 1948, the day that the National Health Service (NHS) was established. Career Keen began his medical career as a house officer at London's West Middlesex Hospital in 1948‚Äì49. He then enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving for two years in Suez, Egypt. He returned to London in 1951, taking up a post at St Mary's Hospital under George Pickering. Keen assisted Pickering over several years on a large project studying hypertension in patients with diabetes and their first-degree relatives. In 1953, he began collaborating with Robert Daniel Lawrence, who headed the diabetes clinic at King's College Hospital, and spent seven years there studying diabetes and its long-term complications. He travelled to Bethesda, Maryland, in 1960 for a year-long research fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, where he experimented with insulin assays and early attempts to isolate pancreatic islets. When Keen returned to London from the United States in 1961, he was hired as a lecturer by Guy's Hospital and its associated medical school, where he would spend the rest of his career. In 1962, he conducted the Bedford Survey, in which every adult in Bedford was asked to provide a urine sample in order to study the population prevalence of diabetes; around 70% of the population provided samples, and 250 participants were found to have undiagnosed diabetes as a result. The study led to the first definition of prediabetes, which Keen called \\"borderline diabetes\\", and demonstrated the relationship between glucose intolerance and cardiovascular disease at a population level. He and his colleagues became the first, in 1964, to show that trace amounts of the protein albumin in urine could predict kidney disease in diabetes, which is now the basis for routine kidney screening in diabetic patients. With the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, he conducted the Whitehall Survey in 1969, which led to the creation of different glucose thresholds for microvascular and macrovascular disease. He also pioneered the concept of the insulin pump, which delivers insulin continuously to type 1 diabetics who are reliant on insulin. In 1971, he was appointed professor of human metabolism at Guy's. He established one of the UK's first diabetes centres at Guy's Hospital. Keen chaired the 1980 and 1985 World Health Organisation expert committees on diabetes. He was involved in the St. Vincent Declaration of 1989, which set international goals and benchmarks for diabetes care. He retired from medicine in 1990, becoming professor emeritus at King's College London. Awards and honours Keen chaired the British Diabetic Association between 1990 and 1996 and was appointed honorary president of the International Diabetes Federation in 1991. He was awarded a CBE and the first United Nations/UNESCO Hellmut Mehnert Award for the Prevention of Diabetes and its Complications in 1998. He received the American Diabetes Association's Kelly M. West Award for Outstanding Achievement in Epidemiology and Harold Rifkin Award for Distinguished International Service in the Cause of Diabetes in 1989 and 1992 respectively. Personal life Keen married Anna \\"Nan\\" Miliband, the sister of sociologist Ralph Miliband, in 1953; they had a son and a daughter.

He stood for election to the Reichstag (parliament) in a succession of general elections between 1893 and 1912. Nationally, the Social Democratic Party received more votes than any other party in every general election between 1890 and 1912, but their votes were concentrated in urban electoral districts which had far larger electorates than the more conservative rural districts: 1912 was the first time that the party won the largest number of seats. It was also the first time that Adolf Hofrichter, elected to represent Cologne City Electoral District, won a seat in the Reichstag. He remained a member till his death four and a half years later. Biography Adolf Gustav Adalbert Hofrichter was born in Danzig (as Gda≈Ñsk was known to the city's German speaking majority and to Anglophones before 1945). His father was a tax official. Slightly unusually for those times, he appears to have grown up in a family without public church connections. While still a child, he was evidently relocated to Prussia's Rhine Province. He attended school in Danzig and Kranenburg, and undertook his apprenticeship at Kaldenkirchen, near the Dutch border, in the extreme west of the country. Having learned the complementary trades of a locksmith and a plumber, he worked at these trades in various Rhine Province towns: by 1892 he was employed as a locksmith's assistant. He had already, in 1881, joined the (by some criteria illegal between 1878 and 1891) Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). He had also served, between 1877 and 1880, in the 4th Westphalia Infantry Regiment. At the start of 1890 the Reichstag refused to renew the Anti-Socialist Laws and a couple of months later Chancellor Bismarck resigned. Over the next couple of years it became apparent that the legislation had lapsed for good. During the early 1890s Hofrichter served as chairman of the Cologne SPD. In January 1892 Adolf Hofrichter took over as chief executive (\\"Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer\\") at the newly relaunched Rheinische Zeitung (newspaper), retaining the position till February 1894. He joined the editorial department in 1894 and remained with the paper as contributor-journalist, backer and publisher till 1901, though sources describing him simply as the publication's editor may be oversimplifying and overstating the situation. He subsequently became chair of the \\"Press Commission\\". Hofrichter was elected local party chairman in 1895. Between 1897 and 1901 he headed up the party's \\"Agitation Commission\\" for the Upper Rhine province. Next, till 1905, he led the city's newly created Labour Secretariat (\\"Arbeitersekret√§riat\\"). He was then appointed Regional Party Secretary (\\"Bezirksparteisekret√§r\\") for the entire region surrounding which at that time was frequently identified as the upper Rhine Province (roughly corresponding to the western half of the modern state of North Rhine- Westphalia). He served in this capacity between 1905 and his death in 1916. At the same time he continued to serve as chairman of the party in Cologne and as a member of the party regional executive committee for the upper Rhine Province. Following nearly 20 years of standing as a Reichstag candidate in various electoral districts in Cologne, Koblenz and Trier, in 1912 Adolf Hofrichter became \\"the first Social Democrat in Cologne elected to the Reichstag\\".For detailed election results see Kaiserliches Statistisches Amt (Hrsg.): Statistik des Deutschen Reichs, vol. 250.

The Supreme Court of India ordered the disputed land (2.77 acres) to be handed over to a trust (to be created by Government of India) to build the Ram Janmabhoomi (revered as the birthplace of Hindu deity, Ram) temple. The court also ordered the government to give an alternative 5 acres of land in another place to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for the purpose of building a mosque as a replacement for the demolished Babri Masjid.  Background  = Allahabad High Court verdict = The Babri Masjid was demolished during a political rally which turned into a riot on 6 December 1992. A subsequent land title case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In the judgment, the three judges of the Allahabad High Court ruled that the of Ayodhya land be divided into three parts, with going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Rama represented by the Hindu Mahasabha, going to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, and the remaining going to Nirmohi Akhara. The judgment affirmed that the disputed land was the birthplace of Rama as per the faith and belief of Hindus, and that the Babri Masjid was built after the demolition of a Hindu temple, noting that it was not built in accordance with the tenets of Islam.Gist of Judgements by Justices S. U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and Dharam Veer Sharma, Allahabad High Court, 6 October 2010 =Title cases= In 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad filed a title suit with the Allahabad High Court seeking injunction to offer puja (worship) at the disputed site. A similar suit was filed shortly after but later withdrawn by Paramhans Das of Ayodhya. In 1959, the Nirmohi Akhara, a Hindu religious institution, filed a third title suit seeking direction to hand over the charge of the disputed site, claiming to be its custodian. A fourth suit was filed by the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for declaration and possession of the site. The Allahabad High Court bench began hearing the case in 2002, which was completed in 2010. After the Supreme Court of India dismissed a plea to defer the High Court verdict, on 30 September 2010, the High Court of Allahabad, the three-member bench comprising justices S. U. Khan, Sudhir Agarwal and D. V. Sharma, ruled that the disputed land be split into three parts. The site of the Ram Lalla idol would go to the party representing Ram Lalla Virajman (the installed Infant Rama deity), Nirmohi Akhara was to receive Sita Rasoi and Ram Chabutara, and the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to receive the rest. The court also ruled that the status quo should be maintained for three months. All the three parties appealed against the division of disputed land to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held final hearing on the case from 6 August 2019 to 16 October 2019. On 9 November 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the land to be handed over to a trust (to be formed by the Government of India) to build the Hindu temple. It also ordered the government to give 5 acres of land to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board to build a mosque as a replacement for the demolished Babri Masjid.  Restrictions imposed before judgement  For 15 days preceding the verdict, restrictions were imposed in Ayodhya to prevent violence. Security arrangements were increased across India. Thousands of paramilitary forces and police troops were deployed in Ayodhya and surveillance of the region was carried out using CCTV cameras and drones. Internet services were closed in several places in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/ahead-of-ayodhya- verdict-internet-shuts-down-in-uttar-pradesh-cities/articleshow/71979981.cms while it was announced that a total of 31 districts and 673 individuals were being closely monitored. Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India was invoked in the entire state of Uttar Pradesh as well as in some major cities such as Bangalore, Bhopal, Jaipur, Lucknow, and Mumbai. A public holiday was declared for schools and colleges across the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, as well as Delhi, on the day of the verdict. Security was stepped up across various towns in Telangana; 20,000 personnel deployed in Hyderabad, mainly around the communally sensitive areas of the Old City including the Charminar and Mecca Masjid. According to reports, around 40,000 police personnel were deployed in Mumbai and 15,000 in Chennai as a precautionary measure. The prime minister made a public request for maintaining peace and religious harmony.  Summary of the verdict  The five-judge bench of the Supreme Court unanimously pronounced its verdict on 9 November 2019. The judgement can be summarised as follows:- * The Court ordered the Government of India to create a trust to build the Ram Mandir temple and form a Board of Trustees within three months. The disputed land will be owned by the Government of India and subsequently transferred to the Trust after its formation. * The Court ordered the entire disputed land of area of 2.77 acres to be allocated for the construction of a temple while an alternative piece of land of area of 5 acres be allocated to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for the construction of a mosque at a suitable place within Ayodhya. *The Court ruled that the 2010 Allahabad High Court's decision, division of the disputed land was incorrect. *The Court ruled that the Demolition of the Babri Masjid and the 1949 desecration of the Babri Masjid was in violation of law. *The Court observed that archaeological evidence from the Archaeological Survey of India shows that the Babri Masjid was constructed on a \\"structure\\", whose architecture was distinctly indigenous and non-Islamic. *On objections raised with regards to ASIs various scientific claims by the Muslim parties, the Supreme Court observed, the contesting parties could have raised it before the Allahabad High Court as there were legal remedies available for the same.The apex court of India also commented that the ASI report which was submitted on behalf of the Allahabad High Court was not an \\"ordinary opinion\\". At the same time, on The Historians report to the Nation authored by Aligrah historians and presented as an evidence, the court observed : \\"At the highest, this report can be taken as an opinion.\\" *The ruins of an ancient religious structure under an existing building do not always indicate that it was demolished by unfriendly powers, the Supreme Court held in its 1,045-page judgment in the Ayodhya case. *The court observed that all four of the Janamsakhis (biographies of the first Sikh guru, Guru Nanak) state unambiguously and in detail that Guru Nanak made pilgrimage to Ayodhya and offered prayers in the Ram temple in 1510‚Äì11 AD. The court also mentioned that a group of Nihang Sikhs performed puja in the \\"mosque\\" in 1857. *The Court said that Muslim parties, including the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, failed to establish exclusive possession of disputed land. It said that the Hindu parties furnished better evidence to prove that Hindus had worshipped continuously inside the mosque, believing it to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama. The Court cited that iron railings set up in 1856‚Äì57 separated the inner courtyard of the mosque from the outer courtyard, and that Hindus were in exclusive possession of the outer courtyard. It said that even before this, Hindus had access to the inner courtyard of the mosque. *The Court ruled that the suit filed by Nirmohi Akhara could not be upheld and it had no shebait rights. However, the court ruled that Nirmohi Akhara should be given appropriate representation in the Board of Trustees. *The Court rejected the claim made by Shia Waqf Board against the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for the ownership of the Babri Masjid. On 12 December 2019 the Supreme Court dismissed all the 18 petitions seeking review of the verdict.  Domestic reactions  = Support = Zufar Faruqi, chairman of the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, issued a statement saying that he accepted the verdict and declared that it will not submit a review petition for the same. The Shahi Imam of the Jama Masjid, Delhi supported the verdict, saying that the dispute should not continue further. Some major industrial bodies supported the decision. A few celebrities also expressed their opinion in support for the decision and called for harmony and peace. Prominent leaders from the Hindu and the Muslim communities extended their support to the Indian government in maintaining peace, after meeting with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.  Political parties and figures  Many political parties in India supported the judgement. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the judgement will usher in peace and unity in India. The Indian National Congress supported the verdict and called for calm and peace. Political figures such as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M. K. Stalin supported the judgement. The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted about the decision saying that it should not be considered as win or loss for anybody. In a subsequent address to the nation, he said that there would be peace and unity and that all issues can be solved within the constitutional framework. = Opposition = The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board's lawyer, Zafaryab Jilani, \\"expressed dissatisfaction over the Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict, saying it has a lot of contradictions and they will seek a review of it.\\" National Herald, published two articles criticizing the verdict. The editorial later withdrew the articles and issued an apology after facing criticism on social media and from the BJP. All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi said that he was not satisfied with the judgement, calling it a victory of \\"faith over facts\\". The primary lawyer of the Muslim parties Zafaryab Jilani said that they were not satisfied with the verdict but added that the verdict also contained some \\"good examples\\". Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, a litigant in the dispute, refused to accept the alternative site for a mosque ordered by the Court. All India Muslim Personal Law Board and Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind decided to file a review petition after rejecting the verdict on 17 November 2019. Concerns of Sikh community 1045-page judgment referring Sikhism as a 'cult' instead of a distinct sovereign religion and quoting accounts of Nihang sikh worshiping idols which is totally prohibited in Sikhism, was condemned by Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, H. S. Phoolka and Sikhs. Dr. Manjit Singh Randhawa filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking to expunge 'all distorted facts' in the verdict judgment and word 'cult' while referring to the Sikh religion.  International reactions  The Indian Ministry of External Affairs briefed foreign envoys and diplomats about the verdict on 9 November 2019. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, criticised the verdict and questioned its timing as it coincided with the inauguration of the Kartarpur Corridor. He called the court verdict an indication of the \\"bigoted ideology of Modi government\\".

He spent his early career as a soldier fighting for the Austro-Hungarian Army against the Russians in the First World War. He later served in the Ukrainian War of Independence and fought for both the White and Red Armies in the Russian Civil War. Borkovsk√Ω fled to Czechoslovakia in 1920 and, after a period in internment camps, settled there. He graduated with a degree in archaeology from Prague's Charles University and headed up excavations at Prague Castle as well as at Czernin Palace. Borkovsk√Ω's discovery of the Prague Castle skeleton led to conflict with German occupying forces during the Second World War who were keen to find evidence of early German involvement in the region. Under threat of being sent to a concentration camp Borkovsk√Ω was forced to issue a paper identifying the skeleton as of Germanic origin and to withdraw a book publicising early Slavic pottery from the area. After the war he came under suspicion from Soviet forces for his pro-German interpretation and, after being spared from being sent to a gulag, issued a paper retracting his earlier interpretation and describing the skeleton as a Slav. After the war he carried out further excavations in Prague, including at the Lev√Ω Hradec, and served as chairman of the Archaeological Society of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.  Early life  Ivan Borkovsk√Ω was born on 8 September 1897 at Chortovec near Horodenka, which was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria but lies in modern West Ukraine. He was born to a poor Ukrainian noble family and was named Ivan Borkovskyj-Dunin. Borkovsk√Ω attended grammar school at Stanislavov between 1909 and 1913 and afterwards studied to become a teacher. Borkovsk√Ω joined the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1915 and fought against Russia during the First World War. Between 1918 and 1920 he fought in the Ukrainian War of Independence and also became involved in the Russian Civil War, first as part of the White Army and then for the opposing Red Army. Borkovsk√Ω was one of a large number of Ukrainians who escaped the war to Czechoslovakia in 1920. He spent the next year interned in a number of camps at Hole≈°ov, Liberec and Josefov before being released. Borkovsk√Ω found that his previous education was not recognised by the Czechoslovak authorities so he had to attend grammar school again at Josefov from which he graduated in 1925. From 1922 Borkovsk√Ω attended lecture on the prehistoric era at Charles University in Prague and from 1923 to 1926 was a volunteer scientific assistant at the State Archaeological Institute. He later joined a degree course at the university and graduated in 1929. Early in his career he specialised in the Later Stone Age.  Prague Castle skeleton  Prague Castle's 3rd Courtyard where the skeleton was found In 1926 Borkovsk√Ω was appointed assistant to Karel Guth, Head of the Historical Archaeology Department of the National Museum and placed in charge of the museum's excavation work at Prague Castle (as part of the Prague Castle Research Commission). In 1928 Borkovsk√Ω excavated the Prague Castle skeleton, a ninth- century burial. The discovery was not published at the time, as Guth controlled this aspect and was often late with his articles; the skeleton would however play a key part in Borkovsk√Ω's later career. The Czernin Palace and Loreto Square Borkovsk√Ω carried out excavations on an early Slavic burial ground in Loreto Square in front of Prague's Czernin Palace in 1934‚Äì35. He also led the excavation of a medieval burial ground in Bartolomejska Street in 1936, ahead of the construction of a new police headquarters. Between 1932 and 1936 he also managed the cataloging of the archaeology collection of the Josef Anton√≠n J√≠ra Museum. It was here that he discovered the first early Slav ceramic artifacts that proved the presence of those people in Bohemia in the early 6th-century AD. Borkovsk√Ω published his findings in the book Old Slavonic Ceramics in Central Europe which he produced at his own expense in 1940. Borkovsk√Ω transferred to the Czech State Archaeological Institute in the same year. During this time Borkovsk√Ω played an active role in the Ukrainian exile community in Prague. From 1933 he lectured at the Ukrainian Free University as an associate professor. He later became a full professor and served as rector from 1939 until 1942. Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia in the lead up to the Second World War and were keen to promote a narrative of an early Germanic and Nordic involvement in the region to legitimise their occupation. Borkovsk√Ω's findings about early Slavic settlement were unhelpful to the German cause and he was forced to withdraw his 1940 book under threat of being sent to a concentration camp. Under German pressure he published an article identifying the burial as of Nordic origin. Soviet forces occupied Czechoslovakia in 1945 and Borkovsk√Ω came under suspicion for his pro-German paper. He was arrested by the NKVD, the Soviet secret police, in May despite protesting that he had been forced to write the paper. Borkovsk√Ω was loaded onto a transport destined for a Siberian gulag but was saved at the last moment by the intervention of Jaroslav B√∂hm, director of the State Archaeological Institute. In 1946 Borkovsk√Ω published a revised paper that identified the burial as a Slav noble of the Przemyslid dynasty.  Later career  Borkovsk√Ω later became director of the new Department of Historical Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology; which joined the Czech Academy of Sciences in 1952. He contributed greatly to the understanding of the appearance of the Prague Castle through history, particularly during the early Middle Ages. In 1950/51 he discovered the foundations of the Church of the Virgin Mary in the castle grounds which, dating from the second half of the 9th century, was the oldest church in the castle. Borkovsk√Ω also carried out research into the Convent of St. Agnes, Convent of St Anna and the demolished Bethlehem Chapel in the Old Town, which were important to building an understanding of the medieval development of Prague. He led the investigation of the Lev√Ω Hradec until 1954 and was also involved in research into the monastery of St. Ji≈ô√≠. From 1954 Borkovsk√Ω was employed by the Institute of Archaeology to continue investigations at Prague Castle. In the same year he received the Science Award of the City of Prague and was awarded a Doctorate of Science degree. He remained in the employ of the Institute for the rest of his life. Borkovsk√Ω served as chairman of the Archaeological Society of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences from 1968 until 1975 and has been described as the founder of modern Czech medieval archaeology. He died in Prague on 17 March 1976.

Shinkot casket, inscription segments B and D The Shinkot casket, also Bajaur reliquary of the reign of Menander, is a Buddhist reliquary from the Bajaur area in Gandhara, thought to mention the reign of the 2nd century BCE Indo-Greek king Menander I. The steatite casket is said to have contained a silver and a gold reliquary at the time of discovery, but they have been lost. Inscription This casket is probably the oldest known inscribed Buddhist relic casket from the area of Gandhara. One of its inscriptions, in the place of honour on the lid, mentions: Minedrasa maharajasa ka·π≠iasa divasa 44411, being translated as \\"On the 14th day of KƒÅrtikka, in the reign of the Maharaja Minadra\\", the Maharaja (\\"Great King\\") Minadra in question being Menander. Menander is otherwise known from his coins, which are generally bilingual in Greek and Kharoshthi, where his Kharoshthi name is given as Menadra. On his coinage, the full title of king Menander appears as Menadrasa Maharajasa Trataresa \\"Saviour Great King Menander\\". In the Milindapanha, his name is given as Milinda. A translation of the different fragments has been made: The characters are very clear and without ambiguity. The \\"Great King Menander\\" segment (ê®®ê®Åê®£ê®°ê®øê®™ê®Ø ê®®ê®±ê®™ê®óê®Ø, Minadrasa Maharajasa) also reads clearly. Paleographically, the shape of the letters of inscriptions C and D correspond to the period of the Indo-Scythian Northern Satraps of Taxila and Mathura in the 1st century BCE, and are lightly incised, almost only scratched, while the letters in A and B are characteristic of an earlier type, closer to the type of the Ashoka inscriptions in the Kharoshthi script, and are bold and deeply incised. The later segments of the inscription were apparently made under the orders of Vijayamitra, king of the Apracarajas (ruled 12 BCE - 15 CE). He appears in D as Vijayamitra apracarajena, which, previously translated literally as \\"Vijayamitra, the King without adversaries\\", is now understood as \\"Vijayamitra, the King of the Apracas\\", an Indo-Scythian tribe now known from other archaeological remains from the region of Bajaur. The authenticity of the inscription pertaining to Menander has been doubted by Harry Falk in 2005, but later upheld by Stefan Baums in his 2017 article on Gandharan inscriptions, \\"A framework for Gandharan chronology based on relic inscriptions\\". The content of the inscriptions was fully published in 1937 in Epigraphia Indica, Vol.24, by Majumdar, who saw the casket in Calcutta, but its whereabouts are now unknown.

The webcomic is particularly popular in China, where the Finnish vision of privacy and personal space struck a chord with people living in crowded cities. Overview Matti gets anxious when people around him are loud in public. Finnish Nightmares is an English-language stick figure webcomic initially developed by Korhonen with the goal of entertaining herself and her friends. The cartoon stars Matti, a socially awkward character who prefers minimal contact and avoids social situations. Korhonen describes the character as \\"a stereotypical Finn who appreciates peace, quiet and personal space. Matti tries his best to do unto others as he wishes to be done unto him: to give space, be polite and not bother with unnecessary chit chat.\\" The character comes across as perpetually uncomfortable who hides from his neighbors and hates being singled out. Korhonen wrote on her blog that some traits associated with introversion are part of Finnish culture and code of conduct, such as giving others a large amount of personal space. Ephrat Livni of Quartz noted that Matti seems introverted even by Finnish standards. Popularity in China Privacy and personal space are often unfamiliar luxuries to people living in crowded Chinese cities. Finnish Nightmares became strongly popular on Chinese online platforms in 2019. Matti's fear of crowds and small talk resonated with many Chinese readers who experience anxiety in the overpopulated streets of Chinese cities. Many of these readers are appealed to Finnish culture as presented in the webcomic; a culture in which privacy and personal space are considered important and commonplace. Fans of the webcomic coined the Mandarin word Jingfen (spiritually Finnish) to describe people who, like Matti, dislike socializing and long for more personal space. Korhonen was surprised by her webcomic's popularity in China. Writing to Sixth Tone, she said \\"I thought Chinese people might be used to crowded places.\\" Korhonen supports the term jingfen, noting that \\"everyone can have a little bit of Matti in them, regardless of where they are from.\\" Publication Korhonen launched her webcomic in 2015 on Blogspot. The webcomic was adapted into a comic book in 2016 and published by Atena. A second adaptation of Finnish Nightmares, titled Matti in the Wallet, was published by Atena in Q2 2019. Both books were listed on the Bookstore Federation charts for several months in 2019. The webcomic was internationally published in August 2019 as a 96-page humorous guidebook, titled Finnish Nightmares: An Irreverent Guide to Life‚Äôs Awkward Moments. Finnish Nightmares was translated into Chinese and Japanese, and has possibly also been translated into Korean. Sales expectations in these regions were high, as Atena received exceptionally high advances on translations. Matti is Still Depressed Today won a Gaiman Award in Japan in 2017.

Dorsett seal Dorsett seal, reversed photography In 1894 Palemon Howard Dorsett, a lifelong Department of Agriculture employee, turned up at the Department of State with a metal die engraved with the Great Seal, claiming it had originally been given to his family by a nephew of George Washington. It was examined by Gaillard Hunt, the author of a pamphlet on the Great Seal, who agreed that it appeared to be contemporaneous with the original 1782 seal, but he took no further interest in the matter. Decades later, in 1936, Dorsett wrote again regarding his die, and this time it was investigated more thoroughly. It is a very similar design to the first Great Seal die and obviously copied from it, even including a border of acanthus leaves. The eagle was different though, being more spirited with its wings more widely spread. More significantly, the arrows and the olive branch are switched, indicating an intentional \\"difference\\" to distinguish it from the actual Great Seal. It is the same size as the first die, and is made of bronze. There was no indication that it could actually be used in a seal press, and a search of government documents showed no use of the seal anywhere.The Eagle and the Shield pp. 409‚Äì417 The investigation also turned up some facts that supported Dorsett's story: documents relating to the sale of Washington's estate list \\"plates arms U.S.\\" being sold to Thomas Hammond (a son-in-law of Charles Washington and therefore a nephew by marriage to George Washington), and also the Hammond and Dorsett families both had roots in West Virginia just a few miles apart. Afterwards Dorsett lent his seal to Mount Vernon, and his heirs made it a donation. It was eventually put on display in a museum there. The origins and purpose of this die remain unknown. Both Hunt and the authors of Eagle and the Shield speculate it was meant to be used by either the President of the Congress or later by the President of the United States, but there is no other evidence to support this. In October and November 2007, two more dies were discovered in Rhode Island with exactly the same design (though cut in relief), even down to the same small flaws. They were made of silver-plated lead, which is sometimes used as an engraving test since it is a cheaper metal. James Trenchard engravings In 1786, for the first two issues of Columbian Magazine, Philadelphia engraver James Trenchard wrote articles on the obverse (in September 1786) and reverse (in October 1786) of the Great Seal, and each issue included a full-page engraving of his own original version of the discussed side of the seal. The project apparently was aided by William Barton, as the official law was printed along with supplemental notes from Barton. Trenchard's obverse featured randomly placed stars, like Thomson's drawing, and had the rays of the glory extending beyond the clouds upward, with the clouds themselves being in an arc. The reverse also followed the blazon carefully, and featured an elongated pyramid with the requisite mottos and the Eye of Providence (a right eye, unlike versions that followed). While not official, Trenchard's depiction had an obvious influence on subsequent official versions, and was the first known public rendering of the reverse side (and only one for many years). St. Paul's Chapel painting St. Paul's Chapel St. Paul's Chapel in New York City has a large oil painting of the national coat of arms, believed installed sometime in 1786. It was commissioned on October 7, 1785, not long after the Congress of the Confederation began meeting in nearby Federal Hall. The painting hangs over Washington's pew, across the room from a painting of the arms of New York over the Governor's pew. The painting has many similarities to Trenchard's version (or vice versa depending on which came first), including the random placement of stars and details of the eagle. The clouds are in a full circle, though, instead of an arc, and the rays extend beyond them in all directions. The shield has a gold chain border with a badge at the bottom. This is the earliest known full-color version of the seal design, and the artist is unknown. Indian Peace Medals European powers had traditionally given \\"peace medals\\" to Native American Indians in an attempt to curry favor, and the newly created United States followed suit. On April 28, 1786, the Congress authorized creation of Indian Peace Medals with the coat of arms (obverse of the Great Seal) on one side, and various designs on the other. The medals were typically oval and made of silver, and were fairly large. The use of the arms on these medals continued through 1795, with the more famous ones having a scene with George Washington on the other side. Medals made after this time used other designs, and the practice continued through the administration of Benjamin Harrison. The design of the arms on these medals, made by the U.S. Mint, follow the Trenchard design very closely. The stars are randomly placed, the clouds form an arc, with the rays of the glory upward and outwards, a design reminiscent of the modern-day Seal of the President of the United States. Diplomatic Medal In 1790 it was decided to award diplomatic medals to foreign envoys at the end of their service, as a less-extravagant version of the European custom to give diplomats expensive gifts upon their departure. Thomas Jefferson (then the Secretary of State) instructed the U.S. charg√© d'affaires in Paris (William Short) to contract with a local engraver to make the medals, since the first was to go to the Marquis de la Luzerne, the former French minister. Jefferson specified that one side must be the Arms of the United States, and gave suggestions for the other side though left the final decision to Short and the engraving artist. Short chose Augustin Dupr√©, a leading engraver of the time, who completed the medals in 1792. Dupr√© created an elegant design, especially interesting for the position of the wings, which are more horizontal (\\"extended\\" in heraldic terms) than most other emblazonments. The eagle itself was unmistakably a bald eagle, without a crest. The five-pointed stars were arranged in a six-pointed star pattern (like the future 1841 die). The clouds are in an inverted arc, much like the official die, but the rays of the glory extend down beyond the clouds and in back of the eagle. Dupr√© added a UNITED STATES OF AMERICA legend around the sides, and a small rosette of leaves in the exergue below the eagle. For the reverse, Dupr√© apparently followed one of Jefferson's suggestions, depicting a scene of international commerce portrayed as Mercury (the god of diplomacy) in conference with the genius of America (shown as an Indian chief, similar to some early American copper coins). Only two medals (both made of gold) were given before the practice was terminated, one posthumously to de la Luzerne and the other to his successor Count de Moustier. Six bronze versions were also delivered to William Short. Their existence was eventually forgotten until the 1870s, when references to the medals in Jefferson's papers were connected to the discovery of Dupr√©'s lead working model. Freedom Plaza Plaque The reverse side of the Great Seal of the United States, as seen in Freedom Plaza. At the Freedom Plaza in Northwest Washington, D.C., there is a monument to the Great Seal of the United States. This includes a plaque of the seal, followed by an inscription that reads: > In 1776 the continental congress adopted a resolution calling for the > creation of a seal for the new nation. In June 1782 the United States > Congress approved a design which was manufactured in September of that year. > In early 1881 the Department of State selected a new design for the obverse, > which was made in 1885. 2,000 to 3,000 times a year the seal is used on > treaties and other international agreements; proclamations, and commissions > of ambassadors, foreign service officers, and all other civil officers > appointed by the President. In addition we see the seal design every day on > the back of the one dollar bill. This inscription honors both the history, and the modern functionality of the Great Seal, especially in regards to its use by the Department of State. Currency The Coinage Act of 1792 established the U.S. Mint and created the U.S. system of currency, and most of its rules were followed for many years. Among them was a basic design for any gold or silver coins; the obverse was required to have an \\"impression emblematic of liberty\\", with the reverse having a \\"figure or representation of an eagle\\". While using a depiction of the national arms was not necessary, various different arms designs were often used until the early 1900s, and still sometimes appear today on commemorative coins. Even before the mint, the 1787 Brasher Doubloon had a depiction of the arms on one side. File:Double Eagle 1856 O Reverse.jpg1856 Double Eagle File:American Silver Eagle, reverse.jpgAmerican Silver Eagle The 1909 reverse According to Henry A. Wallace (then the Secretary of Agriculture in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's cabinet), in 1934 he saw a 1909 pamphlet on the Great Seal by Gaillard Hunt. The pamphlet included a full-color copy of the reverse of the Great Seal, which Wallace had never seen. He especially liked the motto Novus Ordo Seclorum (\\"New Order of the Ages\\"), likening it to Roosevelt's New Deal (i.e., \\"New Deal of the Ages\\"). He suggested to Roosevelt that a coin be made which included the reverse, but Roosevelt instead decided to put it on the dollar bill. The initial design of the bill had the obverse on the left and the reverse on the right, but Roosevelt ordered them to be switched around. The first bill to contain both sides of the seal was the series 1935 $1 silver certificate. The obverse had originally appeared on the back of the $20 gold certificate, Series 1905. In 2008, the redesigned front side of the five-dollar bill added a purple outline of the obverse of the Great Seal as a background, as part of freedom-related symbols being added to redesigned bills. Senate carpet 1978 reproduction When the U.S. government moved back to Philadelphia in 1790, the city, in an attempt to convince the federal government not to move to Washington, was determined to provide luxurious accommodations at Congress Hall, the recently constructed building where Congress was to meet. One of the finishing touches was in June 1791, when a large Axminster carpet was installed in the Senate's upper-floor chamber. The central design was the U.S. coat of arms, complete with the constellation of 13 stars, surrounded by the linked shields of all thirteen states. Under the arms, there was also a pole with a liberty cap and a balance of justice. The carpet was 22 by 40 feet, and was made by William Peter Sprague, an Englishman from Axminster (probably trained under Thomas Whitty) who had set up a factory in Philadelphia. The carpet was not brought to Washington, D.C., when the government moved in 1800, and is long lost. The National Park Service had a reproduction made in 1978 as part of the restoration of Congress Hall; they had to speculate on the exact design of the eagle and chose the representation seen on the first seal die. Lossing's reverse Benson Lossing reverse In the July 1856 Harper's New Monthly Magazine, historian Benson John Lossing wrote an article on the Great Seal. To illustrate the article, along with copies of Hopkinson's and Barton's original drawings and his own interpretations of the first committee's designs, he also included an apparently original version of the reverse. This depiction more resembles the Egyptian pyramids, and changed the Eye of Providence to a left eye. Lossing's reverse has heavily influenced all future renditions, including today's official version. Centennial Medal In February 1882, C. A. L. Totten (then a 1st lieutenant in the U.S. Army) wrote to both the Secretaries of State and Treasury to suggest some sort of commemoration for the Great Seal, which was to have its centennial later that year, in particular including a version of the never-cut and rarely seen reverse side. The State Department demurred, but the Treasury Department (having the ability to act without express permission of Congress) decided that a commemorative medal would be appropriate and agreed to make one later that year. The medal was designed by Charles E. Barber, the chief engraver of the U.S. Mint. For the obverse, Barber primarily used Trenchard's 1786 Columbian Magazine version, but replaced the eagle with the superior one from Dupr√©'s 1792 Diplomatic Medal (which had been rediscovered a few years before). For the reverse, Barber directly copied Trenchard's 1786 design. According to Totten, two proofs were made in time for the June 20, 1882, centennial date with general circulation following in October 1882. This was the first time a design for the reverse had been officially issued by the U.S. government. Listening device On August 4, 1945, a delegation from the Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union presented a carved wooden plaque of the Great Seal to U.S. Ambassador W. Averell Harriman, as a \\"gesture of friendship\\" to the USSR's allies of World War II. Concealed inside was a covert remote listening device called The Thing. It hung in the ambassador's Moscow residential study for seven years, until it was exposed in 1952 during the tenure of Ambassador George F. Kennan.George F.

The book is an application of ideas from James P. Carse's similarly titled book, Finite and Infinite Games, to the domain of business and organizational structure. Sinek begins by summarizing Carse's distinction between two different types of games: finite games (e.g. chess and football) which are played for the purpose of ending play consistent with static rules and infinite games (e.g. business and politics) which are played for the purpose of continuing play. Sinek claims that leaders who embrace an infinite mindset, aligned with infinite play, will build stronger, more innovative, inspiring, resilient organizations, though these benefits may accrue over larger timescales than benefits associated with a finite mindset. Overview Sinek argues that business fits all the characteristics of an infinite game, notably that: there may be known as well as unknown players; new players can join at any time; each player has their own strategy; there is no set of fixed rules (though law may operate as semi-fixed rules); and there is no beginning or end. Further drawing on Carse's work, Sinek extends the distinction between end states in finite games to claim that business, when viewed through an infinite mindset, does not have winners and losers, but rather players who simply drop out when they run out of the will, the desire, and/or the resources to continue play. According to Sinek, it follows that business leaders should stop thinking about who wins or who is the best and start thinking about how to build and sustain strong and healthy organizations. Leaders who want to adopt an infinite mindset must follow five essential practices: * Advance a Just Cause * Build Trusting Teams * Study their Worthy Rivals * Prepare for Existential Flexibility * Demonstrate the Courage to Lead.  Just Cause  A Just Cause is what gives our work (or that of an organization) meaning. It is the world we hope to build and what inspires us to keep playing the infinite game. A Just Cause must be: * For something--affirmative and optimistic * Inclusive-- open for all to contribute * Service oriented--for the benefit of others * Resilient--able to endure change * Idealistic--big, bold and ultimately unachievable A Just Cause is not our Why. Why is our origin story, who we are, our values and beliefs. A Just Cause is our vision of the future. See also * James P.

He is considered to be the most well-known writer to have used the Sylheti Nagri script and this is due to his magnum opus, Halat-un-Nabi (Condition of the Prophet), which gained immense popularity in the Sylhet region and would later be transcribed in the Bengali script. Early life Shree Gour Kishore Sen was born around 1800, being raised in a very traditional Bengali Hindu family of Baidyas in Daulatpur, Longla Pargana close to the town of Kulaura in South Sylhet. His father, Ram Gobind Sen, and his mother both died while he was very young. Being an only child, he was then raised by his paternal uncle, Ram Dulal Sen. Dulal also died during his nephew's childhood. This led to him pondering about the meaning of life and death. Dissatisfied with Hinduism, he approached a Bengali Muslim man named Muhammad Zakir who ran a maktab in Kulaura. In August 1818, he was taught the basics of Islam by Maulvi Muhammad Yusuf. Sen grew an interest in the Arabic and Persian languages, and so he studied under Mir Munshi Abul Fazl, a detective of the Hingazia thana. On 15 November 1823, he became a local judge (Munsiff) for the Hingazia thana. He lost his job in October 1832 and then migrated to Dhaka where he studied under Shah Naqi Ullah. Here, he formally accepted Islam and changed his name to Sadeq Ali. He also mentions that he was a follower of the Hanafi madhhab. Career as a writer Sadeq Ali decided to take a reformist stance against the common Sylheti Muslim literature which had used religious syncretism with Hinduism, in particular Vaishnavism, and Sufi Baul elements. Sadeq Ali then published his Mahabbatnama based on the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha taking inspiration from the earlier version by Shah Gharibullah of West Bengal. He also wrote Hashor Michhil (Procession of Hashr), which also remains in circulation, continuing to be sold in shops in both Sylheti Nagri and Bengali scripts. as well as Radd al-Hind (Response to the Hindus), Kashf al-Bid'ah (Unveiling of Innovation), Pandenama, Dafeh al- Hujat, Hushiarnama and Rahasatul Islam. Sadeq Ali later composed another puthi about the prophetic biography called Halat-un-Nabi in 1855, focusing more on scripture rather than more popular folk beliefs. It became a household item in every Bengali Muslim homestead in Greater Sylhet and Cachar, making it the most popular and widely printed book in the Sylheti Nagri script. Sadeq Ali then wrote a puthi titled Radd-i-Kufr (or A Response to Disbelief) detailing the problems with syncretism in 1874. Legacy Long after Sadeq Ali's death in 1862, the Bangladesh Liberation War took place in 1971. A fire took place in Bandar Bazar, Sylhet town destroying the Islamia Press, which was the largest Sylheti Nagri printing press. However, Bengali script versions of the Halat-un-Nabi puthi continued to be in production and circulation.

Scantlebury participated in pioneering work to develop packet switching and associated communication protocols at the NPL in the late 1960s. He proposed the use of the technology in the ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet, at the inaugural Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 1967. During the 1970s, he was an active member of international working groups that developed concepts for the interconnection of computer networks. Early life Roger Scantlebury was born in Ealing in 1936. Career =National Physical Laboratory= Scantlebury worked with Keith Bartlett at the National Physical Laboratory in south-west London, in collaboration with the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC). His early work was on the Automatic Computing Engine and English Electric DEUCE computers. Following this he worked with Donald Davies on his pioneering packet switching concepts. In October 1967, he attended the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in the United States, where he gave an exposition of packet-switching, developed on the NPL Data Communications Network. Also attending the conference was Larry Roberts, from the ARPA; this was the first time that Larry Roberts had heard of packet switching. Scantlebury persuaded Roberts and other American engineers to incorporate the concept into the design for the ARPANET. Scantlebury is one of the first people to describe the term protocol in a data-communications context in an April 1967 memorandum entitled \\"A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network\\" written with Keith Bartlett. He was part of a team that developed the alternating bit protocol (ABP) in 1969. Along with Donald Davies and Derek Barber he participated in the International Networking Working Group (INWG) from 1972, initially chaired by Vint Cerf. He was acknowledged by Bob Kahn and Vinet Cerf in their 1974 paper on internetworking, \\"A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication\\", and he co-authored the standard agreed by the INWG in 1975, \\"Proposal for an international end to end protocol\\". Later, as head of the data networks group within the Computer Science Division, he was responsible for the UK technical contribution to the European Informatics Network, a datagram network linking CERN, the French research centre INRIA and the UK‚Äôs National Physical Laboratory. =Logica= He joined Logica in 1977 in their Communications Division,Communications Standards: State of the Art Report 14:3 where he worked on the CCITT (ITU-T) X.25 protocol and with the formation of the Euronet, a virtual circuit network using X.25. He moved to the Finance Division in 1981. Personal life He married Christine Appleby in 1958 in Middlesex; they had two sons in 1961 and 1966, and a daughter in 1963. He lives in Esher. Scantlebury was influential in persuading NPL to sponsor a gallery about \\"Technology of the Internet\\" at The National Museum of Computing, which opened in 2009.

There are also two other SuperSplash coasters with custom layouts, including Journey to Atlantis at SeaWorld San Antonio.  Characteristics  Atlantica SuperSplash was constructed by Mack Rides. It is a SuperSplash water coaster featuring two drops, the highest being 30 metres. There is a 9 metre drop between the lift hill and main drop. Two turntables enable boats to take this drop in reverse. There is a small airtime hill after the main drop before boats make their ultimate splashdown. The roller coaster has six boats, each seating guests in four rows of four and restrained with lap bars. Each boat weighs 5 tonnes. The lake surrounding the ride has an area of 4,400m2. Under the surface of the water after the drop, a series of magnets are able to control the speed at which boats enter the water. In this way, the size of the splash can be controlled depending on how warm the weather is that day.

Life Sana Na N‚ÄôHada was born in 1950 in Enxal√©. Though his father wanted him to work on the land, he attended a Fransiscan primary school for 'indigenous' students and encountered teachers active in the national liberation movement. In the 1960s he joined the guerillas to work as a medical assistant. In 1967, Am√≠lcar Cabral sent him ‚Äì together with Jos√© Bolama Cubumba, Josefina Lopes Crato and Flora Gomes ‚Äì to study filmmaking at the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematogr√°ficos in Cuba. He later studied at the Institut des hautes √©tudes cin√©matographiques in Paris. In 1978, Na N‚ÄôHada became the first director of the National Film Institute, holding the post until 1989. Na N‚ÄôHada started his own filmmaking with several short films, the first two co-directed with his contemporary Flora Gomes. He collaborated with Chris Marker on Marker's essay-film Sans Soleil (1983), providing Marker with footage of Bissau Carnival. He was also assistant director to Flora Gomes for his first feature film, Mortu Nega [Those Whom Death Refused] (1988), and in Po di sangui [Blood Tree]. His first feature film, Xime (1994) was co-written with Joop van Wijk. Xime was a historical film set in 1962, the year before Guinea Bissau's war of liberation started. It was shown at the Cannes Film Festival. His documentary Bissau d'Isabel (2005) used the daily life of Isabel Nabal√≠ Nhaga, a nurse struggling to support her family, as a microcosm of the city of Bissau. The documentary Kadjike (2013), shot in the Bijag√≥s Islands, juxtaposed the natural beauty of the archipelago, and its traditional understanding in Bijag√≥ myth, to the threat posed by its exploitation by the global drug trafficking trade.

History One of many battles which took place between the British and their allies against a Lusei clan in Mizoram during the late 19th century. Delhi Durbar in 1903. =Origin= The family was founded by a Bengali Hindu man called Sarbananda from the village of Barsala. Sarbananda became a Muslim, changing his name to Sarwar, and worked as a minister under the Sultan of Bengal. Under the instructions of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah, Sarwar went to the Pratapgarh Kingdom to negotiate with Sultan Muhammad Bazid to return Sylhet to the Bengal Sultanate. After being rejected by Bazid, Sarwar defeated him in a war also fighting Bazid's allies, the Zamindars of Kanihati and of Ita.Bangladesh Itihas Samiti, Sylhet: History and Heritage, (1999), p. 715 Bazid gave up his title as the Sultan of Pratapgarh, and Sarwar was rewarded as the next legitimate Nawab of Sylhet after Gawhar Khan Aswari's death, and was granted the title of Khan. =Early history= Sarwar's son, Mir Khan was the next Nawab of Sylhet. Mir Khan, was made the Qanungoh (revenue officer) of Sylhet, and the family continued holding this office until the abolishment of the Qanungoh system. Mir Khan married Lavanyavati, the Muslim daughter of Bazid of Pratapgarh. Lodi Khan was said to have won a battle against Khwaja Usman, and then his son Jahan Khan established Jahanpur, named after himself. In the 17th century, Keshwar Khan, the Qanungoh of Sylhet under Emperor Aurangzeb, dug a canal which he called Keshwar Khal. His son, Mahtab Khan, is also known to have established a Haat bazaar in the Sylhet region named after himself. =During British rule= Mahtab Khan's son was Masud Bakht who was made the Head Qanungoh of Sylhet. Masud played an important part in maintaining peace during the Muharram Rebellion of 1782. He was succeeded as Qanungoh by his nephew, Muhammad Bakht in 1793. Muhammad Bakht founded the village of Muhammadabad. In the late 17th century, Syed Bakht Mazumdar and his family migrated to Makkah, under the Ottoman Empire, where he joined the council of the Sharif of Mecca and was awarded the Star of the Mejidhi. On the 1st of April 1867, Syed had a son called Muhammad. Following Syed's return to Sylhet, he and his son, Moulvi Hamid Bakht Mazumdar, became one of the only people in their province to be exempted of civil court attendance. Hamid was the Deputy Collector of Sylhet and assisted in the Lushai Hills expedition. Hamid was fluent in Persian and wrote the prose Ain-i-Hind, a history of the Indian subcontinent. Ala Bakhsh Mazumdar Hamed was known to have written Tuhfatul Muhsineen and Diwan-i-Hamed. Collectively, the works of these two are regarded amongst the most creative literary works in the Sylhet region. Hamid's younger brother, Majid Bakht Mazumdar was made the Deputy Collector and Magistrate of Rajshahi in 1878. He then became the Assistant Commissioner of the Assam Province. He assisted the government in the battles of Lushai and Manipur. Majid was awarded the title of Khan Bahadur by King Edward VII for his efforts and invited to the King's coronation at the Delhi Durbar of 1903. The wrestler, Ashrab Ali Mazumdar was also from this family. In the early eighteenth century, Syed's other son (who was born in Makkah), Muhammad Bakht Mazumdar, was made the Honorary Magistrate of Bengal and the Extra Assistant Commissioner in Assam. He was an important visitor of the Civil Jail and Leper Asylum in Sylhet and a member of the District's Local Board council. He is known to have established a madrasa in Sylhet as well. In 1857, he presented six pieces of military equipment to the British Raj. He had a keen interest in the tea industry and in 1904, he opened the Brahmanchara Tea Estate alongside Syed Abdul Majid, Ghulam Rabbani and Karim Bakhsh. He was given the title of Khan Bahadur in 1909. Muhammad was also one of the prominent leaders of the Sylhet-Bengal Reunion League formed in 1920 to reunite the Sylhet District with Bengal, which it had been separated from. However, in September 1928, Muhammad proposed a resolution, during the Surma Valley Muslim Conference, opposing the transfer of Sylhet and Cachar to Bengal and this even gained support from Syed Abdul Majid and his organisation Anjuman-e-Islamia as well as the Muslim Students Association.

Prorenin is converted into renin by the juxtaglomerular cells, which are specialised smooth muscle cells present mainly in the afferent, but also the efferent, arterioles of the glomerular capillary bed. Prorenin is a relatively large molecule, weighing approximately 46 KDa. History Prorenin was discovered by Eugenie Lumbers in 1971. Synthesis In addition to juxtaglomerular cells, prorenin is also synthesised by other organs, such as the adrenal glands, the ovaries, the testis and the pituitary gland, which is why it is found in the plasma of anephric individuals. Concentration Blood concentration levels of prorenin are between 5 and 10 times higher than those of renin. There is evidence to suggest that, in diabetes mellitus, prorenin levels are even higher. Prorenin occurs in very high concentrations in amniotic fluid and amnion. Conversion to renin Proprotein convertase 1 converts prorenin into renin, but proprotein convertase 2 does not. There is no evidence that prorenin can be converted into renin in the circulation. Therefore, the granular (JG) cells seem to be the only source of active renin.

In this photo, Blitzchung's opponent appears to be requesting assistance from a Blizzard employee during the match. This photo predates the Blitzchung controversy by about ten months. In October 2019, Blizzard Entertainment punished Ng Wai Chung (Âê≥ÂÅâËÅ∞) (known as Blitzchung), a Hong Kongese esports player of the online video game Hearthstone, for voicing his support of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests during an official streaming event. The public's response, which included a boycott and a letter from United States Congress representatives, prompted Blizzard to reduce the punishment, but not to eliminate it.  Events  Blizzard Entertainment Logo. =Banning of Ng Wai Chung= On October 6, 2019, during the Hearthstone Grandmasters streaming event in Taiwan, Ng Wai Chung, a professional Hearthstone player and resident of Hong Kong known as \\"Blitzchung\\", was being interviewed following his match, during which he donned a mask similar to those worn by protesters in the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests and said \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\". The stream was cut off shortly after. The following day, on October 7, Blizzard announced that Blitzchung had been banned from the current tournament, would forfeit any prize money (approximately by that point), and would be banned from other Grandmaster tournaments for one year. The company cited a rule that prohibits Grandmasters players from offending the public or impugning Blizzard's image. Blizzard later said that while they respect its players' freedom of speech, they are still bound by competition rules. Blitzchung, in an interview afterwards, stated that he had done the act of protest because his effort towards the social movement over the preceding months sometimes interfered with his preparation for the tournament. =Blizzard employee terminations= Blizzard additionally terminated the contract with the two stream casters that had been conducting the interview, \\"Virtual\\" and \\"Mr. Yee\\"; viewers believed the two had been encouraging Blitzchung to express his message, and thus also ran afoul of the rule. Virtual stated to PC Gamer that he and Mr. Yee only knew moments before the interview that Blitzchung would be wearing a mask, and when Blitzchung started his statement related to the protest, the casters ducked their heads under their desk, so that it was evident that Blitzchung was only speaking for himself. Virtual stated that he had yet to be told why he had been fired from Blizzard's Taiwan offices.  Public response  =Initial reaction= Due to the political nature of this event, the official mainland Chinese sources are against Blitzchung's action; on the other side, most other sources are encouraging his action. Since Blitzchung's actions, which the Chinese government considers to be against China's national dignity, a Sina Weibo social media post on Blizzard's official Hearthstone channel, run by the company's Chinese publishing partner NetEase, publicly condemned his action. And there are many criticisms on Weibo of what some perceive as Blitzchung's acts of treason and separatism. Some other commentators felt that Blizzard acted out of caution for its business interests with China, both Chinese government (who had censored support for the Hong Kong protests) and the Chinese technology giant Tencent (a partial owner of Blizzard). Others spoke out against Blizzard's actions, which appeared as if endorsing the Chinese government position. Joint letter from U.S. Senators and Representatives to Activision-Blizzard regarding the ban Some criticized the weight and impact of Blitzchung's ban as an unfair treatment when compared to lesser penalties that Blizzard had placed on Overwatch League professional players for vulgar statements and gestures on camera. United States Senators Ron Wyden and Marco Rubio spoke against the ban and co-signed a letter with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mike Gallagher, and Tom Malinowski sent to the company requesting a full reversal of the ban on Blitzchung. The letter said that, given Blizzard's stature in the gaming community, its decision \\"could have a chilling effect on gamers who seek to use their platform to promote human rights and basic freedoms\\". =#BoycottBlizzard= Several long-term players of Blizzard's games discussed a boycott of Blizzard to encourage Blizzard to revoke the ban on Blitzchung. On Twitter, the hashtag #BoycottBlizzard trended worldwide, with notable participation of former Blizzard employee and World of Warcraft team lead Mark Kern, who showed he was canceling his subscription to his own game. Some of Blizzard's employees, in protest, shrouded parts of a company monument and staged a walkout using umbrellas as had been done in the 2014 Hong Kong protests. One longtime Blizzard employee stated, \\"The action Blizzard took against the player was pretty appalling but not surprising.\\" Both Brian Kibler and Nathan Zamora, casters for Hearthstone, dropped out of announcing for the Hearthstone Grandmasters at the November 2019 BlizzCon due to the incident. In his resignation, Kibler stated that his appearance would tacitly endorse the decision. Mitsubishi Motors withdrew its esports sponsorship several days after the ban. =Overwatch character symbolism= Supporters of the Hong Kong protest began to post fan art of Blizzard's own Overwatch character, Mei, a Chinese native, as a sign of support for Blitzchung and the protests following the ban. Business Insider's headline expressed their opinion on the matter: \\"Furious fans are hitting back at Blizzard by using one of its characters in anti-China memes after the gaming company punished a pro gamer for defending the Hong Kong protests.\\" =Continued protests= On October 9, at the end of a Hearthstone Collegiate Champs match following Blitzchung's ban, players of the losing team, American University, held up a sign that said \\"Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizz\\" on their player camera before the broadcast quickly cut away. Player cameras were resultingly removed from the event's coverage and replaced by images of the game's leading characters. Additionally, player interviews were said to be discontinued for the rest of the competition. The Blizzard subreddit went private amidst all other subreddits dedicated to Blizzard properties showing anger toward the company's actions. AccessNow.org, a human rights advocacy group, also urged Blizzard to reverse the ban.  Blizzard's response  Pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong, June 16, 2019. =Formally announcing reduced penalties= Five days after the incident, Blizzard president J. Allen Brack wrote that, after reviewing the situation, Blizzard felt the penalties applied were not appropriate, though they were still concerned about how Blitzchung and the casters took the discussion away from the game and into political discourse. Brack stated they will reinstate Blitzchung's winnings, reduce his ban from Grandmasters to six months, and reduce the casters' bans to six months. Brack asserted that \\"our relationships in China had no influence on our decision\\". Blizzard also formally banned the American University team for six months, applying the same reasoning as with Blitzchung's reduced ban. In later interviews, Brack asserted that Blizzard will not wholly remove the bans, citing the importance of keeping its broadcast focus \\"on the games\\" while reiterating \\"it's not about the content of Blitzchung's message\\". =Attempt at withdrawing responsibility= Protests continued at the 2019 BlizzCon convention on November 1‚Äì2, 2019. Brack led off the opening ceremonies by accepting accountability for the initial ban against Blitzchung, stating, \\"We didn‚Äôt live up to the high standards we set for ourselves and we failed in our purpose\\". It was noted that Brack was careful not to mention \\"Hong Kong\\" specifically in his apology, but promised to improve and let Blizzard's actions speak louder than their words. Fight for the Future planned to arrange an \\"umbrella protest\\" at the event to demonstrate their disapproval of Blizzard's actions.  Aftermath  Hong Kong protesters holding a banner reading \\"I want real universal suffrage.\\" =Sympathetic reactions to Hong Kong protests= When the Australian developer Immutable, makers of the online digital card game Gods Unchained, offered to cover Blitzchung's lost winnings and invite him to their upcoming tournament, their game servers were subject to a denial-of-service attack. After the ban was announced, several, high-ranking casters of the HearthStone (casters: Admirable, Sottle, Raven, & Darroch Brown), threatened to discontinue service until the ban was lifted. In contrast to Tencent, Epic Games, which is 40% owned by Tencent, said through a spokesperson that \\"Epic supports everyone's right to express their views on politics and human rights. We wouldn't ban or punish a Fortnite player or content creator for speaking on these topics,\\" a message also shared by its CEO Tim Sweeney on Twitter. Lee Shi Tian, a Hong Kong professional Magic: The Gathering player, expressed support for the protests at a major championship a few weeks later, and was not penalized by Wizards of the Coast. =Negative reactions to Hong Kong protests= Riot Games, which is wholly owned by Chinese company Tencent, had been accused of censoring the words \\"Hong Kong\\" in the team name \\"Hong Kong Attitude\\" as the initialism \\"HKA\\" during the League of Legends World Championship in the week following Blizzard's ban, but Riot identified instances where both names were used interchangeably and asserted that there were no restrictions on the phrase \\"Hong Kong\\". Riot asked casters and players to avoid discussing politics on streams in light of the situation.

The name \\"More\\" recorded in the Scottish accounts seems to be word \\"moor\\", meaning an African person.

James licensed Scottish privateers like Andrew Barton to attack Portuguese shipping.Norman Macdougall, James IV (Tuckwell: East Linton, 1997), p. 239.

In 1506 they were both given gowns of russet cloth with velvet bands, with red skirts or kirtles. In 1507 they, and another girl in the castle, Marjory Lindsay, were given red skirts with green ribbons.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1901), lxxxv, 114, 155, 172, 175, 310-11, 321-2, 336, 361, 370-1, 387: Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1902), 51, 59, 61-2, 82, 100, 116. In later years they joined the court of Margaret Tudor and were bought clothes, and given New Year's day gifts, comparable to those given to the queen's English lady in waiting, Mistress Agnes Musgrave. Ellen is known to have worked for the queen at Linlithgow Palace.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1902), pp. 339, 324, 401, 404.

James IV staged two elaborate tournaments called \\"The justing of the wyld knicht for the blak lady\\", held in June 1507 and again in May 1508. The part of the \\"Black Lady\\" was played by a woman of the court. It is not clear if William Dunbar's poem was connected to these events, or that Ellen More played the part of the Black Lady in the tournaments, although the identity of Ellen, or Elen More, is discussed in scholarship as the subject of Dunbar's poem, the woman named in the accounts, and the actor in the tournaments.Jane E.

After she takes the civil service examination and is appointed to a government position, she finally avenges her father by taking down his enemy. Because it features a woman that ventures out from the domestic space and actively participates in the public sphere, Seol jeo jeon is classified as a work of female hero fiction. Unlike other works of female hero fiction, the female protagonist in Seol jeo jeon does not directly fight in battle nor does she possess any kind of awareness regarding gender. However, because it was created in the late seventeenth century (the early period in the history of classical Korean literature), it is significant in that it demonstrates the formative period for the female hero fiction as a literary genre.  Authorship  The author and original date of creation are both unknown, but the author is presumed to be a woman and the date of creation is estimated to be sometime around the late seventeenth century. ‚ÄúOkso‚Äù Gwon Seop (Ê¨äÁáÆ, 1671-1759)‚Äôs collection of writings, Oksogo (ÁéâÊâÄÁ®ø The Writings of Okso) contains the story, Beon Seolgyeong jeon (ÁøªËñõÂçøÂÇ≥ The Tale of Beon Seolgyeong) which is a translation of Seol gyeong jeon into classical Chinese. Seol gyeong jeon is the same work as Seol Sojeo jeon (ËñõÂ∞èÂßêÂÇ≥ The Tale of Seol Sojeo). As the work was translated in 1724 (in the eighteenth century), it can be presumed that Seol jeo jeon was originally written sometime before then‚Äîaround the latter half of the seventeenth century.  Plot  During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty in China, there was a man named Seol Munbaek who held a government position in the Ministry of Personnel. After he began his government position, he had a daughter named Wolae whose spirit was as excellent and outstanding as that of a hero‚Äôs. At the age of three, Wolae‚Äôs mother passes away. Her father does not remarry and Wolae, when she turns ten years old, starts to manage their household all on her own as efficiently and capably as an adult. One day, Choe Hun, a powerful man within the royal cart, sends a request to Seol Munbaek in order to arrange a marriage between Seol Wolae and his son. However, Seol Munbaek rejects this request and Choe Hun becomes spiteful and starts to harbor a desire for revenge. Afterwards, Choe Hun attempts to rape Lady Jeong, the wife of Confucian Scholar Yi Hyeon, but Lady Jeong escapes, managing to leave behind a letter written in her blood before she commits suicide. Upon hearing of Yi Hyeon‚Äôs circumstances, Seol Munbaek writes an appeal to the king calling for the punishment of Choe Hun. Choe Hun‚Äôs brother-in-law discovers Seol Munbaek‚Äôs plan and informs Choe Hun who proceeds to falsely accuse Seol Munbaek instead. Seol Munbaek is thus banished to the North Sea. Seol Wolae, now alone, is coerced by Choe Hun into marrying his son. She pretends to accept her fate, but instead sends her devoted maid in her place to get married. After the nuptials, she and her maid, Yeohwan, disguise themselves as men and escape to Cheongam Temple where Seol Wolae begins studying military strategies and the martial arts. One day, a person visits the temple and is impressed by Seol Wolae‚Äôs immense spirit and strength and recommends that she take the civil service examination. In order to clear her father‚Äôs name from the false charge, Seol Wolae changes her name to ‚ÄúSeolgyeong‚Äù and takes the civil service examination. After she places first in the examination, she sends a message to the king informing him of the situation between her father and Choe Hun. The king comes to learn the truth and thus banishes Choe Hun and extols the chastity and faithfulness of Madame Jeong, who committed suicide to protect her virtue. He also releases Seol Munbaek from his sentence of exile and decides to make Seol Wolae his son-in-law. Seol Wolae first goes to retrieve her father from his place of exile, and then proceeds to send a message to the emperor revealing her true identity as a woman and humbly begs for his forgiveness. The king is impressed by her and marries her to the crown prince while also promoting Seol Munbaek to a higher government position. Seol Wolae has eight boys and three girls and dies shortly after her husband passes away.  Features and Significance  Unlike other works of female hero fiction, the female protagonist of Seol jeo jeon does not fight in a war nor demonstrate a clear consciousness of gender and gender roles. However, the story was written in the latter half of the seventeenth century (in the early period within the history of classical Korean literature) and portrays a diverse range of problems from the perspective of a woman. In this sense, Seol jeo jeon can be seen as influencing later works of female hero fiction and their creation. The depiction of Seol Wolae‚Äôs father is also remarkable in that he refuses to remarry, even after his wife dies, because he fears that it will be detrimental to his daughter. That is, his consideration of a woman‚Äôs circumstances is behavior rarely seen in works of female hero fiction, let alone within other works of classical Korean literature. Above all else, this work emphasizes that, in a patriarchal society, the most violent and dangerous incident that can occur to a woman is rape. For instance, the story depicts the villainous Choe Hun attempting to rape a married woman, causing her to commit suicide. The portrayal of a married woman‚Äôs rape connotes the oppression and contradictions faced by women in a patriarchal society. Specifically, while men use their power and strength to oppress women, the ideology of ‚Äúchastity‚Äù also pressures women into remaining ‚Äúpure‚Äù and faithful to one man for their entire lives. Thus, the story‚Äôs representation of a married woman‚Äôs rape raises problems based on women‚Äôs real-life circumstances. However, the ‚Äúgood‚Äù character‚Äôs (Seol Munbaek) failure in bringing the rapist to justice shows the absence of any kind of male figure capable of solving the issues surrounding rape. Although Seol Wolae, in disguising herself as a man and stepping out into the public sphere, avenges the married woman‚Äôs rape, it is not her explicit goal from the outset‚Äîrather, it is a side-effect of Seol Wolae punishing Choe Hun for his action and yet, it ultimately contributes to resolving some of the problems in a male-centric society. Seol Wolae‚Äôs actions, motivated by a sense of filial duty, can thus be interpreted as the novelistic embodiment of women‚Äôs stories in classical texts on ethics such as Samgang haengsil do (‰∏âÁ∂±Ë°åÂØ¶Âúñ Illustrated Guide to the Three Relations) and Yeollyeo jeon (ÂàóÂ•≥ÂÇ≥ Five Biographies of Faithful Woman). Nevertheless, Seol jeo jeon helped weaken prejudices regarding women‚Äôs skills and gender roles, likely becoming the foundation for the clearer awareness of gender seen in later works of female hero fiction.  Bibliographic Information  There are currently eleven different extant copies Seol jeo jeon that have been discovered thus far. With the exception of Beon Seolgyeong jeon, which is a translation of the original text into classical Chinese, the other ten copies are handwritten manuscripts in hangeul, the Korean alphabet. Two copies are currently held at Seoul University‚Äôs Kyujanggak Institute for Korean Studies in the Garam Collection (the donated materials from Professor ‚ÄúGaram‚Äù Yi Byeonggi‚Äôs personal collections). One of these copies is known as the ‚ÄúGaram A‚Äù version. The translation by Gwon Seop into classical Chinese is likely the closest to the original text, and while Seol jeo jeon was originally written in hangeul, it appears to correspond in every way (including in terms of content) to the classical Chinese translation, which can be confirmed through the ‚ÄúGaram A‚Äù version. The handwritten manuscript versions of Seol jeo jeon have diverse titles, including Syeoljye jyeon (ÏÖúÏ°îÏ†º), Seolbi hyohaeng rok (ÏÑ§ÎπÑÌö®ÌñâÎ°ù), Chunghyorok (Ï∂©Ìö®Î°ù), and Uiyeol bi chunghyo rok (ÏùòÏó¥ÎπÑÏ∂©Ìö®Î°ù). The majority of the existing copies of the manuscript are titled Uiyeol bi chunghyo rok , with a total of eight copies with this title. Uiyeol bi chunghyo rok emphasizes the female protagonist‚Äôs sense of filial duty.

It was established during a process of redistricting undertaken in the 1990s.United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870‚Äì2010. In 2010, 9,882 people lived in the district. Geography The Eastern District occupies the southeastern portion of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by the Northern District, to the east by District I and District III in Roane County, to the south by District 3 and District 4 in Kanawha County, to the southwest by Buffalo-Union District in Putnam County, and to the west by the Western District of Jackson County.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Gay Quadrangle (ed. 1960, rev. 1987).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kenna Quadrangle (eds. 1906, 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Kentuck Quadrangle (ed. 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Ripley Quadrangle (eds. 1907, 1928, 1960, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Romance Quadrangle (ed. 1957, rev. 1975).United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia, Sissonville Quadrangle (ed. 1958, rev. 1975). Most of the district consists of rolling hills, separated by creeks and low ridges.\\"Ripley and Washington Districts\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883). The district includes the city of Ripley, which is the county seat, and one of only two incorporated towns in Jackson County. =Streams= The main streams in the northern part of the district are Mill Creek and its various tributaries, several of which arise in the western portion of Roane County. Mill Creek is formed in the northwestern portion of the district, by the confluence of Little Mill Creek and the Elk Fork, both flowing from the east. Little Mill Creek begins in western Roane County, and gathers a number of tributaries, the largest of which is Frozencamp Creek, also flowing out of Roane County. The Elk Fork gathers a number of tributaries from both sides of the Roane County line, and flows northwest until it joins with Little Mill Creek. From their confluence, Mill Creek winds southwest until it meets the Tug Fork, coming from the southeast; the Tug Fork is formed by the confluence of two large creeks: the Bear Fork, flowing northwest, with its headwaters in Roane County, and Grasslick Creek, which winds around several ridges in the western part of the district. From its juncture with the Tug Fork, Mill Creek flows northwest, passing the town of Ripley, from which it continues west and northwest through the Western District of Jackson County, before entering the Ohio River at Millwood. The southern portion of the district is drained by the Left Fork and Middle Fork of the Pocatalico River. The Left Fork drains the southwestern portion of the district, flowing southward from the confluence of Pocatalico Creek and the Dudden Fork, and continuing to the southernmost point of Jackson County, where it meets with the Middle Fork. Flowing south and southwest out of the southeastern part of the district, the Middle Fork of the Pocatalico gathers a number of tributaries, of which the largest are the Laurel Fork, Second Creek, and Sugar Creek. From their confluence at the southern end of the county, the Left and Middle Forks flow southward through Kanawha County, where they meet the main branch of the river above Sissonville. =Communities= The only incorporated town in the district is the city of Ripley, located on Mill Creek, about eight miles southeast of the Ohio River. It is the county seat, and with a population estimated at 3,220 in 2017, it is the second-largest city in Jackson County.United States Census Bureau, \\"American Community Survey\\" population estimate for Ripley city, West Virginia (retrieved 9 Nov. 2019). Besides Ripley, there are a number of small unincorporated villages spread throughout the district, mainly along the various creeks. Marshall, Frozencamp, and Hereford are located along Little Mill Creek, with the village of Louther on Frozencamp Creek. Gay is on the Elk Fork, while Shatto is on Mill Creek below the confluence of Little Mill Creek and the Elk Fork. The village of Staats Mills is on the Tug Fork. above Staats Mills, the village of Belgrove is located on the Bear Fork, while Kenna, Fairplain, and Plum Orchard are on Grasslick Creek and its tributaries. Salt Hill is located in the hills above Mill Creek, south of Ripley. In the southern part of the district, Goldtown and Loop are located on the Left Fork of the Pocatalico River, while Kentuck, Fletcher, and Advent are on the Middle Fork; the village of Mount Tell is on Sugar Creek. =Roads and infrastructure= The historic Staats Mill Covered Bridge, now at Cedar Lakes Conference Center. The main east-west highway in the Eastern District is U.S. Route 33, which travels through the northern part of the district between Ripley and Spencer, in Roane County. The main north-south route is County Road 21, which runs from Ripley north to Parkersburg, and south to Charleston, passing through Fairplain, Kenna, and Goldtown before entering Kanawha County. North of Ripley, it is known locally as the Parkersburg Road, while south of Ripley it is the Charleston Road. Interstate 77 runs through the district, roughly paralleling the Charleston Road, on its way from Charleston to Parkersburg; there are exits at Ripley, Fairplain, Kenna, and Goldtown. Other important roads include West Virginia Route 34, which travels from Interstate 77 at Kenna to Red House in Putnam County. The Eastern District is also home to the Cedar Lakes Conference Center, a conference center and retreat located along Mill Creek, southeast of Ripley. Originally established in 1955 as a leadership training facility for West Virginia students, the center is owned and operated by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, and features year-round accommodations for large and small groups, together with a variety of meeting and recreational facilities.e-WV, The West Virginia Encyclopedia, \\"Cedar Lakes Conference Center\\", retrieved 9 Nov. 2019. The center's grounds include the Staats Mill Covered Bridge, a historic covered bridge originally built over the Tug Fork of Mill Creek at Staats Mills in 1887. The bridge was dismantled and brought to Cedar Lakes, where it was reconstructed in 1983.National Archives and Records Administration, Catalog Record 86534365, \\"Staats Mill Covered Bridge\\", accessed 9 Nov. 2019. History Little is written about the early settlers of the Eastern District. The first settler at Ripley was William Parsons, who built a cabin on a plateau overlooking Mill Creek, and later sold his land to Jacob Starcher, who would lay out the town between 1828 and 1832.\\"Towns and Villages: Ripley\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. Until 1831, all of the territory that would become Jackson County was part of Mason, Kanawha, and Wood counties. Most of what is now the Eastern District, including the site of Ripley, was part of Mason County; but the southeastern portion of the district was originally in Kanawha County.Michael F. Doran, Atlas of County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634‚Äì1895, Iberian Publishing Company, Athens, Georgia (c. 1987). Soon after the new county's formation, Ripley was named the county seat. After West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, the counties were divided into civil townships, which were converted into magisterial districts in 1872. Jackson County was divided into five magisterial districts: Grant, Ravenswood, Ripley, Union, and Washington. Except for minor adjustments, the names and boundaries of the historic districts remained largely unchanged from the 1870s until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. All of Washington District was combined with the southern and eastern portions of Ripley District to form the Eastern Magisterial District. The northern, eastern, and southern boundaries of the district follow the original lines of Washington and Ripley Districts, but a new western boundary was drawn, extending the new district along Mill Creek to Ripley, encircling the town, and then running south along the Charleston Road, Pleasant Valley Road, and Jim Ridge Road to the county line. Because redistricting proved confusing with county records, the West Virginia Legislature provided for the original magisterial districts to continue in the form of tax districts, which continued to serve administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. The current magisterial districts are used for those functions requiring equal representation between the residents of the various district, and as such are currently the minor civil division of record for the United States Census Bureau.

It is a fictional work that reveals the universal emotions of those living in Joseon and was quite popular, enjoyed by many. It was later thought to have influenced Yi Kwangsu (1892-1950)‚Äôs Mujeong (Î¨¥Ï†ï Heartless), hailed as the first work of modern Korean fiction.  Authorship  The exact date of creation and author of Sukhyang jeon are unknown, but it is presumed to have been written sometime within the seventeenth century. Records indicate that Amenomori H≈çshu (1668-1775), a Japanese Confucian scholar, came to Busan in 1702 and used Korean stories, including Sukhyang jeon, in order to learn the Korean language. From this record, we can thereby confirm that Sukhyang jeon existed in the late-seventeenth century.  Plot  Kim Jeon, who once saved a turtle from death, and his wife, Lady Jang, were unable to have children for a very long time until one day, they suddenly have a daughter they name Sukhyang. When Sukhyang is five years old, a bandit‚Äôs rebellion breaks out and the family is forced to escape in order to seek refuge. As they evacuate, Kim Jeon and Lady Jang are separated from Sukhyang. With the help of a deer, the newly orphaned Sukhyang makes her way to the home of Jang Seungsang. Sukhyang grows up as the adopted daughter of Jang Seungsang, but one day, she is falsely accused of stealing and is kicked out. Later, Sukhyang attempts to drown herself , but the turtle that her father once saved suddenly appears and rescues her. Afterwards, in another close brush with death, Sukhyang is once more saved by a man named Hwa Deokjin. In another instance, Sukhyang nearly dies from starvation, but an elderly woman named Yi Hwajeong helps her and the two end up living together. One day, Sukhyang has a dream that she becomes a fairy and is playing in heaven. After she wakes from her dream, she records the scene seen in her dream through embroidery. The elderly woman takes Sukhyang‚Äôs embroidery and sells it to a merchant. The merchant visits the writer and master calligrapher, Yi Seon, in order to create a title for the picture embroidered by Sukhyang. Upon seeing the embroidery, Yi Seon is shocked because it exactly reflects his own dream. He then finds Yi Hwajeong and meets Sukhyang, who he marries. However, when Yi Seon‚Äôs father, Yi Sangseo, finds out about their marriage, he gives orders to Kim Jeon, the magistrate of Nagyang, to lock up Sukhyang and kill her. Kim Jeon, unaware that Sukhyang is his own daughter, prepares to carry out the orders. However, his wife, Lady Jang has a dream and begs him to release Sukhyang. With the help of Lady Yeo, Yi Seon‚Äôs aunt, they manage to free Sukhyang from prison. Afterwards, Sukhyang formally meets Yi Sangseo and his wife with the help of Yi Hwajeong and a blue dog, and they finally accept her as a daughter-in-law. Yi Seon attains first place in the civil service examination and is appointed as a royal historian, returning to his home and living happily together with Sukhyang. She later accompanies Yi Seon on his trip to Kiangling. On the way, she is reunited with Jang Seungsang and his wife, who took care of her for a short while, and she repays their former kindness. She also reunites with her father and mother and tells them that she is their daughter. Later, Yi Seon brings back an elixir of immortality from Bongnae Mountain on behalf of the Empress Dowager and he is made King of the Chu State for his actions. Yi Seon and Sukhyang enjoy great riches and honors until finally, they decide to return home by ship.  Features and Significance  While Sukhyang jeon can be interpreted as a love story between Sukhyang and Yi Seon, it can also be seen as a female coming of age novel in that it details the process through which a female protagonist (Sukhyang) encounters numerous ordeals and overcomes them. In the story, the hardships faced by Sukhyang are shown to be planned by Heaven and can thus be seen as a kind of ‚Äúrite of passage.‚Äù Yet the journey through which she endures and overcomes such ordeals can also be seen as Sukhyang‚Äôs process of self-discovery and inner growth. Sukhyang receives the help of diverse beings‚Äîincluding a turtle, a man named Hwa Deokjin, an elderly woman named Yi Hwajeong, a dog, and a deer‚Äîand by empathizing and interacting with them, she is able to overcome her trials and ordeals. In this sense, Sukhyang jeon sketches a picture of humanity as a being that communicates with the world in order to give and receive help. Moreover, Sukhyang‚Äôs story of suffering is very similar to that of Yeongchae, a female character in Yi Kwangsu‚Äôs Mujeong. In Mujeong, Yeongchae‚Äôs home is ruined and she is forced to go to her grandparents‚Äô home. There, she is abused in numerous ways and falsely accused of stealing, causing her to leave and disguise herself as a man. This scene in particular resembles how Sukhyang was separated from her family due to war, adopted into Jang Seungsang‚Äôs home, and then chased out for being falsely accused of stealing, upon which she was forced to disguise herself as a man. Moreover, both Sukhyang jeon and Mujeong feature a dog that accompanies the female protagonist in their wanderings, as well as a scene where the female protagonist reunites with her betrothed. In this manner, Mujeong can be seen as utilizing and building upon the narrative structure and popular influence and mass appeal of Sukhyang jeon.  Texts  There are numerous extant versions of Sukhyang jeon, including a handwritten manuscript in Korean, a woodblock print edition in Korean made in Seoul, a handwritten manuscript in classical Chinese, an edition printed with movable type in Korean, a Japanese translation, as well as an edition stored in Japan. A total of 56 extant copies currently exist, implying the great popularity of Sukhyang jeon. In general, there are no great differences in terms of content between the editions, and it is presumed that the original version was written in Korean.

He fought in the Fenian Rising of 1867, and was the secretary of the IRB in Hospital, County Limerick. He was the patriarch of the prominent Irish republican Crowley family of Ballylanders, and the father of the longest hunger strikers in history, Peter William Crowley and John Crowley, and the Fianna F√°il Politician Tadhg Crowley.  Early life  He was baptised on 31 July 1847 to James Crowley and Bridget Dwyer of Elton, in the parish of Knockainey, County Limerick. His parents had been married two years prior, and his sponsors were Thomas Dwyer and his grandmother Bridget Dwyer (n√©e Ashe). He was the second eldest of eight siblings and grew up on an acre of land on the banks of the river Morningstar, his father being a herdsman.Griffith's Valuation, 1851  Fenian activities  Crowley joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) prior to 1867 and took part in the Fenian Rising of 1867. He also was the secretary of the IRB in Hospital, County Limerick. He would never lose his Irish nationalist beliefs, carrying them down to his children in the future.  Crowley Drapery and Marriage  Crowley had founded the Crowley Drapery in Ballylanders, which still exists today, by the time of his marriage on 19 February 1887 to Ellen Ryan of Killeen. He served as the village's post master and ran the telegram, however these duties would be removed from him three decades in the future as the British found out he had been reading the messages to pass on information to the IRB. People came from far and wide to buy clothes for all occasions from the drapery, and his wife Ellen would often travel to London to purchase the latest fashions. Timothy Crowley and Ellen Ryan had nine children together: James Joseph Crowley (1889-1894), Tadhg Crowley (1890-1969), John Crowley (1891-1942), Patrick Joseph Andrew Crowley (1893-1963), Mark Joseph Crowley (1894-1957), James Michael Crowley (1896-1944), Michael Thomas Crowley (1898-1952), Peter William Crowley (1900-1963) and Bridget Mary Crowley (1902-1983). The Crowleys of Ballylanders  Irish War of Independence  By the start of the Irish War of Independence, Crowley and all of his sons were in the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the Irish Volunteers, and the Irish Republican Army, with the exception of his son Patrick, who had become a priest and gone to serve in Montana in the United States. His daughter Bridget was in Cumann na mBan. In 1916, the Crowleys were advised to resign from these organisations publicly, which they did, though they remained active in them. It was around this time that Crowley lost the position of village postmaster as the British feared that they were reading their top secret letters and telegrams, which they were. In July 1920, Crowley , at that point 72, ambushed a patrol of Royal Irish Constabulary members with his sons and took them prisoner. It was later that month that the British army returned and engaged in a shootout with the Crowleys at 3 am at their drapery. This firefight ended with the drapery being set on fire and the Crowleys arrested. The British later came back and blew up the drapery, reducing it to smoldering ruins and leaving around one million euros worth of damage in today's money. Crowley was not brought to trial due to his advanced age, though there was much discussion among the British government over whether to reimburse Crowley's money after his drapery was destroyed. Eventually it was decided not to, with British intelligence saying that, \\"despite his advanced age, he is the most dangerous man in the Galtees, and any funds given to him would be used without a doubt in the murder of the Crown's forces\\". While Crowley avoided imprisonment, his sons did not. Tadhg and Michael were imprisoned in England, while John and Peter ended up in Cork County Gaol, where they undertook a hunger strike of 94 days along with some others. This was the longest hunger strike in history, lasting from 11 August to 12 November 1920, and was at the same time as Terence MacSwiney's hunger strike in which he died.  Death  He did not live for much longer after his sons' imprisonment, passing away from sudden heart failure on 19 October 1921 at the age of 74 in the home of his sister-in-law's husband, John Culhane, whom they were staying with in Glin after the destruction of the Crowley Drapery. He is buried in Knockainey along with his wife, and sons John and James. The Crowley Drapery has since been rebuilt and still exists today.

Authorship  Sinmirok was first published in 1861 as a banggakbon, a book privately printed for commercial purposes. The author is unknown.  Plot  Hong Gyeong-nae (Ê¥™ÊôØ‰æÜ) was born in Yonggang, Pyeongan Province. From a young age, Hong proved himself to be exceptionally talented. However, the Royal Court at the time discriminated against people from the Pyeongan, Hwanghae, and Hamgyong Provinces‚Äîrarely, if ever, appointing them to positions within the administration. Deeply unhappy with this situation, Hong plotted a rebellion with his fellow comrades, Kim Sayong (ÈáëÂ£´Áî®), U Gunchik (Á¶πÂêõÂâá), and Lee Jecho (ÊùéÊøüÂàù). He gathered around a thousand people in support and led them to Dabokdong, a place in Pyeongan Province that he made his base, where they gathered weapons and strategized. Coincidentally, that year was a bad harvest year for the farmers and the corrupt officials continued their tyrannical behavior as the people grew increasingly resentful and angry. Seizing this ripe opportunity, Hong Gyeong-nae deemed himself the leader of the dissatisfied people and made Kim Sayong his second commander and U Gunchik as his tactician and together, they led an attack on Gasan county. There, they murdered the county governor as he attempted to repel their forces. Hong Gyeong-nae forced open the storehouse and distributed grain among the people, prompting numerous peasants to join Hong in support. With the help of his subordinate commanders, Hong also seized the neighboring counties. Numerous counties, including Jeongju, Taecheon, Cheolsan, and Yongcheon, joined Hong Gyeong-nae‚Äôs peasant army. Kim Iksun, then the leader of the town of Seoncheon and the future grandfather of Kim Satgat, who would become one of the most famous wandering poets of Korea, also surrendered to Hong‚Äôs forces. Though he could have immediately attacked the town of Anju (located in Pyeongan Province), Hong decided to first attack Bakcheon and Yeongbyeon and only afterwards, advance to Anju. However, his two subordinate commanders adamantly believed that they needed to attack Anju first in order to succeed and was dismayed by a plan that they were sure would lead to utter failure and plotted to assassinate Hong in the middle of night. Although the assassination attempt ultimately failed, Hong sustained grave injuries and their plans suffered serious setbacks. In that time, the government forces were able to re-organize and arm themselves and set out on a fierce counterattack. Hong led his army and penetrated the fortress at Jeongju where they begin their siege. Although the government army used all their strength in their attempts to recapture the Jeongju fortress, they ultimately failed. As the siege lengthens, the peasant army‚Äôs food supplies become depleted and morale significantly drops. Eventually, the government army decide to dig underground tunnels beneath the fortress and use gunpowder to explode the fortress, finally succeeding in invading the fortress as it collapses. Upon entering the fortress, the government forces conduct a large massacre, killing anyone they counter with an inestimable number of casualties. Together with his close associates, the injured Hong Gyeong-nae attempts to escape, but is ultimately shot dead. However, there are still those who believe that he survived and is still alive.  Features and Significance  Traditional Korean novels that center around Hong Gyeong-nae‚Äôs rebellion include Sinmirok , Hong Gyeong-nae jeon (ÌôçÍ≤ΩÎûòÏ†Ñ The Tale of Hong Gyeong-nae) and Hong Gyeong-nae silgi (ÌôçÍ≤ΩÎûòÏã§Í∏∞ The True Record of Hong Gyeong-nae). Among these, Sinmirok is classified as the work that narrates the events surrounding Hong Gyeong-nae‚Äôs rebellion from the perspective of the government forces. Hong Gyeong-nae silgi also narrates the events from the government forces‚Äô perspective, but still portrays Hong Gyeong-nae as a hero, while Hong Gyeong-nae jeon is considered the work that most strongly presents Hong Gyeong-nae as being on the side of the people and the masses. Sinmirok can be considered one of the representative works that demonstrates the flow of historical changes brought by the development of Korean publishing in the latter half of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the government army‚Äôs perspective is greatly reflected, the very fact that a book dealing with a riot in Seoul was published also shows that the general masses in those days were also acutely interested in societal changes. As large quantities of information and knowledge circulated through the popularity of hangeul, the Korean alphabet, and commercial publishing, they also became the catalyst for revolution. In 1862, the year after Sinmirok was published, the Jinju Peasants Uprising also broke out.  Archival Materials  Along with Sinmirok , there are two other works that describe this incident: Hong Gyeong- nae jeon and Hong Gyeong-nae silgi.

History Throughout the 19th century, Oelenberg Abbey in Haut-Rhin was a double monastery with masculine and feminine communities. These two communities were founded in 1815 and 1825 by monks and nuns who fled from France to Kleinburlo and Rosenthal, Westphalia during the Revolutionary and Imperial periods. In 1825, the 34 nuns settled in the monastery that the monks built when they came back from exile. However, both monasteries prospered and founded several daughter houses, especially in Germany and Benelux. The commnuties grew (84 nuns in 1893), so Oelenberg became too small. 80 nuns settled near Ergersheim, Bas-Rhin in the Abbey of Our Lady of Altbronn, named after a local pilgrimage that has existed since 1397. The abbey was canonically approved on July 8, 1927. Houses The house of Ergersheim is a former noble property built by the Simonis family in 1826. It is located on a 4-hectare land. The building was transformed into a monastery by architect Dacheux. The foundation stone was laid on September 9, 1894. On December 3, 2009, the community which had become too small for the Altbronn site (20 nuns in 2000, 17 in 2009) and which was disturbed by the demographic growth of the village and the growing noise, decided to sell the abbey and to move to Baumgarten Abbey in the nearby village of Bernardvill√©.

It serves as a memorial to the Red Russians killed in engagements during the Russian Civil War, against the White Russians and intervening Allied forces during the North Russia intervention, as well as those that died in captivity. It was designed by the engineer AV Savchenko and constructed using funds collected from local residents. The construction took two months, and it was undertaken by the ‚ÄúMurmanskzhilstroy‚Äù trust.  History  During the Russian Civil War the city of Murmansk was in White Russian territory, as such any Red Russians who were found were jailed in Yokang prison, a number of which died. Following the withdrawal of Allied troops after the failed Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, the White forces mostly collapsed, allowing the Red forces to reintergrate the city into the USSR. At least 136 people were buried in waste ground in the centre of the city and seven years later it was decided that a memorial would be built over this mass grave. A statue of Lenin was also planned but was never built. But Five Corners Square was erected around the monument.  Description  The monument is a three tier raised platform located in the centre of Five Corners Square surrounded by a low post-and- chain style fence, it is made of reinforced concrete that has been painted white. On the lowest tier stands a pedestal bearing a plaque which reads; The stairs to the second tier are located to the rear of the monument and feature a handrail which extends onto the platform. The stairs to the third tier are facing the front of the monument and begin on the second tier, like the steps to the second tier they feature a handrail which extends onto the platform.

Steleopteron deichmuelleri The family was described by the Austrian paleoentomologist Anton Handlirsch in 1906 on the basis of the fossilised exoskeleton Steleopteron deichmuelleri. Hence, the type genus is Steleopteron. Handlirsch assigned the family to the Epiproctophora. In 2001, the family was excuded from the Epiproctophora and transferred into a suborder of winged damselflies, Zygoptera. Until 2018, it had been believed that Steleopteridae became extinct in the Jurassic, but the discovery of Steleopteron cretacicus showed that the family may have become extinct as late as the Cretaceous.

Early life  Nobu Jo was born in Ehime prefecture on October 18, 1872. She was the daughter of a doctor. She was educated at a Christian mission school in Matsuyama. One of Nobu Jo's suicide prevention signboards, placed alongside railroad tracks near Kobe; from a 1921 publication.  Career  Jo was founder and head of the Kobe Woman's Welfare Association (Kobe Fujin Dojokai). She was known for her suicide prevention campaign. Beginning in 1916 near Suma, she placed large, well-lit signs in high-risk places, including train stations and bridges. The signs advised suicidal visitors to stop, to wait, and to visit Jo's home or office, if they were experiencing despair. Jo believed that many suicidal people in the city experienced stress, poor health, poverty, and social isolation, and that these underlying issues might be resolved or relieved without loss of life. She received letters thanking her for the signage, and was credited with saving thousands of lives. Jo and her organization also started a kindergarten, and assisted domestic violence survivors. She sheltered hundreds of women from abuse in a Kobe residence she established for the purpose, and once telling an angry man with a knife, \\"You may have your wife back just as soon as you become a decent man and deserve her.\\" She helped women arrange education, employment, housing, travel, and childcare, but also offered spiritual guidance and counseling. \\"Her efforts are untiring, her sympathies wide, her methods effectual, as she carries on her work of saving women from suicide\\", declared an Australian newspaper in 1936. Her work continued through World War II and into the postwar era, even adding a retirement home for older women.

He graduated from college in Muncie, Indiana, in 1915 and briefly worked at a newspaper before moving to Hollywood, where he worked at first as a technical director for filmmakers like D. W. Griffith and Wesley Ruggles. By 1919, he had started his own production company ‚Äî James B. Leong Productions, later known as the Wah Ming Motion Picture Company ‚Äî to show Chinese life as it really was. (He had grown tired of seeing Chinese people portrayed as kidnappers and assassins on the screen.) Under this banner, he wrote and directed the 1921 film Lotus Blossom. He said he planned to write and direct four films a year, but this doesn't seem to have come to fruition. (A planned follow-up, The Unbroken Promise, doesn't seem to have been filmed.) Instead, he appears to have taken on work as an actor: Over the ensuing decades, he'd play more dozens of smaller roles in Hollywood films, and also continue to work as a technical director and dialect coach. He also appears to have earned a good deal of money as a grower of silk crops in the 1940s. He married Agatha Tarwater in 1934; the pair had a son together. Leong became a U.S. citizen in 1958.

It was destroyed during the Wars of Religion. History The abbey was founded in the late 11th-century and followed the Rule of Saint Benedict. The establishment was mentioned in 1114. The name Ardorel possibly meant \\"ploughed land\\". In 1124, under the influence of Bernard Ato IV's wife Cecil of Provence, monks from Cadouin Abbey founded a Cistercian monastery at Ardorel under the supervision of abbot √âlie. Little is known about the Benedictines who settled there before the Cistercians. Oddly, Ardorel was listed as a daughter of Pontigny very late, in 1147. Cecil of Provence made numerous donations to the abbey, and wished to be buried there. After √âlie went back to Cadouin, the first abbot of Ardorel was Foulque. Cecil's donations to the abbey were made either directly or indirectly through her vassals, the lords of Vintrou, Hautpoul and Miraval. The abbey was so well-known that even some Cathars like Jordan of Saissac, the son of Bertrand of Saissac, made donations to the abbey in 1283. Very soon, the prospering abbey founded two daughter houses: Valmagne Abbey in 1138 ‚Äìwhich thrived on its turn with up to 300 monks‚Äì and Sira in 1139. Moreover, Jau Abbey became a daughter house of Ardorel in 1162, even though it was founded earlier. In the 14th century, the reputation and the prosperity of Ardorel started declining, especially when the commendatory regime was set up. In 1586, during the French Wars of Religion, a relative of the abbot of Ardorel who secretly converted to Calvinism slipped inside the monastery and opened the doors for spadassins to slaughter the monks and throw their corpses into a well. A few survivors, who had left the monastery earlier, resumed monastic life in a grange in Lempaut owned by Ardorel. The once prosperous abbey is now ruined. According to Janauschek, Ardorel Abbey had the Order number CCLXXIV (274).

Tripp Jr and the Watkins brothers, first built in 1981. The Watkins 36 is a development of the Portman 36 and was developed into the center cockpit Watkins 36C. Development The silent partner in Auroraglas purchased the rights to the center-cockpit Tripp- designed Coronado 35 and Columbia 36 designs from Columbia Yachts and the tooling was modified to become the aft-cockpit Portman 36. That design was produced by Auroraglas and then Watkins Yachts, in Clearwater, Florida, United States after the companies were merged. The Portman 36 was then modified by Watkins to become the aft-cockpit Watkins 36 and finally developed into the center-cockpit Watkins 36C. Production The Watkins 36 was produced from 1981 to 1983. During its production run the Watkins 36 became the flagship of the company product line and its features were incorporated in the newer and smaller boat designs that followed it, including the opening ports, Bomar hatches, through bolted flanged hull joints and the sloping cabin top. Design The Watkins 36 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The design's hull is molded in a single piece using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving, as well as multidirectional chopped strand fibers (MSCF). The keel is integral to the hull and the ballast is internal to the keel. The deck and the cockpit and also moulded in pone piece, also using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving with MCSF. Plywood coring is employed for the cabin top, deck, seat and the cockpit sole for stiffness. The hull-to-deck joint is flanged, glued and then screwed into place. There is an aluminum toe rail, stainless steel through-bolted into place, bonding the toe rail, deck and the hull. An anchor well is located at the bow with a hawspipe leading the anchor chain into the \\"V\\" berth locker. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a British Perkins Engines diesel engine of for docking and maneuvering. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . Later boats delivered had . The boat was factory delivered with many equipment items as standard, including a pressurized water system, a shower, ten opening ports and two hatches, a folding dining table in the main cabin and provisions for shore power. The design layout has a bow \\"V\\" berth and an owner's stateroom aft. The galley is located aft, in the passageway to the owner's state room and is fitted with a double sink, a 12 volt refrigerator and a three-burner propane-fired stove with an oven. The head is aft and accessible from stateroom and the main cabin. The main cabin has of headroom and is finished with hand-rubbed teak trim, with the bulkheads and cabinetry made from teak veneer on plywood. The early boats delivered had a carpeted main cabin sole, with later deliveries with a teak and holly veneer sole over plywood. The companionway stairs tip up, providing access to the engine.

Authorship, date, and title  Rissh≈ç Ankokuron was written by the monk Nichiren. It dates to the first year of Bun'≈ç (1260). Nichiren presented it as a petition to the regent (shikken) H≈çj≈ç Tokiyori, but it was ignored, and brought the anger of the authorities down on Nichiren. The title Rissh≈ç Ankokuron translates to \\"Establishing Right Doctrine and Peace of the Nation\\", and is occasionally abbreviated to Ankokuron.  Contents  The work consists of a single book in ten paragraphs. It takes the form of a dialogue between \\"a visitor\\" and \\"the master\\", and is written in kanbun (Classical Chinese). It propounds the idea that placing one's faith in the Lotus Sutra protect the safety of the nation. Nichiren invokes the fear of natural disasters, famine and plague and quotes from a variety of Buddhist sutras to demonstrate that the reason for such problems is the failure of the sovereign to embrace the correct religious doctrine. He attacks the Pure Land school of H≈çnen as a sinister cult (ÈÇ™ÂÆó jash≈´) and emphasizes the need to reject such false doctrines and place one's faith in the Lotus Sutra. Nichiren also predicted a foreign invasion, which a prediction which came true more than a decade later when Japan was invaded by the forces of Kublai Khan. End≈ç Asai, in his article on the work for the Encyclopedia Nipponica remarks that because of its status as a polemic against the religious practices of the nation, it lacks an explanation of the causes that lead to its conclusions, and recommends reading it in combination with Shugo Kokkaron (ÂÆàË≠∑ÂõΩÂÆ∂Ë´ñ), which Nichiren had published the previous year.

Location View of nave and chancel The Convent of Bom Jesus dos Perd√µes was built on the first range of hills beyond the city center of Salvador. It sits on a narrow street, Rua dos Perd√µes below the Largo do Santo Antonio, a public square, and both the Church of Santo Antonio Al√©m do Carmo and Forte de Santo Ant√¥nio Al√©m do Carmo. The church and convent sit in a dense urban area of small houses and sobrados built at the end of the 19th century. History Archbishop Lu√≠s √Ålvares gave permission for the construction of a small church and convent as early as 1732. Domingos do Rosario and Francisco Chagas built a chapel and dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy and a small convent dedicated to the Lord Good Jesus of Pardons. The L-shaped convent is the oldest part of the building. The chapel and convent were expanded in 1789 by Theod√≥sio Gon√ßalves da Silva and his wife Ana de Souza Queiroz. The expansion included 40 new cells, a sacristy, tower, a refectory, kitchen, lobby, and bathrooms. This constructed continued until the early 19th century. The chapel was gilded in 1819. The convent was greatly modified in the 20th century; its early layout is now difficult to discern. The building underwent numerous reforms in the 20th century. The building was used by the Legi√£o Brasileira de Assist√™ncia in 1943, and a small pavilion was built in 1950. The painted in 1950, under the permission of IPHAN. The side wall and roofs of the nave and chancel were stabilized between 1959 and 1961; stabilization works were carried out again in 1962. The exterior was again painted in 1974 by IPHAN, but is now in a state of advanced decay. Structure The chapel has a simple fa√ßade with a single portal with fluted pilasters, apparently modified in the 19th century in the Neoclassical style. The portal, which no longer aligns with the building after modifications in the 19th century, has a pediment with volutes and a cross at center; its design was inspired by that of the Church of Saint Michael, located to the south below the Pelourinho. Similar pediments can be found at Solar Ferr√£o, also in the Pelourinho; the building of the Museum of Art of Bahia and the Casa de Ora√ß√£o dos Jesu√≠tas The nave of the chapel has a single aisle on one side. Tribunes are along the single aisle with two choirs to the rear of the structure. The two-tiered choir resembles that of the chapel of the Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia. The convent has a high altar that dates to the late 18th-century. Two altars are placed to either side of the chancel arch. The nave ceiling and choir ceiling paintings are attributed to Jos√© Te√≥filo de Jesus. The convent has three stories: one built below street level with stories above. The convent has a narrow, rectangular courtyard. Protected status The Chapel of Our Lady of Help was listed as a historic structure by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage in 1943. It was listed in the Book of Historical Works no. 264.

Life  Keshick was born in 1946 in Charlevoix, Michigan, as a member of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. She descended from many generations of Odawa/Ojibwa quillworkers. Her great-aunt Anna Odei‚Äômin is one of the best- known WPA Arts and Crafts Project artists. Keshick became an apprentice of Susan Shagonaby (daughter of Mary Ann Kiogima) in 1969. Shagonaby taught Keshick \\"from scratch\\", using cleaned quills fresh off a rotting porcupine. Shagonaby later became the director of the Chief Andrew J. Blackbird House. Keshick began quilling full-time in the 1980s. She resides in Petoskey, Michigan.  Work  Keshick is a basket-maker and quillworker. She uses porcupine quills, sometimes supplemented by other natural materials such as birch bark and sweetgrass in the decorative articles she creates. It can take a year for her to acquire the quills she needs for a particular work of art. Her designs incorporate traditional elements from her culture as well as animal and plant designs passed down through the generations. She does not dye the quills, relying on subtle differences in their color to provide shadowing effects. She is known for innovating a method of laying the quills to create dynamic textures that give life to her compositions and the animals and birds that she features. Keshick taught her children, who continue to make quill art. On teaching her art, Keshick has said, Her work is featured in the collection of the Michigan State University Museum.  Awards and recognition  Keshick received a 1992 Michigan Heritage Award, and was a 2014 National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow.

He overthrew the Kachari Kingdom and revolted against the East India Company with the assistance of the local peasantry. Biography Kachari palace ruins at Khaspur. The honorific title Mirza was added before his name and Baig as a suffix. This was the historical naming convention for the descendants of the Mughal dynasty. The Mughal Empire was defeated by the East India Company in the Battle of Plassey of 1757, and an anti-British sentiment was common among the natives of the Indian subcontinent and especially those related to and being descended from the noble dynasty such as Reza. His parents were Iranians and he was a follower of Shia Islam. Reza was from the Sylhet region. The Collector of Sylhet in the late 18th century, Robert Lindsay, described the Sylhet region as a \\"hotbed of resistance\\". Claiming to be a Sufi saint, Reza gained the support of thousands of peasants, fakirs and ryots. It is said he also gained support from Shams ud-Daulah, the Naib Nazim of Dhaka. He made an announcement calling for jihad against the British, who he preached were the reasons of the problems that the peasants were facing. In 1799, Reza invaded the Kachari Kingdom, which was referred to as his \\"hijrat\\", in order to gain a larger following before facing the British in a war. He claimed to be the Mahdi (promised messiah), twelfth imam, promising to free the peasants from oppression. By making a deal with the Nagas and Kukis who were allied with the Kachari Raja, he was able to convince them to join his side. Reza's force proceeded to defeat all the barqandaz (subalterns) sent by the Raja of the Kachari Kingdom, and expelled the King, Raja Krishnachandra Narayan at Khaspur to the nearby hills. After taking over the throne, many Bengali Hindus converted and gave allegiance to him. Here, Reza declared independence of Sylhet from the British. He also invited zamindars and other landowners to join him in his mission, promising them more land if they can liberate their country from the British. He then ordered his followers not to pay their taxes to the Company. Following this, Reza sent 1,200 men to attack the nearby Bondassye thana (now Badarpur, Assam) of the East India Company, administered by a havildar and his eight sepoys. He is also said to have attacked the Badarpur Fort. The Kachari army then arrived with 300 men and two grasshopper cannons but were defeated by Reza's forces. During this time, the British were able to gain a reinforcement of 70 sepoys. The army ended up in a brawl between the Kacharis, and the British sepoys eventually drove both groups back leading to 90 deaths in the Kachari side. Reza escaped but was later arrested on 14 July being sent to a prison in Calcutta.Sreehatter Itibritta ‚Äì Purbangsho (A History of Sylhet), Part 2, Volume 1, Chapter 1, Achyut Charan Choudhury; Publisher: Mustafa Selim; Source publication, 2004 He was given lifetime imprisonment for his crimes.

While large models (such as very deep neural networks or ensembles of many models) have higher knowledge capacity than small models, this capacity might not be fully utilized. It can be computationally just as expensive to evaluate a model even if it utilizes little of its knowledge capacity. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a large model to a smaller model without loss of validity. As smaller models are less expensive to evaluate, they can be deployed on less powerful hardware (such as a mobile device).Hinton et al. (2015) Knowledge distillation has been successfully used in several applications of machine learningYim et al. (2017) such as object detection,Chen et al. (2017) acoustic models,Asami et al. (2017) and natural language processing.Cui et al. (2017)Yu et al. (2017)  The concept of distillation  Transferring the knowledge from a large to a small model needs to somehow teach to the latter without loss of validity. If both models are trained on the same data, the small model may have insufficient capacity to learn a concise knowledge representation given the same computational resources and same data as the large model. However, some information about a concise knowledge representation is encoded in the pseudolikelihoods assigned to its output: when a model correctly predicts a class, it assigns a large value to the output variable corresponding to such class, and smaller values to the other output variables. The distribution of values among the outputs for a record provides information on how the large model represents knowledge. Therefore the goal of economical deployment of a valid model can be achieved by training only the large model on the data, exploiting its better ability to learn concise knowledge representations, and then distilling such knowledge into the smaller model, that would not be able to learn it on its own, by training it to learn the soft output of the large model.Hinton et al. (2015) Model compression, a methodology to compress the knowledge of multiple models into a single neural network, was introduced in 2006. Compression was achieved by training a smaller model on large amounts of pseudo-data labelled by a higher-performing ensemble, optimising to match the logit of the compressed model to the logit of the ensemble.Bucilu«é et al. (2006) Knowledge distillation is a generalisation of such approach, introduced by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in 2015, in a preprint that formulated the concept and showed some results achieved in the task of image classification.Hinton et al. (2015)  Formulation  Given a large model as a function of the vector variable \\\\mathbf{x}, trained for a specific classification task, typically the final layer of the network is a softmax in the form : y_i(\\\\mathbf{x}t) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i(\\\\mathbf{x})}{t}}}{\\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{z_j(\\\\mathbf{x})}{t}}} where t is a parameter called temperature, that for a standard softmax is normally set to 1. The softmax operator converts the logit values z_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) to pseudo-probabilities, and higher values of temperature have the effect of generating a softer distribution of pseudo-probabilities among the output classes. Knowledge distillation consists of training a smaller network, called distilled model, on a dataset called transfer set (different than the dataset used to train the large model) using as loss function the cross entropy between the output of the distilled model \\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{x}t) and the output \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{y}}(\\\\mathbf{x}t) produced by the large model on the same record (or the average of the individual outputs, if the large model is an ensemble), using a high value of softmax temperature t for both models : E(\\\\mathbf{x}t) = -\\\\sum_i \\\\hat{y}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}t) \\\\log y_i(\\\\mathbf{x}t) . In this context, a high temperature increases the entropy of the output, and therefore provides more information to learn for the distilled model compared to hard targets, at the same time reducing the variance of the gradient between different records and therefore allowing higher learning rates. If ground truth is available for the transfer set, the process can be strengthened by adding to the loss the cross entropy between the output of the distilled model (computed with t = 1) and the known label \\\\bar{y} : E(\\\\mathbf{x}t) = -t^2 \\\\sum_i \\\\hat{y}_i(\\\\mathbf{x}t) \\\\log y_i(\\\\mathbf{x}t) - \\\\sum_i \\\\bar{y}_i \\\\log y_i(\\\\mathbf{x}1) where the component of the loss with respect to the large model is weighted by a factor of t^2 since, as the temperature increases, the gradient of the loss with respect to the model weights scales by a factor of \\\\frac{1}{t^2}.  Relationship with model compression  Under the assumption that the logits have zero mean, it is possible to show that model compression is a special case of knowledge distillation. The gradient of the knowledge distillation loss E with respect to the logit of the distilled model z_i is given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} E &= -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\sum_i \\\\hat{y}_i \\\\log y_i  &= \\\\sum_i-\\\\hat{y}_i \\\\frac{1}{y_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} y_i  &= -\\\\hat{y}_i \\\\frac{1}{y_i} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial z_i} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{t}}}{\\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{z_j}{t}}} + ....  &= -\\\\hat{y}_i \\\\frac{1}{y_i} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{t} e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{t}} \\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{z_j}{t}} - \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left( e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{t}} \\\\right)^2} {\\\\left( \\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{z_j}{t}} \\\\right)^2} \\\\right)  &= -\\\\hat{y}_i \\\\frac{1}{y_i} \\\\left( \\\\frac{y_i}{t} - \\\\frac{y_i^2}{t} \\\\right)  &= \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left( y_i - \\\\hat{y}_i \\\\right) + ...  &= \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{z_i}{t}}}{\\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{z_j}{t}}} - \\\\frac{e^{\\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}_i}{t}}}{\\\\sum_j e^{\\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}_j}{t}}} \\\\right)  \\\\end{align} where \\\\hat{z}_i are the logits of the large model. For large values of t this can be approximated as : \\\\frac{1}{t} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1 + \\\\frac{z_i}{t}}{N + \\\\sum_j \\\\frac{z_j}{t}} - \\\\frac{1 + \\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}_i}{t}}{N + \\\\sum_j \\\\frac{\\\\hat{z}_j}{t}} \\\\right) and under the zero-mean hypothesis \\\\sum_j z_j = \\\\sum_j \\\\hat{z}_j = 0 it becomes \\\\frac{z_i - \\\\hat{z}_i}{NT^2} , which is the derivative of \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( z_i - \\\\hat{z}_i \\\\right)^2, i.e. the loss is equivalent to matching the logits of the two models, as done in model compression.

The park includes a stage for performances and areas for sitting. It is also home to a large, historic clock which had previously been located at Union Station. History The park was created in 1982 with an urban development grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 2013, the city, led by Mayor Michael F. Brennan and City Manager Jon Jennings sought to sell the park to Rockbridge Capital, which was renovating the adjacent hotel. However, residents (led by the Friends of Congress Square Park) drafted an ordinance which prevented the sale until a vote could occur. After collecting a sufficient number of signatures, the sale was postponed until after a June 2014 referendum. In that election, voters endorsed their initiative, which prevented the sale of the public and added protections to the further sale of public spaces. Since 2013, the Friends of Congress Square Park has organized events, raised funds on behalf of, and maintained the park. In 2018, the city received a $33,000 grant for a public art project in the park.

Beaded suitcases and valises that she gave as gifts are now part of art collections and exhibitions.  Early life  Nellie Two Bear Gates was born in 1854 on the traditional land of the Yanktonai Ih√°≈ãkt»üu≈ãwa≈ãna Dakota which lay between the Missouri and James River in what is now North and South Dakota. Her Dakota name was Mahpiya Bogawin, meaning \\"Gathering of Clouds Woman.\\" She was the eldest child of Chief Two Bears (d. 1878 or 1879) and his fourth wife, Honkakagewin. At the age of seven, Nellie was taken from her family and placed in a Catholic boarding school at St. Joseph, Missouri where she stayed for eleven years. At school Nellie excelled academically and became fluent in English and French. In 1863 when she was nine and still at boarding school, her family's village was attacked and destroyed at the Battle of Whitestone Hill. Her father Chief Two Bears was one of the signers of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) and settled at Standing Rock Reservation. At 18 Nellie returned to live with her family at Standing Rock after which she exclusively spoke the Dakota language.  Family  Nellie married Frank Gates (b. 1853) in 1878. Together, they had seven children: Frank (b. 1878), Mary Ann (b. 1884, m. J. A. Archambault 1907), Mollie (b. 1885), Josephine (b. January 24, 1888), Catherine (b. 1889), John (b. 1891), and Annie (b. unknown). In 1946, her daughter, Josephine Gates Kelly, became the first woman in the United States to be elected chair of a tribal council. Kelly was the tribal chair of Standing Rock Reservation from 1946 to 1951. Kelly may also be the first female delegate to a Republican National Convention. Her great-granddaughter is author Susan Power.  Artwork and exhibitions  Suitcase (1880‚Äì1910) Suitcase (1880‚Äì1910) is housed at the Minneapolis Institute of Art. Suitcase depicts a wedding scene and was a gift for Gates' relative, Ida Claymore, in honor of her marriage. Pictorial Valise (c. 1903), is part of the Hirschfield Family Collection and was displayed as part of the Artists of the Earth and Sky exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was created as a gift for her daughter Josephine at the time of her graduation from the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, and depicts Chief Two Bears' actions in the Battle of Whitestone Hill in 1863. Beaded Valise (c. 1907) is a traveling case showing pictographic designs of mounted warriors. It was a gift for her son-in-law, J. A. Archambault, as a wedding present. It has been exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution, the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, and the Eiteljorg Museum.

Early career √âtienne Cochard de Chastenoye came to Saint-Domingue in 1697, and served without interruption until 1749. He was a major in L√©og√¢ne in 1713 and in Le Cap (Cap-Ha√Øtien) in 1714. He was the king's lieutenant in Le Cap in 1717. In 1720 he was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In 1723 Chastenoye succeeded Jean-Pierre de Charitte as governor of Saint Croix and Le Cap. Chastenoye and his son were both governors of La Cap and lieutenants to the governor general of Saint-Domingue, and both lived in Le Cap. His son was Achille de Cochard de Chastenoye, Marquis de Chastenoye. Interim governor general Antoine Gabriel de Vienne de Busserrolles, Governor-General of Saint-Domingue, died at Fort-Dauphin (Fort-Libert√©) on 4 February 1732. Etienne de Chastenoye served as interim governor from 4 February 1732 to 27 October 1732. The new governor, Pierre, marquis de Fayet was received on 27 October 1732. In 1737 Chastenoye was appointed lieutenant to the Governor General of Saint-Domingue en 1737. Fayet died in Petit-Go√¢ve on 11 March 1737. Chastenoye was again interim governor from 11 July 1737 to 11 November 1737. Charles Brunier, Marquis de Larnage, was received on 11 November 1737. He died at Petit-Go√¢ve on 19 November 1746. Chastenoye was interim governor for the third time between 17 November 1746 and 12 August 1748. In 1747 there were increasingly poor relations between France and the States-General of the Netherlands. Charles de Tubi√®res de Caylus arrested the Dutch traders at Martinique, and Chastonoye reluctantly followed suit. This was a problem to the colonists, who depended on the Dutch for many of their supplies. It was partly solved by Dutch traders who now claimed to be Danish, and thus eligible to trade. On 22 March 1748 a squadron of British ships under Admiral Charles Knowles entered the harbor of Port Saint Louis, which was guarded by an island castle with high stone walls, 78 guns, 310 troops and a company of black gunners. In the Battle of Saint-Louis-du-Sud, the British ships anchored under the ramparts and fired steadily for three hours, causing 160 casualties to the garrison. Chastenoye, who was commanding the fort, sued for terms. The British seized four ships, blew up the fort and left on 30 March 1748. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle of 24 April 1748 ended the War of the Austrian Succession. Chastenoye was succeeded on 12 August 1748 by Joseph- Hyacinthe de Rigaud de Vaudreuil. On 17 January 1749 Chastenoye wrote to the minister Jean-Fr√©d√©ric Ph√©lypeaux, Count of Maurepas pointing out the commercial losses of the planters during the recent war and the expense of supplying blacks to work on the defenses, and calling for protection for their trade. His son, Achille Cochart, marquis de Chastenoye, was appointed governor of La Cap on 1 November 1749. According to M√©d√©ric Louis √âlie Moreau de Saint- M√©ry, Chatenoye earned the respect of the officers and the confidence of the settlers everywhere in the course of his long career.

Designed by John Pinch the younger, it was built in 1837‚Äì38 and closed in 1983. The church, now a private residence, is a Grade II listed building. History Christ Church was erected as a chapel of ease to St John the Baptist in the parish of Midsomer Norton, at a time when the population of the parish had reached over 3,000. Although the parish church had been rebuilt in 1830‚Äì31, its centralised location made it difficult for some inhabitants to attend services. The proposed chapel of ease was intended to serve the inhabitants of Downside, Benter and Clapton, all of whom were two to four miles from the parish church. The Bishop of Bath and Wells donated a plot of land for the new church, and the plans were drawn up by John Pinch. Construction began in 1937, and the completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. George Henry Law, on 29 November 1838. Downside was made its own ecclesiastical parish on 4 July 1845, which contained Downside, Benter and Nettlebridge, and part of Chilcompton. Christ Church underwent restoration and reseating in 1897, which included replacing the pews with new ones of pitch pine, laying new flooring and adding new altar steps, choir stalls and a vestry. The work was carried out by Messrs. W. A. Catley and C. Hill of Midsomer Norton to the designs of Mr. W. F. Bird. The work cost ¬£200 and the church reopened on 21 November 1897. A new organ was gifted to the church by Miss Talbot of Bath and dedicated on 7 June 1899. The churchyard was extended in the same year to provide more burial space. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. George Kennion, on 24 June 1899. Christ Church was declared redundant on 1 July 1983. It was subsequently sold and used as a store from 1985 to 1995. Planning permission was granted in 1995 for the building's conversion into a single dwelling. Architecture Christ Church is built of Doulting stone, with a roof of tile and slate. It was designed to accommodate 272 persons and made up of a three- bay nave, chancel and west porch. A bellcote containing a single bell was built on the west end gable. A vestry was added to the church in 1907.

Like many of his Japanese contemporaries, in Hollywood, he was often cast as a villain. Biography According to contemporaneous reports, Kino had already established a career for himself in Japan on the stage before moving to San Francisco to work in a stock company and eventually Los Angeles to work in film. He was a founding member of the Japanese Photo Players' Association alongside performers like Sessue Hayakawa and Misao Seki. One of his biggest film roles was as Duck Sing in 1918's Little Red Decides. He said of his \\"evil\\" look in The Lure of Jade that even he was afraid to look in the mirror, and that he scared the cameramen on set; however, he was regarded as one of the nicest people in the business in real life.

This disease is painful to the cat, although it develops slowly over a longer period of time. Cats will usually demonstrate teary eye(s), squinting or closing of the eye(s), and covering of the third eyelid.  Presentation  The affected area of the cornea develops a brown discoloration. The area surrounding the sequestrum may have superficial ulceration. The corneal sequestrum is painful, and the cat may show this by squinting or closing the eye (blepharospasm).  Causes  The cause of corneal sequestra is unknown. A sequestrum in the cornea usually develops following long term (chronic) ulceration of the cornea. Feline viral rhinotracheitis (previously known as Feline herpes virus) is often found in cats with a corneal sequestrum.  Prevention  As the cause is not know, it is difficult to know what steps to take to prevent this from occurring. However, keeping the eyes clean and seeking veterinary attention if an eye is cut, scratched or irritated is advised.  Treatment  Lubricating eye drops are usually given in the first instance of feline corneal sequestra, yet if the eye continues to irritate the cat or becomes worse, surgical removal is usually required. Furthermore, once the removal of the corneal sequestrum is complete, cats will usually remain on lubricating eye drops for the rest of their lives. The disease often reoccurs in cats who have already experienced this problem. Epidemiology Any breed of cat may develop a corneal sequestrum, although Persians and Himalayans may be more suspceptable to developing sequestra than other breeds of cat.

It is the third-highest point of the Joffre Group, which is a subset of the Lillooet Ranges. It is situated east of Pemberton, and northeast of Lillooet Lake. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Matier, to the east. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Twin One Creek, both tributaries of the Lillooet River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1963 by C. Adam, T. Anderson, and G. Richardson. The mountain's name Slalok is the traditional name for the settlement of nearby Mount Currie. The name was officially adopted on June 11, 1979, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The mountain and its climate supports the Matier Glacier, Stonecrop Glacier, and Tszil Glacier on the northern slopes. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Slalok Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Slalok Mountain.

Her work was largely unknown until the early 21st century. Sully is best known today for colored-pencil triptychs and \\"personality portraits\\" which often depicted celebrities such as Amelia Earhart, Gertrude Stein, and Greta Garbo. Using abstract forms and symbols coupled with rich and mesmerizing colors and symmetry, many of her panels appear like a kaleidoscope. Her designs draw from and incorporate classic Native American designs ‚Äî specifically Navajo textiles or Plains parfleches, painted rawhide containers ‚Äî while also aligning with the Art Nouveau and Bauhaus movements. Although she was active in the early decades of the 20th century when Native American art and Art Nouveau were making a parallel climb into mainstream fine art exhibitions, Sully was considered revolutionary in marrying these two genres.  Biography  Susan Mable Deloria was born to father Tipi Sapa (Black Lodge), or Philip J. Deloria, and mother Mary Sully. She is the great-granddaughter of 19th century American portrait artist Thomas Sully, from whom she took her name. Her sister, Ella Cara Deloria, was an anthropologist with whom she traveled extensively throughout the United States, visiting many Native communities and observing the art that was a part of their daily lives. She also spent much of her time in New York City, taking inspiration from the thriving art scene there. Sully was raised in the Episcopal faith as her father was a minister. Her familiarity and experience with religion is depicted in several of her works. Sully died on August 29, 1963 in Omaha, Nebraska.  Artwork  Sully worked largely in triptychs, three-paneled pieces. Some of these triptychs were \\"Personality portraits\\" of celebrities or other public figures, animating the personality of the individual whom they depict through the use of abstract symbolism and a continuous color palette that creates cohesiveness among the three panels. Kagawa is an example of one such portrait, which portrays Toyohiko Kagawa; a Japanese social reformer and Christian missionary. A large purple cross is depicted in the first panel, and the design surrounding it suggests movement and dimension. The second (center) panel is a kaleidoscopic reformation of the first, and appears as though elements of the first panel have been zoomed in to focus on, and arranged in a symmetrical pattern involving three rows of seven oval shapes amid sharp angles. The third panel recalls designs from the first and second, such as crosses and circles, but in a traditional Navajo style; a type of design often seen in Navajo textiles or Plains beadwork. It can be surmised that Sully quite intentionally incorporated customary Navajo design elements with Christian imagery. Curator Jill Ahlberg Yohe says of Sully's symbology: \\"Christianity was imposed on Dakota and Lakota people, so a lot of traditional practices were banned, but if you could superimpose them on Christianity, you could subvert that system and still maintain a lot of traditional practices\\". This can also be recognized in Sully's triptych, \\"The Indian Church\\". In 2019, Sully's great- nephew, Philip J. Deloria, published a book exploring Sully's life and art, Becoming Mary Sully: Toward an American Indian Abstract. Three of Sully's artworks were selected for inclusion in the art show ‚ÄúHearts of Our People: Native Women Artists,‚Äù at Minneapolis Institute of Art.

Accession to leadership  In spring 1829, Wacouta faced two challenges upon becoming leader of the Red Wing band of Mdewakanton Dakota. He needed to fend off challenges from rivals within his village and also find success in dealings with United States government officials. The March 4, 1829, death of Tatanka Mani (Walking Buffalo), the widely respected Mdewakanton warrior, left a vacuum in the leadership of his band. Tatanka Mani, also known as Red Wing, was renowned for his bravery and was thought to be able to see the future through dreams. Wacouta I seemed to be the person to replace Red Wing. Red Wing's surviving son had contracted a bone disease that left him unfit for leadership. Wacouta, as Red Wing's nephew and possible stepson, was next in line. In his early thirties, intelligent, strong, and imposing at six feet tall, he was backed by a majority in the band. Whites who encountered Wacouta as a young man and later as an elder spoke highly of him. Wacouta was not a war chief, however. Younger men led by Mahpiyamaza (Iron Cloud), a warrior more in the mold of Red Wing, questioned his friendships with whites and his leadership. Despite Mahpiyamaza's questioning, by May 18, 1829 the Mdewakanton band elected Wacouta as leader. The new chief signed the Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien on July 15, 1830. However, clashes between the two factions continued and in 1832 the Red Wing band split into two groups led by Wacouta and Mahpiyamaza. They moved downriver from the village of Red Wing to separate camps near Wabasha's village. Wabasha was a well-respected Dakota leader. He and his 500 followers made up the largest of the five Mdewakanton communities.  Diplomacy with the United States  Wacouta continued to lead the remaining members of his group. In 1837, along with Mahpiyamaza and other prominent Dakota, he made a trip to Washington, D.C. At the U.S. capital, the Dakota were pressured and eventually agreed to give up lands east of the Mississippi River for annual cash payments. Some of the money was to be used for \\"education and civilization\\", which became a point of contention for the Dakota. Further, as part of the treaty, the U.S. government planned to recruit farmers, missionaries, and teachers to work with the Indians. In 1838, Wacouta and Mahpiyamaza brought their two factions back to Red Wing where they continued to live separately due to on-going tensions. A series of missionaries, including Samuel and Persis Dentan, John and Nancy Aiton, and Joseph and Maria Hancock, were sent to work with the Red Wing band beginning in the late 1830s. In 1851 a U.S. delegation led by Luke Lea, Commissioner of Indian Affairs and Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota's territorial governor, asked to meet with regional Dakota leaders. They wished to purchase the vast lands belonging to the Dakota. In July, the delegation signed an agreement with Sisseton and Wahpeton Dakota known as the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux. The United States still needed the approval of the eastern Dakota, however. Wacouta I, along with Wapasha III and Taoyateduta (Little Crow IV), all experienced leaders of the Mdewakanton, agreed to confer with Lea and Ramsey in Mendota, Minnesota. Mahpiyamaza was also part of the delegation. He and his band talked openly of opposing any treaty that would cost them their homes and village. Other young Mdewakanton men reportedly threatened to kill the first man to sign such an agreement. Wacouta addressed the assembly and spoke bitterly about his 1837 trip to Washington, D.C. He claimed the whites deceived the Indian leaders. Wacouta feared more treachery. Wapasha III and Taoyateduta also spoke of broken promises. The talks with the U.S. representatives nearly broke down. Despite his concerns, Wacouta, along with other senior Mdewakanton chiefs, had traveled across the United States. They understood the power of the flourishing new nation in a way the younger men did not. Grudgingly, the Indian leaders agreed to the land purchase offer. Wacouta and his band left Red Wing in 1853, heading to a small Minnesota River Valley reservation near present-day Morton, Minnesota. Wacouta died in their new home five years later.

Early life and career  S'eiltin was born into a family of artists. She learned from her mother, who weaved Chilkat robes and sewed skins into garments. As a child, she often visited Tlingit relatives in Haines, Alaska. She earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 1986. She then earned her Masters of Fine Arts in mixed media from the University of Arizona, where she explored her unique aesthetic. S'eiltin is an associate professor and researcher of art and humanities at Fairhaven College.  Works  S'eiltin uses classically indigenous materials in her art, including animal pelts and bones. Themes in S'eiltin's works include the impact of Western colonization, postmodernism, and statements of resistance and hope. One of S'eiltin's works, Hit (House in Tlingit Language), is a 2007 mixed-media installation, including video components, that includes a replica M16 rifle suspended in a 55-gallon glass tank of oil and water.

He was elected Chaldean archbishop of Mosul. Pope Francis granted him the ecclesiastica communio on December 22, 2018. Life Najeeb Moussa Michaeel was born and raised in a Chaldean family in Mosul. He graduated from the Higher Petroleum Institute in Baghdad and became an engineer. He entered the Dominican Order and made his novitiate in Lille and Strasbourg, France. He vowed on December 4, 1981 and was ordained a priest on May 16, 1987 by Bishop Pierre Claverie of Oran, Algeria.

Later, he studied pastoral theology and communication at Babel College in Baghdad. In 2007 he was refugee in Qaraqosh, in the ninive plain, due to the persecution of Christians in Mosul. When the Islamic State arrived in Mosul on the night of August 6-7, 2014, Najeeb Moussa Michaeel fled to Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan, taking about 800 manuscripts dating from the 13th to the 19th century, which he was transporting from Qaraqosh to Mosul. During his period of refuge, he digitized these manuscripts and helped Christian refugees in the Nineveh Plain. The saved documents were later exhibited at the National Archives and the Arab World Institute in Paris, as well as in Italy. Among these manuscripts were texts of Christian and Muslim spirituality written in Aramaic, Syriac, Arabic and Armenian. In addition, since 1990, Najeeb Michaeel has contributed to the safeguarding of 8,000 more manuscripts and 35,000 documents from the Church of the East.

During the eighteenth century, John Curtis has been identified as running the pub, moving there from the Cock and Pye, Ipswich in 1743. He died the next year and John Osborn took over. From at least 1816 it was owned by a succession of three people called Robert Bowman. By 1855 by Alfred Bowman was in charge, and he sold the business by auction in that year. By 1865 it was owned by Bridges and Cuthbert, who established a company that also acquired the Cross Keys Brewery, Culver St, Colchester, but went bankrupt in 1868. It passed into the hands of the Norfolk & Suffolk Brewery Co Ltd in 1886, which was then renamed the Colchester Brewing Company the next year, at which time the Falcon Brewery was closed. The pub then started selling Ind Coope products and was run by the pubs group Punch. In 2010 the Falcon Inn became known as \\"Bowmans Bar and Lounge\\". However, this closed due to bankruptcy in 2017. The pub reopened in 2018, once again as the Falcon.

She was awarded an OBE in 1951.  Family and early life  Born in 1905 to Robert (Robin) Cummings Elliott, Presbyterian minister of Duneane (Antrim) and Florence Wheeler Elliott (nee Steed) in Randalstown. She had a sister, Doreen Mary and a brother Robert (Robin)Cummings. Her uncle on her father's side was Rowley Elliott, MP. Affectionately known as \\"Lyla\\", she was a sickly child, which may have led her to a career as a nurse.  Training  Elliott trained at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, qualifying as a registered nurse in 1930. After several years she attended the Elsie Inglis Memorial Maternity Hospital in Edinburgh to train for six months as a midwife.  Career  After she qualified, Elliott remained at the Royal working as Sister of Wards 7 and 8 before going to Edinburgh to train as midwife. She then remained there working as a midwife and midwifery sister following her training. She returned to Belfast somewhat reluctantly to take up the post of Matron of Whiteabbey Sanatorium in 1943, after being encouraged to apply for the position. The sanatorium was in a state of low morale further acerbated by a newspaper scandal and over a three year period, Elliott worked to readdress these issues, establishing a training scheme for all the nurses, affiliating the sanatorium with Belfast City Hospital, as they were previously unable to get recognition outside the hospital. Again somewhat reluctantly, in 1946 she took up the post of Matron at the Royal Victoria Hospital, the first Royal trained nurse as well as the first from Northern Ireland to hold this position, remaining there until retirement in 1966. Whilst at the Royal she ensured that nurses under her charge went on training courses across the UK as well as locally. She also sought out bursaries and scholarships from Denmark, Paris and Columbia University to help her staff. Starting out in the role Elliott was instrumental in the successful transition of her staff and patients into the new National Health Service in 1948. With the resulting expansion of the hospital in 1950 Elliott ‚Äúcompelled the respect of the Medical Staff and the devotion of her nurses throughout this difficult period‚Äù. In 1949 Elliott formed the Royal Victoria Hospital League of Nurses, which was instrumental to keeping nurses in contact with the hospital and contributed to staffing issues by attracting former nurses to work again. A highly respected nurse, Elliott was known for her work not only augmenting the training and working conditions of her nurses but improving patients‚Äô comfort and experience. This included such changes as coloured bedsheets, individual trays, full evening meals, cooked breakfast, full bed curtains for added privacy, extended visiting periods, and a night admissions unit to minimise disturbance of sleeping patients.  Later years  Following retirement she was awarded an Honorary Masters from Queen's University, Belfast. She moved to Melbourne, Australia, living with her friend Joyce Long, establishing an Australian branch of the Royal Victoria Hospital League of Nurses and was a point of contact for Royal nurses, medical students and doctors. She returned to Belfast in 1990, accompanied by Long, settling in Templepatrick, remaining there until her death.

She is descended from Sugpiaq (Alutiiq), Black, and Choctaw people. In 2019 she was named a Seattle Living Legacy for building global awareness of the LGBTQ+, indigenous, Two Spirit, and Black populations of Seattle through her art, poetry, performances, and multimedia exhibits.  Early life and education  Storme Webber was born in 1959 in Seattle in Pioneer Square, formerly known as Seattle's \\"Skid Row\\". Her bisexual Black Choctaw father from Texas met her Sugpiaq (Alutiiq) mother there at the Casino, one of the oldest gay bars on the West Coast. Webber credits her Sugpiaq (Alutiiq) grandmother from Seldovia, Alaska for \\"starting her 'on the road of life'\\". Webber's grandmother raised her, teaching her how to read before she went to school, and how to appreciate music. At eleven years old, Webber left her family and entered the foster care system. Due to her advanced academic and creative arts skills, Webber qualified for summer program at Lakeside School. After participating in the summer program for two years, Webber received a full scholarship to attend the school full-time. Webber came out as a lesbian at 16 years old; as a teenager she organized a social group for lesbians of color which made her mother‚Äîwho had come out as lesbian at the same age‚Äîvery angry because she did not want her daughter to have a hard life. Webber graduated from Lakeside School in 1977, then moved to New York City to attend The New School. In 2015 she earned her MFA in Intermedia Arts from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vermont.  Career  Webber entered the art, poetry, and performance scene in New York City during the 1980s, where she displayed her first works in galleries in New York and San Francisco. In 1989 she published her first poetry collection Diaspora. In that same year Webber also contributed work to Serious Pleasure, a lesbian erotica anthology published by Sheba Feminist Press in London. In 2007 Webber established Voices Rising: Northwest LGBTQ Artists of Color to create a safe, welcoming, nurturing community of LGBTQ artists of color in Seattle to brainstorm, create, perform, and raise awareness of marginalization and systems of oppression in the larger society. The community maintains an active Facebook page to promote its events and related news articles. Webber has received recognition for her multimedia works Blues Divine (2014) and Noirish Lesbiana (2014). Blues Divine is an ancestral mix tape which combines a book of poetry with an audiobook read by Webber. Her museum exhibit Casino: A Palimpsest (2017) combines archival photographs and storytelling with an art installation to record the history of The Casino, one of the oldest gay bars on the West Coast, as told and experienced by her family. Webber has also produced and performed multiple solo theater works such as Buddy Rabbit, Noirish Lesbiana: A Night at the Sub Room, and Wild Takes of Renegade Halfbreed Bulldagger. These performances have earned acclaim in England, the Netherlands, and Germany. She has also been highlighted in documentaries including Venus Boyz, Hope in My Heart: The May Ayim Story, What‚Äôs Right with Gays These Days?, (Living Two Spirit), and international performance tours.

Architecture  The former Jones and Laughlin building was designed by MacClure and Spahr in the Jacobean Revival style, which was popular in England during the 17th century and can be described as a mix between the more medieval Tudor style and the later Renaissance styles. This architectural style often includes round arches and curved or scrolled, rather than stepped or peaked, gables and parapets. Red brick with stone trim is also commonly found in authentic British examples from the 17th century. The former Jones and Laughlin building is distinctly in the Jacobean Revival style, as the exterior is red brick with sandstone trim and it features numerous rounded arches, such as the one leading into the vestibule on the northwestern facade of the building. The construction for the building was done by the A. & S. Wilson Construction Company, and the steel structure of it was designed by the Jones & Laughlin Company at its Keystone Works structural plant.

Tripp Jr and the Watkins brothers. It was first built in 1981. The Watkins 36C is a center-cockpit development of the aft-cockpit Watkins 36. Development The silent partner in Auroraglas purchased the rights to the center-cockpit Tripp-designed Coronado 35 and Columbia 36 designs from Columbia Yachts and the tooling was modified to become the aft- cockpit Portman 36. That design was produced by Auroraglas and then by Watkins Yachts, in Clearwater, Florida, United States after the companies were merged. The Portman 36 was then modified by Watkins to become the aft-cockpit Watkins 36 and finally developed into the center-cockpit Watkins 36C. A history of Watkins Yachts notes, \\"in 1981 a center cockpit version of the W36 was added to the line. This is ironic as the W36 started life as a Coronado 35 center cockpit modified by giving it a new deck/coach roof to become an aft cockpit. The original Columbia center cockpit design was very dated so a new from scratch deck & coach roof mold was designed.\\" Production The Watkins 36C was produced from 1981 to 1984, with 58 boats completed. During its production run the Watkins 36 and 36C became the flagships of the company product line and their features were incorporated in the newer and smaller boat designs that followed it, including the opening ports, Bomar hatches, through bolted flanged hull joints and the sloping cabin top. Design The Watkins 36C is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a raised transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The design's hull is molded in a single piece using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving, as well as multidirectional chopped strand fibers (MSCF). The keel is integral to the hull and the ballast is internal to the keel. The deck and the cockpit and also moulded in pone piece, also using polyester resin and fiberglass woven roving with MCSF. Plywood coring is employed for the cabin top, deck, seat and the cockpit sole for stiffness. The hull-to-deck joint is flanged, glued and then screwed into place. There is an aluminum toe rail, stainless steel through-bolted into place, bonding the toe rail, deck and the hull. An anchor well is located at the bow with a hawspipe leading the anchor chain into the \\"V\\" berth locker. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel fitted. The boat is fitted with a British Perkins Engines diesel engine of , or on later boats delivered , for docking and maneuvering. The companionway stairs may be removed to provide access to the engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . The boat was factory delivered with many equipment items as standard, including a pressurized water system, a shower, ten opening ports and two hatches, a folding dining table in the main cabin and provisions for shore power. The design layout is the same as the Watkins 36 and has a bow \\"V\\" berth and an owner's stateroom aft. The galley is located aft, in the passageway to the owner's state room and is fitted with a double sink, a 12 volt refrigerator and a three-burner propane-fired stove with an oven. The head is aft and accessible from stateroom and the main cabin. The main cabin has of headroom and is finished with hand-rubbed teak trim, with the bulkheads and cabinetry made from teak veneer on plywood.

No records survive of its commissioner and original locationPier Virgilio Begni Redona, p. 210. It is first recorded in the 19th century, when it was in the Egremont collection, from which it was acquired at an unknown date for the Cook collection in Richmond-upon-Thames, which also contained Moretto's Enthroned Madonna and Child with Saint James the Great and Saint Jerome. In 1898 Pietro Da Ponte wrote of it, attributing it to Cesare MagniPietro Da Ponte, p. 102, though he does not cite his source for this attribution. In 1947 it was sold to the Kress collection, which in 1939 became part of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. One of the first art historians to study the work was Pietro da Ponte, who called it \\"a canvas notable for the great expression of melancholy in its figures\\". In 1913 Tancred Borenius correctly dated it to the painter's youth, made the link to the Deposition Altarpiece and noted the strong similarities between its figure of Mary Magdalene and the woman at Jesus' feet in Moretto's much later Supper in the House of Simon the Pharisee (1550)Tancred Borenius, p. 184.

William Clayton tells his father Oliver Queen that the year is meant to be 2040. William's half-sister Mia Smoak and Connor Hawke decide not to tell Present Team Arrow about the dystopian future of Star City under the interests of preserving their timeline, but William doubts that they can keep this a secret for long. Oliver wants to connect with his children's future selves; he is able to restore his bond with William, but Mia keeps her distance out of resentment. The next day at the bunker, the two teams watch a newscast of the Deathstroke gang. Future Team Arrow believe the gang leader is John Diggle Jr. and go to confront him, only to realize it is Grant Wilson. Grant plants bombs but Oliver and the rest of Present Team Arrow manage to save Future Team Arrow. Connor and William reveal everything to Present Team Arrow. Rene Ramirez and John Diggle have a heated argument about their children before Diggle and Connor argue. Laurel Lance and Mia go to the hospital and Laurel realizes that Mia is going to try and kill Grant. Grant is going to use coordinated bomb attacks, and has them all connected to a phone. Both the Team Arrows suit up and try to find Grant. Once they do, Mia is going to kill him but Oliver stops her from doing so. The next morning, Oliver takes Mia to his father Robert's grave and tells her that he did not know his true father until he had died; he does not want to be like that between them. Oliver then gets a call from Curtis Holt who says that there is a weapon that can defeat Mar Novu but the man who can make it is in Russia. Laurel exits the SCPD and Novu appears before her. He offers to bring back Earth-2, but it will require a simple task: she must betray Oliver.

Club rated the episode A-, saying, \\"It's a fine Arrow plot, kind of vague but mostly effective. It doesn't matter, anyway‚Äîit's just a means to an end. The real meat of the story exists in the conversations between these people, and the presence of the Deathstroke gang makes those conversations about a thousand percent more interesting.\\" Delia Harrington of Den of Geek described it as \\"fun-ass television\\" and \\"a tremendous step forwards\\". She complimented all the callbacks to season 2 and Stephen Amell's acting stating that he is \\"(he) has done some of his best work so far this season, and this episode tops it all. \\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.1 out of 10, noting that the Deathstroke of 2019 suffers as the actor is not very enthusiastic about the role. Schedeen praised Amell's performance and the strong material he is given to work with.

Caesar, having recently lost almost is entire force in a spectacular defeat near Aesernia, had a force consisting of Gallic and Mauritanian and Numidian forces. When Papius brought forward Oxynta, a son of the former king of Numidia, Jugurtha, many of Caesar‚Äôs Numidian troops switched sides, Caesar having to send away the rest to prevent further desertion. When Papius attacked Caesar‚Äôs fortified camp Caesar charged out through another gate with his cavalry, falling on the exposed rebel force, he killed 6,000 men, a large portion of the enemy force.

It was supervised by the Commissioners for Paving, Watching and Lighting. =Formation= In 1835 parliament passed the Municipal Corporation Act which along with broader reorganizations of local government required that the town set up a Watch committee which would recruit a sufficient number of fit men to police the town. The committee decided that a force of 22 constables 2 sergeants and 1 Inspector. The positions of First Sergeant and Second Sergeant were given to the previous heads of the watch while the position of Inspector was given to John Thomas Enright who had been recruited from the metropolitan police. The members of the existing watch were offered positions as constables with 8 of them declining or leaving prior to the swearing in of the new force. =Early years= In the first year turnover was high with 14 mean leaving the force largely due to resignations. After this first year turnover fell averaging 28% up to 1840. A series of robberies in 1851 resulted in the town requesting advice from the Metropolitan police.

Origin  According to Book of Wei and History of the Northern Dynasties, the surname Yujiul√º is of Donghu origin. The first known Yujiul√º was a slave caught by Xianbei mounted raiders under the reign of Tuoba Liwei. The slave, whose hairline started at his eyebrows' level, was called M√πg√∫l«ò (Êú®È™®Èñ≠) - \\"bald-headed\\" in the Xianbei language. When grown-up, Mugul√º was noted for his strength, emancipated and recruited as a cavalry soldier. For tarrying past the deadline, he was sentenced to death by beheading. But he fled to the mountains and ravines in the Gobi desert, where he gathered another 100 fugitives. The fugitives sought refuge under the Gaoche tribe called Hetulin (Á¥áÁ™ÅÈö£). The descendants of Mugul√º and his companions became the nucleus of the future Rouran Khaganate. Alexander Vovin proposes that M√πg√∫l«ò (Êú®È™®Èñ≠), in reconstructed Middle Chinese *muwk-kwot-ljo, transcribed Tuoba Xianbei *moqo-lo ~ muqo-lo 'bald head', which is analysable as 'one [who/]which has cut-off/fallen-off [hair]' and cognate with Mongolic lexical items like Written Mongolian mo…£utur ~ moqutur 'blunt, hornless, bald tail' (cf. Chinese gloss: Á¶øÂ∞æ 'bald tail'), moqu-…£ar, Middle Mongol muqular 'hornless', moqo-dag 'blunt'; all of those are from Proto-Mongolic *muqu 'to be cut off, break off, fall off', which in turn would produce the semantic variation 'blunt ~ hornless ~ hairless ~ bald'.Vovin, Alexander. 2007. \\"Once again on the TabŒ≥aƒç language\\", Mongolian Studies, XXIX: 200-202 Later on, his dynasty was called Yujiul√º, which sounded like Mugul√º.

He started all 13 of Florida's games the following season and finished the year 45 tackles and finished second on the team with 11.0 tackles for loss along 6.5 sacks. Zuniga was named the Southeastern Conference Defensive Lineman of the Week for Week 3 after recording 2.5 sacks against Colorado State. He initially contemplated forgoing his final year of NCAA eligibility to enter the 2019 NFL Draft, but ultimately decided to return to Florida for his redshirt senior season. Zuniga entered his redshirt senior season as a preseason first team All-SEC selection. He was named to the watchlist for the Chuck Bednarik Award midway through the season. Zuniga suffered a high ankle sprain against Kentucky, causing him to miss the next two games, and then re-injured his ankle Georgia and missed the final four games of the regular season. He returned to play in the 2019 Orange Bowl and finished the season with 14 tackles, 7 tackles for a loss, and 3 sacks. Professional career Zuniga was selected by the New York Jets in the third round, 79th overall, of the 2020 NFL Draft. He was placed on injured reserve on September 7, 2020.

The squadron's first predecessor was the 13th Combat Cargo Squadron, which flew men and material in the China Burma India Theater during World War II. That squadron was disbanded in 1948, but was reconstituted in 1985 and consolidated with the unit's second predecessor. The second predecessor of the squadron was organized in 1956 as the 13th Aeromedical Transport Squadron. It flew aeromedical evacuation missions until inactivating in 1968. The squadron received its most recent designation in 1966. It has not been active since its 1985 consolidation. History =World War II= C-46 Commando The first predecessor of the squadron was activated at Syracuse Army Air Base, New York in June 1944 as the 13th Combat Cargo Squadron, one of the four operational squadrons of the 4th Combat Cargo Group.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 72 Combat cargo squadrons were organized to operate independently, with logistics and administrative support from an attached airdrome squadron. In the case of the 13th, this support was provided by the 348th Airdrome Squadron. The squadron was initially equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains. In August, the squadron moved to Bowman Field, Kentucky, where it continued its training and equipped with larger Curtiss C-46 Commandos. The squadron completed its training and began its move to the China Burma India Theater in early November 1944. The squadron arrived in theater in late November 1944 and began operations the following month. In December, it transported material and equipment for the construction of the Ledo Road. Until May 1945, it concentrated on transporting materiel and reinforcements for forces operating in Burma. In February 1945, it transported \\"men, mules and boats\\" as forces crossed the Irrawaddy River. In May, the 13th dropped Gurkha paratroopers during the assault on Rangoon. In June, the squadron moved to Namponmao Airfield, Burma and transported supplies and personnel over the Hump to China. The squadron returned to India in November and was inactivated in late December 1945.Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 34-35 The squadron was disbanded on 8 Oct 1948. =Aeromedical evacuation= The 13th Aeromedical Transport Squadron was activated at Travis Air Force Base, California on 8 November 1956 as the 1st Aeromedical Transport Group replaced the 1706th Air Transport Group (Aeromedical Evacuation). Military Air Transport Service (MATS) had begun aeromedical evacuation operations at Travis on 16 December 1948, when it moved the 1733d Air Transport Squadron (Aeromedical Evacuation) to Travis from Lowry Air Force Base, Colorado, where it had been organized on 9 October 1948 and assigned to the 1702d Air Transport Group.Mueller, pp. 335, 557 In July 1950, the 1702d Group was discontinued and the 1733d was transferred to the 1704th Air Transport Wing at Travis, and became the primary unit for the air movement of casualties from the Korean War once they reached the United States. On 1 February 1953 MATS centralized its aeromedical transport squadrons in the United States under the 1706th Group and the 1733d Squadron was reassigned to it. The 13th absorbed the 1733d's mission, personnel, and equipment on activation and the 1733d was simultaneously discontinued. On 1 June 1964, the 1405th Air Base Wing at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois was redesignated the 1405th Aeromedical Transport Wing, and assumed responsibility for the aeromedical transport mission from the 1st Group. Under the 1405th, responsibility for aeromedical evacuation missions expanded to include all of North America and the Caribbean, not only missions within the United States. The expanded mission called for augmentation of the 13th and the wing's other regular squadrons by squadrons of the Air National Guard. In January 1966, the 1405th Wing transferred it mission, personnel and components to the 375th Aeromedical Airlift Wing, as Military Airlift Command replaced its operational Major Command controlled (MAJCON) units that could not carry a permanent history with Air Force controlled units. The squadron was inactivated on 8 December 1968 as the C-131 was phased out of the aeromedical evacuation fleet and replaced by the Douglas HC-9 Nightingale.

Only residents or city employees of Palo Alto and their guests have access to it, a restriction that has sparked \\"decades-long\\" controversy and a 2020 ACLU lawsuit.  Geography  The park is located in Palo Alto in the eastern foothills of the Santa Cruz mountains. Page Mill Road is the eastern boundary for most of it. To the north and the lowlands is the Arastradero Preserve also owned by Palo Alto and to the south is Los Trancos Open Space Preserve owned by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District. The small Foothills Open Space Preserve also owned by the district is adjacent for part of the east side. Los Trancos Creek is the southwestern boundary of the park and is joined south of the park by Buckeye Creek which flows through the park. The damming of a tributary of Buckeye Creek created Boronda Lake. The park contains nearly one tenth of all land in Palo Alto. About of the park are developed with amenities including a large grassy field, picnic sites, a walk-in, tent-only campground, and a nature interpretive center. Boronda lake is used for fishing, rowing, and canoeing. The park also has of trails. The Bay-to-Ridge Trail, which when complete will link the Palo Alto Baylands Nature Preserve to the Bay Area Ridge Trail, runs through the park connecting Arastradero Preserve and Los Trancos Open Space. Non-Palo Alto residents can use this trail even though it is within the park. The linked pdf on this page includes a map of the Bay-to-Ridge trail and of Foothills Park.  History  Sign on the entry gate Most of the land for the park was bought from Russel V. Lee, a founder of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic (now Palo Alto Medical Foundation), who offered, in 1958, 1,294 acres of his land at $1,000 an acre ($1.3 million total) to the city to preserve as open space. The total cost was high so Palo Alto put it to a citywide vote in 1959 which passed with 62% of the voters supporting buying the land. The council also asked the neighboring communities of Portola Valley and Los Altos Hills to share in the cost, but they declined. The park opened on June 19, 1965, and the restriction limiting access to Palo Alto residents and their guests was put into place in 1969. In 2005, the county provided $2 million in grant funding to go towards the purchase of 13 additional acres of adjacent land, in exchange for which Palo Alto allowed anyone (nonresidents included) to freely pass through that area and enter Foothills Park, on trails from Arastradero Preserve. It is a misdemeanor for a nonresident to enter the park, unless they are traveling through on specific trails on foot. However, enforcement is limited due to budget constraints; the gate is unstaffed on non-holiday weekdays and some weekends in the winter. Activists painted \\"DESEGREGATE\\" outside the front gate in July 2020, in protest of the policy that limits access to residents of Palo Alto and their guests (regardless of race); despite this, the activists believe the policy \\"is closely tied to racist practices of the past\\". In Aug 2020, the City Council voted to run a one-year pilot study that would open the nature preserve for limited permits to non-residents on a \\"revenue-neutral\\" basis, which in practice means a minimal ($6) entry charge \\"to recover a portion of the expenses associated with the existing cost of staffing the entry gate\\". Upon completion of the pilot study, the issue of whether or not to open the preserve to the general public will be placed on the ballot so that the residents of Palo Alto can vote on the issue. In September 2020, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of the local NAACP, calling the restriction \\"unconstitutional\\". The lawsuit contends that the policy \\"infringes on the plaintiffs‚Äô fundamental rights of freedom of movement, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly\\".

Climate Cayoosh Mountain in winter Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Cayoosh Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports a glacier on the northeast slope of this mountain. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Cayoosh Mountain.

Life  Rudolf Egelhofer was born in apparently barren conditions in the family of sign painter Friedrich Egelhofer and his wife Maria. He early on joined the Imperial German Navy, but apparently still young Rudolf had a disregard for authority. Already in 1913, as a 17-year-old ship's boy, he absenteed for the first time from his unit without permission, as evidenced by police files. Egelhofer also served in World War I as Marine infantry on the Western Front in Flanders. In 1918 he was involved in the Kiel Mutiny that triggered the November Revolution. There he was apparently arrested and allegedly sentenced to death. On 15 February 1919, he returned to his hometown together with 600 other armed sailors from Wilhelmshaven. There, under Kurt Eisner's (USPD) leadership the Wittelsbach Monarchy had been overthrown on 7 November, and the Freestate Bavaria had been proclaimed as a republic with Eisner as prime minister of an SPD/USPD government. On 10 January Egelhofer rose at a Spartakist protest meeting in the Bavarian Foreign Ministry building and told the Council of Ministers, that a gathering of 5000 workers demanded the proclamation of a Council Republic, removal of the city commander Oskar D√ºrr (1877-1959, SPD politician and Tsar of Russia's vice consul in Munich), diplomatic relations with the Soviets in Russia and the establishment of a Red Army. After Eisner's murder on 21 February the situation worsened. Egelhofer was directly involved in the revolutionary soldiers' council movement and joined the KPD. He was considered courageous, energetic and apparently also had a certain talent for speaking in public. The author Oskar Maria Graf wrote in his book Wir sind Gefangene about the first Red Army parade in Munich's Ludwigstrasse: \\"From an open window spoke E(n)gelhofer, the army commander. Determined and unaffected, in a sailor's uniform, he stood there, sometimes raising his fist. Whoever heard him, had to believe him.\\" Public order on the issue of arms on 14 April 1919, signed by the city commandant Rudolf Egelhofer; one of the first measures of the new communist leadership of the Council Republic after the foiled Palm Sunday Putsch Egelhofer became active as military leader for the first time in the successful rejection of the attempted coup on 13 April known as the Palm Sunday Putsch against the Munich Council Republic, which only had been in existence for a week since 7 April. Revolutionary troops under his leadership stormed the Munich Central Station, held by supporters of the SPD exile government, who had fled to Bamberg. The coup failed, and the same day Egelhofer was appointed city commander by the Munich Council, now dominated by KPD members as Eugen Levin√© and Max Levien. Shortly after he was appointed leader of Munich's \\"Red Army\\" consisting of soldiers and workers. He was replaced by the pacifist author Ernst Toller. The task, to within a few days organize the defense of Munich with an estimated 20,000 barely trained, poorly armed and highly motivated soldiers and workers against the approaching superiority of the \\"white\\" troops ‚Äì Reichswehr army units and right-wing Nationalist Freikorps ‚Äì which were called in by the Bamberg SPD leadership under Johannes Hoffmann, was not salvageable for the young seaman. In the first days of May, the government troops overran the city. Sustained resistance only existed in a few places. Egelhofer was unable to enforce the idea of gathering relatives of the \\"Bourgeoisie\\" in the Theresienwiese and shooting them when the \\"whites\\" invaded the city. However, he probably gave written consent to the shooting of ten hostages, mainly from the Thule Society environment, in the Munich Luitpold Gymnasium. The \\"Munich Hostage Murder\\" became the only documented evidence of the later claimed \\"red terror\\" during the council's reign. Massive terror was however, exercised in the following years by the victorious \\"white\\" troops in Munich. Hundreds were shot dead or murdered. In total, more than 2,200 supporters of the Council Republic were condemned to death or imprisonment by tribunals. The 23-year-old Egelhofer as one of the most prominent representatives of the Communist council rule was discovered and arrested on 1 May in his hiding place in an apartment on Maximilianstra√üe. After severe maltreatment he was shot dead without trial on 3 May at the Munich Residenz city palace, where he was being held.  Commemorations  In East Germany, an Osa-class missile boat (1964), a Tarantul-class missile boat (1985, today USNS Hiddensee) and the NCO (noncommissioned officer) school I, later training center 6 of the land forces of the National People's Army in Haide near Wei√üwasser were named after Rudolf Egelhofer. There was a Rudolf Egelhofer Oberschule in Rostock, a Rudolf Egelhofer road exists to this day in Strausberg. In Munich, apparently nothing is named after Egelhofer. Since October 2016, a commemorative plaque has been erected on the grave in the Munich Nordfriedhof. Also commemorative coins and porcelain plates with Egelhofer exists.

In June 2019, the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service acting director warned of the potential for an early start to the bushfire season which normally starts in August. The warning was based on the Northern Australia bushfire seasonal outlook noting exceptional dry conditions and a lack of soil moisture, combined with early fires in central Queensland. Throughout the summer, hundreds of fires burnt, mainly in the southeast of the country. The major fires peaked during December‚ÄìJanuary. , the fires burnt an estimated , destroyed over 5,900 buildings (including 2,779 homes) and killed at least 34 people. Nearly three billion terrestrial vertebrates alonethe vast majority being reptileswere affected and some endangered species were believed to be driven to extinction. At its peak, air quality dropped to hazardous levels in all southern and eastern states. The cost of dealing with the bushfires is expected to exceed the 4.4 billion of the 2009 Black Saturday fires, and tourism sector revenues fell by more than 1 billion. However, economists estimated that the Australian bushfires may cost over 103 billion in property damage and economic losses, making the bushfires Australia's costliest natural disaster to date. Nearly 80 per cent of Australians were affected either directly or indirectly by the bushfires. By 7 January 2020, the smoke had moved approximately across the South Pacific Ocean to Chile and Argentina. As of 2 January 2020, NASA estimated that of CO had been emitted. From September 2019 to March 2020, fires heavily impacted various regions of the state of New South Wales. In eastern and north-eastern Victoria large areas of forest burnt out of control for four weeks before the fires emerged from the forests in late December. Multiple states of emergency were declared across New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory. Reinforcements from all over Australia were called in to assist fighting the fires and relieve exhausted local crews in New South Wales. The Australian Defence Force was mobilised to provide air support to the firefighting effort and to provide manpower and logistical support. Firefighters, supplies and equipment from Canada, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States, among others, helped fight the fires, especially in New South Wales. During the ensuing crisis, an air tanker and two helicopters crashed during firefighting operations, the air tanker crash resulting in the deaths of the three crew. Two fire trucks were caught in fatal incidents caused directly by fire conditions, killing three fire fighters. By 4 March 2020, all fires in New South Wales had been extinguished completely (to the point where there were no fires in the state for the first time since July 2019), and the Victoria fires had all been contained. The last fire of the season occurred in Lake Clifton, Western Australia, in early May. There has been considerable debate regarding the underlying cause of the intensity and scale of the fires, including the role of fire management practices and climate change, which during the peak of the crisis attracted significant international attention. Politicians visiting fire impacted areas received mixed responses, in particular Prime Minister Scott Morrison. An estimated 500 million was donated by the public at large, international organisations, public figures and celebrities for victim relief and wildlife recovery. Convoys of donated food, clothing and livestock feed were sent to affected areas. Overview Starting from September 2019, fires heavily impacted various regions of the state of New South Wales, such as the North Coast, Mid North Coast, the Hunter Region, the Hawkesbury and the Wollondilly in Sydney's far west, the Blue Mountains, Illawarra and the South Coast, Riverina and Snowy Mountains with more than 100 fires burnt across the state. In eastern and north-eastern Victoria, large areas of forest burnt out of control for four weeks before the fires emerged from the forests in late December, taking lives, threatening many towns and isolating Corryong and Mallacoota. A state of disaster was declared for East Gippsland. Significant fires occurred in the Adelaide Hills and Kangaroo Island in South Australia and parts of the ACT. Moderately affected areas were south-eastern Queensland and areas of south-western Western Australia, with a few areas in Tasmania being mildly impacted. On 12 November 2019, catastrophic fire danger was declared in the Greater Sydney region for the first time since the introduction of this level in 2009 and a total fire ban was in place for seven regions of New South Wales, including Greater Sydney. The Illawarra and Greater Hunter areas also experienced catastrophic fire dangers, and so did other parts of the state, including the already fire ravaged parts of northern New South Wales. The political ramifications of the fire season have been significant. A decision by the New South Wales Government to cut funding to fire services based on budget estimates, as well as a holiday taken by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, during a period in which two volunteer firefighters died, and his perceived apathy towards the situation, resulted in controversy. Bushfire smoke over the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge on 29 December , was burnt or is burning across all Australian states and territories. Ecologists from The University of Sydney estimated 480 million mammals, birds, and reptiles were lost since September with concerns that entire species of plants and animals may have been wiped out by bushfire, later expanded to more than a billion. In February 2020 it was reported that researchers from Charles Sturt University found that the deaths of nine smoky mice were from \\"severe lung disease\\" caused by smoke haze that contained PM2.5 particles coming from bushfires 50 kilometres away. By the time the fires had been extinguished there, they destroyed 2,448 homes, as well as 284 facilities and more than 5,000 outbuildings in New South Wales alone. Twenty-six people were confirmed to have been killed in New South Wales since October. The last fatality reported was on 23 January 2020 following the death of a man near Moruya. In New South Wales, the fires burnt through more land than any other blazes in the past 25 years, in addition to being the state's worst bushfire season on record. NSW also experienced the longest continuously burning bushfire complex in Australia's history, having burnt more than , with flames being reported. In comparison, the 2018 California wildfires consumed and the 2019 Amazon rainforest wildfires burnt of land. Whereas these bushfires are regarded by the NSW Rural Fire Service as the worst bushfire season in memory for that state, the 1974‚Äì75 bushfires were nationally much larger consuming . However, due to their lower intensity and remote location, the 1974 fires caused around 5 million (approximately 36.5 million in 2020) in damages. In December 2019 the New South Wales Government declared a state of emergency after record-breaking temperatures and prolonged drought exacerbated the bushfires. Due to safety concerns and significant public pressure, New Year's Eve fireworks displays were cancelled across New South Wales including highly popular events at Campbelltown, Liverpool, Parramatta, and across Sydney's Northern Beaches, and as well in the nation's capital of Canberra. As temperatures reached , the New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian called a fresh seven-day state of emergency with effect from 9 am on 3 January 2020. On 23 January, a Lockheed C-130 Hercules air tanker crashed at Peak View near Cooma while waterbombing a blaze, resulting in the death of the three American crew members on board. It was one of eleven large air tankers brought to Australia for the fire season from Canada and US. An investigation is underway by the ATSB to determine the cause of the accident. Reaching the crash site proved difficult due to the active bushfires in the area. The crash site was located in dense bushland, and spanned approximately . On 31 January, the Australian Capital Territory declared a state of emergency in areas around Canberra as several bushfires threatened the city, having burnt . On 7 February it was reported that torrential rain across most of south-east Australia had extinguished a third of extant fires; with only a small number of uncontrolled fires remaining by 10 February. { class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" rowspan=2  State / territory ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" rowspan=2  Fatalities ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" rowspan=2  Homes lost ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" colspan=2  Area ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\" rowspan=2  Notes - ! ha !! acres - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Northern Territory  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  5  Area, includes mainly scrub fires, which are within the normal range of area burnt by bushfires each year; homes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  New South Wales  align=\\"right\\"  26  align=\\"right\\"  2,448  Area; fatalities; homes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Queensland  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  48  Area, includes scrub fires; homes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Western Australia  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\"  1  Area, includes scrub fires; homes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Victoria  align=\\"right\\"  5  align=\\"right\\"  396  Area; fatalities; homes - ! scope=\\"row\\"  South Australia  align=\\"right\\"  3  align=\\"right\\"  151  Area; fatalities; homes (KI:65) (AH:86) - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Australian Capital Territory  align=right 0  align=right 0  Area - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Tasmania  align=right 0  align=right 2   Area; homes - class=\\"sortbottom\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"font-weight:bold;\\"  Total  style=\\"font-weight:bold; text-align:right;\\" 34  style=\\"font-weight:bold; text-align:right;\\" 3,500+   Total area estimate as of 13 February 2020; current figure may be more }  Fire potential  The Garnaut Climate Change Review of 2008 stated: To describe emerging fire trends the study by Lucas and others defined two new fire weather categories, \\"very extreme\\" and \\"catastrophic\\". The analysis by the Bushfire CRC, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research found that the number of \\"very high\\" fire danger days generally increases 2‚Äì13% by 2020 for the low scenarios (global increase by ) and 10‚Äì30% for the high scenarios (global increase by ). The number of \\"extreme\\" fire danger days generally increases 5‚Äì25% by 2020 for the low scenarios and 15‚Äì65% for the high scenarios. In April 2019 a group of former Australian fire services chiefs, Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, warned that Australia was not prepared for the upcoming fire season. They called on the next prime minister to meet the former emergency service leaders \\"who will outline, unconstrained by their former employers, how climate change risks are rapidly escalating\\". Greg Mullins, the second-longest serving fire and rescue commissioner in New South Wales and now a councillor with the Climate Council, said he thought the coming summer was going to be \\"the worst I have ever seen\\" for fire crews, and renewed his calls for the government to take urgent action to address climate change and stop Australia's rising emissions. In August 2019 the federally funded Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC published a seasonal outlook report which advised of \\"above normal fire potential\\" for southern and southeast Queensland, the east coast areas of New South Wales and Victoria, for parts of Western Australia and South Australia. In December 2019, the Bushfire and Natural Hazards CRC updated their advice of \\"above normal fire potential\\". Regions affected =New South Wales= The NSW statutory Bush Fire Danger Period normally begins on 1 October and continues through until 31 March. In 2019‚Äì20, the fire season started early with drought affecting 95 percent of the state and persistent dry and warm conditions across the state. Twelve local government areas started the Bush Fire Danger Period two months early, on 1 August 2019, and nine more started on 17 August 2019. In the week preceding 10 February 2020, a wide band of heavy rain swept through most of coastal New South Wales, extinguishing a significant number of fires; it left 33 active fires, of which five were uncontrolled, all located in the Bega Valley and Snowy Mountains regions. Between July 2019 and 13 February 2020, the NSW Rural Fire Service reported that 11,264 bush or grass fires burnt , destroyed 2,439 homes, and approximately of fire retardant was used. North Coast On 6 September 2019, the northern parts of the state experienced extreme fire dangers.

Under strong winds and extreme heat the fire spread rapidly, growing out of control and impacting the suburban interface across South Turramurra. One house caught alight in Lyon Avenue, but was saved by quick responding firefighters. As further crews arrived and worked to protect properties, a C-130 Air Tanker made several fire retardant drops directly over firefighters and houses, saving the rest of the suburb. The fire was ultimately brought under control several hours later, with one firefighter injured suffering a broken arm. Because of the bushfires occurring in the surrounding regions, the Sydney metropolitan area suffered from dangerous smoky haze for several days throughout December, with the air quality being eleven times the hazardous level in some days, making it even worse than New Delhi's, where it was also compared to \\"smoking 32 cigarettes\\" by Associate Professor Brian Oliver, a respiratory diseases scientist at the University of Technology Sydney.

A large fire impacted the Peregian Beach area on 9 September, on the Sunshine Coast, severely damaging ten houses. In December 2019 Peregian Springs and the surrounding areas came under threat by bushfires for the second time in a couple of months. No homes were confirmed lost in this bushfire. Due to deteriorating fire conditions and fires threatening homes across the state, on 9 November a State of Fire Emergency was declared across 42 local government areas across southern, central, northern and far-northern Queensland. 14 homes were destroyed in the Yeppoon area during mid November 2019. On 11 November a fire started in the Ravensbourne area near Toowoomba, which burnt through over of bush across several days, destroying six houses. At 8 am the air quality in Brisbane reached unprecedentedly poor levels (Woolloongabba PM2.5 238.8 Œºg/m3). Queensland's chief health officer, Dr Jeanette Young, urged residents to stay indoors and to not physically exert themselves. On 13 November a water bombing helicopter crashed while fighting the blazes threatening the small community of Pechey. While the Bell 214 helicopter was completely destroyed, the pilot walked away with minor injuries. On 23 November the state of fire emergency was revoked and extended fire bans were put in place in local government areas that were previously affected under this declaration. On 6 December a house fire broke out in and quickly spread to nearby bushland and was placed under a watch and act alert by the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services that afternoon. The following day, after worsening conditions, the fire was upgraded to an emergency warning and began to threaten homes in the local community. The fire destroyed a shipping container filled with fireworks, and residents within the exclusion zone were ordered to evacuate. One home was destroyed. On 8 November a bushfire broke out in forestry to the west of the township of Jimna, causing Queensland Fire and Emergency services to issue a \\"watch and act\\" alert. The fire caused the evacuation of the entire town. =South Australia= On 11 November 2019 an emergency bushfire warning was issued for Port Lincoln in the Eyre Peninsula, with an uncontrolled fire traveling towards the town. The South Australian Country Fire Service ordered ten water bombers to the area to assist 26 ground crews at the scene. SA Power Networks disconnected power to the town. NASA satellite imagery on 3 January 2020 showing bushfires on Kangaroo Island. A large fire broke out on Yorke Peninsula on 20 November 2019 and threatened the towns of and . It destroyed at least eleven homes and burnt approximately . The fire was believed to have started from a sparking electrical transformer. A Boeing 737 water-bombing aircraft from New South Wales in addition to South Australian Air Tractor AT-802s were used to protect the town of Edithburgh. On 20 December fires took hold in the Adelaide Hills, and near in the Mount Lofty Ranges. Initial south- easterly winds put the towns of Lobethal and in the line of the fire, and by the next morning the winds had changed to north-north-west, threatening other towns. The fires killed one person, more than 70 houses were destroyed, as well as over 400 outbuildings and 200 cars. Yearly Christmas celebrations at Lobethal were cancelled. Also on 20 December, an out-of-control bushfire took hold near Angle Vale, starting from the Northern Expressway and burning through Buchfelde and across the Gawler River. At 11:07 am ACDT the fire was burning under catastrophic weather conditions and an emergency warning was issued for Hillier, Munno Para Downs, Kudla, Munno Para West and Angle Vale. One house was destroyed. Another emergency warning was issued on 3 January for a fire near Kersbrook. At its largest extent, the warning area overlapped with areas that a few days earlier had been in warnings for the Cudlee Creek fire. Water bombers delivered 21 loads in just over an hour before darkness fell, and 150 firefighters on 25 trucks plus bulk water carriers and earthmoving equipment limited the advance of the fire to . On Kangaroo Island starting in the Flinders Chase National Park, the Ravine bushfire burnt in excess of and a bushfire emergency warning was issued on 3 January 2020 as the fire advanced towards Vivonne Bay and the town of was evacuated. On 4 January it was confirmed at least two people died. approximately , representing about a third of the island, had been burnt. Fires remained burning out of control, with firefighters working to contain and control fires before potentially hot windy weather scheduled for later in the week. Following fire damage to a water treatment plant, residents were asked to conserve water and some water was carted into island towns. There were concerns for the future of threatened wildlife, such as glossy black cockatoos, Kangaroo Island dunnarts, and koalas. Authorities stated that any koalas taken to the mainland for treatment cannot return to the island in case they bring diseases back with them. =Western Australia= The smoke plume viewed from the International Space Station, 4 January 2020. Smoke from bushfires seen in the sky of Perth in November 2019 Two bushfires burnt in Geraldton on 13 November, damaging homes and small structures. A fire broke out in Yanchep at 2:11 pm on 11 December, immediately triggering an emergency warning for Yanchep and Two Rocks. The fire led to a service station exploding. On 12 December, temperatures in excess of exacerbated the fire, and the emergency warning area doubled including parts of Guilderton and Brenton Bay further north. On 13 December, increased temperature conditions resulted in the fire burning in excess of , with the fire front over in length. , the emergency warning area stretched from Yanchep north to Lancelin over away. By 16 December, the fire was considered contained and the alert downgraded to watch and act. Approximately were burnt; only two buildings were damaged, both within the first day of the fire starting. In December fires in the region around Norseman blocked access to the Eyre Highway and the Nullarbor and caused the highways of the region to be blocked, so as to prevent any recurrence of the 2007 death of truck drivers on the Great Eastern Highway. Between 26 December 2019 and 1 January 2020, as a result of a lightning strike, a fire tore through of land in Stirling Range National Park in the southwest of the state, burning more than half of the park. The pyrocumulus cloud from the fires could be seen south in Albany. By New Year's Day 2020 a crew of 200 firefighters brought the fire back to advice level without any loss of life or major property damage (a park ranger hut and hiking tracks were destroyed). However, conservationists raised concerns for the potential loss of rare and unique flora and fauna that live in the park, which contains over 1500 such species within its boundaries, including a rare population of quokkas (one of few in mainland Western Australia). A local politician, firefighters, farmers and tourism operators called on Western Australian Emergency Minister Fran Logan to invest in local firefighting assets for the area to make sure the tourist destination was properly protected. The last fire of Western Australian 2019‚Äì20 bushfire season started in Lake Clifton, within the Shire of Waroona, on 2 May and was extinguished on 3 May. The Lake Clifton area was severely damaged during the 2010‚Äì11 bushfire season. =Tasmania= In late October 2019, four bushfires were burning near Scamander, Elderslie, and Lachlan. Emergency warnings were issued at Lulworth, Bothwell, and Lachlan. A large fire near also burnt over . Lighting strikes subsequently started multiple fires in Southwest Tasmania. On 20 December 2019, a fire was started in the north east, which spread to and destroyed one home; a man was charged with starting the fire. Two fires continued to burn in January 2020. A fire in the Fingal Valley, in north-eastern Tasmania, started on 29 December, and a fire at Pelham, north of Hobart, started on 30 December. the Fingal fire had burnt over and the Pelham fire over . =Australian Capital Territory= The Orroral Valley Fire viewed from Tuggeranong in southern Canberra In the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the national capital Canberra was blanketed by thick bushfire smoke on New Year's Day from bushfires burning nearby in New South Wales. That day the air quality in the capital was the worst of any city in the world, at around 23 times the threshold to be considered hazardous. Conditions continued the next day, and Australia Post stopped postal deliveries in the ACT to keep workers safe from smoke. The first death directly linked to the poor air quality was also recorded on 2 January. An elderly woman had been travelling from Brisbane to Canberra by plane, when she exited the plane onto the smoke-flooded tarmac, she suffered respiratory distress and then died. On 2 January 2020, the ACT declared a state of alert; that was extended on 12 January as the merged Dunns Road fire burnt from the Territory's south-west border. Smoke from nearby bushfires continued to severely impact Canberra's air quality intermittently throughout January 2020. From at least 6 January 2020 a bushfire near Hospital Hill in the Namadgi National Park had started; it was extinguished on 9 January. On 22 January 2020 a bushfire started in Redwood Forest; it reached emergency level, threatening and . The next day a second bushfire started, the Kallaroo Fire, which later during the day merged with the Redwood Forest fire forming the Beard Fire; the fire jumped the Molonglo River and threatened the suburbs of , and Oaks Estate as it burnt . Canberra Airport was closed for a day. The fire destroyed one facility, four outbuildings, and three vehicles. On 27 January 2020 a bushfire in the Orroral Valley in the Namadgi National Park started. ACT Emergency Services Minister Mick Gentleman reported, on behalf of the Department of Defence, that the fire had been started by a landing light on a Defence helicopter, while it was conducting routine aerial reconnaissance and ground clearance work to support local firefighters. By the morning of 28 January the fire had grown to and was from the town of Tharwa. An emergency warning was declared for Tharwa and the southern suburbs of Canberra ‚Äì particularly Banks, Gordon, and Conder ‚Äî just after 1:30 pm AEST on 28 January. Chief Minister Andrew Barr described the fire as the biggest threat to Canberra since the 2003 Canberra bushfires. At midday on 31 January, Barr declared a state of emergency for the ACT, the first time such action had occurred since the 2003 fires. The Orroral Valley fire was downgraded to \\"advice\\" status on 5 February and declared to be out on 27 February. = Northern Territory = The Northern Territory went through a relatively average annual bushfire season with respect to area of land burnt, in comparison to the scale of bushfires witnessed in other areas of Australia. Despite this, approximately was burnt, an area which contributed significantly to the total area burnt by bushfires in the nation. Five homes were lost to bushfires in the Territory.  Precedents  While the full extent of the current bushfires is yet to be measured, there have been a number of large scale bushfires recorded in Australian history. The widespread 1938-9 fires in Victoria, NSW, South Australia and the ACT similarly gained international headlines when the fires entered the Sydney suburbs, as did the 1994 eastern seaboard fires. The 1851 Black Thursday bushfires shocked colonial Australia with their ferocity, burning a quarter of what is now Victoria (around ). Lesser known is that about , or 15 per cent of Australia's land mass, experienced fire in the summer of 1974‚Äì5. NSW was again badly affected, and three people killed, however the fires were mainly in sparsely populated inland areas. The five most deadly blazes were: Black Saturday 2009 in Victoria (173 people killed, 2000 homes lost); Ash Wednesday 1983 in Victoria and South Australia (75 dead, nearly 1900 homes); Black Friday 1939 in Victoria (71 dead, 650 houses destroyed), Black Tuesday 1967 in Tasmania (62 people and almost 1300 homes); and the Gippsland fires and Black Sunday of 1926 in Victoria (60 people killed over a two-month period). Environmental effects In mid-December 2019, a NASA analysis revealed that since 1 August, the New South Wales and Queensland bushfires had emitted of carbon dioxide (CO). As of 2 January 2020, NASA estimated that of CO had been emitted. By comparison, in 2018, Australia's total carbon emissions were equivalent to of CO. While the carbon emitted by the fires would normally be reabsorbed by forest regrowth, this would take decades and might not happen at all if prolonged drought has damaged the ability of forests to fully regrow. In December 2019, the air quality index (AQI) around Rozelle, a west suburb of Sydney, hit 2,552 or more than 12 times the hazardous level of 200. The level of fine particle matters, known and measured globally as PM2.5, around Sydney was also measured at or the equivalent of 37 cigarettes. On 1 January 2020, the AQI around Monash, a suburb of Canberra, was measured at 4,650, or more than 23 times hazardous level and peaked at 7,700. On New Year's Day 2020 in New Zealand, a blanket of smoke from the Australian fires covered the whole South Island, giving the sky an orange-yellow haze. People in Dunedin reported smelling smoke in the air. The MetService stated that the smoke would not have any adverse affects on the weather or temperature in the country. The smoke moved over the North Island the following day, but began breaking up and was not as intense as it was over the South Island the previous day; meanwhile, wind from the South Pacific Ocean dissipated the smoke over the South Island. The smoke affected glaciers in the country, giving a brown tint to the snow. On 5 January 2020, more smoke wafted over the North Island, turning the sky in Auckland orange. By 7 January 2020, the smoke was carried approximately across the South Pacific Ocean to Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay.  Ecological effects  Prof. Chris Dickman, a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science from the University of Sydney, estimated on 8 January 2020 that more than one billion animals were killed by bushfires in Australia; while more than 800 million animals perished in New South Wales. The estimate was based on a 2007 World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) report on impacts of land clearing on Australian wildlife in New South Wales that provided estimates of mammal, bird and reptile population density in the region. Dickman's calculation had been based on highly conservative estimates and the actual mortality would therefore be higher. The figure provided by Dickman included mammals (excluding bats), birds, and reptiles; and did not include frogs, insects, or other invertebrates. Other estimates, which include animals like bats, amphibians and invertebrates, also put the number killed at over a billion. A 2020 study estimated that at least 3 billion terrestrial vertebrates alone were displaced or killed by the fires, with reptiles (which tend to have higher population densities in affected areas compared to other vertebrates) comprising over two-thirds of the affected, with birds, mammals, and amphibians comprising the other third. Ecologists feared some endangered species were driven to extinction by the fires. Though bushfires are not uncommon in Australia, they are usually of a lower scale and intensity that only affect small parts of the overall distribution of where species live. Animals that survived a bushfire could still find suitable habitats in the immediate vicinity, which was not the case when an entire distribution is decimated in an intense event. Besides immediate mortality from the fires, there were on-going mortalities after the fires from starvation, lack of shelter, and attacks from predators such as foxes and feral cats that are attracted to fire-affected areas to hunt. At least one species, the Kate's leaf-tailed gecko, had the entirety of its habitat burnt by the fires, while the long-footed potoroo had over 82% habitat burnt. While many endangered species managed to persist through the fires, albeit with severely impacted populations that will not survive in the long-term without major human influence, other species such as the Kangaroo Island micro-trapdoor spider and the Kangaroo Island assassin spider have not been sighted since. On Kangaroo Island, Australia's third-largest island and known as Australia's \\"Galapagos Island\\", a third of the island was burnt. Large parts of the island are designated as protected areas and host animals such as sea lions, penguins, kangaroos, koalas, pygmy possums, southern brown bandicoots, Ligurian bees, Kangaroo Island dunnarts and various birds including glossy black cockatoos. NASA estimated that the number of dead koalas could be as high as 25,000 or about half the total population of the species on the island. A quarter of the beehives of the Ligurian honey bees that inhabited the Island were believed to have been destroyed. Both the Kangaroo Island dunnart and Kangaroo Island subspecies of the glossy black cockatoo are endangered and are only found on Kangaroo Island. Before the fires, there were fewer than 500 Kangaroo Island dunnarts and about 380 Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoos. The loss of an estimated 8,000 koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) caused concerns. They are considered vulnerable to extinction, though not functionally extinct.  Archaeological effects  Fire damaged 500-year-old rock art at Anaiwan in northern New South Wales, with the intense and rapid temperature change of the fires cracking the granite rock. This caused panels of art to fracture and fall off the huge boulders that contain the galleries of art. At the Budj Bim heritage areas in Victoria the Gunditjmara people reported that when they inspected the site after fires moved across it, they found ancient channels and ponds that were newly visible after the fires burned much of the vegetation off the landscape. After fire burnt out a creek on a property at Cobargo, NSW, on New Year's Eve, a boomerang carved by stone artefact was found. Domestic response =New South Wales= The two primary firefighting agencies for New South Wales, Fire and Rescue NSW and the NSW Rural Fire Service, formed the bulk of the primary response to the fires, mobilising thousands of firefighters and several hundred firefighting vehicles. They were heavily supported by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Forestry Corporation of NSW, who hold jurisdiction over national parks and forests across the state. Additional local firefighting resources were also used from agencies such as Air Services Australia and Sydney Trains. Numerous interstate agencies deployed firefighting resources into New South Wales, including several hundred firefighters from the Victorian Country Fire Authority, along with crews from the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the South Australian Country Fire Service, the South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service, the South Australian Department of Environment and Water, and the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service. Despite the substantial loss of property and loss of life, firefighters have so far managed to save over 16,000 structures from direct fire impact in addition to countless lives. Multiple other New South Wales emergency services assisted in the response, including NSW Ambulance that provided ongoing pre-hospital care to victims of the fires including firefighters, NSW Police that worked to ensure public safety was maintained through road closures and evacuations and the NSW State Emergency Service that assisted with logistical support. With brush-tailed rock-wallabies and much of the indigenous wildlife population in parts of New South Wales were left without food or water, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service airdropped approximately vegetables on the known habitats. A joint operation by the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and NSW Rural Fire Service was mounted to protect the critically endangered Wollemia pines growing in Wollemi National Park. Fire retardant was dropped from air tankers, and an irrigation system was installed on the ground by specialist firefighters, who were lowered into the area by winches from helicopters. =Commonwealth= On 24 December 2019, the Morrison Government announced that volunteer firefighters employed in the Commonwealth public service would be offered at least 20 working days paid leave. On 29 December 2019, it announced that volunteer firefighters who have been called out for more than 10 days would be able to receive financial compensation. On 4 January 2020, it announced that it would lease four waterbombing planes including two long-range DC-10s and two medium-range for use by state and territory governments. On 5 January 2020, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, funded initially with 2 billion, under the control of former Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Andrew Colvin. Military On 5 December 2019, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) commenced Operation Bushfire Assist to support state fire services in logistics, planning, capability, and operational support. Activities the ADF has undertaken as part of the Operation have included Air Force aircraft transporting firefighters and their equipment interstate, Army and Navy helicopters transporting firefighters, conducting night fire mapping, impact assessments and search and rescue flights, use of various defence facilities as coordination and information centres and for catering and accommodation for firefighters, liaison between state and federal government services, reloading and refuelling for waterbombing aircraft, deployment of personnel to assess fire damage and severity, and provision of humanitarian supplies. On 31 December 2019, the Defence Minister announced the ADF would provide assistance to East Gippsland, in particular the isolated high-fire-risk town of Mallacoota, deploying helicopters including a CH-47 Chinook and C-27J Spartan military transport aircraft to be based at RAAF Base East Sale and two naval vessels, and , with the vessels also able to assist in south-east New South Wales if required. On 1 January 2020, the ADF deployed additional military staff establishing the Victorian Joint Task Force 646 (Army Reserve 4th Brigade) and the following day the New South Wales Joint Task Force 1110 (Army Reserve 5th Brigade). On 3 January 2020, HMAS Choules and MV Sycamore evacuated civilians from Mallacoota bound for Westernport. On 4 January 2020, following a meeting of the National Security Committee, the Morrison Government announced a compulsory call-out of Army Reserve brigades to deploy up to 3,000 reserve personnel full-time to assist with in the Operation. Additionally, Defence announced that it would deploy HMAS Adelaide to support other Navy ships in evacuations and relief, as well additional Chinook helicopters and military transport aircraft to RAAF Base East Sale. The same day, Chinook helicopters evacuated civilians from Omeo; and Spartan aircraft evacuated civilians from Mallacoota on 5 January. =Community organisations= The response of volunteer organisations and charities was also considerable, with WIRES Wildlife Rescue working to rescue and treat injured wildlife, Rapid Relief Team Australia raising money for victims, providing meals for firefighters and assisting with two bulk water tankers, Team Rubicon Australia providing debris removal and helping with the cleanup of fire affected areas, the Animal Welfare League fundraising and assisting injured animals, and St John Ambulance Australia and Australian Red Cross providing support at evacuation centres across New South Wales. On 1 December 2019 WWF-Australia launched the \\"Towards Two Billion Trees\\" plan to aid the koala bushfire recovery. It aims to stop excessive tree-clearing, protect the existing trees and forests, and restore native habitat that has been lost. The ten-point plan for the next ten years foresees to grow 1.56 billion new trees and save 780 million trees. On 4 January 2020 Architects Assist was established, representing over 600 Australian architecture firms providing their services pro bono to the individuals and communities affected by the bushfires (together with approximately 1500 architecture student volunteers). International response Political figures from outside Australia including Donald Trump, Cory Booker, Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Bernie Sanders, Greta Thunberg, and Elizabeth Warren all publicly commented about the fires. People in the entertainment industry such as Tina Arena, Patricia Arquette, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Ellen DeGeneres, Selena Gomez, Halsey, Nicole Kidman, Lizzo, Bette Midler, Pink, Margot Robbie, Paul Stanley, Jay Park, Jonathan Van Ness, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge also made statements about the fires. Some of the aforementioned people have also donated or raised funds. On 4 January 2020, Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh sent a message of condolence to Governor-General David Hurley, sending their \\"thoughts and prayers to all Australians at this difficult time\\". The Queen indicated in her message that she was \\"deeply saddened\\" to hear of the fires and their devastating impact on the country, and expressed her thanks to emergency service workers. On 8 January 2020, Prince Charles issued a video message expressing his despair at the \\"appalling horror\\" of the fires. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex also issued messages to Australia, Princess Mary of Denmark, who is of Australian heritage, published an open letter where she and her husband, Crown Prince Frederik, expressed their condolences to the victims and respect for the firefighters. =International aid= ;Canada Four deployments totalling 87 Canadian firefighters were sent through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. It was the first time since 2009 that Canadian personnel were deployed to Australia. The Canadian government also sent a CC-17 plane of the Royal Canadian Air Force with 15 personnel on 27 January to further aid with transport and provide airlift support. ;Fiji The government of Fiji deployed the Fiji Military Forces humanitarian assistance and disaster relief platoon and engineers to assist in the bush fire rehabilitation. ;France On 6 January, French President Emmanuel Macron stated he could help out with the bushfires. A team of five French firefighting experts arrived in Australia on 9 January to determine possible options for French and European support. ;Indonesia On 1 February, (Satuan Setingkat Peloton) SST Zeni, an Army engineering platoon unit, would be dispatched to Australia. A total of 38 personnel, consist of 26 army engineers, 6 Korps Marinir personnel, 4 Air Force facility construction personnel, and 2 TNI Medical Department personnel. The team landed in RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales on the same day, according to the Indonesian Embassy on 3 February 2020, the troops will be deployed on the Blue Mountains area. ;Japan On 15 January, the Japanese government sent two C-130 aircraft of the JASDF, along with 70 other Self-Defense Force personnel to assist in transport and other efforts in combating the bushfires. The aircraft left Komaki Air Base and flew to RAAF Base Richmond in New South Wales the next day. ;Malaysia On 5 January, Malaysia offered its assistance through a statement by Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail. On 13 January, Malaysia officially deployed over forty firefighters to assist with the bushfires. Twenty others from government agencies would also be involved with the mission. ;New Zealand Over fifty New Zealanders were deployed to Australia in both direct fire fighting and support roles. In January 2020, New Zealand also deployed elements of the Royal New Zealand Air Force and New Zealand Army including three NH90 helicopters, two Army combat engineer sections, and a command element. A specialist six person animal disaster response team were deployed by non-profit Animal Evac New Zealand on 8 January to New South Wales, assisting with wildlife rescue and supported by SAFE. The team was the first international specialist animal rescuers to arrive and included vets, animal management officers as well as animal disaster and technical animal rescue experts. A second team of four arrived on 13 January. The teams partnered with local wildlife centres to successfully rescue and relocate several injured animals. as well as advising residents in fire danger zones on their animal evacuation plans. ;Papua New Guinea The Government of Papua New Guinea offered to send 1,000 military and other personnel to Australia to assist with the response to the bushfires. Australia accepted 100 Papua New Guinea Defence Force personnel. ;The Philippines The Philippine Red Cross pledged to donate $100K to Australia, while various Filipino personalities pledged support for the victims of the bush fires. The women-led Teduray people of Maguindanao initiated a sacred rain-making ritual for Australian victims, calling on the fire goddess Frayag Sarif's intercession to bring rain to the country. ;Singapore Singapore deployed two Chinook helicopters and 42 Singapore Armed Forces personnel stationed at Oakey Army Aviation Centre to RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria. ;United Arab Emirates The United Arab Emirates sent 200 volunteers from the Emirates Red Crescent to help fight the fire, including Emirati astronaut Sultan Al Neyadi. A Twitter campaign and hashtag #mateshelpmates was launched by the Dubai Expo 2020 aiming to raise donations to help those affected by the fires in Australia. To increase awareness, Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the world's tallest tower, lit up in solidarity with Australia. ;United States A Huron‚ÄìManistee National Forests employee, on secondment to Australia, holds a kangaroo joey. The United States deployed 362 firefighters, including 222 from the United States Department of the Interior, to Australia to help combat the fires. Firefighters from other parts of the US also helped with the fires., On 23 January, three US firefighters died in the crash of a C-130 fire fighting aircraft, north east of Cooma in New South Wales. ;Other countries Several other countries have offered assistance: *On 7 January, Denmark offered 50 firefighters via the Danish Emergency Management Agency that were on a standby and could move on a short notice, but it was deemed unnecessary by the Australian Government, which at that point said that they had sufficient material, manpower and organisation to deal with the remaining fires. *On 6 January 2020, the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs responded to the Civil Protection Mechanism (EUCPM) and prepared 70 firefighters to be deployed in Australia through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) of the European Union. Australia rejected this, as well as the EU call for more bushfire help. *Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu tweeted that Turkey is ready to provide all required assistance, while Turkey's Melbourne consulate donated $14,500 to Queensland Fire and Emergency Services. *The Foreign Ministry of Ukraine notified Australia that the Ukrainian government is ready to send 200 seasoned firefighters to help fight the fires. Ukraine's Foreign Minister also noted that \\"The fires in Australia have not left the Ukrainians indifferent.\\" *Some Pacific nations have also stated that they could send some aid.  Causes  Australia is one of the most fire-prone countries on earth, and bushfires form part of the natural cycle of its landscapes. However, factors such as climate trends, weather patterns and vegetation management by humans can all contribute to the intensity of bushfire seasons, and the most destructive fires in Australian history have usually been preceded by extreme high temperatures, low relative humidity and strong winds, which combine to create ideal conditions for the rapid spread of fire. Scientific experts and land management agencies agree that severely below average fuel moisture attributed to record-breaking temperatures and drought, accompanied by severe fire weather, are the primary causes of the 2019‚Äì20 Australian bushfire season, and that these are likely to have been exacerbated by long-term trends of warmer and dryer weather observed over the Australian land mass. Nonetheless, the political nature of many of the crisis and its associated issues has also resulted in the circulation of large amounts of disinformation regarding the causes of the fire activity, to the neglect of credible scientific research, expert opinion, and previous government inquiries. =Ignition= The major cause of ignition of fires during the 2019‚Äì20 fire crisis in NSW and Victoria is reported to be lightning strikes. According to ABC News, arson has been of little impact ‚Äì accounting for around 1% of NSW fires and 0.3% of Victorian fires by 18 January 2020. The NSW Rural Fire Service referred numerous individuals to the NSW Police; 24 people were charged with arson, allegedly starting bushfires. Queensland police reported that 114 out of 1068 fires \\"were found to be deliberately or maliciously lit\\". =Drought and temperature= A likely contributor to the bushfire crisis was the ongoing drought in eastern Australiathe most severe on record for some fire affected areas. Exacerbating the effects of diminished rainfall in this drought has been a record breaking run of above average monthly temperatures, lasting 36 months to October 2019. The combination of heat and drought caused critical low fuel moisture content, with Victoria Country Fire Authority Response Controller Gavin Freeman stating that the \\"underlying dryness\\" of the bush has led to exceptionally high fire danger. Although Australia has naturally experienced high rainfall variability and hot summers for millennia, the country has experienced an increase of nearly in average annual temperatures since 1900, decreases in average rainfall in southeastern Australia since 1990, with the country's worst recorded droughts occurring within the 21st century. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) stated that on account of projected future climate change, hot days will become more frequent and hotter (very high confidence), and the time in drought is projected to increase over southern Australia (high confidence). In October 2019 David Littleproud, the Australian Minister for Water Resources, stated that he \\"totally accepts\\" the link between climate change and drought in Australia, as someone who has experienced it first hand. =Climate change= Climate and fire experts agree that climate change is a factor known to result in increased fire frequency and intensity in south east Australia, and although it should not be considered as the sole cause of the 2019‚Äì20 Australian fires, climate change is considered very likely to have contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of the fires. The crisis has led to calls for more action to combat climate change. In December 2019, Australia had been ranked worst in terms of policy, and sixth worst overall, out of 57 countries assessed on the Climate Change Performance Index, with the Morrison government labelled \\"an increasingly regressive force.\\" Originally downplaying the role of climate change in causing the fires, Prime Minister Morrison eventually conceded that climate change was one of \\"many factors\\" involved and added that Australia was \\"playing its part\\" in the international effort against climate change. That said, the Morrison Government has received some criticism on its 2030 emission reduction targets. Several members of the governing Liberal Party were criticised internationally for climate change denial, with backbencher Craig Kelly called \\"disgraceful\\" during an interview with the hosts of Good Morning Britain for denying any link between climate change and the fires, and the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation receiving \\"angry\\" feedback from listeners after airing an interview in which former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott said the world was \\"in the grip of a climate cult.\\" Prior to the worst phases of the bushfires, in an interview in November 2019, former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the party had struggled with the issue of climate change denial for more than a decade because it had become an issue of \\"identity\\" rather than fact, and criticised News Corporation for being a \\"long-time promoter\\" of climate denialism. The chief executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia said bushfire preparations had been \\"stymied\\" by the federal government, because \\"there are people within government who firmly believe there is no such thing as climate change or that human beings don't have an impact upon it, and they are adamant that no extra work or extra effort should ever happen because they don't believe in climate change.\\" The NSW Bushfire Inquiry into the causes of the fires published their findings in August 2020. The Inquiry found that climate change played a major role in the summer's fires. =Disputed causes= Throughout the crisis, many people primarily blamed climate change, in agreement with the scientific community, using the event to criticise the government on climate policy. Protests were held in the midst of the crisis, although some were criticised for their timing and use of resources, including by the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews. However, conservative politicians and media primarily blamed a lack of prescribed burning and fire break management, although such assertion has subsequently been heavily criticised and disproven by scientific experts. Accompanying this was the assertion that environmental groups were responsible for the crisis by inhibiting prescribed burning, despite environmental groups holding relatively negligible political power compared to the Liberal and National parties. Furthermore, the amount of prescribed burning in southeastern Australia has been stated to have increased in recent years, following the recommendation for increased prescribed burning from the 2009 Black Saturday Royal Commission. Experts suggested that prescribed burning has been more difficult to achieve given recent trends towards warmer and dryer conditions. Experts have also cast skepticism on the effectiveness of fuel reduction treatments, citing research that suggests that prescribed burning does little to stop bushfire and save property in south east Australia, with climate and weather conditions having primary influence. The effect of previous prescribed burns in slowing the 2019‚Äì20 Australian fires and assisting fire suppression efforts remains unclear, although in many instances the fires were observed to burn through cleared agricultural land and forest recently affected by unplanned and prescribed burns, owing to the extreme weather conditions and dryness of vegetation. Of particular note, the damaging Currowan fire burnt through a large area of Morton National Park subject in 2017 to one of the largest prescribed burns ever successfully conducted in NSW. In relation to the blame of prescribed burning, Professor of Pyrogeography and Fire Science David Bowman stated \\"These are very tired and very old conspiracy theories that get a run after most major fires,\\" and that they were \\"an obvious attempt to deflect the conversation away from climate change.\\" In the lead up to another Federal inquiry into state land management, Professor of Bushfire Behaviour and Management Trent Penman added \\"If there was a silver bullet on bushfires we'd have found it by now, after the 51 [bushfire] inquiries since 1939,\\" and that \\"blindly putting money into prescribed burning won't stop the problem\\". Despite evidence to suggest that fuel loads played a minimal role in the 2019‚Äì20 Australian fires, there are calls to open up Australian protected lands to industry, particularly logging and grazing, to reduce fire fuel, with these calls having so far mainly stemmed from individuals and businesses with interests in such industries, and have resulted in the circulation of large amounts of disinformation. = Misinformation and contested reporting = Incorrect reporting and social media claims about the extent of the fires, its precedents and causes, and matters like funding of fire fighting services have been circulated during the fire season. Media outlets of differing political allegiances have also disputed each other's coverage. ; Misleading maps and graphics: A number of maps giving an exaggerated impression of Australia's fires went viral online, and were published by major news outlets. It was reported by news.com.au that \\"Some bushfire maps have been criticised for misleading people about the location and size of the fires, with a map used by the ABC in the US appearing to show the entire east coast of Australia on fire, as well as a strange line of fires through the centre of the country... \\"Fake and misleading images of Australia‚Äôs bushfire crisis are being circulated; news.com.au; 8 January 2020 One image created by Anthony Hearsey spread widely on Twitter and by celebrities including Rihanna was wrongly interpreted as a map showing the live extent of fires, when in fact it sought to present one month of data of locations where fire was detected, according to NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System.Australia fires: Misleading maps and pictures go viral; BBC NSW 7 January 2020 Maps showing \\"hotspots\\" were spread online as comprehensive fire maps, giving an exaggerated impression of the extent of fires.The truth behind the 'misleading' fire maps that have gone viral during Australia's bushfire crisis; Australian Broadcasting Corporation; 8 January 2020 Photographs of previous Australian bushfires were also being wrongly published as current and maps that exaggerate the extent of the fires, or include both past and present fires. ; Exaggerated extent of arson: The Guardian newspaper wrote that \\"Bot and troll accounts are involved in a 'disinformation campaign' exaggerating the role of arson in Australia's bushfire disaster, social media analysis suggests... The false claims are, in some cases, used to undermine the link between the current bushfires and the longer, more intense fire seasons brought about by climate change.\\" The report cited a study by Queensland University of Technology senior lecturer on social network analysis Dr Timothy Graham, who examined content published on the #arsonemergency hashtag on Twitter. Giovanni Torre wrote for The Telegraph that \\"Australia's bushfire crisis has led to what appears to be a deliberate misinformation campaign started by climate-change deniers claiming arson is the primary cause of the ongoing fires... Social media accounts, including Donald Trump Jr's Twitter account, circulated the false claim that 183 people had been arrested for arson during the Australian fire crisis...\\" 183 people were subject to legal action, but only 24 for \\"deliberately-lit bushfires\\". An opinion piece for The Conversation website stated \\"In the first week of 2020, hashtag #ArsonEmergency became the focal point of a new online narrative surrounding the bushfire crisis. The message: the cause is arson, not climate change. Police and bushfire services (and some journalists) have contradicted this claim [...] We‚Äôve observed both troll and bot accounts spouting disinformation regarding the bushfires on Twitter.\\" The article also argued that a disinformation was underway to downplay the role of climate change in causing the fires. The vice.com website wrote \\"Research conducted by the Queensland University of Technology showed that Twitter accounts with the characteristics of bots or trolls were spreading disinformation about the responsibility of arsonists and Greens.\\" The Guardian accused News Corp of furthering arson disinformation. ; Funding for the Rural Fire Service: Incorrect reports were disseminated that the New South Wales Government, led by Premier Gladys Berejiklian, had cut funding to fire services. NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, in response to the funding cut claims, stated \\"that it is rubbish, it is misinformation, it's being misrepresented and I think it is disgracefully being misrepresented here today\\". He also stated that \\"not only has our budget not been cut, we are enjoying record budgets. We have got more money today than we have ever had before in the history of the organisation\\". Debate and controversy continue to surround previous funding cuts to fire management agencies, with other reports noting recent funding cuts to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which is responsible for the planning and enforcement of prescribed burns in NSW national parks. ; Hazard reduction activities: The Guardian newspaper has disputed claims that Greens have blocked hazard reduction, writing: \\"Despite the evidence a claim persists that a major contributing factor of Australia‚Äôs devastating fire season... is not climate change but a conspiracy by environmentalists to 'lock up' national parks and prevent hazard reduction activities such as prescribed burning and clearing of the forest floor\\". ; Other false reports: * Fires would clear land to benefit a high-speed rail project. * ISIS was somehow responsible or involved. * The fires were a false flag operation deliberately lit by climate change activists. Political response 2019‚Äì20 NSW bushfire state memorial held at Sydney Olympic Park Ongoing political and social debate has surrounded many aspects of the 2019‚Äì20 Australian fire crisis, particularly regarding the causes and future prevention of such fire activity, and the role of climate change. Amid a conservative government that has received noted criticism for its climate change inaction and support for fossil fuel industries, growing acknowledgement within the nation's politics and society of the issue of climate change in Australia resulted in a highly political agenda to the crisis response. The governing Liberal and National parties, accompanied by numerous news outlets associated with climate change denial, firmly deflected responsibility away from the record-breaking drought affecting the country and its associated links to climate change observations and projections. Conversely, scientific experts have asserted the influence of climate change, drought, prolonged fire weather, and contextualised the limited role of prescribed burning and arson in influencing the crisis. The political and social response to the crisis has been marked notably by political blame shifting, the circulation of large amounts of disinformation, and political disregard for scientific research, expert opinion, and previous government inquiries. On 24 January, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons announced that a state memorial for people impacted by the bushfires in New South Wales, which was held on 23 February at Sydney Olympic Park. = Criticism = A protest in Brisbane held in response to the bushfires Further controversy has surrounded Prime Minister Scott Morrison for taking an overseas family holiday to Hawaii, United States, during the bushfires. These criticisms also applied to New South Wales Minister for Emergency Services David Elliot, who went for a holiday in Europe. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was also criticised for holidaying on a cruise ship while fires were active in the state. While travelling throughout fire-affected towns in New South Wales, Morrison was filmed attempting to shake the hands of two residents in Cobargo who had refused to shake his outstretched hand. Morrison was criticised for grabbing and then shaking their hands despite their refusals. In an interview with Andrew Constance, NSW Liberal MP for Bega, Constance described the incident stating \\"the locals probably gave him the welcome he probably deserved\\". Morrison did not appear concerned with the criticism, later stating, \\"people are angry, and if people want to direct that at me, that is up to them\\". On 4 January, volunteer firefighter Paul Parker, from Nelligen, rose to fame after he stopped his firetruck next to a Channel 7 news crew, and used colourful language to denounce what he perceived as an inadequate response by Morrison. The video became popular in the days after. Soon after, Morrison released a video on behalf of the Liberal Party regarding deployment of military assets to respond to the bushfire crisis, for which he was widely criticised. The video was perceived as an inappropriate and an untimely political advertisement, with former ABC broadcaster Barrie Cassidy calling it \\"absolutely obscene,\\" journalist Peter van Onselen saying it was \\"beyond inappropriate\\", and British political commentator Piers Morgan characterising it as \\"one of the most tone-deaf things I've ever seen a country's leader put out during a crisis.\\" The Australian Defence Association, a public-interest watchdog dealing with defence issues, said the video was \\"milking ADF support to civil agencies fighting bushfires\\" and was a \\"clear breach of the (reciprocal) non-partisanship convention applying to both the ADF & Ministers/MPs.\\" NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Fitzsimmons said it was \\"disappointing\\" to learn of the announcement of military assistance from the media and not the government directly. Morrison was further criticised for a \\"donate\\" button on a Liberal Party website page which misleadingly led to a donations page for the Liberal Party itself, rather than bushfire relief; the button was later removed. =Royal commission and other inquiries= On 12 January 2020, the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison outlined a proposal to establish a royal commission into the bushfires. Requiring the approval of the state and territory governments, the Commonwealth Government drafted terms of reference. A number of organisations raised objections to the commission of inquiry, citing cost, length and the emotionally exhausting process; and that previous inquiries had failed to implement many of their recommendations. On 20 February 2020, Morrison released the letters patent confirming the establishment of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, chaired by Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin (Retd), a former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, and supported by the Hon. Dr Annabelle Bennett and Professor Andrew Macintosh, a specialist in climate risk and impact management. On 5 December 2019 David Littleproud, the minister for natural disasters and emergency management, announced that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy would conduct an inquiry into the ‚Äòefficacy of past and current vegetation and land management policy, practice and legislation and their effect on the intensity and frequency of bushfires and subsequent risk to property, life and the environment‚Äô. On 14 January 2020, the Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews, announced an independent investigation into the 2019‚Äì2020 bushfire season in Victoria. On 31 January 2020, the NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian announced an independent investigation to review the causes, preparation and response to the bushfires in New South Wales. =Other names= The term black summer has become a common term for the 201920 bushfire season, for example, the Australian Red Cross uses this phrase as a blanket term for the fires. An episode of Four Corners titled Black Summer comprised an audio-visual media collation of material provided by people impacted by bushfires and was broadcast in early February 2020. The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, in an address to the Australian Parliament labelled the bushfire season as the black summer as he outlined a proposal to establish a royal commission into the bushfires: Donations Philanthropists, corporate organisations, celebrities, and sportspeople donated to various fundraising appeals for bushfire victims and firefighters; estimated to total 500 million as of 19 January 2020. Following a representative sample, a report issued by the Fundraising Institute of Australia estimated that 53 percent of all adult Australians donated to a bushfire appeal. Andrew Forrest and his wife, Nicola, donated A$70 million; and the Paul Ramsay Foundation donated A$30 million. In November, James Packer pledged 1 million to support the NSWRFS. As the impact of the bushfire season spread, the Crown Resorts Foundation and the Packer family Foundation pledged a further 4 million to volunteer fire services in NSW, Victoria and Western Australia ‚Äì all states in which Crown has resorts. The Murdoch family donated A$5 million; the Micky and Madeleine Arison Family Foundation, A$1.5 million; and donations of A$1 million each were received from the Pratt Foundation, John and Pauline Gandel, Mike Cannon-Brookes, Scott Farquhar, and the Haines and the Perich families. Justin Hemmes donated A$500,000. Corporate organisations to make donations or pledges included the Seven Group and Kerry Stokes' private investment firm, ACE Capital Equity, a combined total of A$10 million; Tim Cook from Apple, an undisclosed amount; the NAB and News Corp Australia, A$5 million each; Coles Group, A$4 million (of which A$3 million was in gift cards); the Australian Football League, A$2.5 million; BHP, A$2 million; Westpac and Woolworths, A$1.5 million each; Facebook, A$1.25 million; and Amazon, the ANZ Bank, the Atlassian Foundation, the Commonwealth Bank, Orica, Qantas, and Rio Tinto, A$1 million each; and Canva and the San Diego Zoo, A$500,000 each. Leonardo DiCaprio donated 3 million (3.4 million) via Earth Alliance; Kylie Jenner, 1 million; Ellen DeGeneres, A$1.5 million; and donations of A$1 million were received from Sir Elton John and Chris Hemsworth and family. Pink donated US$500,000 (720,000), tweeting that she is \\"totally devastated watching what is happening in Australia right now.\\" Metallica donated 750,000; and donations of 500,000 were received from Nicole Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, Kylie and Danii Minogue and their family, and Bette Midler. The Wiggles performed a concert on 17 and 18 January, and on 16 February at Stadium Australia in Sydney, the Fire Fight Australia concert featured local and international acts. Tennis players, led by Nick Kyrgios, pledged to donate money for every ace served during the Australian summer of tennis. Many cricket players, such as international representatives Chris Lynn, Glenn Maxwell, D'Arcy Short, Matthew Renshaw and Fawad Ahmed pledged to donate money for every wicket and/or six during the remainder of the Australian cricket season. Shane Warne and Jeff Thomson, retired Australian cricketers, donated their baggy green Test cricket caps and Thomson also donated a playing vest for online auction. Warne's cap was purchased by the Commonwealth Bank with a bid of A$1,007,500; and Russell Crowe's Rabbitohs cap was auctioned with a winning bid in excess of A$500,000. Footballer Mathew Ryan, goalkeeper for Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion and the Australia national team announced he'll donate $500 for every registered save by an English Premier League goalkeeper on the weekend of 11‚Äì12 January 2020. Australian stars who were playing in the 2019‚Äì20 NBA season collectively donated in excess of A$1 million; and Lewis Hamilton, a Formula One driver, donated 500,000. Comedian Celeste Barber launched a fundraising appeal with a target of raising 15,000, however it went on to raise over 50 million, making it the largest fundraiser ever held on Facebook. A telethon conducted with the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks raised more than 2 million. Irish YouTuber Jacksepticeye raised over $200,000 on 26 January through a charity live stream. F1 Delta Time, a blockchain game developed and published by Animoca Brands, raised 51 ether (ETH) in its charity auction by selling the \\"Australia Edition 2020\\" non-fungible token, which is a digital race car that is officially licensed by Formula One. All of the proceeds were split evenly between the NSW Rural Fire Service Association, NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service, and Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund. = Scams and fraud = Multiple media outlets reported that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) received 86 reports of bushfire-related scams. It came as increased requests for cash driven donations leveraging crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe, or as a result of false links posted on Twitter. It prompted some organisations to provide a list of approved and vetted charities online to reduce fraud.

The portrait of the French gynaecologist and art collector Samuel Jean de Pozzi was Sargent's first large portrait of a male subject: it measures . It was the first work that Sargent exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. It was acquired by Armand Hammer in 1967, and has been held by the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles since 1991. The aesthetic and charismatic Dr Pozzi was painted around the age of 35, but the composition departs markedly from the usual formal academic portraits of medical doctors in sombre professional clothing. Pozzi is depicted standing informally \\"at home\\", dressed a voluminous full- length bright scarlet robe de chambre, tied with a red cord at the waist with provocatively dangling tassel. His robe is reminiscent of a monastic habit, and recalls Renaissance portraits of Catholic popes and cardinals, but also resembles a woman's full-length tea gown. He is standing back on his left leg, with his head also turned to his left; his right foot is poking out from the hem of his rob, shod in a red slipper with white embroidery. The intense red colour is repeated in the floor covering and the velvet curtains in the background, also gathered with a cord. The dominant colour may be a reference to the blood of his patients spilled in his professional activities as a surgeon, against which the hands and face of the bearded young doctor stand out, and the white ruffles of his shirt peeking out at the neck and wrists. The long elegant fingers of Pozzi's hands are clearly depicted, the left hand clasping a closure at his breast and the right loosening the cord at his left hip. The attention paid to his hands compliments his surgical skill, but also alludes to the sensuality of man who insisted on performing intimate manual examinations of his female patients. At the time the painting was made, his watery eyes and mottled knuckles could have been intended to imply was suffering from neurasthenia. Sargent chose not to exhibit his larger-than- life-size portrait of Pozzi in Paris, perhaps to protect Pozzi's reputation: it was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1882 under the title A Portrait, and then at the first Les XX exhibition in Brussels in 1884. It was the first of his works to be exhibited in London, before he moved there in 1884 following the scandal caused in Paris by his sensuous Portrait of Madame X. The portrait was retained by Dr Pozzi until his death in 1918, and then kept by his widow and later inherited by his son, Jean Pozzi.

He was successfully elected to the Egyptian House of Representatives in the 2015 election in the individual component of the second phase of the election, along with 13 others in the alliance. On 14 February 2019, Tantawi was one of the 16 members of parliament (MPs) who voted against the parliamentary motion for amending the Egyptian constitution, that led to the 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum in April 2019. The motion was supported by 485 members. =Sisi 2022 departure proposal= On 3 November 2019, Tantawi posted a YouTube video in which he proposed that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi leave power in 2022, rather than in 2024 as defined in the 2019 constitutional amendment. Tantawi later discussed his video with Mada Masr, stating that his aim was to protect Egypt from the \\"imminent danger\\" of el-Sisi continuing in power too long, that it was consistent with el-Sisi's promises, and that this should satisfy el- Sisi's supporters. Tantawi also submitted a formal request under parliamentary procedure to Ali Abdel Aal, Speaker of the House of Representatives, proposing that 12 parliamentary committees be created to \\"generate a national dialogue about the political, economic and social problems facing the country\\". He described his aim as a serious attempt to solve \\"the real crisis Egypt is living through, which authorities should pay attention to before it is too late\\" and that the proposal would help to \\"absorb public outrage\\". Tantawi expressed his worry that a violent reaction by authorities to his initiative would discourage \\"the people\\" from choosing political methods of change. On 5 November in a parliamentary sitting, MP Mahmoud Badr called Tantawi's proposal an \\"outright violation of the constitution\\". Speaker Abdel Aal stated that he \\"[does] not have any initiatives\\" and \\"[does] not pay attention to this sort of talk. ...

Among other things, he helped to develop new varieties of chile peppers, pecans, and onions that are still grown in New Mexico. For example, in 1921, he introduced the \\"New Mexico 9\\", a strain of chile pepper which became the genetic ancestor of all New Mexico chiles. Early life and education Garcia was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, on January 20, 1871, to Ricardo Garc√≠a and Refugio Romero de Garc√≠a. He became an orphan at the age of two. He then moved to the US state of New Mexico with his paternal grandmother, Jacoba Garc√≠a. He originally lived in the Mimbres Valley in the southwestern part of the state, but he and his grandmother later moved to the Mesilla Valley. In 1889, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and in 1890, he began taking classes at the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (NMA&MA;, now known as New Mexico State University). He was a member of the school's first graduating class in 1894, receiving a Bachelor of Science degree that year. He went on to attend Cornell University to do graduate research in the 1899‚Äì1900 academic year before returning to the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, where he received his master's degree in 1905 or 1906. Academic career Garcia became the first director of the Agricultural Experiment Station at New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1913 or 1914. He also became a professor of horticulture at the College in 1906. For many years, he was the only faculty member of Mexican descent at the College. According to New Mexico State University, when he became director of the Station, he also became \\"the first Hispanic in the nation to lead a land-grant agricultural research station.\\" Later in his career, he began providing rooms to Mexican-American students at the College in the horticulture farm on campus. He retired from NMA&MA; in 1945 after falling ill. Personal life and death Garcia married Julieta Amador, a member of a prominent Mimbres Valley family, in 1907. They remained married until her death in 1920; Garcia never remarried. He died on August 6, 1948 at McBride‚Äôs Hospital in Las Cruces, New Mexico, three years after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He left his entire estate to New Mexico State University, including $89,000 toward the construction of a dormitory on campus for Hispanic students, and to provide scholarships to these students. The resulting dormitory, Fabi√°n Garc√≠a Memorial Hall, was dedicated on October 17, 1949. In explaining why he left his estate to the University, he said, \\"I want to help poor boys, for I know their hardship.\\" Recognition The Fabian Garcia Science Center at New Mexico State University is named after Garcia, as are the University's Center for International Programs, Garcia Hall, and the building containing their Center for International Programs. In 2005, he was inducted into the American Society for Horticultural Science Hall of Fame.

Euro-American immigrants who met him as they advanced into the region in the early 19th century came to know him and his village as Red Wing.  Early life  Tatanka Mani was born in the mid-18th century. It is likely his Mantanton family (a sub-group of the Mdewakanton) lived near the mouth of the Minnesota River. His father, also known as Red Wing, was leader of their group of Mdewakanton, and he followed in his footsteps. As a young Dakota man, Tatanka Mani displayed great skill in hunting and warfare. Followers believed he possessed supernatural power and the ability to foretell the future through dreams‚Äîan advantage that led him to many victories over tribal enemies. By the end of the 18th century, he had expanded his leadership beyond the Mantanton to a larger group of Mdewakanton, earning a regional reputation in the process. He was known by French traders in the region due to his prominence.  Leadership  In August 1805, 26-year- old Lieutenant Zebulon Pike led the first United States expedition through the upper Mississippi region and met with seven Mdewakanton leaders. In a treaty they signed on September 23, the Dakota granted land in what became the future Minnesota to the United States for first time. According to Pike's account, le Boeuf qui Marche, (the French name for Tatanka Mani) was present. War broke out between the United States and Great Britain in 1812, creating a problem for Tatanka Mani. The Mdewakanton fighter and his followers had earlier been British allies. To sort out matters, he sent his eldest son to join other Dakota leaders in Washington D.C., where they conferred with the U.S. Secretary of War. Red Wing, meanwhile, joined other leaders and met with Great Britain's representative, and the Mdewakanton agreed to fight for the British. Tatanka Mani is believed to have led a unit of Dakota soldiers to Mackinac Island in Michigan, helping to gain a bloodless victory over the Americans there. Upon returning home, however, he listened to his son's stories of the United States' power. By February 1814, the Red Wing Mdewakanton had decided to offer support to the Americans. A letter from British trader Robert Dickson confirms the defection. At war's end, the victorious United States invited Red Wing to a meeting in St. Louis. On July 19, 1815, he agreed to a treaty as \\"Tatangamanee, Walking Buffalo\\", spokesman for the \\"Sioux (Dakota) of the Lakes\\".  Later life  During the war, Tatanka Mani had moved his village south, to the foot of He Mni Ca≈ã in present-day downtown Red Wing, Minnesota. The 300-foot-high riverside promontory was a well known landmark. Growing numbers of whites traveling up the Mississippi stopped at the village, meeting and talking with the aging Mdewakanton leader. In 1825, he took part in important discussions with Ojibwe and United States leaders downriver at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. Tatanka Mani died on March 4, 1829, and was succeeded by Wacouta I, his nephew or stepson.

The Pasquia Hills are sometimes known as the Pasquia Mountains, or The Pas Mountains, which is where the word Mountain comes from in the name. The original cabin belonged to a mining prospector, and was embedded into the side of a hill. Another potential origin of the name comes from the Forest Ranger cabin in the area. From 1906 to 1930, the Dominion Forest Service built over a dozen ranger cabins in the Pasquia National Forest Reserve, including one at the mouth of Mountain Creek, which originates in the Pasquia Hills and empties into the Nitenai River. The cabin was officially called Mountain Creek Cabin, but was often shortened to Mountain Cabin, even in official correspondence. The Mountain Creek Cabin was destroyed by a fire in 1961.

Doux commerce (lit. gentle commerce or soft commerce) is a concept originating from the Age of Enlightenment stating that commerce tends to civilize people, making them less likely to resort to violent or irrational behaviors. This theory has also been referred to as commercial republicanism. Origin and meaning Proponents of the doux commerce theory argued that the spread of trade and commerce will decrease violence, including open warfare. Montesquieu wrote, for example, that \\"wherever the ways of man are gentle, there is commerce; and wherever there is commerce, there the ways of men are gentle\\" and \\"The natural effect of commerce is to lead to peace\\". Thomas Paine argued that \\"If commerce were permitted to act to the universal extent it is capable, it would extirpate the system of war\\". Engaging in trade has been described as \\"civilizing\\" people, which has been related to virtues such as being \\"reasonable and prudent; less given to political and, especially, religious enthusiasm; more reliable, honest, thrifty, and industrious\\". In the greater scheme of things, trade was seen as responsible for ensuring stability, tolerance, reciprocity and fairness. It is not clear when this term was coined. Writings of Jacques Savary, a 17th-century French merchant, have been suggested as one possible origin but similar use has been traced earlier, for example to a Renaissance- era 16th century work by Michel de Montaigne. The basic idea that trade lessens the chance for conflict between nations can be traced as far as writings of Ancient Greece. It became popular in the 17th century writings of some scholars from the Age of Enlightenment, and has been endorsed by thinkers like Montesquieu, Voltaire, Smith, and Hume, as well as Immanuel Kant. It has been discussed in their essays and literary works; for example Voltaire's poem Le Mondain (1736) has been described as endorsing the doux commerce theory. Out of those, Montesquieu has been argued to be the writer most responsible for the spread of this idea in his influential Spirit of Laws (1748), and the theory is sometimes described as \\"Montesquieu's doux commerce.\\" (although Montesquieu did not use the term itself). In modern scholarship, the term has been analyzed by economist Albert Hirschman in his 1977 work The Passions and the Interests: Political Arguments For Capitalism Before Its Triumph. Hirschman is credited with summarizing the doux commerce argument for the modern readers and popularizing the term in modern discourse. Critique At the same time, even Montesquieu and other proponents of trade from the Enlightenment era have cautioned that some social effects of commerce may be negative, for example commodification, conspicuous consumption, or erosion of interest in non-commercial affairs. Edmund Burke offered the following critique of the doux commerce idea: that it is not commerce that civilizes humans, it is that humans are civilized through culture, which enables them to engage in commerce. This theory led to trade becoming associated with peaceful and inoffensive activities representative of the \\"civilized\\" West European nations; which has however been criticized by later scholars as omitting the facts that much of the said \\"gentle\\" trade and resulting prosperity was built on activities like the slave trade and colonial exploitation. The doux commerce theory continues to be debated in the modern times. The question of whether commerce's impact on the society is net positive or net negative has no conclusive answer. Mark Movsesian noted that \\"as Hirschman once suggested, the doux commerce thesis is right and wrong at the same time: the market both promotes and corrupts good morals.\\" See also *Capitalist peace *Classic liberalism *Economic liberalism *Gains from trade *Mercantilism *Moral progress *Peace economics References Category:Early Modern economics Category:History of international trade Category:Enlightenment philosophy Category:Peace Category:Montesquieu ","title":"Doux commerce"},{"id":"62299639","title":"2019 World Para Athletics Championships ‚Äì Men's 200 metres"},{"id":"62299697","text":"Lucette Destouches (20 July 1912 ‚Äì 8 November 2019) was a French dancer. She was married to the writer Louis-Ferdinand C√©line until his death in 1961. Biography Destouches was the daughter of Joseph Almansor and Gabrielle Donas Lucie Georgette Almansor. She was born on 20 July 1912 in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. Destouches married Louis-Ferdinand C√©line on 15 February 1943 in the 18th arrondissement. During World War II C√©line had collaborated with the Nazis in France; in September 1944 he and Lucette fled to Germany to escape punishment. They later moved to Denmark before returning to France. In his novels, C√©line portrayed Destouches as Lili. The character appeared in Castle to Castle, North, and Rigadoon. C√©line died on 1 July 1961, and Destouches largely kept his death a secret. Only thirty people attended the funeral, including Marcel Aym√©, Claude Gallimard, Roger Nimier, Robert Poulet, Jean-Roger Caussimon, and Lucien Rebatet. Destouches began to teach classical dance. She taught courses with Judith Magre, Fran√ßoise Gallimard, Isabelle Gallimard, Ludmilla Tch√©rina, and members of 2Be3 during their early careers. Destouches was initially quite opposed to Marie Canavaggia's translations and the publications of Rigodoon and anti-Semitic works written by C√©line, such as Bagatelles pour un massacre, L'√âcole des cadavres, and Les Beaux Draps, but finally agreed in 2017. The projects were soon postponed indefinitely. On her 100th birthday in 2012, Destouches had a series of texts by David Alliot written in her honor, titled Madame C√©line. Destouches died on 8 November 2019 at her home in Meudon. She was 107.

For example, this property is true of the unit cube, so the unit cube is a distributive polytope. It is called a distributive polytope because the coordinatewise minimum and coordinatewise maximum operations form the meet and join operations of a continuous distributive lattice on the points of the polytope. Every face of a distributive polytope is itself a distributive polytope. The distributive polytopes all of whose vertex coordinates are 0 or 1 are exactly the order polytopes. See also *Stable matching polytope, a convex polytope that defines a distributive lattice on its points in a different way References Category:Order theory Category:Polytopes ","title":"Distributive polytope"},{"id":"62299760","text":"In mathematics, the order polytope of a finite partially ordered set is a convex polytope defined from the set. The points of the order polytope are the monotonic functions from the given set to the unit interval, its vertices correspond to the upper sets of the partial order, and its dimension is the number of elements in the partial order. The order polytope is a distributive polytope, meaning that coordinatewise minima and maxima of pairs of its points remain within the polytope. The order polytope of a partial order should be distinguished from the linear ordering polytope, a polytope defined from a number n as the convex hull of indicator vectors of the sets of edges of n-vertex transitive tournaments. Definition and example A partially ordered set is a pair (S,\\\\le) where S is an arbitrary set and \\\\le is a binary relation on pairs of elements of S that is reflexive (for all x\\\\in S, x\\\\le x), antisymmetric (for all x,y\\\\in S with x e y at most one of x\\\\le y and y\\\\le x can be true), and transitive (for all x,y,z\\\\in S, if x\\\\le y and y\\\\le z then x\\\\le z). A partially ordered set (S,\\\\le) is said to be finite when S is a finite set. In this case, the collection of all functions f that map S to the real numbers forms a finite-dimensional vector space, with pointwise addition of functions as the vector sum operation. The dimension of the space is just the number of elements of S. The order polytope is defined to be the subset of this space consisting of functions f with the following two properties: * For every x\\\\in S, 0\\\\le f(x)\\\\le 1. That is, f maps the elements of S to the unit interval. * For every x,y\\\\in S with x\\\\le y, f(x)\\\\le f(y). That is, f is a monotonic function For example, for a partially ordered set consisting of two elements x and y, with x \\\\le y in the partial order, the functions f from these points to real numbers can be identified with points (f(x),f(y)) in the Cartesian plane. For this example, the order polytope consists of all points in the (x,y)-plane with 0\\\\le x\\\\le y \\\\le 1. This is an isosceles right triangle with vertices at (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1). Vertices and facets The vertices of the order polytope consist of monotonic functions from S to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. That is, the order polytope is an integral polytope; it has no vertices with fractional coordinates. These functions are exactly the indicator functions of upper sets of the partial order. Therefore, the number of vertices equals the number of upper sets. The facets of the order polytope are of three types: *Inequalities 0\\\\le f(x) for each minimal element x of the partially ordered set, *Inequalities f(y)\\\\le 1 for each maximal element y of the partially ordered set, and *Inequalities f(x)\\\\le f(y) for each two distinct elements x,y that do not have a third distinct element z between them; that is, for each pair (x,y) in the covering relation of the partially ordered set. The facets can be considered in a more symmetric way by introducing special elements \\\\bot below all elements in the partial order and \\\\top above all elements, mapped by f to 0 and 1 respectively, and keeping only inequalities of the third type for the resulting augmented partially ordered set. More generally, with the same augmentation by \\\\bot and \\\\top, the faces of all dimensions of the order polytope correspond 1-to-1 with quotients of the partial order. Each face is congruent to the order polytope of the corresponding quotient partial order. Volume and Ehrhart polynomial The order polytope of a linear order is a special type of simplex called an order simplex or orthoscheme. Each point of the unit cube whose coordinates are all distinct lies in a unique one of these orthoschemes, the order simplex for the linear order of its coordinates. Because these order simplices are all congruent to each other and (for orders on n elements) there are n! different linear orders, the volume of each order simplex is 1/n!. More generally, an order polytope can be partitioned into order simplices in a canonical way, with one simplex for each linear extension of the corresponding partially ordered set. Therefore, the volume of any order polytope is 1/n! multiplied by the number of linear extensions of the corresponding partially ordered set. This connection between the number of linear extensions and volume can be used to approximate the number of linear extensions of any partial order efficiently (despite the fact that computing this number exactly is #P-complete) by applying a randomized polynomial-time approximation scheme for polytope volume. The Ehrhart polynomial of the order polytope is a polynomial whose values at integer values x give the number of integer points in a copy of the polytope scaled by a factor of x. For the order polytope, the Ehrhart polynomial equals (after a minor change of variables) the order polynomial of the corresponding partially ordered set. This polynomial encodes several pieces of information about the polytope including its volume (the leading coefficient of the polynomial and its number of vertices (the sum of coefficients). Continuous lattice By Birkhoff's representation theorem for finite distributive lattices, the upper sets of any partially ordered set form a finite distributive lattice, and every finite distributive lattice can be represented in this way. The upper sets correspond to the vertices of the order polytope, so the mapping from upper sets to vertices provides a geometric representation of any finite distributive lattice. Under this representation, the edges of the polytope connect comparable elements of the lattice. If two functions p and q both belong to the order polytope of a partially ordered set (S,\\\\le), then the function p\\\\wedge q that maps x to \\\\min(p(x),q(x)), and the function p\\\\vee q that maps x to \\\\max(p(x),q(x)) both also belong to the order polytope. The two operations \\\\wedge and \\\\vee give the order polytope the structure of a continuous distributive lattice, within which the finite distributive lattice of Birkhoff's theorem is embedded. That is, every order polytope is a distributive polytope. The distributive polytopes with all vertex coordinates equal to 0 or 1 are exactly the order polytopes.

He painted from his adopted home of Mount Liebig and soon became internationally successful. As well as being an artist Whiskey was a ngangkari.  Life and painting  Whiskey was born in Pitjantjatjara country at Pirupa Akla, about 130 km south of Kata Tjuta to a family of traditional nomadic hunters and gatherers. Whiskey did not encounter a white person until he was in his teenage years and, by this time his father and many of his family group had died and those remaining moved on to the Lutheran mission at Haasts Bluff. At Haasts Bluff Whiskey met and married Colleen Nampitjinpa, a Luritja woman (also a ngangkari), and they had 5 children together and, following working for rations as a labourer at Areyonga, the family eventually settled in Mount Liebig in the 1980s. It was here that Whiskey got his European name as people started calling him \\"Whiskers\\", for his long white beard and his wry humour and this name evolved in to \\"Whiskey\\". Mount Liebig is about 80 km from Papunyua so, from its earliest days, Whiskey was aware of the Western Desert Art Movement and attended the opening of the Ikuntji Art Centre (which was established with the help of Marina Strocchi) where his wife was involved. Despite this Whiskey did not start painting until he was 85 years old, in December 2005, when he \\"walked into the art centre as requested some canvas for himself\\". He went on the paint for the Watiyawanu Artists of Amunturrngu Cooperative. This late start was not unexpected as Pitjantjatjara people were some of the last to embrace painting as an art form, being concerned about their sacred dreaming stories being on public display and being available for public sale. Whiskey's paintings subjects covered his early nomadic lifestyle and a mythic battle related to Cockatoo Dreaming (that had occurred at his birthplace) and show his deep traditional knowledge. In their execution, they are bold and bright. Shortly before is death in 2008 Whiskey had a sell-out exhibition in London where six of his artworks sold for more than AU $250,000. Whiskey is represented important private and public collections and he has exhibited in London, Japan, Milan and throughout Australia.

Early life  Fisher was born in Iceland on 6 January 1991. Fisher officially came out as transgender in 2010, and was one of the youngest people to have undergone a medical transition in Iceland. Fisher's father currently leads the governing council of H√∫navatnshreppur, the area in which Fisher was born and raised, and has publicly written in support of them and their transition. In 2016 Fisher graduated with Master's Degree in Gender Studies from the University of Iceland.  Activism and career  = LGBTQIA+ activism = Fisher was a founding member of HIN - Hinsegin Nor√∞urland, an organisation for queer people in Northern Iceland in 2011. Following on from that they joined the board of Trans Iceland, and are the current chair of the organisation. They were the Educational Advisor of Samt√∂kin '78 - The National Queer Organisation from 2012-2016. On an international level, they were also a board member of The International LGBTQI Queer and Student Organisation from 2014-2016. In 2016, Fisher did a TEDx Talk at TEDx Reykjav√≠k called 'Moving Beyond the Binary of Sex and Gender', where they talked about transgender and intersex people from their own personal perspective. As chair of the organization Trans Iceland, Fisher played a role in crafting legislation to expand the rights of trans and nonbinary people in Iceland. From 2015 to 2019, in collaboration with Kitty Anderson of Intersex Iceland and with Icelandic lawmakers, they helped develop the Gender Autonomy Act which was passed in June 2019. Fisher has criticized the final version of the bill for removing the provisions against intersex medical interventions which had originally formed part of the bill. Fisher relocated to the UK in 2016. They co-direct an ongoing film project called My Genderation, highlighting trans experiences. They work with All About Trans, a UK organization which works to improve trans representation in media. They have contributed articles to a number of British newspapers, including The Guardian and The Independent, as well as to the lesbian magazine DIVA. They also co-authored the book Trans Teen Survival Guide with Fox Fisher, published by Jessica Kingsley Publishers in 2018. In June 2020, Fisher and three other authors resigned in protest from the Blair Partnership literary agency also representing J.K. Rowling, when the company refused to issue a public statement of support for transgender rights, saying that \\"freedom of speech can only be upheld if the structural inequalities that hinder equal opportunities for underrepresented groups are challenged and changed.\\" = Political career = In 2018 and 2019, Fisher ran for parliament in Iceland on behalf of Vinstri Gr√¶n, the Green Party of Iceland. In 2019 they announced their resignation from the party after it formed a government with Sj√°lfst√¶√∞isflokkurinn, the Conservative Party of Iceland.  Recognition  In 2015 Fisher was awarded the Science and Education award by Si√∞mennt, the Icelandic Humanist Association. They were named one of the BBC's 100 Women for 2019.

His first name is sometimes spelled Theodoor, and occasionally the nick-name Dirk is seen; his last name is sometimes spelled Rodenburg or Rodenberg. He was well-travelled and spoke several languages. He states that he studied in Italy and Portugal, and spent time in the French court. For several years he was a trade representative in London for cities of the Hanseatic League, although the dates are unclear: P.E.L. Verkuyl putting him there from December 1602 to March 1607, and Nigel Smith favoring the dates \\"1601 until after June 1610\\". He was an envoy to the court of Philip III of Spain in Madrid from 1611 to 1613, where he likely attended performances of comedias. He was the first to adapt Spanish comedias into Dutch; four of these adaptations were staged, then subsequently printed in 1617-1618. He was appointed chairman of \\"The Eglantine\\" chamber of rhetoric in 1617, shortly after the exit of playwrights Samuel Coster, Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft, and Gerbrand Bredero who formed the competing First Dutch Academy. In support of The Eglantine, Rodenburgh published the Eglentiers Po√´tens Borst-Weringh, a discussion of poetics based largely on Sir Philip Sidney's Apologie for Poetrie and Thomas Wilson's Arte of Rhetorique, but also influenced by Lope de Vega's Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo (New Art of Writing Plays at This Time). The first part of King Otto III was published in 1616, and the second and third parts in 1617, but whether it was ever performed is unknown. Although his plays were very popular in his lifetime, his literary reputation quickly fell into disrepute and neglect, due in part to his use of techniques which were deemed insufficiently classicist. These were not blunders on Rodenburgh's part, but the results of his conscious emulation of Lope de Vega who embraced variety in emotion, plot, character, location, time, and meter ... a far cry from the rationalism and unities of time, place, and plot demanded by neoclassical writers and theorists.

Early life Katzman grew up in Excelsior, Minnesota and attended Minnetonka High School, then St. Cloud State University and the University of Minnesota. Career Katzman was a mainstay of the early punk rock scene in Minneapolis beginning in the late 1970s. H√ºsker D√º guitarist Bob Mould recalls Katzman working backstage when Mould attended his first concert in Minneapolis, a Suicide Commandos performance at Jay's Longhorn Bar in 1978. He was a sound engineer at legendary club First Avenue, where he became the Replacements' preferred sound mixer for their shows. With Mould and the other members of H√ºsker D√º, Katzman co-founded Reflex Records, which released H√ºsker D√º's early single \\"Statues\\" and first studio album Everything Falls Apart. Under Katzman's guidance, the label would also release several compilations of regional underground and alternative bands, as well as albums by local post-punk bands Rifle Sport, Man Sized Action, Otto's Chemical Lounge, and Articles of Faith, as well as the Minutemen's 1985 EP Tour-Spiel. Both Katzman and the H√ºsker D√º members became too busy with other projects, and the label quietly folded in 1985. Katzman frequently recorded live shows by Minneapolis bands, from the early 1980s to his death in 2019. One recording of a Replacements performance at a house party in January 1982, which was shut down by the Minneapolis police amid angry shouting from the partygoers, was used as the intro audio on the band's Stink EP. Katzman's archive of more than 100 live H√ºsker D√º shows was used as the main source of the 2017 rarities collection Savage Young D√º. Katzman played a vital part in the independent record stores that supported the Twin Cities underground music scene, working at Oar Folkjokeopus Records starting at the dawn of the punk era in 1976, and in 1985 founding his own store, Garage D‚ÄôOr Records, which he later expanded into a record label. Garage D'Or released several CDs archiving live shows by seminal punk and New Wave-era Minneapolis bands, including the Suburbs' High Fidelity Boys - Live 1979 and the Suicide Commandos' The Legendary KQRS Concert 1976. Katzman also co- produced Lick, the 1989 album by Boston alternative rock band The Lemonheads. =Reflex Records discography= ;Compilations *Barefoot and Pregnant cassette compilation (1982) *Kitten cassette compilation (1982) ;H√ºsker D√º *\\"Statues\\" b/w \\"Amusement\\" 7\\" single (1981) *Everything Falls Apart 12\\" LP (1983) *Live Featuring J.C.

Its primary objective was to instill a sense of national pride among the city- dwellers to indigenous handmade products rather than imported British-made products. It included the display of swadeshi wrestling, swadeshi art and recital and performances of swadeshi poetry and songs. The mela met regularly until 1880 after which it lost its importance due to the establishment of other institutions.  Founding  In 1867, the National Paper published the Prospectus of a Society for the Promotion of National Feeling among the Educated Natives of Bengal by Rajnarayan Basu. Inspired by this booklet Nabagopal Mitra founded the Hindu Mela and the National Society in 1867. The mela was first known as the Chaitra Mela. The founding of the mela was supported financially by the Tagore family of Jorashako. Members of the Tagore family recited poetry and performed songs at the event.  Later years  Satyendranath Tagore was deeply associated with the Hindu Mela. He was not present in the founding session of the Hindu Mela held in April 1867 as he was in western India. However, he was present for the second session. He composed a song \\"mile sabe Bharat santan, ektan gaho gaan\\" (unite, India's children, sing in unison), which was hailed as the first national anthem of India.Bandopadhyay, Hiranmay, Thakurbarir Katha, pp. 98‚Äì104, Sishu Sahitya Sansad . Despite being too young to participate during the founding years of the mela, Rabindranath Tagore quickly became deeply involved in the mela. It was here that he got first exposed to anti-British sentiments which shaped his beliefs later in life. On the tenth anniversary of the mela, Rabindranath Tagore recited a poem attacking the then newly appointed Viceroy Lord Lytton's decision to hold a lavish Durbar in Delhi where Queen Victoria was proclaimed the \\"Empress of India\\" all while a famine raged across the country. This was among his first acts of publicly attacking the British Raj. Several organisers of the Hindu Mela came together to form a secret society, Sanjivani Sabha which manufactured swadeshi matchsticks and cloth woven in swadeshi looms. The Hindu Mela also provided sufficient exposure to indigenous physical sports. In the first session of the mela, renowned wrestlers in the city were invited and felicated. In the following session, competitions for indigenous physical sports such as lathi-play and wrestling were organized. In 1874, when the fifth session of the mela was held, tickets for muscle-posing shows sold at a rate of 50 paise. As a result of this exposure, many schools introduced physical education into their curriculum. Physical education was also included into the syllabus of Indian Civil Service examinations.

It boasts of having a huge courtyard, an Ardhamandapa and a spacious open mukhamantapa(frontal courtyard) and a Garbhagriha(sanctum santorum) over which there exist a beautifully carved shrine. The temple has a 8 porches and the pillars of these porches are smooth and round.

Also, there is another inscription nearby belonging to the reign of fifth Ratta dynasty chief Kannakaira(1082‚Äì96). Mentions The description of Mahalingeshwara temple in the Belgaum gazetteer by James Campbell is as follows: On the south or right bank of the river, reached by a flight of fifteen steps, is the large temple of Mahalingeshvar (70' * 42'). It is a plain structure with eight porches, each of which has three pillars, with a row of single pairs inside. The temple is built of large stones, and the ceilings are flat. Four pillars in the centre of the hall or mandap are 8' 9\\" high exclusive of the brackets, and have square bases, octagonal mouldings, then a square plain block, round neck and capital, and a square abacus. The pillars of the porches have round smooth shafts. The brackets of the capitals have the cobra ornament. On each side of the door leading into the antechamber is a perforated panel. On the door posts door-keepers with four hands hold the trident or trishul and the drum or damru Two smaller door-keepers bear the mace and fruit and on the walls behind them is K√°rtiksv√°mi on the right and perhaps Brahma with a mace in his right hand on the left. The shrine door is plain and the back of the hall or mandap has been repaired since the temple was built. The outside of the roof is much injured. In the east porch is a long inscription in Old Kanarese characters, but so besmeared with paint that part of it cannot be read. The date, which appears to be about 1153, is effaced, but the inscription belongs to the seventh Ratta chief K√°rtavirya III.(1143-1164).

The charter of Brussels, as codified in 1570 in articles 206 and following, provided the conditions of admission to the bourgeoisie of the city.Recueil des anciennes coutumes de la Belgique, published by order of the King of the Belgians, under the direction of the Justice Ministre, by a special commission, Coutumes du Pays et duch√© de Brabant, quartier de Bruxelles, Volume 1, Coutumes de la ville de Bruxelles, by A.

Gobbaerts, printer (publisher) of the King, successeur d‚ÄôEmm. Devroye, rue de Louvain 40, Brussels, 1869. The Bourgeois were the patrician class of the city. This social class was abolished by Napoleon during the French occupation.  Capacity of bourgeois  The non-bourgeois inhabitants, called \\"inhabitants\\" in French and \\"ingesetene\\" in Dutch, have none of these political rights, but are not less protected by communal laws, and can appeal to urban justice, as well as buy property. The capacity of Bourgeois, which implied an oath, was seen as a pledge of loyalty to the city and the urban community. In Brussels, the bourgeois were sometimes called \\"poorters\\" name often given to citizens of important cities called walled cities. This word derives from the Dutch word fallen into disuse poorte,Word listed by Jan Louys D'Arcy, Het groote woorden- boeck, vervattende den schat der Nederlandtsche tale, met een Fransche uyt- legginge, Rotterdam, printed by Pieter van Waesberghe, 1651. The word poort- grave is also derived from this word, meaning mayor of the city. city or place closed by walls, like the imposing stone houses that the rich bourgeois of the Seven Noble Houses lived in in the early days of the city, and to which was also given the name of \\"poorte\\" or \\"porta\\" in Latin, and whose synonym was \\"herberg\\" or \\"hostel\\" and which are also called steen. Each of these \\"poorte\\" had a name, for example: \\"Poorte van den Galoyse\\", \\"Poorte van Coeckelberg\\", \\"Gouden Poorte\\", \\"Priemspooerte\\", the \\"Raempoorte\\" (in Overmolen), \\"porta t 'Serclaes' known as 'the Palace', 'Slozenpoorte' (on the Sablon), 'Poorte van de Tafelronde' or 'Poorte van Vianen'. The European Medieval practice of naming houses was rich and varied in Brussels. The capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organisation of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to Greco-Latin antiquity, others were founded around the year one thousand.Henri Pirenne, Les villes du Moyen √Çge, essai d‚Äôhistoire √©conomique et sociale, Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927. , also : Les villes et les institutions urbaines, Alcan, 1939. This system of urban civilization developed in parallel to the rural civilization rooted in the Neolithic era.Pierre Bonenfant, Professor at the Brussels University, \\"Racines pr√©historiques de la Wallonie\\", in Histoire de la Wallonie published under the direction of L√©opold Genicot, Toulouse, Privat, 1973, p.37-39: (FR)  Abolition by Napol√©on  Under Napoleon, the Law abolished for good, in the territories that were submitted to France, the differences of status between cities and countryside and abolished the quality of bourgeois or citizen of a city. In other parts of Europe, as it is now in Switzerland (Swiss bourgeoisie), this system has endured. In Germany it was slowly abolished, and only Hamburg and Bremen retain the Hanseatic designation freie Stadt from their days as free imperial cities.

OpIndia and Aadhyaasi Media separated from Kovai Media in November 2018. Rahul Roushan was appointed the CEO of OpIndia, and Nupur J Sharma became the editor. Roushan and Sharma each owned half of Aadhyaasi Media after the transition. In January 2019, Aadhyaasi Media was acquired by Kaut Concepts Management Pvt Ltd, which gained 98 percent ownership of Aadhyaasi Media and left Roushan and Sharma with one percent each. Kaut Concepts has a 26 percent stake in TFI Media Pvt Ltd, the operator of TFIpost‚Äîa Hindu nationalist website also known as The Frustrated Indian, and is directed by Ashok Kumar Gupta, who is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and campaigns for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Aadhyaasi Media's directors are Sharma, Gupta, and Roushan's wife, Shaili Raval. In the 2018‚Äì2019 financial year, Aadhyaasi Media reported in profit. Between March and June 2019, OpIndia purchased of political advertising on Facebook. The BJP petitioned Facebook to allow OpIndia to receive advertising revenue on the social network in November 2019. In 2020, the West Bengal Police filed first information reports (FIRs) against Sharma, Roushan and Ajeet Bharti (the editor of OpIndia Hindi) in response to content published on OpIndia. The Supreme Court of India stayed the FIRs in June 2020 after hearing a plea from the defendants which argued that the matter was outside the jurisdiction of the government of West Bengal.  Content  OpIndia solely denounces what it describes as \\"liberal media\\". In an analysis of the 284 articles published by OpIndia in 2018, University of Maryland researchers Prashanth Bhat and Kalyani Chadha identified five recurring patterns in OpIndia's content: # Portraying mistakes as fake news: OpIndia has provided coverage of \\"misquoted statements, incorrect headlines, or errors\\" in various mainstream media outlets, including NDTV, The Times Group and BBC, and claimed them to be \\"fake news\\". After the outlets published corrections, OpIndia continued to allege that the errors were intentional. According to Bhat and Chadha, the rhetoric employed by OpIndia is similar to the strategies used by European right-wing populist publications that aim to engender distrust in the mainstream media. # Shaming journalists: OpIndia has attacked the \\"professional integrity\\" of specific mainstream media journalists that the website believes to be opposed to the ruling BJP, including journalists from The Wire, The Indian Express, NDTV and The Quint. OpIndia has accused these journalists of sexual harassment, plagiarism, financial misconduct, \\"malicious editing\\" and other forms of unethical behavior. Some stories in this category were obtained by monitoring the journalists' social media accounts for \\"inconsistencies or contradictions\\". Bhat and Chadha compared OpIndia's method of attacking journalists to practices used by American right-wing publications. # Alleging partisanship: OpIndia has alleged the existence of a \\"news media conspiracy\\" in which mainstream media outlets are biased against the ruling BJP and India itself, and favourable of the opposition Indian National Congress (INC), which the website considered part of the \\"establishment\\". OpIndia claimed that the media produced too little coverage of the INC's use of Cambridge Analytica, while providing too much coverage of the BJP's handling of the Rafale deal controversy. English- language outlets are the primary targets of OpIndia's criticism. # Amplifying criticism: OpIndia has regularly featured stories in which celebrities and public officials criticised mainstream media outlets, and reports in which the outlets apologised to critics. In these stories, OpIndia accused journalists of various faults, including \\"insensitivity and irresponsibility\\", misinformation, publishing sensitive information and compromising \\"national security\\". In one story, OpIndia covered the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's criticism of journalist Nidhi Razdan, then played down the Minister's correction after the situation was revealed to be a \\"misunderstanding\\". # Alleging bias against India and Hindus: OpIndia has accused Indian publications of having a liberal media bias and of publishing stories that are \\"anti-India\\", particularly regarding India‚ÄìPakistan relations. The website published allegations that mainstream media outlets were \\"anti-Hindu\\", including in rebukes of Times Now and CNN-News18 for covering weight loss tips and fireworks bans around Diwali. Bhat and Chadha wrote that OpIndia's portrayal of the mainstream media as \\"pro-minority and anti-majority\\" is in line with the narratives communicated through Norwegian and German right-wing websites, and that the Diwali accusations resemble the \\"War on Christmas\\" allegations published by American right-wing outlets. Raj, in 2014, intended for OpIndia to combat media manipulation and distinguish \\"what is being reported\\" from \\"what the facts are\\". In 2018, Sharma stated that OpIndia is openly right-leaning and does not claim to be ideologically neutral. Sharma described OpIndia's dislike of left-liberal ideas as the website's \\"ontological positions on the basis of which we operate\\" in 2019. As of June 2020, OpIndia declares on its website that it aims to produce content \\"that is free from the burden of liberal bias and political correctness\\". The site accepts article contributions from its readers. Fact checkers certified by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), including Alt News and Boom, have identified multiple instances in which OpIndia has published fake news. According to a Newslaundry data compilation, OpIndia published 25 fake news stories and 14 misreported stories between January 2018 and June 2020 that were fact-checked by other organisations. False reports on OpIndia frequently criticise Muslims. Newslaundry found 28 articles on OpIndia released from 15‚Äì29 November 2019 with headlines that explicitly named Muslims as perpetrators of various crimes. A writer who left OpIndia due to this trend told Newslaundry, \\"If the accused in an incident belongs to the Muslim community, then you have to mention his name in the heading. The news is to be published in such a way that if the reader is a Hindu, then he starts developing hatred for Muslims.\\" Ever since being declared by the online encyclopaedia wikipedia as an unreliable source, OpIndia started publishing news content on a regular basis portraying wikipedia in a negative light. = Bihar human sacrifice claims = OpIndia's 10 May article containing the human sacrifice claims. The headline was later revised. Between 9‚Äì14 May 2020, OpIndia published a series of seven articles (one in English and six in Hindi) falsely claiming that Rohit Jaiswal, a Hindu boy, was sacrificed in a mosque in Bela Dih ‚Äì a village in Kateya, Gopalganj, Bihar ‚Äì after which his body was disposed of in a river on 28 March. In the articles, OpIndia alleged that the suspected perpetrators were \\"all Muslims\\". One of the articles asserted, \\"A new mosque had been built in the village and it is being alleged that there was a belief that if a Hindu was 'sacrificed', the mosque would become powerful and its influence would increase.\\" The stories were accompanied with videos of Jaiswal's sister and father, in which neither of them mentioned a sacrifice or mosque. Jaiswal's postmortem report indicated that his cause of death was \\"asphyxia due to drowning\\". Local residents in the village, including Jaiswal's mother, declined to corroborate the human sacrifice claims, and a local journalist said that the village did not have a new mosque. The FIR filed by the father on 29 March listed six suspects (five Muslim boys and one Hindu boy) and did not reference a sacrifice or mosque. OpIndia later released an audio recording of its interview with Jaiswal's father, in which he claimed that Jaiswal was murdered in a mosque. In a follow-up interview with Newslaundry, the father retracted the claim and said that he made the accusations in \\"sheer frustration\\" of the attention around Jaiswal's death. After Newslaundry interviewed Bharti‚Äîthe editor of OpIndia Hindi, OpIndia deleted the word \\"all\\" from the phrase \\"all Muslims\\" in its description of the suspected perpetrators. Vijay Kumar Verma, a Deputy Inspector General of Bihar Police, disclosed on 14 May that he had filed an FIR against OpIndia under Section 67 (obscenity) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Section 295(A) (inciting religious outrage) of the Indian Penal Code for its reporting of the false human sacrifice claims. The FIR stated that OpIndia published the claims \\"without knowing or understanding the case\\". On 17 May, the Director General of Bihar Police, Gupteshwar Pandey, examined the drowning incident and found no evidence supporting the human sacrifice claims or the suspicion of communal motives behind the death. = Plagiarism = OpIndia has regularly been criticised for alleged plagiarism and copyright violation in their articles without attributing to the original publishers. It was later discovered by the AltNews when OpIndia published an article covering 2020 Pulitzer Prize nomination about three Kashmir journalists who were awarded for their photographs taken during the state-wide lockdown imposed in 2019 by the ruling party, BJP after the revocation of article 370 involving Kashmir conflict.  Reception  In March 2019, the IFCN rejected OpIndia's application to be certified as a fact checker. While noting partial compliance on a number of categories, the IFCN rejected the application on grounds of political partisanship and lack of transparency, and raised concerns over questionable fact-checking methodologies. The rejection disqualified OpIndia from fact-checking contracts with web properties owned by Facebook and Google. In response, Sharma criticised the IFCN assessment and urged for acceptance of outlets with \\"declared ideological leanings\\". After co-founder Raj departed OpIndia, he described the website as a \\"blind mouthpiece\\" of the BJP on Twitter in August 2019. Raj criticised Sharma, alleging that she and others \\"started as trolls\\" and \\"abuse and play victim card when questioned\\". OpIndia was blacklisted from wikipedia in 2020 alongside Swarajya and TFIpost. Stop Funding Hate, a British social media campaign, urged organisations to withdraw their advertising from OpIndia in May 2020 after the website published an article asserting that businesses should be able to declare that they do not hire Muslims. The head of the campaign, Richard Wilson, said that \\"OpIndia is becoming internationally notorious for its hateful and discriminatory coverage\\" and that the campaign has \\"rarely seen such overt advocacy of discrimination on religious grounds\\". Over 20 organisations, including advertising network Rubicon Project, video streaming service Mubi, personal care brand Harry's and the Sa√Ød Business School, ceased advertising on OpIndia as a result of the campaign. Sharma responded that she would \\"stand by our article and our content 100%\\" and that OpIndia would \\"never alter its core belief system or content\\". Roushan stated that advertisements constitute a minority of OpIndia's revenue and claimed that OpIndia received a \\"700% jump\\" in donations during the campaign.

Soft growing robots are built from compliant materials and attempt to mimic how vines, plant shoots, and other organisms reach new locations through growth. While other forms of robots use locomotion to achieve their objectives, soft growing robots elongate their body through addition of new material, or expansion of material. This gives them the ability to travel through constricted areas and form a wide range of useful 3-D formations. Currently there are two main soft growing robot designs: additive manufacturing and tip extension. Some goals of soft growing robotics development are the creation of robots that can explore constricted areas and improve surgical procedures.  Additive manufacturing design  One way of extending the robot body is through additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing generally refers to 3-D printing, or the fabrication of three dimensional objects through the conjoining of many layers of material. Additive manufacturing design of a soft growing robot utilizes a modified 3-D printer at the tip of the robot to deposit thermoplastics (material that is rigid when cooled and flexible when heated) to extend the robot in the desired orientation. = Design characteristics = The body of the robot consists of: # A base, where the power supply, circuit board, and spool of thermoplastic filament is stored. # The tubular body of varying length created by additive manufacturing which extends outwards from the base. # The tip where new material is deposited to lengthen the tubular body, and house sensors. The additive manufacturing process involves polylactic acid filament (a thermoplastic) being pulled through the tubular body of the robot by a motor in the tip. At the tip, the filament passes through a heating element, making it pliable. The filament is then turned perpendicular to the direction of robot growth and deposited onto the outer edge of a rotating disk facing the base of the robot. As the disk (known as the deposition head) rotates, new filament is deposited in spiraling layers. This filament solidifies in front of the previous layer of filament, pushing the tip of the robot forward. The interactions between the temperature of the heating element, the rotation of the deposition head, and the speed the filament is fed through the heating element is precisely controlled to ensure the robot grows in the desired manner. = Movement control = The speed of the robot is controlled by changing the temperature of the heating element, the speed at which filament is fed through the heating element, and the speed the deposition head is spun. Speed can be defined as the function: S=\\\\frac{L_d}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{(\\\\tan\\\\alpha)^2}+1}} Where L_d is the thickness of the deposited layer of filament, and \\\\alpha is the angle of the helix in which the filament material is deposited. Controlling the direction of growth (and thus the direction of robot \\"movement\\") can be done in two ways: # Changing the thickness of the filament deposited on one side of the deposition head (tilting the tip away from that side). # Changing the number of number of layers of filament on one side of the deposition head by using partial rotation of the deposition disk to add extra material in that sector (tilting the tip away from the side with extra layers of filament). For example, the disk could normally rotate clockwise, rotate counter-clockwise for 1 radian, and then resume rotating clockwise. This would add two extra layers of material in the 1 radian section. = Capabilities = One of the major advantages of soft growing robots is that minimal friction exists between the outside environment and the robot. This is because only the robot tip moves relative to the environment. Multiple robots using additive manufacturing for growth were designed for burrowing into the soil, as less friction with the environment reduces energy required to move through the environment . * Unsubmerged, one robot was able to grow at a speed of 1.8-4 mm/min. with a maximum bending speed of 1.28 degrees per minute and a growing force of up to 6kg. * Unsubmerged, a second prototype was able to grow at a speed of 3-4 mm/min. as well as passively turn 40 degrees with a 100% success rate and 50 degrees with a 60% success rate (where passively turning means the robot was grown into a slanted wall and the properties of the thermoplastic filament used to bend the robot in the desired direction).  Tip extension design  A second form of soft growing robot design is tip extension. This design is characterized by a tube of material (common materials include nylon fabric, low density polyethylene, and silicone coated nylon) pressurized with air or water that is folded into itself. By letting out the folded material, the robot extends from the tip as the pressurized tube pushes out the inner folded material. = Design characteristics = In contrast with additive manufacturing where new material is deposited behind the tip of the robot to push the tip forward, tip extension utilizes the internal pressure within the robot body to push out new material at the tip of the robot. Often, the tubing inside the robot body is stored on a reel to make it easier to control the release of tubing and thus robot growth. Multiple methods of turning a tip extension robot have been developed. They include: # Pinching the inner tube of robot body material and securing the pinched material with latches. To turn the robot, a latch is opened, releasing more robot body material on one side of the robot. The internal pressure causes the extra material to inflate, making one side of the robot longer than the other, and turning the robot away from the longer side. To grow the robot straight, none of the latches are released or all of the latches are released. The latches are controlled through their placement in a second set of inflatable tubing attached to the main robot body material. #* If a latch's tubing is uninflated, the latch can never open because the internal robot body pressure forces it closed. #* If a latch's tubing is inflated, and the latch is on a straight section of the robot body, the latch will not open due to the slant of the latch's angled, interlocking hooks. #* If a latch's tubing is inflated, and the latch is on the tip of the robot, the curve of the tip allows the interlocking hooks to slip past each other and open the latch. # Adding a second set of inflatable tubing to the sides of the robot body. This tubing is pinched periodically along its length so that when inflated, the tubing will contract lengthwise. To turn the robot, one set of tubing is inflated, causing the tubing to contract along the length of robot body and turn the robot body in the direction of the inflated tubing. Robots utilizing the tip extension design are retractable. Current designs use a wire attached to the tip of the robot that is used to pull the tip of the robot back into the robot body. = Mathematical analysis = The theoretical force the tip grows under can be modelled as: F_{driving}=PA Where F_{driving} represents the force the tip grows under, P represents internal pressure, and A represents cross sectional area of the robot tip. However, the experimental force the tip expands under has been found to be less than this largely due to axial tension in the robot body. A model that approximates F_{driving} more accurately is: F_{driving}=PAk-[YA+F_v]-[F_l+\\\\Sigma_iF_{Ci}] Here, k is an eperimentally determined constant and Y is yield pressure when no growth occurs. F_v , F_l , and F_{Ci} , are force terms dependent on velocity, length, and curvature or the robot respectively. Additionally, multiple mathematical models for various forms of turning, twisting, and retracting have been developed.  Methods of robot operation  Soft growing robots can be controlled in various ways depending on how well the objective and growth path are defined. Without a clearly defined goal or robot growth path, teleoperation is used. When a clearly defined goal exists (such as a light source), computer vision can be used to find a path to the goal and grow a robot along that path. If the desired path of robot growth is known before the robot is deployed, pre- planned turning positions can be used to control the robot. * Teleoperation: a human operator controls robot growth, speed, and turning. This can be done either with the operator viewing the robot, or with the operator using an onboard camera. * Computer vision: using a camera and software to detect a pre-defined goal and steer the robot towards the goal autonomously. * Pre- determined turning positions: With the latch turning design, the latches can be made so they open at pre-planned times, making the robot grow in pre- planned shapes.  Applications  Possible applications of soft growing robots focus on their low friction/interaction with the environment, their simple method of growth, and their ability to grow through cramped environments. * Coral reef exploration: ** Soft growing robots potentially have the ability to grow within the passageways of the reefs, with sensors (optical, distance, etc.) without damaging the reef. * As the support structure for an antenna: ** A soft growing robot can grow into a helix configuration with an antenna attached to it, which is an optimal configuration for the operation of the antenna. * Surgical Procedures: ** Minimally invasive surgery involves medical procedures within sensitive, constricted environments (the human body) which could be well suited to the flexibility and controllability of soft growing robots. * Burrowing into the ground: ** As friction is only experienced by the tip of the soft growing robot body when digging, soft growing robots may be more energy efficient than other methods of digging that involve the entire robot body moving relative to the environment.

Designed by Benjamin Ferrey, it was built in 1864‚Äì66 and made redundant in 1989. The church, now in private ownership, is a Grade II listed building. History The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built to replace an earlier medieval church serving East Lydford, which was dedicated to St Peter. By the middle of the 19th-century, it had become dilapidated and was considered inadequate and uncomfortable. Furthermore, the church's location by the river made it prone to flooding; in the winter of 1863, heavy rain fell during a service and the congregation had to be taken home by cart as the surrounding fields became too flooded to navigate on foot. The rector of the parish, Rev. John James Moss, offered to build a new church at his sole expense, as a memorial to his late wife, Louisa Mary Anne, who died in 1863. A meeting of 22 September 1864 saw the offer unanimously accepted, and the foundation stone was laid by Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Cust, the father of Mrs. Moss, on 5 October 1864. The chosen site for the new church was on a plot of land owned by Rev. Moss and more central to the village. The church was designed by Benjamin Ferrey of London and built by Mr. Davis of Langport for a cost of ¬£2,000. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, the Right Rev. Robert Eden, on 11 April 1866. The church was later closed in 1987 and declared redundant on 1 January 1989. By 1987, the church was only used for a monthly service and on other special occasions. In addition to requiring repairs estimated to cost ¬£35,000, much of the local congregation favoured the Church of St Peter at Lydford-on-Fosse. The church was at risk of demolition in 1989 and sold to a private owner in 1993. It was placed on Mendip District Council's Historic Buildings at Risk register that year. The 2011 register considered the building to have possible \\"structural problems\\", with an \\"immediate risk of further rapid deterioration\\". Architecture The Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary is built of Keinton stone, with Doulting stone dressings and tile roofs, in the Early English style. It was designed to accommodate 100 persons and made up of a three-bay nave, chancel, south porch and north tower. The space under the tower served as a vestry and organ loft. The top of the tower is octagonal and has a spire standing at a height of 100 feet, topped with an ornamental cross and gilded weathercock. The nave was paved with encaustic tiles from Maw & Co and the open roof made from stained deal. Internal fittings included the church's seating of stained deal and an oak pulpit which was transferred from the old church. The chancel stalls and reading desk were made from oak, while the font of Caen stone was gifted by Captain and Mrs. Chas Egerton in memory of their two infant children. The stained glass window at the east end was supplied by Heydon of London. Most of the church's fittings were moved upon closure to St Peter's at Lydford-on-Fosse.

Research Zviran specializes in the area of alternative passwords. He and his research colleague William Haga were among the pioneers of research on multi-level protection of information systems and on the characteristics of usefulness versus password strength. Together they developed and launched the cognitive passwords approach, which is widely used today as a second line of defense in a wide range of systems and applications. The Zviran Index In 1984, parallel to his academic career, Zviran established the Zviran Index in partnership with Elad Systems. The index is based on comparative salary and benefits surveys in the area of information systems in Israel, and serves as a managerial tool for organizations. In 1989, together with his wife, Rachel, he acquired the share of Elad Systems and established a new company - Zviran Consulting and Surveys. With the rapid development of the hi-tech industry in Israel, Zviran expanded the areas covered by the salary and benefits surveys to technology and hi-tech companies and later to additional areas, including consumer goods, pharma, infrastructure and construction, and more. The company also engaged in consulting projects throughout the world, on a broad range of issues in the area of compensation. In 2012 Zviran and his wife sold the ownership of the company. The company still bears the name Zviran but Zviran is not a shareholder and is not involved in its activities.

Hartmann played a central role in the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality as a diagnosis of mental illness from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. This change opened the modern era of LGBTQ rights by providing support for the overturning of laws against homosexuals and by advancing gay civil rights, including the right to marry.  Early life  Hartmann was born in Vienna, Austria in 1937 into a family of intellectual social reformers. Hartmann's early years were unsettled by the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany (Anschluss), and his family's consequent emigration from Vienna to Paris in 1938, to Switzerland in 1939, and to New York City in 1941. His father was Heinz Hartmann (1894‚Äì1970), an internationally known psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, as well as a student and analysand of Sigmund Freud.https://books.google.com/books?id=vDdfDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA727 He became widely known as an ego-psychologist and a dean of world psychoanalysis in the mid-twentieth century. His mother, Dora Karplus Hartmann, M.D. (1902‚Äì1974), came from a family of lawyers and publishers. A noted mountaineer in her early life, she chose to become a pediatrician in Vienna over the objections of her father who believed that a woman's constitution was not strong enough to endure medical school. She continued her medical training in New York to become a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.  Education  Hartmann was educated at the Fieldston School in New York City after which he attended Harvard College, where he received a B.A. in History and Literature (magna cum laude, Phi Betta Kappa). As a Rhodes Scholar, Hartmann earned two degrees in English Literature from Oxford University. He received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School and then served as an intern in pediatrics at the University of California in San Francisco. He served his residency in psychiatry (1965‚Äì1967) and a fellowship in child psychiatry (1967‚Äì1969) at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center (MMHC). Upon completion of his training, Hartmann began a private practice and continued as a clinical professor of psychiatry at MMHC.  Career  Following the Kent State Shootings in 1970, Hartmann co-founded and chaired the Committee of Concerned Psychiatrists within the American Psychiatric Association with the goal of persuading the APA to ‚Äúacknowledge and take part in social issues that affect mental health and mental illness.‚Äù The CoCP quickly expanded its involvement in social issues to include the Vietnam War and Civil Rights, as well as the newly emerging Women's Rights and Gay Rights Movements. Finding the governing structure of the APA deeply conservative and self-perpetuating, Hartmann encouraged reform-minded candidates to run for leadership positions. Two such candidates encouraged by Hartmann and the CoCP were Alfred Friedman (1917‚Äì2011) who served as APA president in 1973‚Äì1974 and John Spiegel (1911‚Äì1991) who served as APA president in 1974‚Äì1975. Both of these men shared the CoCP's belief that public laws against homosexuality and prohibitions against homosexuals in psychiatry were based upon flawed studies, societal prejudice, and outdated psychoanalytic theory. Hartmann and the CoCP also participated in the APA's selection of Melvin Sabshin (1925‚Äì2011), a psychiatrist and social reformer open to broader membership participation in the APA, who served as the organization's medical director from 1974 until 1997. Through his membership on the Social Issues Committee of the Northern New England Psychiatric Society (NNPS), Hartmann and Richard PIllard (b.1933) who had just become one of the country's first psychiatrists to identify himself publicly as gay, drafted a position paper for the NNPS arguing that the homosexuality did not meet the scientific or clinical criteria for a diagnosis of mental illness, and that homosexuals deserved full civil rights. With minor modification, this paper was adopted by the NNPS and forwarded to the Assembly of the APA which passed a resolution drawn largely from the paper. In December 1973, the Board of Trustees of the APA voted 13-0, concurring that homosexuality was not valid as a diagnosis of mental illness. A small group of opponents attempted to reverse the Board's vote by referendum, but that effort failed, and the APA's membership affirmed the removal of homosexuality as a diagnosis of mental illness. Hartmann's activism led him to be elected a member of the APA Assembly and subsequently Speaker of the Assembly before being elected Vice President (1990) and President of the APA (1991‚Äì1992). As a member of the APA's Board of Trustees and International Affairs Committee, Hartmann led and participated in human rights missions to examine mental health conditions under apartheid in the Union of South Africa and under dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile. Working closely with Melvin Sabshin, Hartmann traveled to the Soviet Union to meet with dissident psychiatrists and to examine evidence of the abuse of psychiatry by the Soviet government. Hartmann's findings contributed to the successful efforts of Melvin Sabshin and the APA to persuade the World Psychiatric Association World Psychiatric Association (WPA) to establish an Ethics Committee to investigate abuses of psychiatry. The Soviet Union resigned from the WPA in protest. In 1992, Hartmann led a Travelling University of Psychiatry to post-Iron-Curtain Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary under APA sponsorship. In 1996, Hartmann co- founded the Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity of the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute (BPSI) with Gerald Adler, M.D. psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. This work was part of a broader effort that resulted in the American Psychoanalytic Association issuing a public apology to the LGBTQ community on June 21, 2019 for its past views pathologizing homosexuality and transgender identities. In 2019, BPSI awarded Honorary Membership, to Hartmann citing his role in the APA's 1973 vote and his contribution to psychoanalysis by helping ‚Äúto remove homophobia from our institutional culture by organizing conferences, leading evening programs, serving as a discussant during clinical presentations, and providing mentorship for gay analytic Candidates when none existed.‚Äù  Personal life  Hartmann has lived with Brian Pfeiffer, an architectural historian, in Cambridge, Massachusetts since 1973. They married in 2004 when Massachusetts became the first state in the nation to grant full civil rights for same-sex marriage. \\\\---- Drescher, J. An Interview with Lawrence Hartmann, M.D. p. 129.

The premium cable channel showed telecasts of sporting events, principally those involving the Milwaukee Brewers and Milwaukee Bucks. Sportsvue operated from April 3, 1984 to February 2, 1985, closing in the middle of the Bucks season due to the losses incurred in its brief period of operation and inability to attract a sufficient subscriber base. Within days of Sportsvue's closure, the Bucks were put up for sale. History =Pre-launch= In 1981, the Bucks and Brewers announced plans to launch a cable sports channel known as the Wisconsin All- Sports Network as a complement to the games carried by broadcast TV stations; the network would also carry collegiate sports events and would have launched as soon as 1983. Plans for WASN were rolled into a larger and more ambitious effort of Group W Satellite Communications, known as \\"The Sports Network\\", in 1983. TSN (no relation to the Canadian network of the same name that launched in 1984) was to incorporate WASN, as well as Pro-Am Sports System in Detroit, Sportsvision in Chicago, Sonics Superchannel in the Pacific Northwest, and a new channel in the mid-Atlantic region (which Group W wound up launching as Home Team Sports in the spring of 1984). However, in October, Group W dropped its sports network plans, which had already delayed the channel from fall 1983 to a spring 1984 debut. =Becoming Sportsvue= The cable channel changed its name to Sportsvue in January 1984; at the same time, it announced a launch date of April 3. The network would carry the season opener between the Brewers and the Oakland Athletics‚Äîpart of a slate of 67 baseball contests‚Äîas well as a Bucks game two days later; in addition, the network trumpeted that it lined up 40 Wisconsin Badgers hockey and basketball games (football telecasts were not an immediate possibility due to a then-pending Supreme Court case and the team being on probation for the 1984 season), 10 Marquette University athletic events (primarily basketball), and National Hockey League coverage. (No final deal had been worked out with the University of Wisconsin by July, and negotiations continued into September.) Sportsvue was a financial venture of importance to both the Brewers and Bucks, who were strapped for cash and played in a small market; the clubs hoped that Sportsvue revenues would help the teams remain competitive. Jim Fitzgerald, who owned the Bucks, warned in January 1984 that, if the channel were not successful, there was a chance he could sell the franchise. =Distribution and subscriber problems= Cable distribution was sometimes hit-or-miss around the state. For those who subscribed to participating cable systems around the state, the service cost $8 to $9 a month. Some systems, such as Group W Cable in La Crosse (which ultimately changed its mind) and Teltron in Wausau and Stevens Point, did not add Sportsvue typically because the costs were too expensive or their systems required technical rebuilding to have the channel capacity needed to add the new service; Teltron had capacity for just two premium channels, space already taken up by HBO and Cinemax. Customers of the cable system in Madison needed new converter boxes to be able to subscribe. Other systems that would have been critical to the company's success, such as RVS in Waukesha County and the system in Racine, did not pick up Sportsvue because they objected to its revenue split. One critical distribution shortfall did not even have to do with a specific cable system: the city of Milwaukee was not wired for cable at the time, prompting Sportsvue to consider alternate distribution methods, including the TVQ pay microwave system and SelecTV, to reach customers there; Milwaukee was not projected to be cabled until 1986. The network expected 50,000 subscribers after a year of operation, and it signed up 15,000 in its first month, but from there, subscription figures flatlined. As time went on, low uptake rates prompted additional cable providers that had been considering carriage of Sportsvue to hold off, like Warner Amex in Neenah. In other areas, such as Eau Claire (served by Wisconsin CATV) interest was lower than the cable company needed to see to make money on the necessary investment; a Wisconsin CATV official warned that due to the number of subscribers Sportsvue needed to break even, \\"we don't know if that channel is going to make it\\". Officials attributed Sportsvue's stagnating uptake to the poor performance of the Brewers. The stagnation continued into December, when the service still had just 16,000 subscribers. =Closure= A month into 1985, the bottom fell out for Sportsvue. Its president, Joe O'Neill, stepped down from the position on January 15 but remained on as legal counsel, while the network announced on January 24 that it would axe a third of its staff. Four days later, further measures were announced in a bid to shore up the network's finances; the network would cut in half the number of live events it broadcast and raise its rates to cable companies. Not even these increasingly drastic changes were enough. On February 2, Sportsvue announced that it would cease operations after that night's Bucks game against the Portland Trail Blazers, citing the low subscriber count. The channel had lost $2 million in its 10 months of operation; Bucks owner Fitzgerald said the team had \\"taken a bath\\" on its investment in cable sports. In appraising the reasons for its closure, Phil Rosenthal of The Capital Times cited the Brewers' poor performance in 1984; the inability to reach potential subscribers in uncabled Milwaukee; poor supplemental programming and its part-time operation; and the failure of the Group W venture. =Impact of closure= In the wake of the closure of Sportsvue, Bucks management said that the team would have to take a \\"hard look at the future\\" and Fitzgerald noted that other cities were already showing interest in buying the franchise. He then officially announced that he was putting the Bucks up for sale on February 5, just three days after the network folded. Grocery store magnate Herb Kohl bought the Bucks a month later, keeping them in Milwaukee. In a lawsuit later in the year over the 1979 privatization of the club, Fitzgerald claimed that he had not thought of selling the club until Sportsvue failed. Brewers owner Bud Selig blamed larger-market teams and the rise of superstations for the failure of Sportsvue. A more immediate change was that the local stations that carried Brewers and Bucks games, and which had seen their inventories drop with Sportsvue, gained the opportunity to telecast additional games. WLRE in the Green Bay market added 16 more Brewers games that were offered by the club after the network's closure, along with six additional Bucks games in the remainder of the NBA season.

Signed as National Route 7, it is a bypass that travels to the south of the central district of the city. Starting to the southwest of central Aomori near the Sannai-Maruyama site, it connects the main route of National Route 7 to National Route 4 east of the central district of Aomori. Route description The Aomori Belt Highway primarily serves as a bypass of the central part of the city of Aomori. For planning purposes the city considers the area outside of the highway to be the \\"outer\\" part of the city. It starts at a junction with its parent route, the main line of National Route 7, near the Sannai-Maruyama archaeological site in southwestern Aomori city. From there, it travels southeast towards Aomori Interchange, a junction between the Aomori Belt Highway and the northern terminus of the T≈çhoku Expressway. Curving to the south and then east, it passes by the Sannai-Maruyama site and the Aomori Museum of Art and then begins paralleling the Aomori Expressway. The Aomori Belt Highway serves as a frontage road for the expressway for the next several kilometers with access to the limited-access road at Aomori-ch≈´≈ç Interchange. While heading east, the highway intersects several roads that lead to and from the center of Aomori, including National Route 103 and Aomori Prefecture Route 120. After the intersection with National Route 103, the highway begins slowly curving to the northeast and eventually to the north. When the belt highway curves to the north, the Aomori Expressway stops paralleling the highway, continuing northeast. About north of this split the Aomori Belt Highway terminates at an intersection with National Route 4. History The Aomori Belt Highway was initially planned as on of three highways that passed through the city of Aomori from west to east in 1964. It was originally opened as a two-lane road in 2002, but was mostly expanded to a four-lane highway by 2009 serving as a frontage road to the Aomori Expressway. The interchange connecting it to the Aomori Expressway was completed on 28 September 2003 at a cost of 79.5 billion Japanese yen.

It is an isolated mountain situated at the head of Queens Reach of Jervis Inlet, northwest of Princess Louisa Inlet, in a remote wilderness area that few visit. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Tinniswood, to the north-northeast. Mount Albert is set southeast of Mount Waddington, the highest peak of the entire Coast Mountains range. The mountain was named in 1860 by Captain Richards to honor Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (1819-1861), the husband of Queen Victoria. The name was officially adopted on May 6, 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent was made in 1929 by Arthur Tinniswood Dalton and Percy Williams Easthope. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Albert is located in a marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C.

It debuted internationally in August 2019 at the 76th Venice Film Festival, and debuted in the Philippines on January 29, 2020. The Kingmaker was nominated as best documentary at the London Film Festival and the Stockholm Film Festival, and for the Checkpoints Award at the Bergen International Film Festival. It was nominated for four categories in the 2019 Critic‚Äôs Choice Documentary Awards, eventually winning the award for Most Compelling Living Subject of a Documentary. It also received the Audience Award for Best Documentary Film at the Warsaw International Film Festival 2019. The film has a 97% Certified Fresh rating from Rotten Tomatoes and a 76/100 from Metacritic.. Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved on December 16, 2019.. Metacritic. Retrieved on December 12, 2019.  Plot  Greenfield‚Äôs exploration of Imelda Marcos‚Äôs narrative takes on what the New York Times calls a ‚Äúdialectic‚Äù approach, allowing Imelda to tell her narrative and slowly introducing opposing viewpoints as the movie progresses. The film is organically divided into two parts, following the chronology of the events of Marcos‚Äôs life. The first half focuses on Imelda‚Äôs life from the time she became first lady of the Philippines in 1965, through the 21 years where she and her husband ruled the Philippines, until they were deposed and forced into exile by the 1986 People Power revolution. As described by IndieWire, the second half of the film ‚Äúfeatures survivors of her husband‚Äôs declaration of martial law and focuses on the political comeback of the Marcos family,‚Äù focused on the ascension of her son Bongbong Marcos to increasingly prominent national posts.  Subjects featured  Aside from Imelda Marcos herself, other figures Greenfield featured in the documentary include Marcos' son, the vice-presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos; former Philippine President Benigno Aquino III; Vice president Leni Robredo who had defeated Bongbong Marcos in the 2016 Philippine Vice Presidential election; former Presidential Commission on Good Government head Andres D. Bautista; and Martial Law torture survivors including former Commission on Human Rights chair Etta Rosales, and journalist-screenwriter Pete Lacaba.  Portrayal of Marcos  In numerous promotional interviews, Greenfield characterizes Imelda Marcos as the documentary‚Äôs unreliable narrator. In various interviews, Greenfield says she did not know this was going to be the case. She went into the first interviews with Marcos without knowing what to expect. In an interview with Vox, Greenfield recounts thinking Imelda was being ‚Äúsurprisingly candid‚Äù in her her first interview, and that she first thought Marcos actually believed what she was saying. Greenfield only realized that some of Marcos‚Äôs statements were ‚Äúobviously untrue‚Äù once she did further research. In later interviews, the topics got to ‚Äúreally egregious things,‚Äù which Greenfield says made it ‚Äúreally clear‚Äù Marcos was lying. In an interview with Fortune, Greenfield says: > ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a narcissist. I think she does believe her own story, but the self- > serving, strategic story, too. I think that in the past, people have made > the mistake of thinking she‚Äôs delusional, and she kind of puts that out > there, but I think it‚Äôs very strategic. She says early on in the film, > ‚ÄúPeople underestimate women, and sometimes that‚Äôs useful.‚Äù I think people > have underestimated her, and that‚Äôs made her only the more powerful and > successful.‚Äù = Dialectic approach = Greenfield recounts that Marcos was so effective that test-viewers who watched the interviews could not tell whether or not Marcos was lying. So in order to make sure viewers understood that something Marcos was saying was untrue, Greenfield would intersperse interviews with people who knew otherwise, such as Martial Law torture victims and officials who investigated the Marcoses. This resulted in a narrative style which the New York Times described as ‚Äúdialectic.‚Äù = Interviews as cin√©ma v√©rit√© = Another method Greenfield used in order to show that Imelda Marcos is an unreliable narrator was to turn the interviews into instances of Cin√©ma v√©rit√©, showing that Marcos was making efforts to project a pre-planned image of herself. One example prominently shown in early trailers shows how Marcos accidentally knocks over a glass picture frame, but doesn‚Äôt acknowledge the fact even while a uniformed servant cleans the glass shards off the floor for her. Greenfield tells Fortune Magazine: > I see that scene as showing how unstoppable she is. [‚Ä¶] I think about it > more like she breaks things and she‚Äôs not even aware and lets other people > clean up the mess. She doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge it. She‚Äôs telling her story > about being friends with and courting all of the dictators of the 20th > century, so she doesn‚Äôt pay attention to the wreckage around her and the > fact that other people have to deal with it.  Awards  The Kingmaker was nominated for numerous Best Documentary Awards, including the 2019 London Film Festival, the 2019 Stockholm Film Festival, the 2019 Bergen International Film Festival, the 2020 Chicago Independent Film Critics Circle Awards, the 2019 El Gouna Film Festival 2019, the 2020 Hollywood Critics Association Awards, the 2019 Philadelphia Film Critics Circle Awards, and the 2019 Warsaw International Film Festival (which it won). It was also nominated for four categories in the 2019 Critic‚Äôs Choice Documentary Awards, eventually winning the award for Most Compelling Living Subject of a Documentary.

The noble Mark Gjini belonged to the family.  Name  According to Krahe and Lambertz the noun Gjin may be an ancient Albanian name, a form of the anthroponym Gentius.Riska, Albert (2013). \\"The Christian Saints in the (Micro)toponymy of Albania\\". Anglisticum Journal (IJLLIS) vol 2 issue 3. Pages 167-176. Page 174 The name Gjin is generally associated by Albanian Christians to the figure of a saint.  Origin  The Gjini family is mentioned for the first time in 1216 in a letter sent from Pope Innocent III to Demetrius Gjini, the Prince of Albania.  Background  The Ginni family, amongst families like the Bruti, Bruni, Krutaj, Skuraj, fled to Venetian Albania due to Ottoman pressure in the 16th century, although migrations had already begun in 1479, after the fall of Shkod√´r. The Gjini family produced lawyers who lived and worked in Zadar and Dalmatia and also members who served in the Venetian military during the Cretan War (1645-1669). M. Antonovic writes of a Clement Ginni, a possible ancestor of the Gjini family figuring in Shkoder in 1330. The family reappears again only in 1536 in the will of Nikola Murthe, a migrant from Bar, who resides in Venice. A certain Baron Stjepan is said to have fled after Shkodra fell. In 1598, lawyers Nikola and Marko Ginni, sons of John Paul, are recorded in Zadar. Nikola was a captain in the Venetian military in 1622 where he did business with the head of Zadar, Simon Celadic. In 1593, Captain Marko Ginni was recorded as commander of a naval unit with soldiers commanded by Ulcinj migrant and Zadar resident Nikola Mesili (Melili) from Ulcinj. In 1595, two lawyers were recorded - John and Paul Ginni, the latter being a captain in 1595 when he married a noblewoman Margaret, daughter of Bartol Ferr. In 1602, Paul was recorded as a commander of an Albanian unit. A soldier named Leka Fransi from the Bojana river, was under Paul's command. In 1610, Ginni was to navigate a merchant ship from Venice to Split. In the summer, Ginni returned to Istria, where along with Captain Petar ≈Ωarkoviƒá, commanded a detachment of 38 soldiers. The last mentioning of Paul Ginni is recorded in 1612 where he captured five Senj narrows.

The features of the local relief include alas depressions with lakes and swamps, as well as polygonal soils. Along the banks of rivers, seas and lakes there are baydzharakh mounds. Climate The climate of the lowland is severe, with long, bitter winters. The vast plain is wholly frozen, under ice and snow, between early October and the end of May or early June, according to the year. Once the ice melts large areas become flooded and some islands and sandbanks completely disappear underwater.

There is evidence of pre-historic activity at the site and some sources say it was fortified by the Romans (a Romano-British settlement has also been found nearby). The site came to prominence during the Anglo- Saxon era when a settlement was established. In the mediaeval period, a manor house was established next to the hill and a motte castle constructed atop it. The castle has since disappeared and the area returned to agricultural use. The site was listed as a scheduled monument in 1923.  Description  Whittington Tump from the M5 northbound Whittington Tump is located some south east of the city of Worcester and commands its southern approaches. The hill rises above the valley floor and is approximately oval in plan, measuring by . It has been described as an \\"enigmatic feature\\" with little known of its origin but it is believed to be an artificial enhancement of a natural hill. In particular it is believed that the side slopes, likely to have already been quite steep, have been steepened by the work of man ‚Äì especially upon the northern side. This interpretation has been in place since at least the mid-19th century. The hill is overlain with reddish brown clayey soil of the local Worcester Series. John Price writing in 1799 thought that the name of the hill came from Old British but both Crookbarrow and Whittington are derived from Old English. Whittington is a development of \\"Hwinton\\" ‚Äì meaning a farm or enclosure belonging to a man by the name of White. The modern M5 motorway passes within of the site to the south east. The tump, recognisable by a distinctive solitary tree on its top, is clearly visible from the motorway on the approaches to junction 7 (Worcester South) and is used by some motorists as a land mark.  History  Triangulation pillar and tree on top of the tump =Early occupation = There is evidence of prehistoric activity at the site, a neolithic scraper was found on the north-east side of Whittington Tump in 1886, and the hill would have formed an important landmark at this time. It has been posited that the site has prehistoric roots either as a religious monument or burial mound; Anglo-Saxon writings describe it as an ancient site. By the 18th-century it came to be regarded as a burial mound and one of the largest in England; though no evidence has been found to prove this hypothesis. A Romano-British settlement site has also been located around to the south of the site. This may have been a large farmstead, a hamlet or a small village ‚Äì with the evidence hinting towards one of the latter. Archaeologists found evidence of ironworking as well as domestic activities dating from as early as the 2nd century AD; the site appears to have been abandoned by the 3rd or 4th centuries. Other Roman artefacts have been recovered from the north-east face of the tump. Owing to similarities with the name \\"Crookbarrow\\" the site was described by some antiquarians as the burial site of the 1st century AD British chieftain Caratacus, though he was probably buried in Rome where he died in captivity. One antiquarian, John Price, stated in 1799 that the site had been fortified by the Romans and subsequently saw use as a burial site. = Anglo-Saxon and mediaeval eras = It is believed that an Anglo-Saxon enclosure, presumably that of White, was established by the 7th century AD. A settlement here would have had the advantage of fertile soil, a ready supply of water from Long Brook and good visibility over the surrounding land. The settlement is referred to in contemporary Anglo-Saxon documents as a widely known and visible landmark and was one of a number of Anglo-Saxon settlements in southern Worcestershire. It is said that Whittington Tump was an important spot from which laws passed in Middlesex were proclaimed. A mediaeval manor known as Crookbarrow Manor is mentioned in a document of 1314 as being in the demesne of Alexander and Elizabeth de Montfort. The remains of a manor were discovered to the immediate east of the hill during archaeological investigations ahead of works to widen the M5 motorway. It is believed that this site had a primarily agricultural role. The manor site measured approximately square and was surrounded by a moat that was probably originally revetted in masonry. There is evidence of mediaeval ridge and furrow farming to the north of the manor. Archaeologists also believe that a motte castle was present on the summit of the hill during this period. The motte may have had a wooden or stone tower and a terrace on the north and west sides of the structure indicated that it was probably surrounded by a palisade or walkway. A number of square depressions on the top of Whittington Tump indicate the presence of structures some wide. The motte was subject to ridge and furrow farming later in the mediaeval era after its abandonment. Prominent ridge and furrow remains are evident on the north and west side of the hill on a north-west to south-east alignment. = Modern era = The south-west corner of the former manor site was occupied by Crookbarrow Farm from the 17th century. Continued agricultural use of the area has resulted in an earth bank (lynchet) forming against the base of the hill, this is particularly visible on the west and south-west faces of the hill. In some areas, the lynchet has since been planted with trees and utilised as a field boundary. The south-east and northern parts of the former manor house moat survive and remain visible as a ditch up to wide and deep. The entire site (described as a \\"motte castle, moated site, and medieval agricultural remains\\") was listed as a scheduled monument on 10 August 1923. This was because the castle has been described as a good example of a motte structure and the tump may preserve details of the original construction such as post holes or foundations. The site is described in the listing documentation as an important record of the political and social organisation of Worcestershire during the medieval period. As part of the retriangulation of Great Britain a triangulation pillar was erected on top of the tump by 1948.

In order to redeem himself, he enlisted as a volunteer in the Imperial army operating in Hungary during the Siege of Buda. In the next year, he returned to Venice, enlisting in the Venetian navy under the captain (Governator di Nave) Pietro Zaguri. In 1693, he was appointed paymaster under the Doge and Captain General of the Sea Francesco Morosini. In 1695, he took part in the naval Battle of the Oinousses Islands, under the command of Captain General against the Ottoman fleet, and in the next year he fought in the Battle of Andros under Captain General .

In 1716, he participated in the successful defence of Corfu, and recaptured Butrint and Santa Maura. In 1717, he distinguished himself in the battle off Passavas, along with his brother : aboard a small felucca, Pisani passed through the enemy ships in full action, reorganized his own ships of the line, and encouraged his troops. Once back in Santa Maura, he busied himself with its re-fortification, alongside Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg. He then recovered Preveza and Vonitsa, for which he was awarded by the Senate the Knighthood of the . In 1718, he was besieging Dulcigno when news arrived of the Treaty of Passarowitz. He lifted the siege and returned with the fleet to Corfu. On 21 September 1718 he was killed in an explosion caused when a thunderbolt struck a gunpowder magazine. His body was transported to Venice, where his funeral took place; he was buried in the island of La Certosa.

He descended from the family von Stoffeln with property on Castle Hohenstoffeln on the Hohenstoffeln at Hegau. He was substantially involved in the Appenzell Wars as the city refused to pay homage to him, and the Appenzellers, his subjects, even refused to pay taxes. Due to the price decline of grain after a disastrous plague epidemic, Kuno had been obliged to drastically increase taxes in order to balance the loss of revenue. He first aligned with cities at Lake Constance that were devoted to him and later with Duke Frederick IV of Austria in order to put an end to the population's attempts at freedom. He was not granted any luck in battle, however: the abbot's army lost one battle after another. Eventually, Kuno was forced to sell or lease estates in order to fill the abbey till. He left behind a completely run down monastery which had become meaningless in comparison to the aspiring city. In chronicles of the 15th century, Kuno is described as a true spectre.

It revolves around one-on-one battles that require fast reflexes. The game was released on July 25, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, Linux, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.  Gameplay  Fantasy Strike is designed to be less complex than traditional fighting games, having dedicated buttons for every action, including melee, jump/throw, special moves, and a super move. Each player picks a character to play, which are then placed in an arena. By performing various attacks unique to the character, each player tries to bring down their opponents health pool down to zero to win a round. Whoever is the first to win four out of seven rounds is given the match win. In addition to attacks, players can use blocking to defend against attacks and break through blocks by using throws. A unique feature to Fantasy Strike is the \\"Yomi Counter\\", which can be performed when not attacking by pressing no buttons at all. When yomi countering, if the character is hit by an opponents throw, they won't get hit and instead perform a counter throw, turning the tables. The game features various modes. Singleplayer pits the player in matches against AI controlled opponents, with different modes putting a different spin on the formula. Arcade adds some story through artwork and dialog, as well as stronger version of the character Midori who serves as the final challenge, Survival provides a stream of progressively stronger opponents. Daily Challenge is similar to Survival, but can only be played once per day and compares the score between the players. Single Match allows a selection of any opponent and difficulty for a standard match. Boss Rush, which was added afterwards for the full release, allows the player to pick up and use power-ups, but introduces special opponents that also possess power- ups and get stronger after each battle. Multiplayer allows player-against- player matches both locally and online. The latter provides automatic match- making for a casual and a ranked queue, or directly challenging specific opponents through friend matches. Players may either choose to play Standard or Team Battle. Standard refers to the classic mode, where each player picks a character to play a best of seven. Team Battle instead makes each player pick three characters. The game will then randomly pick a character from each players pool of characters, upon which the players play a best of five. The winning player removes his character from his pool. This is repeated until a player has no more characters in his pool, meaning he won with all of his characters and is thus declared the winner. Team Battle is used in ranked play and proposed as the go-to mode for tournaments, as it is designed to alleviate the issue of counter-picking. In addition to single-player and multi-player modes, there is also a tutorial, a learn section and a training mode. The tutorial should teach new players how to play the game in general, while the learn section contains characters spotlight videos that delve deeper into what to do with each individual character. The training mode is lets player experiment and practice with a character as well as look up frame data in real-time.  Plot  The game is set in the world of the same name, \\"Fantasy Strike\\", a world featured in other games made by Sirlin Games. In the story, Rook hosts a martial arts tournament to rally the strongest fighters of the land.  Characters  The game features ten different playable characters, categorized into four different groups: zoner, rushdown, grappler and wildcard. Reception Fantasy Strike received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to website Metacritic. Many reviewers praised the game's accessibility by virtue of the relative ease of execution, while retaining the depth that makes fighting games difficult to master and fun. Farrell from PC Invasion states that \\"the game is purely skill-based, as every good fighter game is. There were worries that the game could be too simple or that the game gets too repetitive because of the limited movesets. With ten characters, some noted that Fantasy strikes roster is fairly small compared to other titles. However, most are also quick to mention how those few characters are highly distinct and offer unique experiences. The in-game materials that are supposed to help the player learn and understand the game were praised. Martinez from Gaming Illustrated mentions how \\"Utilizing both videos and tutorials helps you deepen your understanding of surface and high level play and the underlying mechanics.\\". Furthermore, some reviewers commented on how the clean visuals and various UI Hints (such as color-coded moves and \\"Jumpable\\" text) made it easier to understand what was happening while playing. Reviewers also agree that the rollback based netcode makes for a solid online experience. Concerning the visual presentation, reviewers appear to be in disagreement. Some say that \\"The visuals and aesthetics are mostly bland\\", ascribing the game a typical style that is not distinct enough to set itself apart. On the other hand, some highlighted the game as something that is pleasing to look at. Reviewers also expressed their dissatisfaction with some of the single- player modes. Jones from Heavy says that \\"While there‚Äôs a lot of modes on display here, not all of them are fully featured and worth returning to.\\" and O'Reilly from Nintendo Life complains that the \\"arcade mode is a little barebones\\". In contrast, the single player-mode boss rush is mentioned as a highlight.

He was the grandfather of Heinrich von Gundelfingen.  Life  Heinrich descended from the same family as the former Abbot of Saint Gall, Konrad von Gundelfingen (1288‚Äì1291). The first mention of Heinrich as monk in Saint Gall appears in connection with the election of his predecessor. Before his election as abbot, Heinrich is documented three more times: in 1383, 1395 and in 1410 as master of the monastery. From 1392 he was documented as working dean and from 1401 as gatekeeper. He was probably neither educated nor priestly ordinated. Being one of two conventuals, who, after Abbot Kuno von Stoffeln's death, remained at the monastery, he became abbot upon the urging of the city of Saint Gall. The abbey was at that time merely retained for trade and economic reasons. The other conventual, Georg von Enne, received the remaining monastic offices.  Works  In 1411, Heinrich received homage in Saint Gall. On 6 January 1412, the city appealed to Pope John XXIII for the confirmation of the new abbot and described in the same letter the abysmal state of the abbey. Thereupon, on 28 March 1412, the Pope commanded the Bishop of Augsburg, the Judicial vicar of Basel and the Cantor of Saint Felix and Regula to protect the abbey in its rights and property. On 5 December 1411, he even took the abbey under his own protection and confirmed its rights. Emperor Sigismund provided Heinrich with a confirmation of prerogatives and a jura regalia on 24 October 1413. In the same year, as it was custom, the abbot on his part confirmed the rights of the cities of Saint Gall, Wil and Wangen. A dispute between the abbey and the Appenzeller, which had begun during the reign of Henrich's predecessor and had culminated in the Appenzell Wars, in which the abbey was defeated, was in 1412 brought before the federal Tagsatzung, but the negotiations remained fruitless. In the year 1417, several visitations took place in the abbey. They all concluded that the monastery was in high need of reform. Subsequently, Abbot Heinrich was removed from office and Konrad von Pegau was on 9 May 1418 pronounced abbot in his stead. One last documentary mention of Heinrich as abbot appears on 13 June 1418. Due to an agreement with Abbot Heinrich von Mansdorf, Heinrich von Gundelfingen received a life estate of 200 gulden on 21 August 1419. After Heinrich von Mansdorf's death, Heinrich, as only conventual, became again caretaker and governor of the abbey.

Afterwards, during the Zog regime and Communist take over, she was treated badly and interrogated in Shkoder, and his fighters against Ottoman and Serb armies in 1910‚Äì1912. Nora Luli was married to Gjelosh Luli, the son of Ded Gjon Luli. Nora was given the \\"Hero of the People\\" award.  Life and death  Born in 1880 in Pikal√´ in Hoti, she grew up and lived in an environment of Albanian highlander warriors with the local men having fought for the League of Prizren. Nora married Gjelosh Luli, son of Ded Gjon Luli. Amongst the highlander warriors were Gjok Luli, Gjergj Deda, Nik Gjelosh Luli, Lek Nishi, Mark Mirin, Mark Gjelosh Lula, Kol Miri, Lul Gjeloshi and Luk Gjeloshi and captain Gjelosh Luli, most who ended up dead or as \\"enemies of the people\\" during the Communist take over. At a young age, she learned how to use firearms thanks to her father and she became one of the best shooters in the Hoti region. After her father died, she inherited his rifle, and shortly after, she joined Ded Gjon Luli's forces against the Ottoman and Serb armies. Nora organized the Women's Warfare Unit. Many of the women gathered information on the enemy, collected weapons and ammunition and transported them to Hoti. In 1910, Ded Gjon Luli appointed Nora responsible for the women of Hoti and Tring Smajli for the women of Gruda who fought in Shkoder and Podgorica. On March 23, 1911, the uprising broke out with the battle of Traboin with an Albanian victory. After Albanian casualties, Nora went home to the widows and said \\"Your men's rifles should not be silenced. Take them you brave women and come take revenge!\\". The women of Hoti also fought in the Battle of Decic with Nora leading the attack where she was wounded. At the Qafe Ungl√´, Nora saved some women surrounded by four Turkish soldiers. Nora's husband, Gjelosh Luli, was poisoned by a Serb agent leaving her with young orphaned children. When the communists took over in Albania, her husband was hunted who eventually died in the mountains of Kastrat, and Nora Luli was interrogated in Shkod√´r and then released. In 1962, on the 50th anniversary of the Albanian independence, Nora of Hoti, at the age of 82, was honored in the official state celebration in Vlora at the invitation of Enver Hoxha.

In 1979, he graduated with a specialist degree in physics and engineering from the Faculty of Physics and Mechanics of the Leningrad Polytechnic Institute. In 1984, he graduated with honors from the Department of Modern and Contemporary History, Faculty of History of Leningrad State University. In 1991, under the supervision of Professor Vladimir Revunenkov, a Doctor of Historical Sciences, he defended his dissertation at St. Petersburg State University for the degree of Candidate of Historical Sciences on the topic of The Officer Corps of the French Army Under the Ancien R√©gime and During the Revolution of 1789‚Äì1799 (speciality 07.00.03 ‚Äì general history). The official opponents were Professor David Pritzker, a Doctor of Historical Sciences, and researcher at the Leningrad Branch of the Institute of History of the USSR Sergey Iskyul, a Candidate of Historical Sciences. The external review was conducted by the Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia. Since 2000, he had been a Docent of the Department of Modern History, Faculty of History of St. Petersburg State University. He is the author of a number of works on the military history of Europe of the 17th‚Äìearly 19th centuries. In 1999, he published a major study, Napoleon's Army, which was translated into French in 2003. In 2006, he published the two-volume monograph Austerlitz. Napoleon, Russia and Europe, 1799‚Äì1805, a study of the premises and course of Napoleon's first war against the anti-French coalition. He translated into Russian and supplemented with extensive commentary Memoirs of the Napoleonic Wars 1802‚Äì1815 () by French officer Octave Levavasseur, who took part in all military campaigns (except for the Russian campaign of 1812) by Napoleon Bonaparte. He was a prominent figure in Russian historical reenactment. In 1976, he founded the first reenactment group of the Napoleonic era. In February 1989, the Federation of Military History Clubs of the USSR was created and Sokolov became its president. In subsequent years, Sokolov continued to lead the association of clubs involved in reenactment (Military- Historical Association of Russia (1996), All-Russian Military-Historical Social Movement (2006))..  Arrest for murder On 9 November 2019, Sokolov was detained on suspicion of the murder of Anastasia Yeshchenko, his 24-year- old lover, his graduate student at St. Petersburg State University and his co- author of scholarly works. There is an ongoing investigation by the Investigative Committee of Russia.–£–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¥–µ–≤—É—à–∫–∏ –¥–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º –°–ü–±–ì–£ // –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ñ–∞–∫—Å On 11 November, Sokolov was charged with wilful murder (article 105 of the Criminal Code)–î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—É –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤—É –ø—Ä–µ–¥—ä—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–æ –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ —É–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–º —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –∞—Å–ø–∏—Ä–∞–Ω—Ç–∫–∏ // –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ñ–∞–∫—Å, 11.11.2019 and was arrested for two months until 8 January 2020 with the detention in the Kresty Prison. On 13 November, his defense lawyer said that Sokolov had given full testimony on the case (he had previously refused to do so, referring to the 51st article of the Constitution of the Russian Federation).–î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–∞–ª –ø—Ä–∏–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –∫–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ü–∏–µ–π –∏ —É–ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∏–ª —Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è–º —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É. According to the investigation, Sokolov was found in the Moyka River in Saint Petersburg with a backpack containing the woman's arms and a weapon. Local media claims he was drunk and fell into the river as he tried to dispose of body parts. Police found the parts of humans body in his home, but the package with the victim‚Äôs torso was not caught from the river until 11 November. He has admitted guilt and is willing to cooperate in the investigation. According to Sokolov's defense lawyer, his client filed a confession, but the defense team does not intend to exclude the version of self-incrimination. In addition, his lawyer noted that Sokolov was assigned a psychiatric examination. As Sokolov himself stated during a meeting of the Oktyabrsky District Court of St. Petersburg, the crime was committed on the basis of a personal conflict, because, according to him, Yeshchenko had ‚Äúrecently a terrible reaction to my children‚Äù and ‚Äúshe started to freak at their mention‚Äù and then they both ‚Äúlost control‚Äù during a quarrel and then ‚Äúshe attacked me with a knife‚Äù.–î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤ –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–ª —É–±–∏—Ç—É—é –∏–º –¥–µ–≤—É—à–∫—É \\"—á—É–¥–æ–≤–∏—â–µ–º\\", –Ω–∞–ø–∞–≤—à–∏–º –Ω–∞ –Ω–µ–≥–æ —Å –Ω–æ–∂–æ–º // –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä—Ñ–∞–∫—Å, 11.11.2019–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å—É–¥. –î–æ—Ü–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –°–æ–∫–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –∞—Ä–µ—Å—Ç–æ–≤–∞–ª–∏ –≤ –ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥–µ. –û–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω // –§–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–Ω–∫–∞.—Ä—É, 11.11.2019 At the same time, according to the local media, the young woman was killed in her sleep by a shot in the head.

The representative of the Investigative Committee also promised to verify Sokolov's involvement in the beating of another woman. In 2018, the Moskovskij Komsomolets newspaper published an article in which Sokolov's student accused the lecturer of brutal beating in 2008. Soon after reports of his detention, the Russian Military Historical Society (RMHS), chaired by Minister of Culture Vladimir Medinsky, removed from its website all mention of Oleg Sokolov, who formerly was a member of its scientific council, and the adviser to the RMHS chairman announced that she had heard his name for the first time. French Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (ISSEP), founded by Marion Mar√©chal, the niece of Marine Le Pen, had removed him from his position on its scientific committee on Saturday (November 9th). He was subsequently dismissed from his post at Saint Petersburg State University.

The base, located on the southwest bank of the Saigon River about from the South China Sea, represented the largest single industrial complex in South East Asia. The shipyard was originally created around 1788 by Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c √Ånh as the Chu Su Naval workshop. With help from French engineers Lord Nguyen built a fleet of ships that helped him defeat the T√¢y S∆°n dynasty and establish him as Emperor Gia Long. The naval workshop was progressively expanded and after the French conquered Cochinchina in 1862 they expanded the area as the Port de la Marine (Naval Port) under the control of the French Navy. The French Navy expanded the base facilities making it the Navy headquarters and home to the Naval Artillery and barracks. In 1864 the Navy expanded the Chu Su Naval workshop into the Naval Arsenal and Shipyard which by 1888 had modern facilities including a 168m drydock. In 1902 the base became the headquarters of the Naval Forces of the Oriental Seas under the command of a Vice Admiral who controlled 38 ships and over 3800 officers and sailors. By 1918 the shipyard was capable of building vessels of up to 3500 Deadweight tonnage (DWT). With the departure of the French the base passed to the control of the RVNN. In 1955 the shipyard was renamed the Ba Son Shipyard and it was capable of building vessels up to 10,000 DWT and repairing vessels up to 35,000 DWT. Starting in 1965, the shipyard built 90 Yabuta junks for the Junk Force to replace their wooden junks. Mr. Yabuta, a Japanese engineer at the shipyard in 1961, originally designed the junk. Armed with a .30-caliber machine gun, it featured a 110-horsepower diesel engine capable of generating ten knots of speed and was built entirely out of fiberglass, which obviated the need to treat the hulls for wood-boring Teredo worms. Wooden junks, by contrast, needed to have their hulls scraped, blow-torched and resealed every three months. The U.S. Military Assistance Program provided funds for building materials and engines, and the Vietnamese paid the wages of the shipyard laborers who built the junks. After the first Yabutas were completed, output slowed significantly. In 1966 the shipyard built only nine junks and in 1967, just 15. Production went from three junks a week in 1965 to one every five weeks in 1967 as private construction firms lured shipyard workers away with salaries, on average, three times higher than what the government had paid them. At 03:00 on 31 January 1968 at the start of the Tet Offensive, twelve Viet Cong (VC) sappers approached the base in two civilian cars, killing two guards at a barricade at Me Linh Square and then advanced towards the base gate. The sound of gunfire alerted base sentries who secured the gate and sounded the alarm. A .30-caliber machine gun on the second floor of the headquarters disabled both cars and killed or wounded several sappers while the Navy security force organized a counterattack. Simultaneously a U.S. Navy advisor contacted the U.S. military police who soon attacked the VC from adjoining streets, the resulting crossfire ended the attack, killing eight sappers with two captured. With the Fall of Saigon the base was taken over by the VPN which continues to use the barracks at 1A Ton Duc Thang () to the present day. In 2015 the Ba Son Shipyard was closed and sold to a private developer who later demolished all the facilities to make way for apartment development.

Life  Pope Martin V assigned the Abbey of Saint Gall to Konrad von Pegau in 1418, after the dismissal of Abbot Heinrich von Gundelfingen, who had fallen from grace because of the lack of reforms. Konrad von Pegau had distinguished himself at the Council of Konstanz by his scholarliness and his enthusiasm for reform. Pegau is situated in the Bishopric Merseburg. Konrad von Pegau however soon asked the Pope to release him again from the task of administering the abbey. The state of things in Saint Gall was too discouraging, the more so as, only recently, a fire had raged in the abbey. The Pope condescended to Konrad's wish and on 15 March 1419, he announced this to the vassals of the monastery and simultaneously made Heinrich von Mansdorf the new abbot. Konrad's reign lasted ten months; he is once documented as abbot - on 23 January 1419.  Sources  * Erhart, Peter. 2008: \\"Konrad von Pegau\\".

Etymology The specific name susurra is derived from the Latin susurrus meaning \\"whispering\\" and refers to the relatively quiet advertisement call of this species compared to those of other sympatric anuran (Hyla japonica and Rhacophorus arboreus). Evolution Both Glandirana rugosa and Glandirana susurra are present on Sado Island, but their ranges do not overlap: G. susurra occurs on the central part of the island while G. rugosa in the south and in the north. Together with the fact that the race of G. rugosa on Sida Island is only distantly related to G. susurra, this suggests that G. susurra speciated on Sato Island before the invasion of the present G. rugosa lineage. Experiments suggest that the postzygotic reproductive isolation between these lineages is nearly perfect, although it remains to be confirmed that this also applies to specimens originating from areas near the species boundary. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is rounded. The tympanum is distinct and the supratympanic fold is well-developed. The fingers and the toes are slender with slightly depressed tips; no webbing is present between the fingers while the toes have well-developed webbing. Dorsal skin has many dermal ridges of varying size. The dorsum is khaki-colored, whereas the abdomen is almost whitish anteriorly and yellow posteriorly. A mid-dorsal stripe is present in some individuals. Males lack vocal sac (present in G. rugosa). Tadpoles of stages 41‚Äì42 measure about in body length. Habitat and conservation Glandirana susurra occurs near various bodies of water, such as rice fields, small streams, and ponds. It is known from elevations between above sea level. Spawning occurs in ponds from middle May to early August. Adult frogs and at least some tadpoles spend their winter in the mud under water. As of late 2019, this species has not been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

It forms the seaward shore of a large spit at the entrance to Hoopers Inlet. Allans Beach is by road from Dunedin city centre and from the small town of Portobello. It receives little human traffic but is known to trampers, surfers, and naturists.  Physical geography  Allans Beach proper is approximately long and faces south-southeast; it is part of the Allans Beach Recreation Reserve. It runs to the southwestern tip of the spit which narrows the opening of Hoopers Inlet to a channel some across. Behind the beach rises a system of dunes covered in pƒ´kao sedge. Behind these dunes lies Hoopers Inlet Swamp, which consists of a sequence of wetland types from freshwater swamp to salt marsh. The Allans Beach Wildlife Management Reserve covers a section of the Inlet beyond these wetlands. Northeastward the land rises towards Mount Charles; eastward along the coast the slopes of the Mount abut the sea to form the rugged headlands of MƒÅtakitaki and Cape Saunders. On the far side of the channel the next peak is Sandymount. Periodically, natural processes cause sediments to block the channel entirely, most recently in 2012. The surf at Allans Beach is generally stronger than at beaches closer to the city; in winter the swells coming from the Southern Ocean can be huge.  Wildlife  Sea lion on Allans Beach Allans Beach is frequented by New Zealand fur seals, New Zealand sea lions, and yellow-eyed penguins. The public are urged to keep at least away from these animals, and from active sea lions. Visitors encountering yellow-eyed penguins are asked to crouch down so as not to disturb them. In addition, Hoopers Inlet and the wetlands on the northern side of the Allans Beach spit host a diverse range of estuarine biota. Sharks may be encountered offshore. Despite the aforementioned precautions (which may be enforced by fines under the Marine Mammals Protection Act), some recreational users of Allans Beach have been observed harassing the wildlife. The yellow-eyed penguins' nearest nesting colony is on the Sandymount side of the Hoopers Inlet channel; during the periodic natural blockages of the channel it becomes accessible to foot traffic from the beach, thus exposing the colony to interference by humans and dogs.  Recreational use  Allans Beach sees relatively few visitors. Access is via a walking track across farmland from the end of Allans Beach Road. This track continues for the entire length of the beach and is used for walking, jogging, and wildlife observation. The low elevation of the terrain renders it suitable for trampers of all skill levels. Dogs may be walked on a leash at the western end of the beach but are not permitted at the eastern end, to protect the wildlife. Horses are not permitted on Allans Beach as the area is deemed ecologically sensitive. The frequently high swells can make Allans Beach dangerous for swimmers and challenging for surfers. At least an intermediate level of surfing skill is recommended except on particularly calm days. Owing to Allans Beach's secluded situation, it is favoured by naturists. New Zealand has no official nude beaches, as public nudity is legal on any beach where it is \\"known to occur\\".

In a long career he played leading roles in London theatres. Early life and career Lacy was born, as Walter Williams, in Bristol in 1809, the son of a coach-builder, and was educated for the medical profession. He was first seen on the stage in Edinburgh in 1829, as Count Montalban in The Honey Moon; he was playing there again in 1832, and acted also in Glasgow, Liverpool, and Manchester. His debut in London was at the Haymarket Theatre in August 1838, as Charles Surface in The School for Scandal. Harriette Taylor, who played Lady Teazle in the production, became Lacy's wife in 1839. After three years' engagement at the Haymarket, he accepted three years' engagement at Covent Garden, where he first appeared as Captain Absolute in The Rivals. He then joined the company of Drury Lane; his first appearance there was as Wildrake in James Sheridan Knowles's The Love Chase.\\"Lacy, Walter\\". Charles E Pascoe, editor. The Dramatic List: a record of the performances of living actors and actresses of the British stage. 1880. Princess's Theatre For seven years he was a member of the company at the Princess's Theatre in London, under the management of Charles Kean. He was first seen there in September 1852, as Rouble in the first performance of Dion Boucicault's The Prima Donna, and as Chateau Renaud in Boucicault's The Corsican Brothers. A reviewer wrote: \\"Rouble, the generous, wrong-headed millionaire, always fighting for his mistress, and always offending her, was admirably dressed and played by Mr Walter Lacy, who is a new addition to the company. His ludicrous distress, tempered in the oddest manner by a sort of cold nonchalance, made up one of those characteristic inconsistencies which stand out in the memory from the level of ordinary stage routine.... His performance of Chateau Renaud in The Corsican Brothers... was a great instance of his care and judgment in a part quite out of his usual line, and in which he had all the disadvantage of appearing after an excellent predecessor.\\" (The Times, 20 September 1852.) Other parts played at this theatre included John of Gaunt in Richard II, Edmund in King Lear, and Lord Trinket in The Jealous Wife. Later career He later appeared in various London theatres. In June 1860 he was, at the Lyceum Theatre, the Marquis of Saint Evremont in a dramatization of A Tale of Two Cities, and at Drury Lane in October 1864 was Cloten to Helena Faucit's Imogen in Cymbeline. He was Flutter in The Belle's Stratagem in October 1866 at St James's Theatre, where he was in November the first John Leigh in Boucicault's Hunted Down. In two Lyceum revivals of Romeo and Juliet he was Mercutio. In August 1868 he was, at the Princess's, the original Bellingham in Boucicault's After Dark. He became Professor of Elocution at the Royal Academy of Music, and was absent from the stage for many years. He reappeared at the Lyceum in April 1879 as Colonel Damas in Sir Henry Irving's revival of The Lady of Lyons. A reviewer wrote: \\"Colonel Damas exhibited a nature gentler and more subdued than that with which most actors have been wont to invest that worthy soldier; yet there were still distinctly to be traced those enduring remains of a skilled and careful training which neither time nor long disuse are ever able wholly to efface.\\" (The Times, 19 April 1879.) He died on 13 December 1898 at 13 Marine Square, Brighton, and was buried at Brompton Cemetery on 17 December. The drama critic Joseph Knight wrote: \\"Lacy was a respectable light comedian, but failed as an exponent of old men.... He was a familiar figure at the Garrick Club... and was almost to the last a man of much vivacity, and of quaint, clever, unbridled, and characteristic speech.\\" References Attribution * Category:1809 births Category:1898 deaths Category:19th-century English male actors Category:English male stage actors Category:Male actors from Bristol Category:Academics of the Royal Academy of Music Category:Burials at Brompton Cemetery ","title":"Walter Lacy"},{"id":"62304583","text":"Alice Thompson, or Alice Thomson may refer to: In literature * Alice Meynell, n√©e Thompson (18471922), British writer, editor, critic, and suffragist, remembered mainly as a poet * Alice Thompson (born ?), Scottish novelist * Alice Thomson (born 1967), British political journalist * Alice Thompson Gilbreath (born ?), author In music * Alice Thompson (musician), composer and pianist ","title":"Alice Thompson (disambiguation)"},{"id":"62304586","text":"Cindy Meyer (born 21 June 1964) is a South African short track speed skater.

He was an Edgar Award winner and worked as a Peace Corps teacher in Tanzania in the early and mid-1960s. He was also the author of An African Season about his experiences in Tanzania and as a teacher. It was the first book ever written by a Peace Corps volunteer. Early life Levitt was born in The Bronx, New York City, on April 27, 1941. His father, Boris, operated a business dealing with import/export; his mother, Celia (Kossovsky), was an English teacher at Hunter College. He grew up in the Five Towns area on Long Island. He graduated from Lawrence Woodmere Academy and went on to study at Dartmouth College, obtaining a bachelor's degree from that institution in 1963. Levitt subsequently joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in Tanzania teaching English. One of his students at Mpuguso Middle School in Rungwe District, Southern Highlands Province, was Godfrey Mwakikagile. He became an African studies scholar and author of many non-fiction books on African history, economics, and politics. *Godfrey Mwakikagile, My Life as an African: Autobiographical Writings, New Africa Press, 2009, p. 255: \\"When I was a student at Mpuguso Middle School,...I had been taught by two American Peace Corps teachers in my last year, 1964....One of them, Leonard Levitt, wrote a book, An African Season, about his experiences at our school and in Tanzania in general....\\" *Godfrey Mwakikagile, Africa: Dawn of a New Era, New Africa Press, 2015, p. 315: \\"The year 1964 when Leonard Levitt became one of our teachers was the worst in Congo's history.\\" Levitt also taught Oscar Mwamwaja, one of Tanzania's first commercial airline pilots who survived an Air Tanzania hijacking on February 26, 1982, during which he was forced to fly from Tanzania to Britain, according to reports, \\"Hijacked Jetliner Arrives in Britain,\\" The New York Times, 28 February 1982, and \\"4 Tanzanian Hijackers Surrender; 90 Hostages Are Freed in Britain,\\" The New York Times, 1 March 1982. Levitt wrote about his experiences as a teacher in Tanzania in the article \\"Tanzania: A Dream Deferred\\",‚ÄúTanzania: A Dream Deferred,‚Äù published in The New York Times Magazine in November 1982. as well as the book An African Season: The Long Way Round. The latter was the first book to be written by a member of the Peace Corps. In his book, Africa: Dawn of a New Era, Godfrey Mwakikagile stated the following about Leonard Levitt: ‚ÄúI remember very well what one of our first Peace Corp teachers said when he introduced himself to us in class at Mpuguso Middle School in Rungwe District in the Southern Highlands one morning in the early part of 1964 when I was in standard eight, what Americans call the eighth grade. He said: 'My name is Leonard Levitt. I am a Jew from New York City.'‚Äù - (Godfrey Mwakikagile, Africa: Dawn of a New Era, New Africa Press, 2015, p. 314). Career After graduating from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Levitt was first hired by the Long Island Press to be their sportswriter on a part- time basis. He was later employed by the Associated Press, The Detroit News, and Time. In 1975, he began working for Newsday, first as a beat reporter writing about police on Long Island, and later for the paper's New York edition. Levitt's most notable article came in 1991, in which he and Kevin Donovan wrote about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley. The two reporters read through approximately 400 pages of police documents and over 100 interviews. They concluded that the local police had acquiesced to the Skakel family, who were related to the Kennedy family through marriage. The report prompted authorities to reopen its investigation and press charges against Michael Skakel for murder. Although Skakel was convicted of murdering Moxley in 2002, he was freed in 2013 and had his conviction quashed in 2018, after an appeals court found that he had not been given effective assistance of counsel. Levitt left the New York edition of Newsday when the paper shut down in 2005. He launched his own blog called \\"NYPD Confidential\\", which was a continuation of his Newsday column \\"One Police Plaza\\" that he started a decade earlier. The New York City Police Department proceeded to revoke his press pass and prohibited him from entering the Department's headquarters, claiming that he was no longer licensed to possess credentials. However, he eventually regained these with the assistance of the New York Civil Liberties Union. The book detailing his investigation of the Moxley case, Conviction: Solving the Moxley Murder, which Levitt co-wrote with Frank Garr (the lead investigator for the prosecution), won the Edgar Award in 2005 for best non-fiction. Personal life Levitt was married to Susan (n√©e Gina) for 46 years. Together, they had a son (Michael) and a daughter (Jennifer). Levitt died on May 18, 2020, at his home in Stamford, Connecticut. He was 79, and had been suffering from lung cancer in the two years leading up to his death. News of his death was first announced by his daughter.

Considered one of the most significant Bulgarian authors of the 21st century. Life Born in Sofia in 1968, Boukova has a degree in Classics from Sofia University. She is the author of three books of poetry, including Diocletian‚Äôs Palaces (1995), Boat in the Eye (2000), and Notes of the Phantom Woman (2018); two collections of short stories, including A as in –ênything (2006) and Tales With No Return (2016); and the novel Traveling in the Direction of the Shadow (first published in 2009, followed by a revised edition in 2014). Her poems and short stories have been translated into numerous languages, including Greek, Spanish, French, German, and Arabic. English translations of her poetry and prose have been published in various anthologies and journals in the US and the UK, including Best European Fiction 2017, Words Without Borders, Two Lines, Absinthe, Drunken Boat, Ariel Art, European Literature Network, Zoland Poetry, Take Five, At the End of the World ‚Äì Contemporary Poetry from Bulgaria. Boukova has lived in Greece since 1994, where she is a member of the platform Greek Poetry Now and of the editorial board of FRMK, a biannual journal on poetry, poetics, and visual arts. Poems originally written by her in Greek were included in Austerity Measures: The New Greek Poetry (Penguin Books, 2016, New York Review of Books, 2017). Books in Greek: The minimal garden, Ikaros 2006 (translated by Dimitris Allos), Drapetomania, Mikri Arktos 2018. Boukova is also the editor and translator into Bulgarian of more than ten collections and anthologies of modern and ancient Greek poetry, including Sappho‚Äôs Fragments (The Union of Bulgarian Translators‚Äô Prize in 2010), the collected poetry of Catullus, and the Pythian Odes by Pindar (The National Prize for Translation in 2011). According to the Bulgarian poet and writer Silvia Choleva \\"Boukova is a Borgesian type of author. She favors play, references, riddles unexpected twists, ironies, and the dramaturgy of verse. She possesses deep knowledge not just in the sphere of the humanities, in which she specialized, but she is also enticed by science, she knows a lot, and all of this is reflected in Notes of the Phantom Woman\\" Fiction Iana Boukova is the author of the short story collections A as in –ênything (2006) and Tales With No Return (2016), and the novel Traveling in the Direction of the Shadow. Her novel was originally published in Bulgarian in 2009 (followed by a revised edition in 2014). Traveling in the Direction of the Shadow has been praised as one of the most innovative, compelling, erudite, idiosyncratic, and ambitious books to emerge out of the contemporary Bulgarian literary scene for decades past. This very Borgesian novel is a story about storytelling‚Äîabout stories‚Äô power to mutually attract, to find their path towards each other, and to complete one another. The main characters, whose names serve as titles of the novel‚Äôs eight chapters, all have their own complete, cradle-to-grave ‚Äúbiography,‚Äù their own hidden, often torturous talent; they have all been marked by fate in their own way. Intellectually, stylistically, and conceptually, Boukova is in conversation with a global community of authors, brought together by translation and including, in particular, Jorge Luis Borges as well as Marguerite Yourcenar, Milorad Paviƒá, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Italo Calvino, or Georges Perec, among others. Poetry Her poetry collection Notes of the Phantom Woman received the Ivan Nikolov National Award for the most outstanding book of poetry in 2019. A Greek-language version of it was also published in 2018 in Athens under the title Drapetomania. The Greek poet, artist, and translator Katerina Iliopoulou defines that: The Phantom-woman orchestrating the book is the invisibly present witness-poet, the one who has been turned into a ghost across the entire spectrum of the totalitarianism of merchandise, disguised as a cartoon-like superhero, showcasing the incredible transforming powers of poetry. Because the poetry at hand is not one of defeat but, rather, battle- ready poetry, the poetry of the present coming-to-be, which declares: we' re perfectly able to use your own weapons!. The Athens daily morning newspaper Kathimerini underlines the significance of Iana Boukova's poetry: A pointed intellect is in charge: a restless, ironic intelligence is given utterance in a style that‚Äôs meant to smart, to cause abrasions, unburdened by the delusion of prophetic speech and the concomitant assurance of high discourse. The Greek poet, and critic Orfeas Apergis emphasizes in the newspaper Ta Nea that: This book brings in contact the essay form (the philosophic, metaphysical ‚Äútendency‚Äù) and poetry (poetic excess), like two ever-moving, rotating grindstones that hone one another. Boukova formulates conclusions that appear scientific yet bear a poetic charge, one usually expressed in terms of terror at the metaphysical void. The book‚Äôs second central section is titled ‚ÄúTractatus‚Äù. It is a treatise on the revulsion an observer feels towards city pigeons. Like Wittgenstein meeting Kafka, you might say. This Tractatus could well be taught at schools as an example of the difference between poetry and ‚Äúpoeticality‚Äù.\\" Works =Books= *Notes of the Phantom Woman: Poetry.

Third reading was agreed to in House of Representatives on 5 December 2019. In May 2020, the bill was shelved by the government. The bill proposes to: * give the Federal Court of Australia power to cancel the registration of a registered organisation (that is, a union or an employer organisation) or disqualify office-holders from holding an office within an organisation; * introduce offences for acting as an officeholder while disqualified; and * introduce a public interest test for the amalgamation of registered organisations. 2017 Bill First 2019 Bill The first 2019 bill was introduced at the start of the 46th Parliament in July 2019, in the aftermath of the Royal Commission into Trade Union Governance and Corruption and particularly the revelation of misconduct within the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU). John Setka, the Victorian Secretary of the CFMEU, was asked to be expelled from the Australian Labor Party, and even resign as head of CFMEU Victorian branch, over alleged comments against \\"anti-violence campaigner Rosie Batty\\". Crossbencher Senator Jacqui Lambie has threatened to vote for the bill if Setka did not resign from the CFMEU Victoria branch, to the point that she invited Setka over to her Tasmanian home for Sunday roast, in a bid to convince Setka to resign. Labor and the Greens were opposed to the bill. This left the deciding power to the other five crossbencher senators: Lambie, Centre Alliance senators Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff, Pauline Hanson's One Nation senators Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts. The government had assumed One Nation would be supporting the bill and would hence ensure its passage in the Senate. However, on 28 November 2019, the bill was defeated in the Senate on a 34‚Äî34 tie vote, after One Nation apparently blindsided the government and voted against it. Lambie also voted against it, after her amendments were rejected by the government. Second 2019 Bill A few days after the first 2019 bill was defeated, the second 2019 bill was reintroduced into the parliament on 4 December 2019. The third reading was agreed to in the House of Representatives the following day on 5 December 2019. , the bill is awaiting second debate in the Senate. Jacqui Lambie stated in January 2020 that she might consider supporting the bill if her amendments were supported by the government. Lambie already had preliminary discussions about her amendments with Rex Patrick, who will likely back the bill in the Senate. Pauline Hanson stated she was open to shifting her position after opposing the previous bill, but would only make the decision after she had seen the updated version of the bill, spoken to Malcolm Roberts and met with all interested parties. On 26 May 2020, Morrison announced that the government will shelve the bill, Instead, the government will chair five working groups ahead of the budget later that year in October, to try to reach a consensus with unions and employers to change the current industrial relations system. Morrison stated that the current system is \\"not fit for purpose\\".

Biography  Lodovico Flangini was born in Venice in 1677 to a noble family of the Venetian patriciate,Flangini - Dizionario Storico-Portatile Di Tutte Le Venete Patrizie FamiglieFlangini - Libro dei nobili veneti, messo in luce the third son of Girolamo, a Senator and member of the Council of Ten. Already as a youth he enlisted in the Venetian navy and participated in the War of the Morea in 1696‚Äì1697 as a ship of the line captain (Governator di Nave) under the provveditore Grimani. He was then elected as provveditore straordinario di Terraferma at Orzinuovi in 1701, at Brescia in 1704, and at Bergamo in 1706. In 1717, during the Seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, he was appointed Capitano Straordinario delle Navi (commander of the sailing fleet), replacing Andrea Corner. He thus took over command of 28 ships of the line in three divisions (Red, Yellow, and Blue), 18 galleys, 2 galleasses, 10 galliots, 4 fireships, and 2 corvettes. In addition, Venice's allies in the Holy League provided 7 Portuguese, 5 Papal, and 4 Maltese ships of the line, as well as 5 Spanish, 4 Papal, 3 Maltese, 2 Tuscan, and 2 Genoese galleys. Flangini hoiste dhis ensign on the newly built 70-cannon battleship Leon Trionfante, and on 12 May scored a partial victory at the Battle of Imbros, in which he forced the Ottoman fleet of 42 ships to retreat. Four days later, the two fleets met again in the sea between Mount Athos and the island of Agios Efstratios, and in the ensuing battle, the Venetians defeated the Ottomans. Six Ottoman ships of the line were badly damaged, and the Ottoman fleet suffered 2,500 killed or wounded. As the Ottoman fleet began its retreat, a musket ball hit Flangini in the neck. Heavily wounded, he sailed to Thermia (Kythnos), but again led the Venetian fleet in battle on 22 June, directing the action from the deck of his flagship until he collapsed and died. His final words were reportedly \\"Verd√®, San Marco ne aiuta\\". His body was transported to Venice, where his funeral took place. His brother Constantino received the title of a Knight of the in his stead. The poet and musician Benedetto Marcello composed an ode in his honour, Corona Poetica in Morte di S.E.

Etymology The name derives from the nearby Tzofar stream and is also referring to one of the \\"friends\\" of Job (f.e. Job 2:11).Bitan, Hanna: 1948-1998: Fifty Years of 'Hityashvut': Atlas of Names of Settlements in Israel, Jerusalem 1999, Carta, p.58, In the Negev there are also kibbutzim with the names of the two other \\"friends\\"; nearby former Mahane Bildad, since 2001 named Tzukim, and Elifaz in the southern Arava. History The settlement was founded as a Nahal settlement in 1968 where Bildad Camp is currently located. In 1975 it was established as a moshav by city residents and native moshavniks and relocated several kilometers north to reach is present-day location. After the peace agreement between Israel and Jordan, Israel transferred a portion of the land area in Tzofar to Jordanian control, known as Al Ghamr, but Israel rented the land so that Israeli workers from the moshav could continue to cultivate it. The 25-year renewable lease would end in 2019. The Jordanian government announced its intention to end the lease. The treaty gives Jordan the right to do so only on one condition-that a one-year prior notice is given, which coincided with the announcement in October 2018. In October 2019, Israeli officials said that King Abdullah II of Jordan agreed that Israeli farmers can continue working their crops in the Al Ghamr enclave for another season. Jordan denied the Israeli officials' claim and said the decision to take the land was \\"final and decisive.\\" The Jordanian King Abdullah II said that as of 10 November 2019, Israeli farmers will be banned from entering Al Ghamr enclave. Economy Tzofar trees Winter farming is the main industry of the moshav. The produce is intended mainly for export, while some of it is sold locally. Vegetables grown in the moshav include melons, peppers, and tomatoes. An attempt has been made to farm lobster in artificial ponds. Pens for cattle have been constructed to serve as a holding place for cattle being imported into Israel. The moshav also contains a grove of palm trees jointly owned by all the inhabitants. A secondary source of income is tourism, based on the proximity of Tzofar to the ancient Nabataean spice route and ancient Nabataean city of Moa.

Synopsis The film centres on the Gujarati population. Since India's independence, the Gurjar community had been demanding reservation for itself. However, the government ignored the demands. After fifty years of peaceful protest, the Gurjars made Pradhan Ji their leader and took a more radical approach. The chief minister thought about giving reservation to the Gurjar community, but the other caste leader, Nagina Singh, threatened the chief minister with withdrawal of support from his party, burying the idea. For this reason the angry Gurjars burned train tracks under Ji's leadership, breaking the rail connection between the financial capital Mumbai and Delhi. As the news of this movement began to resonate in India as well as abroad, the state government used the police force to suppress this movement, killing 72. The Gurjar society continued to demand its reservation in a peaceful manner.

It was the Marine Corps' first semi-automated system capable of collecting, processing, computing and displaying aircraft surveillance data while also sharing that information with other participating units via tactical data link. The system was developed in the late 1950s/early 1960s when it was recognized that due to the speed, range and complexity of fighter aircraft operations effective air control and air defense demanded enhanced situational awareness. MTDS was a spiral development of the United States Navy's Navy Tactical Data System (NTDS). At the time it was developed, it was the largest research and development project ever undertaken by the Marine Corps. Produced by Litton Systems Inc. in Van Nuys, California, MTDS took almost a decade to develop. When finally fielded in September 1966, it was the premier air defense command and control system in the United States Military. It saw its widest operational use during the Vietnam War where it was utilized to great effect controlling and deconflicting aircraft in the Northern portion of South Vietnam from July 1967 through January 1971. MTDS remained the backbone of Marine Corps air defense operations until it was replaced by the AN/TYQ-23 Tactical Air Operations Module in the early 1990s. Background =Marine Corps Air Warning Program= The Marine Corps‚Äô air warning program was developed during World War II to provide early warning and fighter control for Marine Corps forces ashore during amphibious operations. Through the 1950s Marine Corps air defense equipment and tactics continued to rely on manual plotting of air tracks based on voice calls from ground control intercept (GCI) controllers. By the mid-1950s, early warning, fighter control, and ground controlled intercept (GCI) were performed by the Marine Air Control Squadrons as part of Marine Aviation. There were three MACS assigned to each Marine Amphibious Force. These squadrons provided air defense command and control centers known as Counter Air Operations Centers (CAOC) that relied on Marines to manually plot aircraft tracks on a large map based on voice or telephone calls from radar operators. Controllers manually calculated intercepts using vectors, headings, and speed. =Precursor systems and early development= In 1944, the British Air Force installed analog computers at Chain Home stations in order to automatically convert radar plots into map locations. After the war, the Royal Navy began to develop a command and control system known as the Comprehensive Display System (CDS) which further allowed operators the ability to assign identifications to objects on their radar screens. This made it easier for operators to vector friendly fighters onto intercept courses during ground controlled intercept. The United States Navy became very interested in the Comprehensive Display System after seeing a demonstration. At the same time that the US Navy was looking to improve the air defense capabilities of the fleet, air defense in the United States also took on a much greater priority after the Soviet Union exploded its first nuclear weapon on 29 August 1949. The United States established a committee chaired by MIT professor George Valley, later to be known as the Valley Committee. The committee determined that the greatest threat to the nation's air defense was low-flying aircraft capable of avoiding widely dispersed GCI radars. To counter this the committee recommended that a large number of ground based radar systems be installed all over the United States to provide complete coverage. This large number of stations required a command and control center that could aggregate radar track data in real time. The amount of data necessary for this meant that it could not be done manually and would require a computer. Thus was born the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment also known as \\"SAGE.\\" SAGE was a system of large computers and associated networking equipment that coordinated data from many radar sites and processed it to produce a single unified image of the airspace over a wide area. In 1953,at the same time that the USAF was developing SAGE, the Naval Research Laboratory showed Marine Corps representatives the findings of its Electronic Tactical Data Systems program to determine the services' interest in any further development. There was no money at the time however the Marine Corps continued to refine requirements for their future automated tactical data system for air defense operations. When the United States Navy eventually wrote the requirements for NTDS they also included specifications for a ground-based unit to be developed by the Marine Corps. The Chief of Naval Operations officially authorized the development of NTDS in April 1956. Concurrently, Headquarters Marine Corps, began to budget the system and further refine requirements. The requirements were developed by the Marine Corps Electronics Branch which was a department underneath the Electronics Development Division within the Navy‚Äôs Bureau of Ships. When funds became available in 1957 a contract was awarded to Litton Systems Incorporated for the development of the Marine Tactical Data System. System =Major Components & Subcomponents= *(AN/TYQ-1) - Tactical Air Command Center (TACC), produced by Philco Ford - Furnished the automatic displays and communications to provide for the overall command and coordination of all air operations in an area of operations. *(AN/TYQ-2) - Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC), produced by Litton Industries - An operational complex of 14 shelters containing computers to track and process radar information and communications equipment for the execution of anti-air warfare. **(AN/TYA-5) - Central Computer Group - shelter that contains the electronic data processing equipment that forms the core of the AN/TYQ-2. **(AN/TYA-6) - Data Processor Group - transportable shelter containing 2D radar and electronic data processing equipment. **(AN/TYA-7) - Geographic Display Generations Group - transportable shelter containing electronic scanning, mapping, and processing equipment. **(AN/TYA-9) - Operator Group - shelter containing electronic data processing, display, and communications equipment. **(AN/TYA-12) - Communications Group - shelter containing electronic digital and communication equipment. **(AN/TYA-23) - Two shelters comprising the primary facilities for the test and repair of circuit plug-in cards and analog modules. **(AN/TYA-25) - Photographic Transport Group - shelter containing commercial photographic equipment and developing facilities. **(AN/TYA-26) - Ancillary Group - shelter containing the consoles and displays of associated radars and radio direction finding equipment. **(AN/TYA) - Maintenance Group - Two shelters for test and repair of the magnetic drum assembly, microppsitioner, power supplies, and communications modules. *(AN/TYQ-3) - Tactical Data Communications Central (TDCC), produced by Litton Industries. \\\\- The system employed a UNIVAC CP-808 computer which was a light-weight version of the CP-642B utilized by NTDS. The TDCC hosted the critical operational software to drive MTDS and exchange air command and control data with NTDS and other joint command and control systems. **(AN/TYA-20) - Shelter housing the CP-808 computer. =Design= MTDS consisted of three major components that worked in concert to automate early warning, fighter direction and the control of surface to air missiles within the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF). Under MTDS, air defense within the Marine Corps was to be combined into a new agency known as the Tactical Air Operations Center (TAOC). The TAOC automated air defense functions which up to that point had to be completed manually. Operators could control more than 20 simultaneous intercepts while the computer tracked up to 250 air targets. Ensuring that the entirety of the system was helicopter transportable was a major factor influencing much of the design of MTDS. Marine Corps forces operating from amphibious shipping needed the ability to sling load MTDS huts underneath helicopters in order to get it ashore during an amphibious operation. This meant that controlling the weight of each section of the system was critical and those weights were defined by the cargo carrying capacity of the Marine Corps helicopter fleet. In its original design, MTDS planned to utilize TADIL-A/Link 11 to communicate between all participating Marine Corps units (TACC, LAAM, etc...) and the Navy's NTDS afloat. Early studies determined this would quickly overwhelm TADIL-A and create increased latency in the system. If track latency was too great then operators would not be able to properly control aircraft. There were also questions about the viability of utilizing high frequency radio waves in mountainous terrain where the Marine Corps may need to operate. To overcome these deficiencies, the Marine Corps investigated an emerging technology known as Tropospheric scatter. This eventually led to the development of the AN/TRC-97 built by RCA. The TRC-97 provided data, voice and teletype connectivity for MTDS and would grow to become the backbone of USMC and USAF long haul communications for years to come. Early in the design phase of MTDS, it was decided to use magnetic drum memory computers. Memory drums were used as the digital storage elements and system clock pulse generators in the Central Computer Group and each of the Radar and Identification Data Processors (RIDP). The drums utilized had a capacity of 1,123,200 bits and operated at a speed of 2667 rpm, and generated a clock frequency of 333 kcs. There were no issues with this design until shortly after preduction had begun in 1964. At that time a senior defense official questioned the efficacy of drum memory computers and requested a review of the program. Production was halted in order to examine whether the system would be better off utilizing Magnetic-core memory computers. After a few month delay, the Marine Corps was able to show that the drum memory system already in place met all reliability requirements set forth for the program. Production of the system was allowed to continue. =Testing= In the early 1960s, Marine Air Control Squadron 3 (MACS-3) at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana, California was administratively detached from the I Marine Amphibious Force and moved under Air, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific for purposes of testing MTDS equipment and operational concepts. MACS-3 Sub-Unit 1 located at Marine Corps Base Twentynine Palms, CA took delivery of the second MTDS system in September 1962. In 1963, the program was in serious trouble and then Commandant of the Marine Corps General David M. Shoup named Colonel Earl E. Anderson as the first program manager for MTDS. In March 1965, MACS-3 accepted the first production model of MTDS for operational testing. System development and testing were completed in October 1965. =Training & Fielding= MACS-3 graduated its first class of MTDS operators and maintainers on 8 October 1963. The initial course was twenty weeks long for maintainers and six weeks long for operators. Classroom instructions was provided by the Marines of MACS-3, field representatives from Litton Industries and civilians from the US Navy's Naval Aviation Engineering Service Unit. MTDS began fielding to the operating forces in July 1966 with the last system fielding in August 1973. MTDS was replaced by the AN/TYQ-23 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM), a joint USAF/USMC program. Development of the AN/TYQ-23 began in the early 1980s and coincided with the development of the USMC's next generation long range radar, the AN/TPS-59. Operational testing lasted from 1985 through 1991. Testing was not complete before the beginning of Gulf War in 1990 therefore Marine Air Control Squadron 2 utilized MTDS when combat operations commenced in January 1991. Fielding of the AN/TYQ-23 began shortly after the end of the Gulf War and MTDS was concurrently removed from the Marine Corps inventory. Operational Use The first MTDS system fielded to the Fleet Marine Force was given to Marine Air Control Squadron 4 at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California in September 1966. Shortly thereafter the squadron was informed that they were deploying to South Vietnam to replace Marine Air Control Squadron 7 (MACS-7). In November 1966 they sent an advanced party to scout the best locations for MTDS in country. They eventually decided upon the Monkey Mountain Facility near Danang. This site was chosen because of it was co-located with the HAWK Missile Batteries of the 1st Light Antiaircraft Missile Battalion and the United States Air Force's Panama Air Control Faility. The site also provided excellent line of sight to United States Seventh Fleet ships operating in Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin. MACS-4 arrived in Vietnam in June 1967 and was established and operating on top of Monkey Mountain beginning 6 July 1967. On 13 January 1971 at 0001, MACS-4 made its last tactical transmission in support of operations during the Vietnam War. During its time in Vietnam utilizing MTDS, MACS-4 controlled or assisted 472,146 aircraft. Even though MACS-4 departed Vietnam on 31 January 1971 it maintained a small detachment of twenty Marines on top of Monkey Mountain to man the AN/TYQ-3 - Tactical Data Communications Central (TDCC). The AN/TYQ-3 facilitated critical data exchange between the USAF and USN during the later stages of the Vietnam War. This detachment remained in support of operations until 14 February 1973. In 1969, the Marine Corps fielded the AN/TPS-32 radar which was the service's first three dimensional radar and was optimized for operations with MTDS. Legacy The development of MTDS coincided with the fielding of the MIM-23 HAWK Missile system, and the AN/TPQ-10 Radar Course Directing Central. The arrival of these highly technical systems, and the concurrent need for specialists to operate them, was a catalyst for the professionalization of aviation command and control in the Marine Corps. Recognizing the need for a separate headquarters to oversee these specialized units and the agencies and equipment they provide, the Marine Corps recommissioned the Marine Air Control Groups in September 1967. This laid the foundation for what is now known as the Marine Air Command and Control System (MACCS). Testing and fielding of MTDS along with various other automated systems in the 1960s highlighted that the Marine Corps was not properly staffed to develop, test and acquire new digital equipment. Lessons learned from MTDS's testing and development and the recognized need to support current and future tactical data systems led to the development of the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) based at MCB Camp Pendleton, CA. MCTSSA was organized in 1970 and its structure came from MACS-3 which was concurrently decommissioned.

The inverse consistency error, introduced by Christiansen and Johnson in 2001, quantifies the distance between the composition of the mappings from each image to the other, produced by the registration procedure, and the identity function, and is used as a regularisation constraint in the loss function of many registration algorithms to enforce consistent mappings.Christiansen and Johnson (2001)Bhatia et al. (2004)Johnson and Christensen (2002)Arganda- Carreras et al. (2006) Inverse consistency is necessary for good image registration but it is not sufficient, since a mapping can be perfectly consistent but not register the images at all.Rohlfing (2012)  Definition  Image registration is the process of establishing a common coordinate system between two images, and given two images : \\\\begin{align} I_1: \\\\Omega_1 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}  I_2: \\\\Omega_2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\end{align} registering a source image I_1 to a target image I_2 consists of determining a transformation f_1: \\\\Omega_2 \\\\to \\\\Omega_1 that maps points from the target space to the source space.The transformation goes in this direction in order to allow resampling the source image in target space. An ideal registration algorithm should not be sensitive to which image in the pair is used as source or target, and the registration operator should be antisymmetric such that the mappings : \\\\begin{align} f_1: \\\\Omega_2 \\\\to \\\\Omega_1  f_2: \\\\Omega_1 \\\\to \\\\Omega_2 \\\\end{align} produced when registering I_1 to I_2 and I_2 to I_1 respectively should be the inverse of each other, i.e. f_2 = f_1^{-1} and f_1 = f_2^{-1} or, equivalently, f_2 \\\\circ f_1 = \\\\operatorname{id}_{\\\\Omega_2} and f_1 \\\\circ f_2 = \\\\operatorname{id}_{\\\\Omega_1}, where \\\\circ denotes the function composition operator.Bender and Tom√© (2009)Leow et al. (2005) Real algorithms are not perfect, and when swapping the role of source and target image in a registration problem the so obtained transformations are not the inverse of each other.

Inverse consistency can be used as a quality metric to evaluate image registration results. The inverse consistency error (ICE) measures the distance between the composition of the two transforms and the identity function, and it can be formulated in terms of both average (ICE_a) or maximum (ICE_m) over a region of interest \\\\Omega of the image:Beg and Khan (2007) : \\\\begin{align} ICE_a &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\mathrm{d}x} \\\\int_{\\\\Omega} \\\\left\\\\Vert f_2(f_1(x)) - x \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\mathrm{d}x  ICE_m &= \\\\max_{x \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\left\\\\Vert f_2(f_1(x)) - x \\\\right\\\\Vert . \\\\end{align} While inverse consistency is a necessary property of good registration algorithms, inverse consistency error alone is not a sufficient metric to evaluate the quality of image registration results, since a perfectly consistent mapping, with no other constraint, may be not even close to correctly register a pair of images.

Hersch Joseph John Hersch (December 19, 1903 - October 17, 1968) was a Democratic politician from Philadelphia who served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and as a city magistrate before being elected to the Philadelphia City Council. Early life and family Joseph J. Hersch was born in Philadelphia in 1903, the son of Charles H. Hersch and Mary Fitzpatrick Hersch. His parents were involved in city politics, both serving as the Democratic ward leader for the city's 37th ward. Hersch attended parochial schools through eighth grade and then became a union upholster. His father served as city coroner, then an elected position, from 1933 to 1941. In 1938, Hersch married the former Mary Nolan, who worked as a telephone operator. They were listed as husband and wife in the 1940 census, but after that Mary is never mentioned in connection with Hersch again, even in his obituary, and they appear to have had no children. In 1939, Hersch was involved in a strange incident in the Philadelphia Sheriff's office: when Republican Sheriff William J. Hamilton, Jr. was confirmed as state Secretary of Revenue, deputy coroner Vincent Moranz claimed the office for himself and appointed Hersch as his deputy. According to a story in The Philadelphia Inquirer the next day, \\"none of the participants in the man-made mixup took the affair very seriously, except Hamilton\\" who called it \\"calculated trickery.\\" State legislator and city magistrate In 1940, Hersch was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives along with fellow Democrat James R. Rooney to represent the 20th district (state house districts were multi-member at the time). He went on to serve five nonconsecutive terms thereafter, being re-elected in 1942, 1944, 1948, 1950, and 1952. After the 1952 election, Hersch was the unanimous choice of the House Democratic caucus for the position of minority whip. By that time, Philadelphia had approved a new city charter and Hersch worked with a bipartisan coalition in Harrisburg to reverse some of the reform-minded changes it made. The effort was unsuccessful, but ward leaders rewarded Hersch by nominating him to an open seat for magistrate in Philadelphia in 1953. (City magistrates presided over a local court, the duties of which are now performed by the Philadelphia Municipal Court.) He was elected, and resigned his House seat that year to take up his new post. Two years later, in 1955, Hersch was appointed chief of the magistrates. In 1958, he earned the praise of Mayor Richardson Dilworth for his efforts to clean up the corruption surrounding traffic tickets in the city, which Dilworth believed contributed to the decline in unsafe driving. In 1961, Hersch asked City Council for an increase in funding of the magistrate courts, which he said were overworked because so many more traffic tickets were being written. In a interview later that year, Hersch explained that his lack of formal education beyond eighth grade was no hindrance to his performance of the job of magistrate. \\"A law degree doesn't make a magistrate more qualified. Living with people is more essential than going to a law library to find out what it's all about. ... If you take Purdon's law books away from [the lawyers], they're out of business.\\" Not everyone shared Dilworth's high opinion of Hersch. In 1962, the Committee of Seventy, a non-partisan watchdog group, called for Hersch's removal from the job, citing an excessive discharge rate that let too many defendants avoid fines for traffic infractions. Hersch's fellow magistrates in both parties rallied to his defense, and he kept his job for the time being. The next year, though, a change of party power in Harrisburg meant that the new Republican governor, William W. Scranton, would have the power to replace him. Instead, Hersch resigned to run for an open seat on the Philadelphia City Council. City councilman Hersch ran unopposed for city council in the 1963 primary and was elected easily at the general election that November. The seat had previously been held by James Hugh Joseph Tate, who was elected mayor that year. In 1966, Hersch also succeeded Tate as vice-chairman of the City Democratic Committee after Tate declined to run for the party post. By 1967, Hersch and Tate had become serious rivals in inter-party fights. Hersch was nevertheless reelected in 1967, as was the mayor. The following year, Hersch died suddenly at the age of 64 at Lankenau Hospital. His first marriage appears to have ended soon after it began, but after his death a second woman, Nell Yesalonis, claimed to have married Hersch in January 1956. Yesalonis claimed she and Hersch kept the marriage a secret because Hersch's mother (who died in 1966) disapproved and \\"was very jealous.\\" Yesalonis claimed a pension as Hersch's widow, and was awarded one by the city Board of Pensions and Retirement in May 1969. Hersch was buried in Northwood Cemetery after a funeral Mass at St. Veronica Catholic Church in North Philadelphia.

It was the second historic building to be erected at the museum. The mill was built in around 1760, close to a farm of the same name near the small town of Llanwrtyd in Powys. After being enlarged during the 19th century, when the spinning jack, made by John Davies of Llanbrynmair in about 1830 and thought to be the only one of its age and kind still in use, was installed, along with carding engines purchased from a mill in Yorkshire.. The mill eventually closed down in 1947 and was relocated and rebuilt at St Fagans in 1952. All the processes from dyeing of fleece to finishing of fabric, can be carried out within the building, which still produces woollen shawls and blankets for sale. The two handlooms, dating from the mid-18th century, were converted to be used with a flying shuttle. The water wheel is located on the ground floor and is fed by water pumped from a pool below, originally built in 1904 as a swimming pool for the Earl of Plymouth, who owned St Fagans at the time.

A crime is described as an act against the Albanian Penal Code for which there are judicial consequences such as punishments or fines. The Penal Code is based on the Constitution of the Republic of Albania with general principles of international criminal law ratified by the Albanian state. Crimes in Albania can only be committed within the territory of the Republic of Albania, land space, maritime waters and air space under the sovereignty of the Albanian state. Albanian law is also applicable to foreign citizens committing crimes against or within in the Albanian state. Crimes committed against humanity, which violates the independent and constitutional order is punishable. It is not possible to be punished for a crime through a violation of a law which is not written in the Albanian legal code. Internationally protected civilians are included in the Albanian protective system and can be extradited according to international agreements.  Causal factors and attributes  There are many socio-cultural and socio-political factors connected to the criminal culture and statistics in Albania and amongst Albanians which is based on religious and cultural factors, such family relations and the former Communist system. Studies on the complexity of Albanian honor violence is an area which requires a careful approach as family members involved will often hold onto cultural values passionately, and no single factor can be explanatory. Historical factors, tribalism, warfare and low socio-economical factors, combined with a history of blood feuds, also contribute to holistically to crimes statistics. This results in isolation amongst families trapped in blood feuds and a decrease in the belief of the modern justice system. Studies on the Albanian blood feuds phenomena show that poor living conditions, mountainous habitats and low education contribute to isolation. Poverty in low income regions has also led to prostitution and organized crime, with children mostly being the victims. In general, crimes related to honor and masculinity tend to be stronger in Mediterranean countries, like Albania, than in northern Europe. Albanian families tend to feel obliged to take personal matters into their own hands as the trust for the judicial system is rather low.  Origin  The first traces of criminality being handled within in a system of codes, in the present day area of Albania, was in the 15th-century where the Kanun law was practiced amongst Albanian mountaineers. Although primitive, the system worked well, was often fast, cheap and left few crimes unsolved, in comparison with other European counterparts. Customary law was considered to be more authoritarian than written laws amongst Albanians.  Crime during the Ottoman and Medieval period  As the Pashaliks of Scutari, Yanina, Berat, and Monastir all strived for decentralized systems of power in the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, lawlessness erupted as a central authority was absent. This meant that the Albanian pashaliks was responsible for his region and could personally alter the penal code for the citizens. Though most Albanian local lords were still under the jurisdiction of the Sultan. For a period, the Albanian beys negotiated in their favor towards the Sublime Porte which resulted in an extended landownership which concentrated the power in the hands of a few powerful families. This resulted in the Albanian provinces being imposed a status of extensive lawlessness with the local beys fighting each other. The Porte responded with \\"Divide et impera\\" hoping to avoid the loss of control. In 1847, during the southern Albanian revolts, the local beys resisted the Porte's taxation system (tanzimat) which risked the feudal relations of merchants and craftsmen. The Albanian highlanders refused to accept the conscriptions of the Nizam law of 1843.  Crime in the 19th century  Albanian law was first officially applicable to Albanian citizens in 1912 after the Albanian declaration of independence. The government approved the decision of \\"the new organization of justice\\" on may 10, 1913. With the decision of the Conference of Ambassadors in London, and with Prince Wilhelm zu Weid becoming the prince of Albania on April 10, 1914, the \\"Organic Statute of Albania\\" was proclaimed in Vlore. There was a council of the elderly, judges of peace, first instance courts and courts of appeal. Albanian criminal justice system was the same as of other European socialist countries in 1946 with the model of the People's Republic of Albania in 1946 being taken from the USSR. In 129, the Penal Code of the former Kingdom of Albania was in force. Between 1945 and 1952, the penal law was separated with different enactments and criminal procedures. A new code was adopted in 1952. With the constitutional reform of 1977, the Penal code was reformed and has been practiced since then. An entirely new code was brought to practice at the end of 1990. The code of criminal procedure was first adopted in 1953 and in 1968, a system of advocates was established. In 1991, the Constitution was changed by the new pluralist parliament after the election of March 31, 1991. The gap between the authorities and the population increased after the fall of communism which increased religious practices and nationalism. In the 1990s, religious aids were sent to Albania as an antidote to the crime waves. When the isolation ended, many Albanians settled abroad, and after having gathered information from other groups, an independent Albanian network of organized crime emerged.  Today  Much of the crimes committed today are tied to the Albanian mafia both in Albania, but also in other European countries. The cocaine market in the UK is owned by the Albanian mafia. There are also problems with Albanian media portraying murders as \\"blood feuds\\" and many who are arrested suspected of murder use the phrase \\"I did it for blood feud\\" thus complicating forensic investigations. There also signs of \\"blood feud certificates\\" where civilians purchase certificates by corrupt officials in order to apply for asylum in European countries with complicated stories of blood feuds. Albanian authorities are however quick to file reports and initiate prosecutions, with serious penalty, thus lowering the rate of. However, a change of culture is needed in order to eradicate the phenomena, requiring roughly 25 years. There is also a cultural phenomena of how organized crime is portrayed in modern day media, with Albanians being portrayed as mainly antagonists. Organized crimes is defined by UN as \\"a structured group of three or more persons, existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit‚Äú. Albanian organized crime has become a transnational phenomena with ties in Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and the Italian and Colombian mafia as well. Much of the organized crimes is based on families with consanguinity belonging to the same clan and village. The networks are made of \\"people of the village\\" which discourages dropouts. Organized crime in Albania has also expanded on the European heroin market which has led media corporates displaying Albanian criminal's main objectives as drug trafficking, human trafficking, car trafficking and money laundering. Albanian authorities has been criticized by the international community because it does not hinder criminal activities. In 2013, The U.S. Department of state pointed out in a report the necessity of the implementation of laws and convictions of suspects. The Albanian authorities have decreased anti-trafficking law enforcements as a result of a lack of evidence. Family ties and nepotism and favouritism is seen as a possible factor in the corruption amongst Albanian officials in the court system resulting in difficulties in investigations which has put Albania in the 116th place of 175 countries in accordance to the Corruption Perception Index. Money laundering helps syndicates diversify their revenues, which is a result of the fall of communism, which allowed for organized crime to penetrate into politics. In May, 2019, the Albanian government was criticized for having links to the organized crime.

The episode introduces the character of Lady Trieu, played by Hong Chau, a wealthy industrialist that had bought out Adrian Veidt's enterprises on his death. Synopsis The Clarks are visited late at night by Lady Trieu, who anxiously wants to buy their house and farmland. She offers the infertile couple a baby created from their DNA and five million dollars. The Clarks agree, moments before an object from space rattles their house and lands nearby. Trieu claims it as her own. Angela gets a call from the heritage center notifying that more information about Will has been discovered. Discreetly breaking into the closed facility, she learns of Will's connection to the Tulsa Race Riots, but that he disappeared shortly after that. She hears a crash outside, and finds Laurie laughing next to Angela's smashed car. Angela affirms the car is hers, and secretly pockets an unlabeled pill bottle she saw Will had. Later, Angela gives the pill bottle and the KKK outfit from Judd's closet to Wade for safe keeping, and asks Wade to have his ex-wife analyze the pills. Later, Angela is unable to catch an unknown vigilante, dubbed \\"Lube Man\\", after he witnesses her disposing of Will's wheelchair. At the station, Laurie informs Angela they found unknown fingerprints on her car, and have a lead on new drone technology developed by Lady Trieu's company that may have been used to abduct her car. At Trieu's Millennium Clock facility, Trieu willingly offers the list of staff with access to the lightweight drones, while in Vietnamese, tells Angela that Will wondered if she found the pills yet. After they leave, Trieu speaks to Will who has listened from a nearby room. Trieu questions why Will does not directly tell Angela what is going on, but Will believes it is better for her to figure it out herself with events coming to a head in three days. That night, Trieu is happy to hear that her daughter Bian is having dreams of an attack on a Vietnamese village despite not being there. Elsewhere, Adrian Veidt selects non-deformed human fetuses from a lake, and then once ashore, uses a device to accelerate their aging to a new pair of Phillips and Crookshanks. As he brings them to his manor, he explains that they will gain full intelligence soon enough to help. He has them clear a room full of the murdered corpses of other clones, which he uses to launch by catapult to test the limits of his prison. Production Lady Trieu is played by Hong Chau, whose Vietnamese heritage helped in her casting. \\"If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own\\" introduced Lady Trieu, played by Hong Chau, an American actress of Vietnamese descent. Chau had not been familiar with the source material but had accepted Damon Lindelof's invitation to hear about the part he proposed for her in the show. According to Chau, Lindelof spent about an hour and a half establishing the story of the limited comic series before going into the character of Trieu, how she was tied to the limited series, and his plans for her character within the show, all which intrigued Chau. He also expressed the importance of her Vietnamese heritage to Chau's story as well as ties to the original limited series. To prepare for the part, Chau reviewed the behaviors of real-life billionaires like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson, as well as Japanese scientists that were on the leading edge of cloning and genetics research. The episode's title is taken from a passage in Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, the book Cal was reading when Angela tries to pick a fight. The episode includes the only appearance of Lube Man within the series, in the scene where Angela attempts to chase him down after he witnesses her disposing of Will's wheelchair. Lube Man escapes by covering himself with some oil and then sliding feet-first into a drain opening. This was a wholly practical effect. While the drain was specifically constructed to help with the scene, Regina King, who played Angela, was amazed with the stuntman's ability. The mystery behind Lube Man became popular with fans of the show after the episode. Lindelof had written the scene to be \\"in the midst of other insane things happening\\" during the episode and did not expect the character or his identity to take off in popularity with fans of the show. While Lube Man did not appear again, the accompanying \\"Peteypedia\\" material for the show, purportedly collected by FBI Agent Dale Petey, heavily implies that Petey himself is Lube Man. Lindelof remained coy about confirming this, but directed readers to Peteypedia \\"to reach the obvious conclusion\\" to his identity. Reception =Critical= At Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 93% approval rating with an average rating of 8.3 out of 10 based on 27 reviews. The site's summary of the critics states, \\"Guided by the bombastic introduction of the eccentric trillionaire Lady Trieu, 'If You Don't Like My Story, Write Your Own' makes for a truly bizarre, highly captivating experience.\\" =Ratings= In its original broadcast in the United States on HBO, the episode had an estimated 707,000 viewers.

With their legal personhood, permanent capital, transferable shares, separation of ownership and management, and limited liability, the Dutch and English colonial trading companies VOC and EIC are considered institutional breakthroughs. We analyze the VOC's business operations and financial policy and show that its novel corporate form owed less to foresight than to piecemeal engineering to remedy design flaws. The crucial feature of managerial limited liability was not, as previously thought, integral to that design, but emerged only after protracted experiments with various solutions to the company's financial bottlenecks. Legal form followed economic function, not the other way around. Despite the presence of a central Asian headquarters in Batavia (modern Jakarta), even the numerous settlements of the Dutch East India Company or VOC (1602-1799) had separate administrations and record keeping. Second, unlike the Atlantic slave complex, European and preexisting indigenous forms of bondage seemingly shared many forms of similarities. Except for South Africa, European colonial powers took over and interacted with existing Indian Ocean systems of slavery, rather than imposing their own system in a relative vacuum as in the New World.
