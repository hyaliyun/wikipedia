St David's. Pantheon. The Mtatsminda Pantheon of Writers and Public Figures (, mtats'mindis mts'eralta da sazogado moghvats'eta p'anteoni) is a necropolis in Tbilisi, Georgia, where some of the most prominent writers, artists, scholars, and national heroes of Georgia are buried. It is located in the churchyard around St David’s Church \\"Mamadaviti\\" on the slope of Mount Mtatsminda (Geo. მთაწმინდა, meaning the Holy Mountain) and was officially established in 1929. Atop the mountain is Mtatsminda Park, an amusement park owned by the municipality of Tbilisi. The first celebrities to be buried at this place were the Russian writer Alexander Griboyedov (1795–1829) and his Georgian wife Nino Chavchavadze (1812–1857). The Pantheon was officially opened in 1929 to celebrate the centenary of Griboyedov’s death in Iran. Since then, several illustrious Georgians have been buried or reburied there.

Michael Greenberger, JD, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law, is the CHHS founder and director. History Shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, University of Maryland, Baltimore, President David J. Ramsay called on Professor Greenberger to create a center that could bolster the university's extensive work in scientific research, policy development, and legal analysis related to homeland security. On May 15, 2002, CHHS officially opened its doors. The scope of work grew soon after, and by summer 2003 the Maryland Emergency Management Agency asked CHHS to develop a manual to guide Maryland state agencies through the COOP plan writing process. Next, Howard County, MD, the Baltimore City Health Department, and the University of Maryland Medical Center tapped CHHS for its expertise in emergency planning. In October 2005, CHHS was awarded a $1.484 million grant to run nationwide DHS COOP training program, and CHHS teams have since delivered the course to first responders in locations as far away as California, Alaska, and Guam. In fall 2007, CHHS organized and hosted the first national conference on emergency preparedness for vulnerable populations. Professor Greenberger was appointed to the Maryland Governor's Emergency Management Advisory Council in 2008, the same year CHHS tested COOP plans drafted for the Maryland Judiciary. Today, the list of CHHS clients includes dozens of institutions and agencies from jurisdictions across the country.

It allows applications to make standard C++, C#, Java, or Python objects persistent without having to convert the data objects into the rows and columns used by a relational database management system (RDBMS). Objectivity/DB supports the most popular object oriented languages plus SQL/ODBC and XML. It runs on Linux, Macintosh, UNIX and Windows platforms. All of the languages and platforms interoperate, with the Objectivity/DB kernel taking care of compiler and hardware platform differences.  History  Objectivity/DB was first sold in 1990. The C++ and Java interfaces for Objectivity/DB incorporate the features defined in the ODMG'93 standard. The C# and Python interfaces were added subsequently.  Architectural features  Objectivity/DB is a distributed database that provides a single logical view across a federation of databases distributed across the network. It uses a distributed computing model that links a small software library with the client application. The client transparently communicates with remote servers that are functionally simpler than their equivalents in centralized database server architectures. There are lock, remote data transfer and query agent server processes. The distributed architecture helps make Objectivity/DB inherently scalable and reliable. It has sustained ingest rates in excess of one terabyte per hour while simultaneously supporting data fusion and query operations. Objectivity/DB uses a distributed storage hierarchy. Objects are stored in logical clusters called containers. The containers are stored in databases that are cataloged in a federated database. Every object has a unique 64-bit Object Identifier (OID) that is a composite logical structure. The physical address space limitation for a single federation is in the millions of Terabytes range. The largest publicized Objectivity/DB installation, at SLAC's BaBar experiment, stored over a Petabyte of objects.Lessons Learned from Managing a Petabyte Jacek Becla and Daniel L. Wang, 2005 BaBar Database Objectivity/DB provides a flexible approach for defining how objects are placed within a given storage hierarchy. Database designers can define a custom placement strategy that is encapsulated in an XML configuration file and made available to the application. This strategy can define which persistent objects are stored together, which are distributed, and which are stored near designated objects. Objects can be linked to other objects using named uni-directional or bi-directional links. The links can have a cardinality of 1:1, 1:many, many:1 or many:many and use the OIDs to speed up the navigation of networks of objects. The OIDs are also used in support of scalable collections (tree, list, set etc.), indices and hash tables. Eliminating the relational Join operations inherent in a relational database gives Objectivity/DB a performance advantage. Objectivity/DB is also different from RDBMSs in the way in which it handles queries. The application declares and initializes an iterator that locates and returns qualified objects as soon as they are located. The Objectivity/DB Parallel Query Engine splits queries into subtasks directed at individual databases or containers. Remote query agents service each subtask and return results to the iterator. The Parallel Query Engine has two replaceable components: a splitter that can determine how to best subdivide the task and a filter in the query agent that can further refine a query. A query involving cities in Europe might be split into forty nine subtasks, one for each country. The filter might access an external data source before qualifying or disqualifying the objects that the Query Agent has found in the Objectivity/DB database or container. Databases and system data (catalogs and schema) can be replicated to multiple locations using a quorum based synchronous replication mechanism. Replicas that are temporarily separated from the quorum are transparently resynchronized when they are reconnected to the network that services them and their peers. Individual databases and lock servers can be allocated votes that are used to determine whether or not a client can update a replica. The distributed database and processing architecture of Objectivity/DB has allowed it to be used in many grid computing environments. It has attained certification as an IBM Ready For Grid product. It is also used in Service Oriented Architecture applications. Objectivity For Java has support for the J2EE Connector Architecture (JCA) standard. The distributed architecture of Objectivity/DB is equally applicable to cloud environments.  Typical applications  Objectivity/DB is generally used in data intensive or real-time applications that manipulate highly complex, inter-related data. It may be embedded in a software or hardware product or used as a part of commercial, scientific or government project. Early deployments were primarily in Computer-Aided Design and engineering applications. In the early 1990s a number of telecom equipment manufacturers started embedding Objectivity/DB in advanced intelligent network and element management systems. Notable deployments have included the wireless SprintPCS and the Iridium low Earth orbit satellite networks. A number of process control, manufacturing and medical instrumentation systems incorporate Objectivity/DB because of its real-time performance and high availability. Defense contractors and large science projects started using Objectivity/DB in the late 1990s. The government applications cover command and control, security, data fusion and intelligence applications. Objectivity/DB has been used in astrophysics, high energy physics, fusion, earth sciences, hydrography and bioinformatics applications. Most of these applications build and manipulate extremely large (multi-Petabyte) databases. The choice of an RDBMS or an ODBMS depends on many factors. An ODBMS can be ideal in a compute or data intensive object oriented system. However, if an RDBMS can comfortably meet the functional and performance requirements of an application with the available programming resources then there is probably no need to consider an ODBMS.

It is the first historical work of Kerala to be authored by a keralite. The book describes the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonize the Malabar coast. Along with chronological events of the era, the book also provides an analysis of the events, as well as the lifestyle, customs and family structure of the people of the time.The 16th Century Mappila Muslims’ Jihad against the Portuguese: Impact of Tuhfat al-Mujahidin fi ba‘d Akhbar al- Burtughaliyin, Jose Abraham, Concordia University, 40th Annual Conference on South Asia, 2011 Center for South Asia University of Wisconsin-Madison http://southasiaconference.wisc.edu/archive/2011/2011-Program.pdf Summary Shaikh Zainuddin Makhdum, born in 1517 AD, was a historian, and a religious scholar from Ponnani. Completed in 1583, his work Tuhfat is one of the few Asian sources that narrate the reaction of the Muslim populations of the Malabar coast to the Portuguese colonial expansion into the south west of India. It is also important as a pioneering work about the origins of the Mappila community in modern-day Kerala and has been reviewed as \\"a study in liberation theology of Islam\\". The work was translated into many European languages, notable among which are \\"História dos Portugueses no Malabar\\", by David Lopes in 1898 and the English translation by S. Muhammad Husayn Nainar, titled \\"Tuhfat al-Mujāhidīn: A Historical Epic of the Sixteenth Century\\" published in 1942 by the University of Madras. Another translation into Malayalam was written by C. Hamza, in 1995. This is called by many as a source book of struggle against European colonial history. It also is the oldest historical book on Kerala. It details the history of Kerala, on the arrival of Islam in Kerala through Malik ibn Dinar and the accompanying merchant caravan and the establishment of local Muslim communities headed by the jurists (qaadi) in various settlements from Tuticorin in the south to Bhatkal in the north. It also expounds the extent of good relations between the Zamorins of Calicut and between the Muslims. It traces the socio-cultural decay of the Muslim community and the consequential Portuguese piracy and occupation in Malabar. It prays for the prosperity of the Zamorins and exhorts for the struggle (jihad) of Muslims under the banner of the Zamorins of Calicut, against the Portuguese.http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi- bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=1571159&programId;=7940924&channelId;=-1073881580&BV;_ID=@@@&tabId;=9 Contents Completed in 1583, the book was dedicated to the Sultan of Bijapur Ali Adil Shah. The work is divided into four parts — the first discusses in detail about the Islamic concepts of Jihad, followed by a look into history of the Muslim community in the Malabar. It then describes the customs of the Hindu population of the Malabar at the time, and the final fourteen chapters narrate the history of the Portuguese in Malabar and the rise of the naval forces led by the Kunjali Marakkars, from the arrival of the former towards the end of the fifteenth century till the Battle of Chaliyam of 1571.E-JOURNAL OF PORTUGUESE HISTORY,Brown University, Vol.9, number 1, Summer 2011 http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Portuguese_Brazilian_Studies/ejph/html/issue17/html/v9n1a06.html Reception P. Govinda Pillai, a leading Marxian critic and journalist in Kerala, has called it \\"an important event not only in the historical studies of Kerala but in the history of Kerala historiography. This is the first work based on the history of Kerala authored by a Keralite, albeit in Arabic. Moreover, like Thucydides’ Peleponnesian War, Tuhfath is credited with extraordinary historicity, since the author narrates events in which he took part in many ways and which he witnessed\\".AG Noorani Translations * Shaykh Zainuddin Makhdum, Tuhfat al-Mujāhidīn: A Historical Epic of the Sixteenth Century.

Central characters *Albert Campion describes himself (in Police at the Funeral) as a professional adventurer. He is a member of an aristocratic family but has chosen to follow his unconventional career under a pseudonym. He is the main character in the series. *Magersfontein Lugg is Campion's manservant. He retired from a previous career as a burglar when he \\"lost his figure\\". He is involved in most of Campion's adventures. Police Officers *Stanislaus Oates of Scotland Yard first appears in Look to the Lady. At that time he is an Inspector but he is promoted as the series goes on, becoming Chief of Scotland Yard by More Work for the Undertaker. Campion is godfather to his son. *Charles Luke (normally called Charlie) is introduced in More Work for the Undertaker as a Divisional Detective Inspector. He comes from the East End of London, and speaks in a Cockney accent; he is also notable for using his hands and face to describe whatever he is talking about. In The Beckoning Lady he falls in love with Prunella Scroop-Dory, the last of an old aristocratic family, to the dismay of Campion who considers that she was brought up to live in a world that no longer exists. She dies in childbirth before the start of The China Governess, after which Luke's mother takes care of him and his baby daughter. Campion's family *Amanda Fitton first appears as a seventeen-year-old in Sweet Danger. The story of that book revolves around her brother Hal's attempts to regain his title, Earl of Pontisbright. Her parents are dead and she lives at the crumbling house of Pontisbright Mill with her brother Hal and sister Mary, and her American aunt Harriet Huntingforest (\\"Aunt Hatt\\"). They are very poor and make a living in a number of ways; Amanda is particularly skilled with machinery, supplying electricity generated from a converted watermill to her neighbours in the village and driving an electric car. The book ends with a scene in which she asks Campion to take her into partnership, and implies that she may be ready to marry him \\"in about six years\\". Amanda reappears in The Fashion in Shrouds, now working as an aircraft engineer; she enters into a fake engagement to Campion to help in their investigation. At the end of the book, they genuinely become engaged, but three years later in Traitor's Purse the marriage has not yet taken place, and Amanda falls in love with another man. Campion, who is suffering from amnesia, recognises his real feelings for her for the first time, just as she asks him to break off their engagement. Her new love affair ends badly as the other man rejects her as soon as she becomes available, and at the end of the book she and Campion decide they will marry straight away. She appears at the end of the next book, Coroner's Pidgin, revealing that they have a son, Rupert, and in a letter at the end of More Work for the Undertaker, fingering the villain. She has important roles in The Tiger in the Smoke, The Beckoning Lady, and The Mind Readers. Her final appearance is in Mr. Campion's Falcon when Amanda telephones Albert in the Chapter entitled Telephone Exchange. *Rupert is the son of Campion and Amanda. He appears as a small child at the end of Coroner's Pidgin, and plays a significant part in The Beckoning Lady. He is mentioned several times in the later novels, during which time he goes to study at Harvard. He later appears in Mr Campion's Farthing, written after Allingham's death by her husband Philip Youngman Carter, at which time he is studying to become an actor. *Val Ferris is Campion's sister. She is never mentioned before her first appearance in The Fashion in Shrouds. Like Campion, she has been disinherited by their family. In her case this is due to her marriage to an unsuitable man, Sidney Ferris, who turned out to be a drunk and died in a car crash. After that, she developed a successful career as a fashion designer. She marries aircraft manufacturer Alan Dell after The Fashion in Shrouds. *Hal Fitton is Amanda's younger brother. The plot of Sweet Danger concerns his claim to the title \\"Earl of Pontisbright\\" and to the throne of a fictional Balkan country, Averna, which is small but potentially very wealthy. He comes into his inheritance at the end of the book. He next appears again in The Fashion in Shrouds, by which time he is an undergraduate at Oxford. He has at least one daughter, Sophia, whose son is Edward Longfox, one of the two schoolboys who are at the centre of The Mind Readers. *Canon Avril is Campion's uncle on his mother's side. He is an elderly, unworldly clergyman. He appears first as one of the main characters in The Tiger in the Smoke and again in The Mind Readers. His character was partly based on Allingham's father, Herbert Allingham.Martin, Richard.(1988) Ink in her Blood (The Life and Crime Fiction of Margery Allingham), Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press. p185 *The Bishop of Devizes appears in two different parts of the series, apparently referring to two different characters. \\"Thoughts on Mr Campion and his family\\" by Roger Johnson The first Bishop of Devizes dies before Look to the Lady, and leaves Campion a small inheritance; he is also mentioned in Police at the Funeral. The second appears, alive, in Coroner's Pidgin, as a wine expert. Friends and acquaintances *William Faraday (\\"Uncle William\\") first appears in Police at the Funeral, when he is in his sixties and living at the house of his domineering, Victorian mother, Caroline Faraday. He appears again in Dancers in Mourning, by which time his mother has died and he has become a bestselling author and librettist. His death occurs before the start of The Beckoning Lady. *Renee Roper first appears as a theatrical landlady in Dancers in Mourning. Then in More Work for the Undertaker she has become the landlady of the eccentric Palinode family; she asks Campion to investigate the mysterious deaths of two members of the family. *Guffy Randall first appears as part of the foxhunt which comes to Campion's rescue in The Crime at Black Dudley. He appears again in Sweet Danger where he helps Campion in his investigation. He marries Mary Fitton, Amanda's older sister. Their daughter Mary appears in The Beckoning Lady. Their grandson Sam Ferris is one of the two schoolboys who appear in The Mind Readers. *Thos. T. Knapp first appears in Mystery Mile as a spiv with a talent for tapping phones, a permanent sniff, an awful old mother and considerable physical courage. He pops up throughout the series, with an offstage role in Coroner's Pidgin, and features in The Mind Readers, employed by a forgotten wartime comms establishment on a bleak estuary island. *L. C.

Biography  Born in Los Angeles, California, Saidy began his writing career in 1943 with the screenplay for the Red Skelton comedy I Dood It. The following year, he scripted both the Lucille Ball-Dick Powell feature film Meet the People and the book for the Harold Arlen-E. Y. Harburg musical Bloomer Girl. It was the first of several collaborations with Harburg, which included Finian's Rainbow (1947), Flahooley (1951), Jamaica (1957), and The Happiest Girl in the World (1961). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical for Jamaica. Finian's Rainbow has had three major revivals (1955, 1960 and 1967), and was also made into a film starring Fred Astaire and Petula Clark, directed by Francis Ford Coppola, in 1968. Saidy's last project was the screenplay for the film, for which he was nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. In 2004 the Irish Repertory Theatre staged a well-received Off-Broadway production. New York's City Center Encores! series performed a critically acclaimed concert version of the piece in March 2009. Directed and choreographed by Warren Carlyle, it starred Tony Award-winner Jim Norton and Kate Baldwin as Finian and Sharon, with Cheyenne Jackson as Woody and Jeremy Bobb as Og, the leprechaun.

A mother carrying Medea will express the toxin in her germline, killing her progeny. If the children also carry Medea, they produce copies of the antidote, saving their lives. Therefore, if a mother has one Medea allele and one non-Medea allele, half of her children will inherit Medea and survive while the other half will inherit the non-Medea allele and die (unless they receive Medea from their father). Medea's selfish behavior gives it a selective advantage over normal genes. If introduced into a population at sufficiently high levels, the Medea gene will spread, replacing entire populations of normal beetles with beetles carrying Medea. Because of this, Medea has been proposed as a way of genetically modifying insect populations. By linking the Medea construct to a gene of interest - for instance, a gene conferring resistance to malaria - Medea's unique dynamics could be exploited to drive both genes into a population. These findings have dramatic implications for the control of insect-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Construction of Medea  Medea, which has been found in nature only in flour beetles, is the only selfish gene that has been simulated in the lab and tested in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The toxin was a microRNA that blocked the expression of myd88, a gene vital for embryonic development in insects. The antidote was an extra copy of myd88. The offspring receiving the extra copy of myd88 survived and hatched, while those without the extra copy died. In lab trials where 25% of the original members were homozygous for Medea, the gene spread to the entire population within 10 to 12 generations.  Etymology  Medea was named for the Greek mythological figure of Medea, who killed her children when her husband left her for another woman.

It is a remote volcano that was identified as such in 1985, but the first ascent only occurred in 2014, making it the last unclimbed major Andean volcano. It is located west of Lake Argentino and northeast of Peel Fjord in the southern Andes and erupted mainly dacites and pyroclastic tephra. It has erupted several times in the Holocene, with a major eruption taking place 3,000 ± 1,000 years before present. Its eruptions have spread ashfalls over Patagonia.  Geography and geomorphology  Aguilera lies west of the city of Calafate, northwest of Peel Fjord and within the commune of Natales. There is not much knowledge on volcanism in southernmost Chile/Patagonia as the volcanoes are poorly mapped, difficult to access and the weather conditions hostile. Aguilera was named in 1933 by Alberto Maria de Agostini, but its volcanic nature was first established in 1985. Aguilera is part of the Andean Austral Volcanic Zone, which lies in the southernmost territory of Chile. It consists of six volcanoes, from north to south these are Lautaro, Viedma, Aguilera, Reclus, Monte Burney and Cook; only the first has clearly documented historical activity, in 1959-1960. The first five are located on the South America Plate at increasing distances from the trench, while Cook is on the Scotia Plate and is a complex of lava domes unlike the other volcanoes which are stratovolcanoes. North of Lautaro lies a long gap without volcanism and then Cerro Hudson, the southernmost volcano of the Southern Volcanic Zone. The volcano is a / high stratovolcano that rises from the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, reaching a height of about above its base and almost entirely covered with ice.  Geology  Off southwesternmost South America, the Antarctic Plate subducts beneath the South America Plate at a rate of . This subduction is responsible for the volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone, whereas earthquake activity is low; this is possibly because the subducting plate is too hot and too slow moving. The basement below Aguilera is of Paleozoic-early Mesozoic age and consists of metamorphic rocks. The volcano sits at the easterly margin of the Patagonian Batholith, a Mesozoic-Cenozoic igneous rock province. Volcanism occurs along much of the Andes, partly due to the subduction of the Antarctic Plate and partly due to the subduction of the Nazca Plate, in each case beneath the South America Plate. The latter subduction gives rise to the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, the Austral Volcanic Zone was once considered part of the Southern Volcanic Zone. = Composition = Aguilera has erupted dacites with intermediate contents of potassium, defining a calc-alkaline suite with adakitic characteristics. Phenocrysts include amphibole, biotite, clinopyroxene, hornblende and plagioclase; plagioclase and also orthoclase and pyroxene often occur as xenoliths. Melts of subducted sediment and from the subducting slab give rise to the magmas of Aguilera and other volcanoes of the northern Austral Volcanic Zone, but they are subsequently modified by interactions with the mantle wedge and in the case of Aguilera, Lautaro and Viedma further interaction takes place with the Paleozoic crust.  Climate and vegetation  Aguilera lies within the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies belt and the average temperature of the region is about . There is a west-east precipitation gradient from to less than in the region; frontal systems and cyclones within the westerlies deliver most precipitation in the region, but precipitation rates are controlled by orographic precipitation and the rainshadow effect resulting in the west-east gradient. Vegetation in the region ranges from Magellanic subpolar forests to semidesert, depending on the amount of moisture available; Nothofagus species form most of the woods, including Nothofagus antarctica, Nothofagus betuloides and Nothofagus pumilio.  Eruption history  Aguilera erupted during the Holocene, depositing tephra in the region of Lago Argentino and Torres del Paine. The composition of rocks erupted by Aguilera are similar to these from Lautaro and Viedma, and the linkage of specific ash deposits to Aguilera is based mainly on geographical considerations. Other volcanoes have left tephra deposits in the wider region, including Cerro Hudson, Monte Burney and Reclus. A thick tephra from Laguna Potrok Aike may testify to an eruption of Aguilera between 42,400 - 51,747 years before present. Later, two ash layers emplaced 5,700 and 5,150 years before present in the Vega Ñandú mire in Torres del Paine National Park may have been erupted at Aguilera. A tephra layer found at archeological sites around Lago Argentino and deposited there 4,091 - 4,566 years before present originated at Aguilera and probably disrupted local human communities. Farther away in Antarctica, a tephra found in Talos Dome and deposited there 4,420 years before present may have originated at this volcano as well. Another smaller eruption occurred at Aguilera after the A1 event and deposited ash in the Lago Argentino area; the date of its eruption is unknown. There are no known historical eruptions although Aguilera is a candidate volcano for an eruption that occurred in 1886. = A1 eruption = A major eruption occurred at Aguilera less than 3,596 ± 230 years before present, it was later constrained to have occurred 3,000 ± 100 years before present, and is known as the A1 eruption of Aguilera. It was a large eruption and deposited tephra east of the volcano and as far south as the Strait of Magellan; other Aguilera tephras are less widespread. Its volume has been estimated to be between , larger than the 1991 eruption of Cerro Hudson, and it is classified as level 5 on the volcanic explosivity index. Tephra deposits from this eruption have been found in the Cordillera Baguales ( thickness), at Gran Campo Nevado ( thickness), Lago Argentino ( thickness), Lago Cardiel ( thickness), Lago Roca ( thickness), Lake Viedma ( thickness), Brunswick Peninsula ( thickness), Seno Skyring (), Torres del Paine National Park ( thickness) and Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego ( thickness). On Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego apparently the eruption did not impact human populations to a large degree. Furthermore, a sulfur dioxide-rich layer in ice cores from Talos Dome, Antarctica, dated to 3,600 years before present may have been a consequence of the Aguilera eruption.  First climb  Aguilera was the last major volcano in the Andes to be climbed, with the first successful attempt occurring in August 2014 by a group of Chilean climbers.

These collected volumes were created specifically to be sold to libraries, with all proceeds going back to the Diversity Foundation to produce more single issues of the comic book series.  Characters  * Robert Reilly - Robert is the brains of the operation. His father owns the scrapyard, which is filled with discarded technical equipment that Robert can make gadgets out of to help solve their cases. The scrapyard is just one of many enterprises that Robert's father owns, and his business calls for him to travel extensively. Robert has the highest GPA of his school. * Raymond Garcia - Raymond is impulsive, but brave in the face of danger. He usually is the first one to use Robert's inventions while they're still in the testing phase. Ray is a comic book fan and his favorite superhero is Captain Patriot. He also likes to make short films and hopes to study film-making. His family owns a small market in the city. * Jinn Lee - Jinn is the intuitive detective of the group. She has a knack for being able to piece clues together to solve a mystery. She has a younger brother named Kahl, who likes to spend as much time with her as he can. Jinn was an aspiring skateboarding competitor before the accident that put her in a wheelchair. She is currently undergoing physical therapy to learn to walk again. Jinn also has a pet spider named Rex. * Katie - Katie is Raymond's younger cousin, and she visits him regularly. An avid reader of junior mystery novels, Katie follows her cousin's adventures and idolizes the Scrapyard Detectives. After helping them on a case, she is made an official Scrapyard Detective. Katie has a hyper active imagination that sees “mysteries” to solve everywhere. * Lisan Khatib - Lisan's family moved to the United States from India. Lisan helps the Scrapyard Detectives with research, and is a part-time member, due to his after school activities. Lisan is also on the school basketball team, and has the second highest GPA at his school, after Robert. Inventions and Gadgets * The Detecto-Sled - The \\"Detecto-Sled\\" is a one- person hovercraft vehicle that was invented and constructed by Robert. It was made from a variety of discarded parts found in the scrapyard, but the main pieces were salvaged from a vacuum cleaner, a small leaf blower motor and a snowboard. Two old metal cylinders from a fire extinguisher serve as the propulsion thrust. The handle bars are from Robert's old bicycle, and feature a brake system modified from the bicycle as well. Robert only got to ride it a short time, before Raymond started using it almost exclusively, bringing it back in for repairs from time to time. The engine appears to run on plain gasoline. * REX 2.0 Robotic Spider - \\"REX 2.0\\" is a remote controlled surveillance device that resembles a robotic spider. The device is named after Jinn's pet spider, Rex, but Jinn was quick to point out that spiders have 8 legs, not four, so technically it does not qualify as a spider. REX 2.0 was created by Robert as a way to gather information the course of investigations, when surveillance in person can't be accomplished. REX 2.0 is guided by remote control in the form of a rewired video game system controller which controls its movements. Using special goggles, the user can see the environment that REX 2.0 is scrambling over via a small web camera installed in its central shell. In the case of \\"A Friend in Need\\", REX 2.0 was stomped on by Ben Crenshaw's father, a suspect in an investigation by Raymond. REX 2.0 has not returned to active duty, and is still awaiting repairs by Robert.

It aired on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada on March 28, 2007. The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Stephen Williams. The episode's story focuses on couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before arriving on the island, and what they have been doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned for the fifth time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel Roebuck) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deemed it unnecessary.  Plot = Flashbacks = The flashbacks begin with Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) acting in a popular, Charlie's Angels-like TV show Exposé filmed in Sydney, in which she is a guest star. She is also having an affair with the septuagenarian executive producer, Howard L. Zuckerman, who is very wealthy, while Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) works as his chef. Paulo kills Zuckerman by poisoning his food, and the couple steals his diamonds, which are worth $8 million. The couple plan on returning to the United States on Oceanic Flight 815, encountering Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) at the airport. Upon surviving the plane crash, Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds. Nikki consults Dr. Leslie Arzt (Daniel Roebuck), who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people. He also gives her a trajectory map which leads them to The Pearl and the Nigerian plane; they explore neither. When Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake, Paulo finds the diamonds, but does not tell Nikki. Instead, he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). The two accidentally leave behind a walkie-talkie that Paulo takes. Later, when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick), Nikki and Paulo visit The Pearl, Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending to use the bathroom. Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds without telling her and decides to lure him into a trap. When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him. She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes, claiming that he did it so that she would not end their relationship. As Nikki stands in a state of regret, the pheromones of the female spider attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg. She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach. = On the beach = Nikki then runs onto the beach, before collapsing where Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) are playing ping pong. As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her, she says something barely audible. She is soon pronounced dead. Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said before she died and come to the conclusion that she said, \\"Paulo lies\\", although she actually said \\"paralyzed\\". Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle. Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo's tent, and concludes they were working with the Others, due to the similarity. Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp, but Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) reminds them that she was abducted nearby (unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her). Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep. Meanwhile, Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan), who feels guilty, confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her. She says nothing and walks away. Sawyer returns, having found the diamonds, and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning. He gives the diamonds to Sun, but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because \\"they're worthless here.\\" The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo, where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave. Nikki's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave, burying her and Paulo alive.  Production  Damon Lindelof admitted that Nikki and Paulo were killed off due to being unpopular. \\"Exposé\\" was the fourteenth episode of the series directed by Stephen Williams, and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir, with two con artists who did the \\"perfect crime\\", that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island. A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie's Evil Under the Sun. A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo's selfishness, which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and \\"too focused on their own petty needs to really care about anyone else\\". The flashbacks of \\"Exposé\\" would show how Nikki and Paulo were always on the island by making them appear in important previous events. The scene set after the crash mixes actual scenes and unused footage of the pilot episode, along with new footage shot in the original location of Mokulēʻia beach. Since not all pieces of the wreckage were found, a few were added with greenscreen effects.\\"Lost on Location: 'Exposé' \\". Lost: The Complete Third Season – The Unexplored Experience, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Featurette, disc 7. Released on December 11, 2007. The scene with Jack's speech intersperses new scenes with footage from \\"White Rabbit\\". Other continuity nods were considered, such as Paulo finding Shannon's inhaler from \\"Confidence Man\\", Nikki seeing Boone and Locke carrying shovels to excavate the hatch, and a filmed, but deleted scene where Nikki sees the sky turning purple.\\"The Lost Flashbacks: 'Exposé: People Can Change'\\". Lost: The Complete Third Season – The Unexplored Experience, Buena Vista Home Entertainment. Deleted scene, disc 7. Released on December 11, 2007. During season one, the writers had the idea of introducing a character who was an actress and also created the outline of the fictional show where she would work Exposé. The \\"long, daunting hours\\" on the writer's room would sometimes lead to creating episodes of the fictional show, with ten being done when the Nikki-centered episode was written. Originally, there was going to be an entire flashback episode in which Nikki was going to be a crime-fighting stripper, only to have it revealed that she was actually an actress. The idea was shortened to just one flashback spot. The role of Mr. LaShade was written with Billy Dee Williams in mind and, when he was cast, the color scheme of LaShade's hat was chosen in reference to his costume worn in his famed role as Lando Calrissian . Nikki and Paulo were killed off due to being disliked by much of Lost's fan base. Show runner Damon Lindelof admitted that the couple were \\"universally despised\\" by fans.Jensen, Jeff & Snierson, Dan, (February 8, 2007) \\"'Lost' and Found,\\" Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on July 23, 2008. Lindelof explained that \\"back when we (the producers) had more good faith with the audience, we could have gotten away with these shenanigans. Given the backlash against them, we had to clean up the mess.\\" The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006. It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo's bad reception, they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast. Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive. Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn't bothered by the general dislike of her character, she was very nervous during the burial scene, because she has claustrophobia. Speculation about the duo's deaths began months before the actual episode aired. Santoro said in an interview with Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season. Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show, Football Wives.  Reception  \\"Exposé\\" had 11.25 million viewers upon its first US broadcast, being ABC's third most watched show of the week – behind the performance show and results of Dancing with the Stars – and placing Lost at the eighteenth spot on the overall weekly ranking. It also attracted 1.089 million viewers in Canada, being the fourth most watched show of the night, and 961,000 viewers in the United Kingdom, being Sky One's most watched show of the week.\\"Weekly Top 10 Programmes (Sky 1, April 1, 2007) \\", BARB. Retrieved on July 16, 2011. \\"Exposé\\" received mixed reviews. Lindelof admitted that the episode \\"created a varying degree of fan reaction\\", with some fans even describing it as \\"filler\\". But Cuse defended \\"Exposé\\", saying it was \\"a little bit more of an anthology episode for the show\\", and that he felt that \\"it's unrealistic, in a show that is now 72 episodes in, that every episode is gonna be, you know, chock full of plot momentum. I think it's entirely reasonable, and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren't super-narratively, you know, propelled.\\" Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode \\"was a complete waste of time\\", and that although he \\"wanted Nikki and Paulo to die\\", he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode. Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams, he did not think \\"Exposé\\" \\"will do much to change anyone's minds\\" about Nikki and Paulo, who were already unpopular characters. Brooke Tarnoff, a writer for UGO.com, wrote that she was \\"embarrassed\\" for Lost. New York Magazine put \\"Exposé\\" at the top of its list of \\"Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes\\". However, TV Guide's Matt Roush very much praised the episode for \\"weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons\\", Roush went on to say that \\"Exposé\\" was \\"a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they're doing after all.\\" Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review, stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline, \\"their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television\\". The IGN staff later ranked \\"Exposé\\" 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes, describing it as \\"one of the series' darkest and most fun episodes\\".

Early life Goldt was born in the town of Weende, now Göttingen, to working-class parents originally from Silesia. In 1977, he moved to West Berlin to avoid conscription. He started training as a photographer, but soon turned to making music full-time, working in various daytime jobs to support himself, including as a tourist guide. It was during this time that he chose the pseudonym Max Goldt. Career In 1978, Goldt joined Gerd Pasemann to form the core of the underground band Aroma Plus, who released two self-published albums before disbanding. From the ashes of Aroma Plus, in 1981 Goldt and Pasemann formed the duo Foyer des Arts, with Goldt providing lyrics and vocals. Foyer des Arts was signed by Warner Music's German branch WEA and enjoyed moderate commercial during the New German Wave. Their only hit (#36 on the West German singles chart) was Wissenswertes über Erlangen (\\"Things Worth Knowing About Erlangen\\"), a satirical take at Goldt's experience as a tourist guide (1982). Although Foyer des Arts did not formally disband until 1995, they were on hiatus most of the time and Goldt started to home record solo albums with experimental, often instrumental music and as well as Sprechgesang and spoken word tracks with background music and various effects. Goldt also published much of the (often quite bizarre) lyrics as books. From 1987, Goldt had a regular column in the Berlin underground magazine Ich und mein Staubsauger (\\"Me and my vacuum cleaner\\"), in which he wrote more \\"straightforward\\" yet humorous essays with a distinctive style. After the magazine's demise in 1988, Goldt's column began to appear in Titanic, Germany's premier satirical magazine, on a monthly basis. The change marked the beginning of Goldt's second career as a writer of essays. The column appeared under varying headlines (Aus Onkel Max’ Kulturtagebuch [\\"From Uncle Max's cultural diary\\"], Diese Kolumne hat vorübergehend keinen Namen [\\"This column is temporarily without a name\\"], Manfred Meyer berichtet aus Stuttgart [\\"Manfred Meyer reporting from Stuttgart\\"], and Informationen für Erwachsene [\\"Information for adults\\"]. Regularly reprinted (some in revised form) in book format, these essays established Goldt as a major author. Goldt regularly travels the German-speaking areas reading from his books, often drawing large crowds. Recordings from these performances have been released on a series of compact discs. Apart from that, he continues to record music (in the broadest sense), solo and with Stephan Winkler (as NUUK). In 1998, Goldt suspended his regular contributions to Titanic, although one-off articles continued to appear, but eventually resumed them in 2005. Since 1996, Goldt has cooperated with cartoonist Stephan Katz to produce comic strips that have appeared in Titanic, Die Zeit and in a series of books. In 2008, on the recommendation of Daniel Kehlmann, he was awarded the Kleist Prize. Style Max Goldt's writing style is characterised by a fresh, frequently ironic perspective on familiar aspects of everyday life; seemingly tangential changes of topic, triggered by unexpected (yet arguably logical) associations; creative use of language, often combined with a critique of linguistic conventions in journalese and everyday language; frequent references to pop culture; ambiguity as to whether or not the narrator is relating the first- hand experience, opinions and sentiments of the author.Daniel Kehlmann: Der Seitlich-Vorbei-Geher, Kleist-Preis für Max Goldt.

Life The Leaning Tree Taylor was born in Greenock, Scotland, in 1874, the fifteenth of seventeen children of an army major. Initially apprenticed in the Glasgow shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde, he trained as an artist at the Glasgow School of Art, where he met and married Jessie M. King in 1908. They moved to Salford, where he designed for George Wragge Ltd, producing many designs for stained-glass windows, including domestic work for the Scottish engineer Sir William Arrol at Seafield House in Ayr. Between 1911 and 1914 the Taylors lived in Paris where they established an art school – the Shearling Atelier. The influence of modern French art and the Ballets Russes can be seen in Taylor's art: his style broadened and he began to make more use of dramatic outlines. On their return to Scotland at the outbreak of the First World War, Taylor and King settled at The Greengate in the High Street in Kirkcudbright, where S J Peploe was a frequent visitor. They established a summer school at High Corrie on the Isle of Arran, as well as locally in Kirkcudbright. Taylor's work, like that of his wife, became more powerful and dramatic during their time in Galloway, closer in style to the Scottish Colourists. A number of Taylor's paintings are in public collections, including Glasgow Museums.Isle of Whithorn by Ernest Archibald Taylor, BBC - Your Paintings.

His oils, painted in broad brushstrokes, depict the rugged landscape of the Western Highlands, often with a white croft set against a dark rock face.

As an academic subject, it crosses the boundaries of standard disciplines, focusing on understanding the United States' relationship with the oceans, seas, and major waterways of the globe. The focus is on merchant shipping, and the financing and manning of the ships. A merchant marine owned at home is not essential to an extensive foreign commerce. In fact, it may be cheaper to hire other nations to handle the carrying trade than to participate in it directly. On the other hand, there are certain advantages, particularly during time of war, which may warrant an aggressive government encouragement to the maintenance of a merchant marine.Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers Publishers, Copyright 1938, p. 672 History=Early history= The maritime history of the United States goes back to the first successful English colony was established in 1607, on the James River at Jamestown. It languished for decades until a new wave of settlers arrived in the late 17th century and set up commercial agriculture based on exports of tobacco to England. Settlers brought horses, cattle, sheep and hogs as well as tools and the current technology to the Americas. From the very first days of the founding of the North American colonies shipbuilding was naturally one of the industries that chiefly engaged the attention of the colonists. At the time of the breaking out of the American Revolution and for a long time afterwards more of the people in New England were actually engaged in shipbuilding and ship sailing than in agriculture, even in spite of the restrictions imposed on the building of ships in the English colonies. The statement is made that at one time during this period Massachusetts was estimated to have one vessel for every hundred of its inhabitants. One out of every four signers of the Declaration of Independence was a shipowner or had been a ship captain.pp. 330-331 https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIuAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false The 18th century As British colonists before 1776, American merchant vessels had enjoyed the protection of the Royal Navy. Major ports in the Northeast began to specialize in merchant shipping. The main cargoes included tobacco, as well as rice, indigo and naval stores from the Southern colonies. From the other colonies exports included horses, wheat, fish and lumber. By the 1760s New England was the center of a flourishing shipbuilding industry. Imports included all manner of manufactured goods.Samuel Eliot Morison, The Maritime History Of Massachusetts, 1783-1860 (1921) excerpt and text search Revolutionary War The first war that an organized United States Merchant Marine took part in was the American Revolutionary War, which lasted from 1775 to 1783. In 1775 the Continental Congress and the various colonies issued Letters of Marque to privately owned, armed merchant ships known as privateers, which were outfitted as warships to prey on enemy merchant ships. They interrupted the British supply chain all along the eastern seaboard of the United States and across the Atlantic Ocean and the Merchant Marine's role in war began. This predates both the United States Coast Guard (1790) and the United States Navy (1797). During the American Revolution, American ships came under the aegis of France due to a 1778 Treaty of Alliance between the two countries.See First Barbary War. 1783–1790 By 1783, however, with the end of the Revolution, America became solely responsible for the safety of its own commerce and citizens. Without the means or the authority to field a naval force necessary to protect their ships in the Mediterranean against the Barbary pirates, the nascent U.S. government took a pragmatic, but ultimately self-destructive route. In 1784, the United States Congress allocated money for payment of tribute to the pirates. Also in 1784, Boston navigators sailed to the Pacific Northwest and opened the U.S. fur trade. Captain William Bainbridge paying tribute to the DeyIn 1785, the Dey of Algiers took two American ships hostage and demanded US$60,000 in ransom for their crews. Then- ambassador to France Thomas Jefferson argued that conceding the ransom would only encourage more attacks. His objections fell on the deaf ears of an inexperienced American government too riven with domestic discord to make a strong show of force overseas. The U.S. paid Algiers the ransom, and continued to pay up to $1 million per year over the next 15 years for the safe passage of American ships or the return of American hostages. Payments in ransom and tribute to the privateering states amounted to 20 percent of United States government annual revenues in 1800. Jefferson continued to argue for cessation of the tribute, with rising support from George Washington and others. With the recommissioning of the American navy in 1794 and the resulting increased firepower on the seas, it became more and more possible for America to say \\"no\\", although by now the long-standing habit of tribute was hard to overturn. A largely successful undeclared war with French privateers in the late 1790s showed that American naval power was now sufficient to protect the nation's interests on the seas. These tensions led to the First Barbary War in 1801. The only clause in the treaty of peace (1783) concerning commerce was a stipulation guaranteeing that the navigation of the Mississippi should be forever free to the United States. John Jay at this time had tried to secure some reciprocal trade provisions with Great Britain, but without result. Pitt in 1783 introduced a bill into the British Parliament providing for free trade between the United States and the British colonies, but instead of passing this bill Parliament enacted the British Navigation Act of 1783 which admitted only British-built ships and manned ships to the ports of the West Indies and imposed heavy tonnage dues upon American ships in other British ports. This was amplified in 1786 by another act designed to prevent the fraudulent registration of American vessels, and by still another in 1787 which prohibited the importation of American goods by way of foreign islands. The favorable features of the old Navigation Acts which had granted bounties and reserved the English markets in certain cases to colonial products were gone; the unfavorable alone were left. The British market was further curtailed by the depression there after 1783. Although the French treaty of 1778 had promised \\"perfect equality and reciprocity\\" in commercial relations, it was found impossible to make a commercial treaty upon this basis. Spain demanded as her price for reciprocal trading relations that the United States surrender for twenty-five years the right of navigating the Mississippi, a price which the New England merchants would have been glad to pay. France (1778) and the Dutch Republic (1782) made treaties, but not on even terms; Portugal refused the U.S. advances. Only Sweden (1783) and Prussia (1785) made treaties guaranteeing reciprocal commercial privileges.Harold Underwood Faulkner, American Economic History, Harper & Brothers, 1938, p. 182 The weakness of Congress under the Articles of Confederation prevented retaliation by the central government. Power was repeatedly asked to regulate commerce, but was refused by the states, upon whom rested the carrying out of such commercial treaties as Congress might negotiate. Eventually the states themselves attempted retaliatory measures, and during the years 1783–88, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia levied tonnage dues upon British vessels or discriminating tariffs upon British goods. Whatever effect these efforts might have had were neutralized by the fact that the duties were not uniform, varying in different states from no tariffs whatever to duties of 100 percent. This simply drove British ships to the free or cheapest ports and their goods continued to flood the market. Commercial war between the states followed and turned futility into chaos. The effect of this trade policy upon American shipping was detrimental. After the passage of the U.S. Constitution in 1789 the congress was petitioned for relief. On June 5, 1789, a petition from the tradesmen and manufacturers of Boston was sent to the Congress which stated \\"that the great decrease of American manufactures, and almost total stagnation of American ship-building, urge us to apply to the sovereign Legislature of these States for their assistance to promote these important branches, so essential to our national wealth and prosperity. It is with regret we observe the resources of this country exhausted for foreign luxuries, our wealth expended for various articles which could be manufactured among ourselves, and our navigation subject to the most severe restrictions in many foreign ports, whereby the extensive branch of American ship-building is essentially injured, and a numerous body of citizens, who were formerly employed in its various departments, deprived of their support and dependence.... \\" \\"National State Papers of the United States, 1789-1817, Part II Text of Documents, Administration of George Washington, 1789-1797, 1st Congress, 1st Session, Volume I, March 4, 1789 – August 28, 1789 Michael Glazier, Inc., 1985, p. 113 The congress responded with passage of the Tariff of 1789 which established tonnage rates favorable to American carriers by charging them lower cargo fees than those imposed on foreign boats importing similar goods. Coastal trade was reserved exclusively for American flag vessels. In 1789, when the Constitution was adopted, the registered tonnage of the United States engaged in foreign trade was 123,893. During the next succeeding eight years it increased 384 percent.p. 331 https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIuAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false I The 1790s Shipping articles from a 1786 voyage to Boston. Articles is the nautical term for the contract between the crew and the ship. In 1790, federal legislation was enacted pertaining to seamen and desertion. In 1796, federal legislation regarding Seaman's Protection Certificates (also known as Protection papers) was enacted. Immediately after the Revolutionary War the brand-new United States of America was struggling to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and a great deal of this income came from import tariffs. Because of rampant smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws, and on August 4, 1790, the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, later renamed Revenue Cutter Service in 1862. It would be the responsibility of the new Revenue-Marine to enforce the tariff and all other maritime laws. Although tangential to American maritime history, 1799 saw the fall of a colossus of the world's maritime history. The Dutch East India Company, established on March 20, 1602, when the Estates-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly to carry out colonial activities in Asia, formerly the world's largest company, became bankrupt, partly due to the rise of competitive free trade. =The 19th century= The New American Practical Navigator. During the wars with France (1793 to 1815) the Royal Navy aggressively reclaimed British deserters on board ships of other nations, both by halting and searching merchant ships, and in many cases, by searching American port cities. The Royal Navy did not recognize naturalized American citizenship, treating anyone born a British subject as \\"British\\" -- as a result, the Royal Navy impressed over 6,000 sailors who were claimed as American citizens as well as British subjects. This was one of the major factors leading to the War of 1812 in North America. Commercial whaling in the United States was the center of the world whaling industry during the 18th and 19th centuries and was most responsible for the severe depletion of a number of whale species. New Bedford, Massachusetts and Nantucket Island were the primary whaling centers in the 19th century. In 1857, New Bedford had 329 registered whaling ships. Robert Fulton ordered a Boulton and Watt steam engine, and built what he called the North River Steamboat (often mistakenly described as the Clermont ). In 1807 this steamboat began a regular passenger boat service between New York City and Albany, New York, distant, which was a commercial success. In 1808 John and James Winans built Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, the second steamboat to operate commercially. In 1809, Accommodation, built by the Hon. John Molson at Montreal, and fitted with engines made in that city, was running successfully between Montreal and Quebec, being the first steamer on the St. Lawrence and in Canada. The experience of both vessels showed that the new system of propulsion was commercially viable, and as a result its application to the more open waters of the Great Lakes was next considered. That idea went on hiatus, due to the War of 1812, however. As a result of rising tensions with Great Britain, a number of laws collectively known as the Embargo Act of 1807 were enacted. Britain and France were at war; the U.S. was neutral and trading with both sides. Both sides tried to hinder American trade with the other. Jefferson's goal was to use economic warfare to secure American rights, instead of military warfare. Initially, these acts sought to punish Great Britain for its violation of American rights on the high seas; among these was the impressment of those sailors off American ships, sailors who claimed to be American citizens but not in the opinion or to the satisfaction of the Royal Navy, ever on the outlook for deserters. The later Embargo Acts, particularly those of 1807–1808 period, were passed in an attempt to stop Americans, and American communities, that sought to, or were merely suspected of possibility wanting to, defy the embargo. These Acts were ultimately repealed at the end of Jefferson's second, and last, term. A modified version of these Acts would return for a brief time in 1813 under the presidential administration of Jefferson's successor, James Madison.See Embargo Act of 1807. The African slave trade became illegal on January 1, 1808.See . By 1807 the tonnage registered in the United States engaged in foreign trade had increased to 848,307.p. 331 https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIuAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false The War of 1812 The United States declared war on Britain on June 18, 1812, for a combination of reasons—outrage at the impressment (seizure) of thousands of American sailors, frustration at British restrictions on neutral trade while Britain warred with France, and anger at British military support for hostile tribes in the Ohio-Indiana-Michigan area. After war was declared Britain offered to withdraw the trade restrictions, but it was too late for the American \\"War Hawks\\", who turned the conflict into what they called a \\"second war for independence.\\" Part of the American strategy was deploying several hundred privateers to attack British merchant ships, which hurt British commercial interests, especially in the West Indies. Clipper ships In the United States the term \\"clipper\\" referred to the Baltimore clipper, a type of topsail schooner that was developed in Chesapeake Bay before the American Revolution and was lightly armed in the War of 1812, sailing under Letters of Marque and Reprisal, when the type--exemplified by the Chasseur, launched at Fells Point, Baltimore, 1814-- became known for its incredible speed; a deep draft enabled the Baltimore clipper to sail close to the wind (Villiers 1973). Clippers, outrunning the British blockade of Baltimore, came to be recognized as ships built for speed rather than cargo space; while traditional merchant ships were accustomed to average speeds of under 5 knots (9 km/h), clippers aimed at 9 knots (17 km/h) or better. Sometimes these ships could reach 20 knots (37 km/h). \\"The Prinz Albert,\\" 1897, by Antonio Jacobsen Clippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. The small, fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as spices, tea, people, and mail. The values could be spectacular. The Challenger returned from Shanghai with \\"the most valuable cargo of tea and silk ever to be laden in one bottom.\\" The competition among the clippers was public and fierce, with their times recorded in the newspapers. The ships had low expected lifetimes and rarely outlasted two decades of use before they were broken up for salvage. Given their speed and maneuverability, clippers frequently mounted cannon or carronade and were often employed as pirate vessels, privateers, smuggling vessels, and in interdiction service. 1815–1830 During the 18th century, ships carrying cargo, passengers and mail between Europe and America would sail only when they were full, but in the early 19th century, as trade with America became more common, schedule regularity became a valuable service. Starting in 1818, ships of the Black Ball Line began regularly scheduled trips between Britain and America. These \\"packet ships\\" (named for their delivery of mail \\"packets\\") were infamous for keeping to their disciplined schedules. This often involved harsh treatment of seamen and earned the ships the nickname \\"bloodboat\\". During the 1820s American whalers start flocking to the Pacific, resulting in more contact with the Hawaiian Islands. Because of the influence of whaling and several local droughts, there was substantial migration from Cape Verde to America, most notably to New Bedford, Massachusetts. This migration built strong ties between the two locations, and a strong packet trade between New England and Cape Verde developed during the early to mid-19th century. The Erie Canal was started in 1817 and finished in 1825, encouraging inland trade and strengthening the position of the port of New York.See . Although the amount of tonnage registered in foreign trade did not equal that of the years 1815-17 or the figures of the next two decades, the proportion of American carriage in the foreign trade reached 92.5 percent in 1826, a larger percentage than has been attained before or since. Not only were we carrying practically all of our own goods, but the reputation of Yankee ship builders for turning out models which surpassed in speed, strength, and durability any vessels to be found, brought about the sale between 1815 and 1840 of 540,000 tons of shipping to foreigners. Not withstanding higher wages, it cost less to run an American vessel, for a smaller crew was carried. Of the world's total whaling fleet in 1842, it was estimated that of 882 ships 652 were American vessels.Faulkner, p. 280-281 The 1830s SS Great Eastern In 1832, Secretary of the Treasury Louis McLane ordered in writing for revenue cutters to conduct winter cruises to assist mariners in need, and Congress made the practice an official part of regulations in 1837. This was the beginning of the lifesaving mission that the later U.S. Coast Guard would be best known for worldwide. The side-wheel paddle steamer SS Great Western was the first purpose-built steamship to initiate regularly scheduled trans-Atlantic crossings, starting in 1838. The record times of these steam ships (the Atlantic crossing to New York in thirteen and a half days) proved that steamers could make the trip in shorter time than the fastest sailing packet. The British government was farsighted enough to realize that the motive power of the immediate future was steam, and in 1839 heavily subsidized the Cunard Line, which began its career in 1840 with four side-wheeled wooden ships. The British Government, therefore, readily aided Samuel Cunard, as it did other owners, granting him a subsidy of $425,000 a year to carry the mails back and forth between Liverpool, Halifax, and Boston, with an occasional visit to Quebec.p. 332 https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIuAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false This policy of subsidization, which was continued to at least WW II by Great Britain, aided materially not only in giving her maritime interests a start in the new type of ships, but in helping them win and hold supremacy on the ocean. The Peninsular Company, afterwards the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, was established in 1837, and the Pacific Steam Navigation Company in 1840, both subsidized.Faulkner, p. 282-283 The 1840s The first regular steamship service from the west to the east coast of the United States began on February 28, 1849, with the arrival of the SS California (1848) in San Francisco Bay. California left New York Harbor on October 6, 1848, rounded Cape Horn at the tip of South America, and arrived at San Francisco, California after a 4-month 21-day journey. SS Great Eastern was built in 1854-1857 with the intent of linking Great Britain with India, via the Cape of Good Hope, without coaling stops; she would know a turbulent history, and was never put to her intended use. The years leading up to the Civil War were characterized by extremely rapid production in ship building. The 538,136 tons registered in foreign trade in 1831 had increased to 1,047,454 in 1847 and to 2,496,894 in 1862, a figure which represented the culmination of our ship-building tonnage until surpassed in WW I. From 1848 to 1858 ship building had been maintained at an average of 400,000 tons a year. This construction was caused by two conditions, the development of the clipper ship after 1845 and the increased demand for shipping. Designed for speed, the clipper was built on sharp lines and carried a maximum of canvas and was the culmination of the intense rivalry between steam and canvas. It was intended primarily for long voyages, and was used especially for the California and Far Eastern trade. Given a fair breeze, a clipper ship could outdistance a steamship. It was not uncommon for a clipper to sail over 300 miles a day; the Flying Cloud (clipper) on a ninety-day run to San Francisco made 374 miles in one day. The Comet (clipper), on an eighty-day voyage from San Francisco to New York averaged 210 miles a day. It appeared that the American ship builder, before he relinquished his supremacy, was intent upon demonstrating to what heights of efficiency and speed a sailing ship could attain.Faulkner, p. 283 The increased demand for shipping was the result of several factors. The discovery in 1848 of gold in California was a major cause along with the wars between Great Britain and China in 1840-42 and 1856-60 threw a part of the China trade into American hands. The revolutionary outbreaks of 1848 interrupted European trade, with a resultant benefit to Americans, while the Crimean War, which occupied many European boats in transporting troops and supplies, gave new openings to American ships. In addition the natural growth in population, wealth, and production necessitated increased shipping.Faulkner, p. 284 The volume of mail between the United States and Europe increased substantially during this period, and the capacity of the sailboat to deliver this mail efficiently and within a reasonable time was uncertain. Following the precedent established by England and other maritime nations, the federal government began its aid to ocean shipping with the overseas mail service. On March 3, 1845, Congress authorized the Postmaster General to invite bids on contracts to carry mail between the United States and abroad. Regular subsidized service between New York and Bremen, Havre, Liverpool and Panama was established under the Act of 1845. Subsidy payments averaged between $19,250 and $35,000 per round trip, and aggregated government expenditures to 1858 amounted to $14,400,000.http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1916&context;=flr This development led to the formation of the U.S. Mail Steamship Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. The 1850s Almost as revolutionary as the gradual substitution of steam for sailing vessels was the very gradual substitution of iron and later steel ships for those of wood. With an abundance of coal and iron close to the sea, with skilled mechanics and cheap labor, Great Britain forged ahead from the start. Already by 1853 one-fourth of the tonnage built in Great Britain were steamships and more than one-fourth were built of iron. In the same year 22 percent of American tonnage was constructed for steamships, but scarcely any iron ships were built here. The Yankee ship builder, overconfident in the recognized superiority of his inimitable clipper ship, was blinded to the fact that the future of the sea was for the nation which could build the cheapest and the best iron steamships. There was a decidedly unhealthy element to this remarkable activity in ship building. In the first place the demand from Europe because of the Crimean War was abnormal; between 1854 and 1859 the European nations were buying 50,000 tons of shipping as against 10,000 tons in normal years. Unfortunately, this increase in the building of sailing ships came at a time when their days were numbered, for between 1850 and 1860 the share of ocean freight carried by steamers increased from 14 to 28 percent. When the abnormal demand for sailing ships should let up, as it did in 1858, it meant that shipyards built and equipped for the production of wooden ships and shipwrights trained for a type no longer wanted would be idle, while foreign shipyards already engaged in the building of the iron steamship would be in a decidedly superior position. The panic of 1857 precipitated the crash. In 1858 ship building, which had been maintained for the preceding years at an average of 400,000 tons a year dropped to 244,000 and in 1859 to 156,000. At that time the combined imports and exports carried in American bottoms was steadily declining, only 65.2 percent being carried in 1861 as against 92.5 percent in 1826. Another factor in the decline of American ship building was a fundamental economic change in progress throughout the United States. Capital was finding new and more profitable fields for investment. Manufacturing, which grew rapidly after the War of 1812, absorbed some of it; while considerable amounts were drawn into such internal improvements as canals and railways. Between 1820 and 1838 the states contracted debts of over $110,000,000 for the building of roads, canals, and railroads; from 1830 to 1860 over 30,000 miles of railroad were built, most of the capital coming from private investors. The minds of the venturous and ambitious turned from the sea to the unexploited West, and capital turned from ship building to the development of natural resources.Faulkner, p. 284-285 In 1852, the lighthouse board established and published first Light List and Notice to Mariners. In 1854, Andrew Furuseth was born in Norway, and Western river engineers form a \\"fraternal organization\\" that is a precursor to the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association. Also, Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry established trade relations with Japan with the signing of the Convention of Kanagawa. In 1857, New Bedford had 329 registered whaling ships. The discovery of petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania, on August 27, 1859, by Edwin L. Drake was the beginning of the end of commercial whaling in the United States as kerosene, distilled from crude oil, replaced whale oil in lamps. Later, electricity gradually replaced oil lamps, and by the 1920s, the demand for whale oil had disappeared entirely. Clipper ship sailing card for the \\"Free Trade,\\" printed by Nesbitt & Co., New York, early 1860s Decline in the use of clippers started with the economic slump following the Panic of 1857 and continued with the gradual introduction of the steamship. Although clippers could be much faster than the early steamships, clippers were ultimately dependent on the vagaries of the wind, while steamers could reliably keep to a schedule. The steam clipper was developed around this time, and had auxiliary steam engines which could be used in the absence of wind. An example of this type was the Royal Charter, built in 1857 and wrecked on the coast of Anglesey in 1859. In 1859, the \\"Memphis and St. Louis Packet Line,\\" which would later become the Anchor Line was formed, principally providing service to these two cities and points in between. The Anchor line was a steamboat company that operated a fleet of boats on the Mississippi River between St. Louis, Missouri, and New Orleans, Louisiana, between 1859 and 1898, when it went out of business. It was one of the most well-known, if not successful, pools of steamboats formed on the lower Mississippi River in the decades following the American Civil War. The 1860s The final blow to clipper ships came in the form of the Suez Canal, opened in 1869, which provided a huge shortcut for steamships between Europe and Asia, but which was difficult for sailing ships to use. =Civil War era= Merchant shipping was a key target in the U.S. Civil War. For example, the CSS Alabama, a Confederate sloop-of-war commissioned on 24 August 1862, spent months capturing and burning ships in the North Atlantic and intercepting grain ships bound for Europe. Other Confederate commerce raiders included the CSS Sumter, CSS Florida, and CSS Shenandoah. The elements contributing to the decline of the merchant marine were already operative before the Civil War, and the result would undoubtedly have been the same if that conflict had not come. The war, however, accentuated a tendency already existing and dealt a blow from which the merchant marine failed to recover until artificially revived during World War I. In 1861 registered American tonnage in foreign trade amounted to 2,496,894 tons and in 1865 to 1,518,350, while the percent of imports and exports carried in American ships dropped in the same years from 66.2 to 27.7. The decrease of tonnage in these years of some 900,000 tons was chiefly due to two causes. The first of these was the loss sustained from Confederate cruisers such as the Alabama built and fitted out in England contrary to the laws of warfare. The second and most important was the sale during the four years 1862-65 of 751,595 tons of shipping abroad, occasioned by (1) lack of confidence, decline in profits due to continual Confederate captures and high insurance rates, and (2) decline in export business due to the cessation of cotton shipments abroad.Faulkland, p. 285-286 A second round of ocean-mail contracts was authorized by Congress on May 28, 1864. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the United States and Brazil entered into a ten-year contract for monthly voyages between the United States and South America. Of the $250,000 annual subsidy requirement, the United States contributed $150,000 and Brazil $100,000. Subsequent subsidies to various individual American flag lines amounted to approximately $6,500,000 between 1864 and 1877. Efforts by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company to increase its subsidies and the political scandals that grew out of these efforts, caused the Government to abrogate all subsidies to the Lines. Little more was done by the Government until the passage of the Ocean Mail Act in 1891.p. 336 https://books.google.com/books?id=rzIuAAAAYAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false =1866–1870= First West Coast attempt at unionizing merchant seamen with the \\"Seamen's Friendly Union and Protective Society.\\" The union quickly dissolves. The Civil War dealt our once famous merchant marine a blow from which it never recovered except for the assistance of government intervention in World War I and later. Destruction by Confederate privateers and large sales abroad decreased the amount of tonnage. Delay in adopting iron steam- driven ships gave British builders an advantage which they continued to hold. But more important than all else was the fact that more profitable investments in internal transportation and the exploration of raw materials in the great industrial age which dawned after the war drew capital away from the sea. Lack of government interest helped complete the downfall of American shipping. The five years following the Civil War showed a slight revival but the forces tending to a decline continued operative. American shipping in foreign trade and the fisheries, which amounted to 2,642,628 tons in 1870, had dropped to 826,694 tons in 1900. In 1860 the percentage of imports and exports carried in American ships was 66.5, but this dropped in 1870 to 35.6, in 1880 to 13, in 1890 to 9.4, in 1900 to 7.1.Faulkner, p. 672-673 The 1870s By 1870, a number of inventions, such as the screw propeller and the triple expansion engine made trans-oceanic shipping economically viable. Thus began the era of cheap and safe travel and trade around the world. Starting in 1873, deck officers were required to pass mandatory license examinations. In 1874, the New York Nautical School was founded as a means of training young men for careers at sea in the postwar merchant marine, becoming the first school of its type in the United States. It would later become the State University of New York Maritime College. Also in 1874, the union that would become the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association formed. The Buffalo Association of Engineers began corresponding with other marine engineer associations around the country. These organizations held a convention in Cleveland, Ohio including delegates from Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois and Baltimore, Maryland. This organization called itself the National Marine Engineers Association and chose as its president Garret Douw of Buffalo. On February 23, 1875 MEBA was formed. As of 1876, Plimsoll marks were required on all U.S. vessels The 1880s Columbia. In 1880, passenger steamship Columbia of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company became the first outside usage of Thomas Edison's incandescent light bulb and the first ship to use a dynamo.Jehl, Francis Menlo Park reminiscences : written in Edison's restored Menlo Park laboratory, Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village, Whitefish, Mass, Kessinger Publishing, 1 July 2002, page 564Dalton, Anthony A long, dangerous coastline : shipwreck tales from Alaska to California Heritage House Publishing Company, 1 Feb 2011 - 128 pagesSwann, p. 242. The Sailors' Union of the Pacific (SUP) founded on March 6, 1885, in San Francisco, California is an American labor union of mariners, fishermen and boatmen working aboard U.S. flag vessels. At its fourth meeting in 1885, the fledgling organization adopted the name Coast Sailor's Union and elected George Thompson its first president. Andrew Furuseth, who had joined the union on June 3, 1885, was elected to its highest office in January 1887. In 1889 he returned to sea but was reelected to the position of union secretary in 1891. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was founded in 1886 by Samuel Gompers as a national federation of skilled workers' unions. Several maritime unions would affiliate with the AFL. In 1887, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee was formed. The 1890s In 1891, a marine engineering school opened in Massachusetts. On July 29, 1891, Andrew Furuseth merged the Coast Seamen's Union with the Steamship Sailor's Union to form the new Sailors' Union of the Pacific. With the exception of a two-month period when he shipped out as a fisherman, Furuseth was secretary of the SUP until 1935. Originally formed as the National Union of Seamen of America in 1892 in Chicago, Illinois, the organization was a federation of independent unions, including the Sailors' Union of the Pacific, the Lake Seamen's Union, the Atlantic Coast Seamen's Union, and the Seamen's and Firemen's Union of the Gulf Coast. Formed by maritime labor representatives from America's Pacific, Great Lakes and Gulf Coast regions In 1893, the ISU affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, in 1893 and in took the name International Seamen's Union of America in 1895. In 1895, the Maguire Act was passed: desertion from coastal vessels no longer punishable by imprisonment. In 1897, the White Act was passed, which abolished \\"imprisonment of US citizens for desertion in American or nearby waters,\\" and ends corporal punishment The Ocean Mail Act of 1891 provided for mail-subsidy payments to various classes of steamships and inaugurated a trade-route system which remained basically unchanged up to the present day. Under the Act's directive to \\"subserve and promote the postal and commercial interest of the United States,\\" the Postmaster General invited bids under which contracts were subsequently awarded on routes which varied in number from four to nine. The Act remained in effect until 1923, and total subsidy in the form of mail payments totaled $29,630,000. =The early 20th century= A steamship cleaning a whale, c. 1900. In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or \\"the Wobblies\\") was founded, representing mainly unskilled workers. \\"The Wobblies,\\" a force in American labor only for about 15 years, were largely routed by the Palmer Raids after World War I. In 1908, Andrew Furuseth became president of the International Seamen's Union and served in that office until 1938. The 1910s During this period, Andrew Furuseth successfully pushed for legislative reforms that eventually became the Seamen's Act. During World War I there was a shipping boom and ISU's membership included more than 115,000 dues-paying members. However, when the boom ended, the ISU's membership shrunk to 50,000. Andrew Furuseth (left) with Senator La Follette (center), and muckraker Lincoln Steffens, c. 1915. In 1915, the Seamen's Act of 1915 became law. The act fundamentally changed the life of the American sailor. Among other things, it: #abolished the practice of imprisonment for seamen who deserted their ship #reduced the penalties for disobedience #regulated a seaman's working hours both at sea and in port #established a minimum quality for ship's food #regulated the payment of seamen's wages #required specific levels of safety, particularly the provision of lifeboats #required a minimum percentage of the seamen aboard a vessel to be qualified Able Seamen #required a minimum of 75 percent of the seamen aboard a vessel to understand the language spoken by the officers Laws like the Seaman's Act put U.S.-flagged vessels at an economic disadvantage against countries lacking such safeguards.DeSombre 2006, p. 75. By moving their ships to the Panamanian flag of convenience, owners could avoid providing these protections. The Belen Quezada, the first foreign ship flagged in the Panamanian registry, was employed in running illegal alcohol between Canada and the United States during Prohibition.DeSombre 2006, p. 76. In addition to sidestepping the Seamen's Act, Panamanian-flagged ships in this early period paid sailors on the Japanese wage scale, which was much lower than that of western merchant powers. President Woodrow Wilson signed into law the act to create the United States Coast Guard on January 28, 1915. This Act effectively combined the Revenue Cutter Service with the Lifesaving Service and formed the new United States Coast Guard. Gradually the Coast Guard would grow to incorporate the United States Lighthouse Service in 1939 and the Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service in 1942. World War I Shipbuilding became a major wartime industry, focused on merchant ships and tankers. Merchant ships were often sunk until the convoy system was adopted using British and Canadian naval escorts, Convoys were slow but were effective in stopping U-boat attacks.Brian Tennyson, and Roger Sarty. \\"Sydney, Nova Scotia and the U-Boat War, 1918.\\" Canadian Military History 7.1 (2012): 4+ online The troops were shipped over on fast passenger liners that could easily outrun submarines.Holger H. Herwig, and David F. David. \\"The Failure of Imperial Germany's Undersea Offensive Against World Shipping, February 1917–October 1918.\\" Historian (1971) 33#4 pp: 611-636. In the First World War, Britain, as an island nation, was heavily dependent on foreign trade and imported resources. Germany found that their submarines, or U-boats, while of limited effectiveness against surface warships on their guard, were greatly effective against merchant ships, and could easily patrol the Atlantic even when Allied ships dominated the surface. By 1915, Germany was attempting to use submarines to maintain a naval blockade of Britain by sinking cargo ships, including many passenger vessels. Submarines, however, depending on stealth and incapable of withstanding a direct attack by a surface ship (possibly a Q-ship disguised as a merchant ship), found it difficult to give warning before attacking or to rescue survivors, which meant that civilian death tolls were high. This was a major factor in galvanizing neutral opinion against the Central Powers, as countries like the United States suffered casualties and loss to their trade, and was one of the causes of the eventual entry of the US into the war. In Sovereignty at Sea: U.S. Merchant Ships and American Entry into World War I, historian Dr. Rodney Carlisle asserts that it was, in fact, the sinking of nine U.S. merchant ships that utilmately induced President Wilson to ask Congress to declare war.\\"History Associates Cofounder Rodney Carlisle Authors New Book on World War I\\", History Associates (www.historyassociates.com), retrieved 2014-05-28. Over time, the use of defended convoys of merchant ships allowed the Allies to maintain shipping across the Atlantic, in spite of heavy loss. The Royal Navy had conducted convoys in the Napoleonic Wars and they had been used effectively to protect troopships in the current war, but the idea of using them to protect merchant shipping had been debated for several years. Nobody was sure if convoys were Britain's salvation or ruin. Consolidating merchant ships into convoys might just provide German U-boats with a target- rich environment, and packing ships together might lead to collisions and other accidents. It was potentially a logistical nightmare as well, and allied officers judged it too much so. With the ability to replace losses, the dilemma of using convoys was not as painful. After experiments through the early months of 1917 that proved successful, the first formal convoys were organized in late May. By the autumn the convoy system had become very well organized, and losses for ships in convoy fell drastically, with 2% losses for ships in convoy compared to 10% losses for ships traveling on their own. The convoy loss rate dropped to 1% in October. However, convoy was not mandatory, and monthly loss rates did not fall below their 1916 levels until August 1918. The need for administering the merchant marine during wartime was demonstrated during the First World War.\\"Training Merchant Marines For War: The Role of the United States Coast Guard\\", United States Coast Guard U.S. Department of Homeland Security (www.uscg.mil), retrieved 2014-05-28. Commerce warfare, carried on by submarines and merchant raiders, had a disastrous effect on the Allied merchant fleet. With the resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, U-boats sank ships faster than replacements could be built. 1919–1930 Another of ISU's successes was the strike of 1919, which resulted in wages that were \\"an all-time high for deep sea sailors in peacetime.\\" However, ISU had its shortcomings and failures, too. After a round of failed contract negotiations, ISU issued an all-ports strike on May 1, 1921. The strike lasted only two months and failed, with resulting wage cuts of 25 percent. The ISU, as with all AFL unions, was criticized as being too conservative. For example, in 1923 the Industrial Workers of the World publication The Marine Worker referred to the ISU's \\"pie-cards\\" (paid officials) as \\"grafters and pimps.\\" In 1929, the California Maritime Academy established. 1930–1941 In 1933, John L. Lewis founded the Committee for Industrial Organizations within the AFL. The committee split from the AFL in 1938 as the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). In 1934, Harry Lundeberg joined the Sailor's Union of the Pacific in Seattle. The ISU was weakened by the loss of the Sailors' Union of the Pacific in 1934. Furuseth charged that the SUP was being infiltrated by \\"radicals\\" from the IWW, and demanded the SUP cease activities with the Maritime Federation. The SUP refused and the ISU revoked their charter. The ISU was involved the West Coast longshoremen's strike of 1934. Lasting 83 days, the strike led to the unionization of all West Coast ports of the United States. The San Francisco general strike, along with the 1934 Toledo Auto-Lite Strike led by the American Workers Party and the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934, were important catalysts for the rise of industrial unionism in the 1930s. West Coast sailors deserted ships in support of the International Longshoremen's Association longshoremen, leaving more than 50 ships idle in the San Francisco harbor. ISU officials reluctantly supported this strike. In clashes with the police between July 3 and July 5, 1934, three picketers were killed and \\"scores were injured.\\" During negotiations to end the strike, the sailors received concessions including a three-watch system, pay increases, and better living conditions. In April 1935 at a conference of maritime unions in Seattle, an umbrella union was established to represent the membership of the ISU as well as maritime officers and longshoremen, which was named the Maritime Federation, Harry Lundeberg was named its first president. He was also named Secretary-Treasurer of SUP. The merchant marine in the United States was in a state of decline in the mid-1930s. At that time few ships were being built, existing ships were old and inefficient, maritime unions were at war with one another, ship owners were at odds with the unions, and the crews’ efficiency and morale were at an ebb. Congress took action to fix the problems in 1936. The Merchant Marine Act, approved on June 29, 1936, created the U.S. Maritime Commission \\"to further the development and maintenance of an adequate and well balanced American merchant marine, to promote the commerce of the United States, and to aid in the national defense.\\" The commission realized that a trained merchant marine work force was vital to the national interest. At the request of Congress, the chairman of the Maritime Commission, VADM Emory S. Land worked with ADM Russell R. Waesche, Commandant of the Coast Guard, to formulate a training program for merchant-marine personnel. Called the U.S. Maritime Service, the new training program was inaugurated in 1938. It used a combination of civilian Maritime Commission and uniformed Coast Guard instructors to advance the professional training of merchant mariners. Joseph P. Kennedy named head of Maritime Commission Merchant Marine Act in 1937. On 15 October 1938 the Seafarer's International Union was chartered. =NMU formation= In 1936, an ISU boatswain by the name of Joseph Curran was drawing attention. From March 1 to March 4, Curran led a strike aboard the SS California, then docked in San Pedro, California.Barbanel, \\"Joseph Curran, 75, Founder of National Maritime Union,\\" The New York Times, August 15, 1981.Kempton, Part of Our Time: Some Monuments and Ruins of the Thirties, 1998 (1955).\\"Retired Union Boss Joseph Curran Dies,\\" Associated Press, August 14, 1981.Schwartz, Brotherhood of the Sea: The Sailors' Union of the Pacific, 1885–1985, 1986. Seamen along the East Coast struck to protect the treatment of the SS California's crew. Curran became a leader of the 10-week strike, eventually forming a supportive association known as the Seamen's Defense Committee. In October 1936, Curran called a second strike, in part to improve working conditions and in part to embarrass the ISU. The four-month strike idled 50,000 seamen and 300 ships along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\\"Politics and Pork Chops,\\" Time, June 17, 1946. Believing it was time to abandon the conservative ISU, Curran began recruiting members for a new rival union. The level of organizing was so intense that hundreds of ships delayed sailing as seamen listened to organizers and signed union cards.\\"C.I.O. Goes to Sea,\\" Time, July 19, 1937. The ISU's official publication, The Seamen's Journal, suggested Curran's \\"sudden disenchantment\\" with the ISU was odd, since he'd only been a \\"member of the union for one year during his seafaring career.\\" In May 1937, Curran and other leaders of his Seamen's Defense Committee reconstituted the group as the National Maritime Union. Holding its first convention in July, approximately 30,000 seamen switched their membership from the ISU to the NMU and Curran was elected president of the new organization. Within a year, the NMU had more than 50,000 members and most American shippers were under contract. =SIU formation= In August 1937, William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, assumed control of the ISU with the goal of rebuilding it under the AFL. Lundeberg, who was also head of the Sailor's Union of the Pacific. On October 15, 1938, at an AFL convention in Houston, Texas, Green handed Lundeberg the Seafarer's International Union charter. The new union represented 7,000 members on the East and Gulf coasts. Seventy years later, SIU holds the charters to both NMU and SUP. The 1940s=World War II= As with the other military services, the entry of the United States into the Second World War necessitated the immediate growth of the merchant marine and the Coast Guard. The Maritime Commission spawned the War Shipping Administration in early February 1942. This new agency received a number of functions considered vital to the war effort, including maritime training. Several weeks after the creation of the new agency, however, the Maritime Service was transferred again to the Coast Guard. The transfer allowed the War Shipping Administration to concentrate on organizing American merchant shipping, building new ships, and carrying cargoes where they were needed most. The United States intended to meet this crisis with large numbers of mass-produced freighters and transports. When World War II loomed, the Maritime Commission began a crash shipbuilding program utilizing every available resource. The experienced shipyards built complicated vessels, such as warships. New shipyards, which opened almost overnight around the country, generally built less sophisticated ships such as the emergency construction \\"Liberty ships\\". By 1945 the shipyards had completed more than 2,700 \\"Liberty\\" ships and hundreds of \\"Victory ships\\", tankers and transports. AB's were in high demand during World War II. All of these new ships needed trained officers and crews to operate them. The Coast Guard provided much of the advanced training for merchant marine personnel to augment the training of state merchant marine academies. The Maritime Commission requested that the Coast Guard provide training in 1938 when the Maritime Service was created. Merchant sailors from around the country trained at two large training stations. On the East Coast the men trained at Fort Trumbull in New London, Connecticut, and Government Island in Alameda, California served the West Coast. In 1940 Hoffman Island in New York Harbor became the third training station for the service. After the start of the war other training stations were added in Boston, Port Hueneme, California, and St. Petersburg, Florida. Training ships manned by the Coast Guard included the Maritime Commission steamships American Seaman, American Mariner, and American Sailor. One of these ships, the 7,000-gross-ton American Seaman, carried 250 trainees in addition to the regular crew of 18 officers and 100 enlisted men. Four complete machine shops, various lifeboats and up-to-date navigational equipment comprised the special educational equipment. In addition the Coast Guard manned the full-rigged sail training ships Tusitala and Joseph Conrad, as well as the auxiliary schooner Vema. The Tusitala was built in Greenock, Scotland in 1883 and operated in merchant service before becoming a receiving ship in St. Petersburg in 1940. The Joseph Conrad sailed from Jacksonville, Florida to train apprentice seamen. The training ships were important commands. These steamships were the largest ships manned by the service prior to the Coast Guard joining the Navy in World War II. CDR Alfred C. Richmond, who commanded the American Sailor, the first Maritime Service training ship, later became Commandant of the Coast Guard. Licensed and unlicensed merchant marine personnel enrolled in the service. The ranks, grades, and ratings for the Maritime Service were based on those of the Coast Guard. Training for experienced personnel lasted three months; while inexperienced personnel trained for six months. Pay was based on the person's highest certified position in merchant service. New students received cadet wages. American citizens at least 19 years old, with one year of service on American merchant vessels of more than 500 gross tons, were eligible for enrollment. Coast Guard training of merchant mariners was vital to winning the war. Thousands of the sailors who manned the new American merchant fleet trained under the watchful eyes of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard only continued the administration of the Maritime Service for ten months after the United States entered the war. Merchant marine training and most aspects of merchant marine activity transferred to the newly created War Shipping Administration on September 1, 1942. The transfer allowed the Coast Guard to take a more active role in the war and concentrated government administration of the merchant marine in one agency. However, just as the transfer removed the merchant marine training role from the Coast Guard, the service assumed the role of licensing seamen and inspecting merchant vessels. The Atlantic Ocean was a major strategic battle zone during World War II (Battle of the Atlantic) and when Germany declared war on the US, the East Coast offered easy pickings for German U-Boats (referred to as the Second happy time). After a highly successful foray by five Type IX long-range U-boats, the offensive was maximized by the use of short-range Type VII U-boats, with increased fuel stores, replenished from supply U-boats or \\"Milchkuh\\". In February to May 1942, 348 ships were sunk, for the loss of 2 U-boats during April and May. U.S. naval commanders were reluctant to introduce the convoy system that had protected trans- Atlantic shipping and, without coastal blackouts, shipping was silhouetted against the bright lights of American towns and cities. Several ships were torpedoed within sight of East Coast cities such as New York and Boston; indeed, some civilians sat on beaches and watched battles between U.S. and German ships. MS Pennsylvania Sun torpedoed in 1942 (was saved and returned to service in 1943). Once convoys and air cover were introduced, sinking numbers were reduced and the U-boats shifted to attack shipping in the Gulf of Mexico, with 121 losses in June. In one instance, the tanker Virginia was torpedoed in the mouth of the Mississippi River by the on May 12, 1942, killing 26 crewmen. There were 14 survivors. Again, when defensive measures were introduced, ship sinkings decreased and U-boat sinkings increased. The cumulative effect of this campaign was severe; a quarter of all wartime sinkings--3.1 million tons. There were several reasons for this. The naval commander, Admiral Ernest King, was averse to taking British recommendations to introduce convoys, U.S. Coast Guard and Navy patrols were predictable and could be avoided by U-boats, poor inter-service co-operation, and the U.S. Navy did not possess enough suitable escort vessels (British and Canadian warships were transferred to the U.S. east coast). In 2017, Sadie O. Horton, who spent World War II working aboard a coastwise U.S. Merchant Marine barge, posthumously received official veteran's status for her wartime service, becoming the first recorded female Merchant Marine veteran of World War II. =Wartime issues= During the Second World War, the merchant service sailed and took orders from naval officers. Some were uniformed, and some were trained to use a gun. However, they were formally considered volunteers and not members of the military. Walter Winchell, the famous newspaper columnist and radio commentator, and columnist Westbrook Pegler both described the National Maritime Union and the merchant seamen generally as draft dodgers, criminals, riffraff, Communists, and other derogatory names. It came to a head in the middle of the war with the writing of a column in the New York World-Telegram by Pegler, who alleged that merchant seamen refused to work on Sundays per union rules, causing sick USMC servicemen to unload their own supplies in an incident off Guadalcanal. He went on to say that these seamen received \\"fabulous pay for sailors, including overtime bonuses, whereas the navy men draw only the modest pay for their ratings without extras.\\" This was a specific allegation, and in February 1943, the National Maritime Union, representing seven other unions, filed suit for libel against Hearst Newspapers, publisher of the newspaper, and the Associated Press for its wide dissemination of what was claimed to be an untrue story. As part of their suit, they pointed out that Government allotments for families, low-rate premiums on insurance, hospitalization, dental care, pension, and civil service rating consideration tend to balance the pay of ordinary seamen in civilian service. But they denied the incident ever took place, and were backed by a report of Admiral William F. Halsey, commander of United States forces in the South Pacific, to the Navy Department in which Halsey praised the \\"co-operation, efficiency and courage\\" of the merchant seamen and asserted that \\"In no instance have merchant marine seamen refused to discharge cargo from their vessels or in any other way failed to co-operate with the United States forces ashore in that (South Pacific) area.\\" They won their suit, but the residual effect would last for decades. What was ignored, say the Seafarers' International Union, was the fact that seamen are paid by the ship owner for their work, consequently they were paid only while the ships were in the water. A seaman torpedoed off his ship was off the payroll the minute he was injured, landed in a lifeboat or hit the water. Surviving seamen had to beg, borrow, plead or work their way back to the United States from places such as Murmansk, Russia, so they could be reassigned to another ship. Until that happened, they weren't paid. And in addition they would be drafted if they didn't find another ship within 30 days. Their wartime record reveals that their losses were among the highest of any group in the front lines. They died at a rate of 1 in 24. All told, 733 American cargo ships were lostFlag and 8,651 of the 215,000 who served perished on troubled waters and off enemy shores. Allied tanker Dixie Arrow after she was torpedoed in the Atlantic Ocean by a German U-boat. The biggest supporter of the merchant men was President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It was he who in 1936 urged the United States Congress to pass the Merchant Marine Act, which established a 10-year program for building ships that would be used for commerce during peacetime and would be converted for use by the Navy during times of war or national emergency; and a training program for seamen that linked them to the military in wartime, specifically the Navy. It was this legislation that enabled the country to take on the Axis powers a few years later, but not before extensive losses on the East coast, which was crawling with German submarines by the end of 1941. That year the Germans sank 1,232 Allied and neutral ships worldwide, including those manned by the Merchant Marine, and the following year was even worse. The Allies would lose 1,323 ships, while Germany's submarine losses totaled just 87. More than 1,000 merchant seamen would die within sight of the East Coast, and it wasn't uncommon for inhabitants of the seashore to find their bodies washed up on the sand. Roosevelt, while the war was under way, proclaimed \\"Mariners have written one of its most brilliant chapters. They have delivered the goods when and where needed in every theater of operations and across every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult and dangerous job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will be greater public understanding of our merchant's fleet record during this war.\\" But it wasn't to be, for with Roosevelt's death in 1945, the Merchant Marine lost its staunchest supporter and any chance to share in the accolades afforded others who served. The War Department, the same government branch that recruited them, opposed the Seaman's Bill of Rights in 1947 (see below) and managed to kill the legislation in congressional committee, effectively ending any chance for seamen to reap the thanks of a nation. For 43 years, the U.S. government denied them benefits ranging from housing to health care until Congress awarded them veterans' status in 1988, too late for 125,000 mariners, roughly half of those who had served. Today there are shrine and memorial reminders of mariners' heroism such as The American Merchant Marine Veterans Memorial in San Pedro, California, and the American Merchant Mariners' Memorial at Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. The old Navy-Marine Memorial in Washington, D.C. honors those who died during World War I. Since the First World War and World War II, many Merchant Marine officers have also held commissions in the United States Naval Reserve. Graduates of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy are commissioned into the USNR by default if they do not choose to be commissioned in another service of the armed forces. A special badge, known as the Naval Reserve Merchant Marine Badge, has existed since the early 1940s to recognize such Merchant Marine personnel who are called to active duty in the Navy. World War II USMM were eligible for the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal, Merchant Marine Mariner's Medal, Merchant Marine Combat Bar, Merchant Marine Atlantic War Zone Bar, Merchant Marine Mediterranean-Middle East War Zone Bar, and Merchant Marine Pacific War Zone Bar. In 1946, a Merchant Marine World War II Victory Medal was established. In the late 1940s, the Liberian open registry was formed as the brainchild of Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II.DeSombre 2006, p. 74. Stettinius created a corporate structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint- venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when the Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations. On 11 March 1949, Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos registered the first ship under the Liberian flag of convenience, the World Peace. When Stettinius died in 1950, ownership of the registry passed to the International Bank of Washington, led by General George Olmsted.Pike, 2008. Within 18 years, Liberia grew to surpass the United Kingdom as the world's largest register. The 1950s Paul Hall ordered the creation of AMO. The U.S. Maritime Commission was abolished on 24 May 1950, its functions were split between the U.S. Federal Maritime Board which was responsible for regulating shipping and awarding subsidies for construction and operation of merchant vessels, and Maritime Administration, which was responsible for administering subsidy programs, maintaining the national defense reserve merchant fleet, and operating the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. AMO was chartered on May 12, 1949, as the Brotherhood of Marine Engineers by Paul Hall as an affiliate of the Seafarer's International Union of North America. The original membership consisted entirely of civilian seafaring veterans of World War II. =Korean War= Merchant ship carrying mail from the United States to combat troops in war zone, ties up at a port in Korea. During Korean War.On March 13, 1951, the Secretary of Commerce established the National Shipping Authority (NSA) to provide ships from the Maritime Administration's (MARAD) National Defense Fleet (NDRF). These ships would meet the needs of the military services and other agencies of government beyond the capabilities of the privately owned vessels of the U.S.-flag Merchant Marine. During times of war, the NSA also requisitioned privately owned merchant ships and made them available for military purposes. Immediately after its establishment, the NSA reactivated vessels to meet the urgent needs of America's European allies to help transport coal and other bulk materials to rebuild their defenses. During the Korean War there were few severe sealift problems other than the need to re- mobilize forces following post–World War II demobilization. About 700 ships were activated from the NDRF for services to the Far East. In addition, a worldwide tonnage shortfall between 1951 and 1953 required the reactivation of over 600 ships to lift coal to Northern Europe and grain to India during the first years of the Cold War. The commercial merchant marine formed the backbone of the bridge of ships across the Pacific. From just six ships under charter when the war began, this total peaked at 255. According to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS), 85 percent of the dry cargo requirements during the Korean War were met through commercial vessels — only five percent were shipped by air. More than $475 million, or 75 percent of the MSTS operating budget for calendar year 1952, was paid directly to commercial shipping interests. In addition to the ships assigned directly to MSTS, 130 laid-up Victory ships in the NDRF were broken out by the Maritime Administration and assigned under time-charters to private shipping firms for charter to MSTS. Ships of the MSTS not only provided supplies but also served as naval auxiliaries. When the U.S. Army's X Corps went ashore at Inchon in September 1950, 13 USNS cargo ships, 26 chartered American, and 34 Japanese- manned merchant ships, under the operational control of MSTS, participated in the invasion. Sealift responsibilities were accomplished on short notice during the Korean War. Initially American troops lacked the vital equipment to fight the North Koreans, but military and commercial vessels quickly began delivering the fighting tools needed to turn back the enemy. According to the MSTS, 7 tons of supplies were needed for every Marine or soldier bound for Korea and an additional one for each month thereafter. Cargo ships unloaded supplies around the clock, making Pusan a bustling port. The success of the U.S. Merchant Marine during this crisis hammered home to critics the importance of maritime preparedness and the folly of efforts to scuttle the Merchant Marine fleet. In addition to delivering equipment to American forces — more than 90 percent of all American and other United Nations’ troops — supplies and equipment were delivered to Korea through the MSTS with the assistance of commercial cargo vessels. A bridge of ships, much like in World War II, spanned the Pacific Ocean during the three years of hostilities. Merchant ships played an important role in the evacuation of United Nations troops from Hungnam, following the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. The Merchant Marine and Navy evacuated over 100,000 U.N. troops and another 91,000 Korean refugees and moved 350,000 tons of cargo and 17,500 vehicles in less than two weeks. One of the most famous rescues was performed by the U.S. merchant ship SS Meredith Victory. Only hours before the advancing communists drove the U.N. forces from North Korea in December 1950, the vessel, built to accommodate 12 passengers, carried more than 14,000 Korean civilians from Hungnam to Pusan in the south. First mate D. S. Savastio, with nothing but first aid training, delivered five babies during the three-day passage to Pusan. Ten years later, the Maritime Administration honored the crew by awarding them a Gallant Ship Award. Privately owned American merchant ships helped deploy thousands of U.S. troops and their equipment, bringing high praise from the commander of U.S. Naval Forces in the Far East, Admiral Charles T. Joy. In congratulating Navy Captain A.F. Junker, Commander of the Military Sea Transportation Service for the western Pacific, Admiral Joy noted that the success of the Korean campaign was dependent on the Merchant Marine. He said, \\"The Merchant Mariners in your command performed silently, but their accomplishments speak loudly. Such teammates are comforting to work with.\\" Government owned merchant vessels from the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) have supported emergency shipping requirements in seven wars and crises. During the Korean War, 540 vessels were activated to support military forces. From 1955 through 1964, another 600 ships were used to store grain for the Department of Agriculture. Another tonnage shortfall following the Suez Canal closing in 1956 caused 223 cargo ship and 29 tanker activations from the NDRF. =1953–1960= In 1953 at the Sixth Biennial Convention of the SIUNA the BME gained autonomy, which would allow it to adopt its first constitution and elect officers for the first time. The first constitution was drafted by Edward Reisman, Rudolph Wunsch, James Wilde, Everett Landers, Peter Geipi, and William Lovvorn, who \\"wanted to craft a document that would provide for free and fair elections, set the terms of office for official positions, specify the duties of union officials, provide for charges, trials, and appeals, permit rank and file membership inspection of the union's financial records, and permit amendments by rank and file vote.\\" The constitution, allowing for the election of a president, two vice-presidents, and a secretary-treasurer, was adopted with 96 percent of the membership voting to adopt it. Wilbur Dickey was elected first president on December 15, 1953. In September 1954, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) recognized the fledgling union, by granting it \\"exclusive jurisdiction within the federation over 'licensed engine room personnel on self-propelled vessels.'\\" The BME Welfare Plan was growing at an impressive rate under the care of Director of Welfare and Special Services Ray McKay. In August 1954, he reported its assets to be in excess of $100,000. The plan offered a number of progressive benefits, such as full surgery coverage for members and their families, and full coverage for seeing a physician. In February 1955, the union began pursuing the \\"first pension plan ever for U.S. merchant marine officers,\\" which was well underway by November 1955. In 1955, Joseph Curran was named a Vice-President of the AFL-CIO. Due to pressures from the Second Red Scare after World War II the AFL and CIO merged into the AFL- CIO in 1955 under the leadership of John L. Lewis. In 1957, Wilbur Dickey resigned the union's presidency and Ray McKay took the position on January 17, 1957. Later that year, on October 29, 1957, McKay and then-president of the Marine Engineers Beneficial Association H.L. Daggett signed an accord leading BME to merge with several MEBA locals. The newly formed entity was known as MEBA's Great Lakes District Local 101. On 28 January 1957, Harry Lundeberg died. Shortly after, Paul Hall became president of Seafarer's International Union. That year, Raymond McKay became president of American Maritime Officers, which left SIU, and joined MEBA. Also that year, Michael Sacco joined Seafarer's International Union. =The late 20th century=1960s In 1960, after an internal reorganization of MEBA, American Maritime Officers became known as \\"District 2 MEBA.\\" In 1961, the Federal Maritime Board regulatory functions were assumed by the newly created Federal Maritime Commission, while the subsidy functions were assigned to the Maritime Subsidy Board of the Maritime Administration. During the Berlin crisis of 1961, 18 National Defense Reserve Fleet vessels were activated, which remained in service until 1970. The Vietnam War required the activation of 172 NDRF vessels. Vietnam War Aerial photograph during the boarding SS Mayagüez, note Cambodian gunboats alongside the ship. During the Vietnam War, ships crewed by civilian seamen carried 95 percent of the supplies used by our Armed Forces. Many of these ships sailed into combat zones under fire. In fact, the SS Mayaguez incident involved the capture of mariners from the American merchant ship SS Mayaguez.National Maritime Day, 2002 The crisis began on May 12, 1975, when Khmer Rouge naval forces operating former U.S. Navy \\"Swift Boats\\" seized the American container ship SS Mayagüez in recognized international sea lanes claimed as territorial waters by Cambodia and removed its crew for questioning. Surveillance by P-3 Orion aircraft indicated that the ship was then moved to and anchored at Koh Tang, an island approximately off the southern coast of Cambodia near that country's shared border with Vietnam. Tragically, the ship's crew whose seizure had prompted the US attack had been released in good health, unknown to the US Marines or the US command of the operation, before the Marines attacked. The incident marked the last official battle of the United States involvement in the Vietnam War. The 1970s In 1970, the Merchant Marine Act authorized a subsidized shipbuilding program. On March 5, 1973 Joseph Curran resigned as the president of NMU, he was succeeded by Shannon J. Wall. In 1976, the first woman was admitted to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Since 1977, the Ready Reserve Fleet has taken over the brunt of the work previously handled by the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The RRF made a major contribution to the success of Operation Desert Shield/Operation Desert Storm from August 1990 through June 1992, when 79 vessels were activated to meet military sealift requirements by carrying 25% of the unit equipment and 45% of the ammunition needed. The 1980s In 1981, the Maritime Administration came under control of the U.S. Department of Transportation. In 1988, Frank Drozak died, Michael Sacco replaced him as president of Seafarer's International Union. The 1990s In 1992, while functioning as an autonomous union within MEBA, \\"District 2\\" reverted to its original name of \\"American Maritime Officers.\\" In 1993, Raymond T. McKay died, his son Michael McKay replaced him as American Maritime Officers president. AMO finally withdrew from MEBA in 1994 and resultingly lost its AFL-CIO affiliation This was restored after approximately a decade, on March 12, 2004, when Michael Sacco presented AMO with a charter from SIUNA. Two RRF tankers, two RO/RO ships and a troop transport ship were needed in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope in 1993 and 1994. During the Haitian crisis in 1994, 15 ships were activated for Operation Uphold Democracy operations. In 1995 and 1996, four RO/RO ships were used to deliver military cargo as part of U.S. and U.K. support to NATO peace-keeping missions. Four RRF ships were activated to provide humanitarian assistance for Central America following Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Three RRF ships currently support the Afloat Prepositioning Force with two specialized tankers and one dry cargo vessel capable of underway replenishment for the Navy's Combat Logistics Force. =The 2000s= On October 22, 2001, the Merchant Marine Act of 2001 was enacted, providing for the construction of 300 ships in a span of ten years. In 2003, 40 RRF ships were used in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. This RRF contribution was significant and included sealifting equipment and supplies into the theatre of combat operations, which included combat support equipment for the Army, Navy Combat Logistics Force, and USMC Aviation Support equipment. By the beginning of May 2005, RRF cumulative support included 85 ship activations that logged almost 12,000 ship operating days, moving almost 25% of the equipment needed to support the U.S. Armed Forces liberation of Iraq. MSC is also involved in the current Iraq War, having delivered 61 million square feet (5.7 km²) of cargo and 1.1 billion US gallons (4,200,000 m³) of fuel by the end of the first year alone. Merchant mariners are being recognized for their contributions in Iraq. For example, in late 2003, Vice Adm. David Brewer III, commander of Military Sealift Command, awarded the officers and crewmembers of the Merchant Marine Expeditionary Medal. On January 8, 2007, Tom Bethel was appointed by the AMO national executive committee to fulfil the term of former president Michael McKay. The RRF was called upon to provide humanitarian assistance to gulf coast areas following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita landfalls in August and September, respectively, of 2005. The Federal Emergency Management Agency requested a total of eight vessels to support relief efforts. Messing and berthing was provided for refinery workers, oils spill response teams, longshoremen. One of the vessels provided electrical power.

Paul's Kinetoscopes, featuring the end of the 29 May 1895 Epsom Derby viewed from a raised position close to the finishing line with the main stand in the distance. A photograph of Acres filming the movie has survived, which shows that the camera used in the production was relatively portable. The film was long considered lost but footage discovered in the Ray Henville collection in 1995 has been identified by the BFI as being from this film. Synopsis A stationary camera looks diagonally across a racetrack toward the infield showing the horses as they pass. Once the horses have passed the camera it is clear that the race has come to an end and there is a close finish between three horses. Once the race is over police officers run onto the field. The camera also displays various members of the audience moving around. Current status Often muddled with the 1896 Derby, shot by Robert Paul, the 1895 film is now freely available to viewers in the UK in a digital restoration on the BFI Player. New research has revealed that the Acres and Paul films, including this one, were shot far slower than the forty frames per second required by the Kinetoscope. They were actually filmed at around sixteen frames per second, which would later be established as the standard speed in the silent era.

When the pressure or vacuum is released, the bellows will return to its original shape, provided the material has not been stressed past its yield strength. They are used both for their ability to deform under pressure and to provide a hermetic seal that allows movement. Precision bellows technology of the 20th and 21st century is centered on metal bellows. Less demanding applications utilize rubber and plastic bellows. These products bear little resemblance to the original leather bellows used traditionally in fireplaces and forges. Types deep drawn tubes for bellows Metal bellows There are three main types of metal bellows: formed, welded and electroformed. Formed bellows are produced by reworking tubes, normally produced by deep drawing, with a variety of processes, including cold forming (rolling), and hydroforming. They are also called convoluted bellows or sylphons. Welded bellows (also called edge- welded, or diaphragm bellows) are manufactured by welding a number of individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two bellows types generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high tooling cost, but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial tooling cost and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.Edge Welded Metal Bellows, Bellowstech Electroformed bellows are produced by plating (electroforming) a metal layer onto a model (mandrel), and subsequently removing the mandrel. They can be produced with modest tooling costs and with thin walls (25 micrometres or less), providing such bellows with high sensitivity and precision in many exacting applications, and may also be produced in shapes that would be exceptionally difficult to produce by other means with little additional difficulty.Precision Metal Bellows, NiCoForm Another area of comparison is in metals of construction. Hydroformed and rolled bellows are limited to metals with high plastic elongation characteristics, whereas welded bellows may be fabricated from a wider variety of standard and exotic alloys, such as stainless steel and titanium, as well as other high-strength, corrosion-resistant materials. Electroformed bellows can be produced of nickel, its high-strength alloys, and copper. Applications Metal bellows are used in a large number of industrial applications. Below you will find a few; * Load cells; A load cell deforms if a certain load in the form of a pressure or a strain is imposed on it. This deformation is then detected by a strain gauge through which a low voltage direct current is flowing. The change in voltage is detected and made visible on a control panel. A bellows is mounted over the gauge to protect it from outside influences. * Vacuum interrupters; For the switching of very high voltages in transformer stations a high vacuum, or high pressure dielectric gas must be maintained around the contacts while in service to mitigate arc formation which would damage the contacts and may prevent safe circuit breaking. Here the bellows allow the contacts to move in and out while maintaining a reliable gas-tight seal. * Mechanical seals; These are mostly used to close the inside of a pump from the outside world to prevent leakage. For that purpose, a mechanical seal is mounted on the pump shaft. As the pump shaft is turning, there has to be a sealing element consisting of a stationary and a rotating ring. To enforce sufficient pressure on the two rings one is fitted with a spring, the bellows allows the free movement of the spring without leakage. The bellows may be constructed such that it also functions as the spring. * Pressure gauges: If the pressure of aggressive fluids or gases has to be measured, the gauge has to be isolated from the flow. For critical applications, a diaphragm sealing is used instead of a bourdon tube in the gauge. This gives more security than aggressive media will not leak. The diaphragm is a self-contained sensor, transmitting the displacement to the measuring device. * Sensors: In this application diaphragm or convoluted bellows are completely sealed and filled with a certain gas. Two electrical poles are penetrating the inside of the bellows. By varying the current of those two poles the temperature inside the bellows can be regulated. The expansion or contraction of the bellows is used as an actuator to control a certain movement. * Valve sealing: A bellows is used between the housing and the valve stem to seal the inside completely from the outside world. In Europe, this is of particular importance as regulations such as TA Luft prohibit any leakage. * Couplings for stepper motors and servomotors: The flexible part, capable of compensating for misalignment is made by a bellows. It ensures that there is no angular positioning difference between the two coupling halves. This is essential if the positioning accuracy should be extremely precise. * Exhaust bellows: Running engines cause self vibration. To compensate for those movements and temperature differences resulting in thermal expansion, bellows are used to connect the exhaust gas pipes to the funnel. * Piping expansion joint: In this application, a short section of bellows is connected between pipes to absorb thermal movement and vibration, typical in high-vacuum, high-temperature, cryogenic, or high purity systems, and factory-sealed systems that must not allow any gas leakage to or from the interior for a lengthy service life. * Metal bellows are also used in other products and market segments, including medical applications like implantable drug pumps, to industrial actuators, to aerospace applications such as altitude sensors and fluid management devices (accumulators, surge arresters, volume compensators, and fluid storage). Metal bellows are also found in space applications, providing reservoirs with potable water as well as accumulators to collect wastewater. Manufacture Welded bellows can be fabricated from a variety of exotic metals and alloys, whereas formed bellows are limited to alloys with good elongation – brass being a prime example. Welded bellows are not fabricated from brass because of its fundamentally poor weldability. Other advantages to welded bellows include compactness (higher performance in a smaller package), ability to be compressed to solid height with no damage, resistance to nicks and dents, and dramatically greater flexibility. The welding of metal bellows is a microscopic welding process, typically performed under laboratory conditions at high magnification. Hydroformed bellows are produced by forcing a metal tube to expand under hydraulic pressure inside a bellows-shaped mold, and assume the convoluted shape of the mold. Electroformed bellows are produced by plating metal onto a bellows-shaped model (mandrel), and the subsequent mandrel removal by chemical or physical means. Due to the low tooling cost and short manufacturing cycle, electroforming of bellows is not only an inexpensive manufacturing method, but also a perfect prototyping tool. Deflections There are a variety of expansion joints and not each one can accept the same types of deflection. The various types of deflections are axial, lateral, angular, torsional, cyclic, or any combination that can occur at the same time.Types of metallic Bellows Deflections U.S. Bellows, (retrieved March 2012) References Category:Manufactured goods Category:Mechanics Category:Metallic objects ","title":"Metal bellows"},{"id":"10375928","text":"The Rajiv Gandhi Memorial is a memorial to Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi at the site where he was assassinated at Sriperumbudur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu India.

Over 300 matches involving \\"England\\" or \\"All England\\" prior to 1877 are known. However these teams were usually put together on an ad hoc basis and were rarely fully representative.Scorecards available on Cricketarchive. The history of the current England side can be traced to 1877 when England played in what was subsequently recognised as the very first Test match. Since then, up to 20 August 2006 they have played 852 Test matches, winning 298, losing 245 and drawing 309. During these 852 matches, they have been captained by 77 different players. Early history The term \\"All-England\\" was first used in reports of two Kent v All-England matches in July 1739. The first match was at Bromley Common in Kent on Monday 9 July 1739. It was billed as between \\"eleven gentlemen of that county (i.e., Kent) and eleven gentlemen from any part of England, exclusive of Kent\\". Kent, described as \\"the Unconquerable County\\" won by \\"a very few notches\\". The second match was at the Artillery Ground in Bunhill Fields, Finsbury on Monday 23 July 1739. This game was drawn and a report includes the phrase \\"eleven picked out of all England\\". In subsequent decades there were many more such matches between a side representing a county, or the MCC, and a side drawn from the rest of England and described as \\"England\\" or \\"All England\\". As the next section describes, in 1846 the term \\"All England Eleven\\" would acquire a new, more precise, definition. The All-England XI In 1846 William Clarke formed the All- England Eleven as a touring team of leading players to play matches at big city venues, mainly in the North of England. Clarke's team was a top-class side worthy of its title. The AEE lasted until 1880. In 1852, several players set up the United All-England Eleven as a rival to the AEE, and from 1857 to 1866 the annual match between these two teams was arguably the most important contest of the English season – certainly judged by the quality of the players. Early tours The team that toured Australia in 1861. The 1873/4 team. The early overseas tours were organised as purely commercial ventures, as indeed were the first Test-playing tours. The first such tour was to North America by a team of English professionals, departing England in September 1859. The team comprised six players from the All-England Eleven and six from the United All-England Eleven, and was captained by George Parr. They played five matches, winning them all. There were no first-class fixtures. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, attention turned to Australia. The inaugural tour of the country took place in 1861-2, and was organised by Messrs Spiers & Pond. Led by HH Stephenson, the English team played 12 matches, but none were first-class. In 1863–4, the Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by an English team under the captaincy of George Parr, which also visited New Zealand. The team played 16 matches, but none were first- class. There were further tours of North America (taking in both the US and Canada) in late 1868, led by Edgar Willsher, and in late 1872, under R.A. Fitzgerald. The latter side included W.G.Grace. In 1873–4, the Melbourne Cricket Club organised a tour by a team under the captaincy of WG Grace, which played 15 matches, but none were first-class. Most of the matches of these early touring teams were played \\"against odds\\", that is to say the opposing team was permitted to have more than eleven players (usually twenty-two) in order to make a more even contest. 1877 to 1890 James Lillywhite, a professional with Sussex CCC, led a team which had sailed on the P&O; steamship Poonah on 21 September 1876. They played in Australia and then New Zealand before returning to Australia to play a combined Australian XI, for once on even terms of XI a side. The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, came to be regarded as the first Test match, although none of its participants could have guessed at its significance at the time. Charles Bannerman, of Australia, faced the first ball and scored the first century, a glorious 165 before retiring hurt with a broken finger. The next highest score in this inaugural Test for Australia was Tom Horan with 10. Alfred Shaw of England bowled the first ball and took 5 for 38 in Australia's second innings. Tom Kendall, born in England, took 7 English wickets for 55 to bring Australia victory by 45 runs. 100 years later, in the Centenary Test, the result and margin would be exactly the same. England won a second match to square the series. In 1878/79 Kent captain and MCC luminary Lord Harris took a team, consisting mainly of amateurs, to Australia where they lost by 10 wickets at Melbourne. Their batting was reasonably strong but the lack of professional bowlers cost them dear. The tour became famous for an unseemly incident in a tour game at Sydney where a near riot broke out. One of the umpires was Edmund Barton, who became Australia's first prime minister. The 1880 Australian tourists were the first to play a Test match on English soil. Their 'demon' bowler, Fred Spofforth, sustained a hand injury and, crucially, missed the game in which W.G. Grace scored 152 and Billy Murdoch one run better. Lord Harris led the victorious England side at the Oval. An all professional side, organised by Shaw, Shrewsbury and Lillywhite sailed to Australia for the 1881/82 campaign. The tour was bedeviled with scandal and allegations of fisticuffs, betting and heavy drinking. Tom Garrett took 18 wickets in the three Tests played for Australia. Many of the tour matches were still against local '22's. Australia won the four Test series 2 – 0. The developing rivalry took on a new turn in 1882, when England lost at home at The Oval in the solitary Test of the summer. Spofforth took 7 for 46 and 7 for 44 and Ted Peate, Yorkshire slow left armer who had taken 8 wickets, was out just 8 runs short of victory. Upset at this turn of events, The Sporting Times printed an obituary to English cricket: \\"In Affectionate Remembrance of ENGLISH CRICKET, which died at the Oval on 29th AUGUST 1882, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. N.B. – The body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia.\\" When England toured Australia the following winter of 1882/83 and won 2–1, the England captain, the Hon. Ivo Bligh was presented with an urn that contained some ashes, which have variously been said to be of a bail, ball or even a woman's veil. And so The Ashes series was born. Yorkshire stalwart Billy Bates, who played all his 15 Tests on 5 tours to Australia, scored 55 and took 14 for 102 at Melbourne in the second Test, including the first Test hat-trick, to bring England the first innings victory in Test cricket. A.G. Steel made 135* at Sydney – although he did drop Bonner 4 times (out of 8 drops in total) as the giant Australian hitter scored 87. England won 1–0 in the three Test series in 1884. Peate took 6 for 85 in Australia's first innings, and Ulyett 7 for 36, the second as England won by an innings Lord's where Steel made a wonderful 148 out of England's first innings of 379. Australia's captain Billy Murdoch scored the first Test double hundred at the Oval where Walter Read of England hit a century in 113 minutes after going in at number 10. All 11 Englishmen bowled in Australia's innings, including wicket keeper Lyttelton with underarm lobs. England embarked on a long stretch of dominance. They won 14 and lost only 3 of the Tests played between 1884 and 1890. Billy Barnes hit 134 in the opening Adelaide Test of the five Test 1884/85 series while Johnny Briggs of Lancashire hit a two-hour ton at Melbourne in the second, where Australia fielded a completely new team of 11 different players after a dispute over gate money. Wilfred Flowers scored 56 and took 5 for 46 in the third Test at Sydney where Australia pulled back a game thanks to Bonner smashing a century in even time. England won the deciding fifth Test by an innings at Melbourne, Arthur Shrewsbury making 105*. W. G. Grace scored 170 in the Oval Test of 1886, beating the individual Test innings record of 164 set by Arthur Shrewsbury in the previous match on an evil pitch at Lords. England won by an innings on the third day after Australia were bowled out for 68 and 149m with George Lohmann of Surrey taking 12 for 104. The Australian tourists, without Bannerman or Murdoch and often losing Spofforth to injuries, lost all three Tests. Shrewsbury's England beat Australia in both matches on the 1886–87 tour, despite being bowled out for 45 on the first day at Sydney. Two England parties toured there in 1887–88, with Shaw and Shrewsbury's team sponsored by Melbourne CC and Lord Harris's team by the Sydney Association. The two sides joined up for one Test Match at Sydney which they won thanks to Lohmann's 9 wickets and Bobby Peel's 10. Australia made just 42 and 82 on a poor pitch in bad light. The 1888 Australians won at Lords but lost at The Oval and Old Trafford. Their bowling was penetrative, particularly Jack Ferris and the 'terror' Charlie Turner, but their batting was too weak to withstand the English professionals in their home conditions. Bobby Peel took 11 wickets at Old Trafford. England won the first Test in South Africa, at Port Elizabeth in March 1889 by 8 wickets, despite fielding a less than first choice XI. W.H. Ashley took 7 for 95 for South Africa in his only Test. Bobby Abel of Surrey scored 120 for England in the Second Test, the first hundred scored in South Africa. Bernard Tancred of South Africa became the first Test batsman to carry his bat, for 26*, as South Africa collapsed to 47 all out. M.P. Bowden remains the youngest man to captain England, at just 23 years and 144 days. Johnny Briggs took 7 for 17 and 8 for 11 at Cape Town, 14 bowled and 1 LBW. 1890s Four ball overs gave way to five ball overs in the 1890s and to six ball overs in Australia, as the game continued to develop quickly. England won the 1890 Ashes series 2–0, although Jack Barrett carried his bat for 67 through Australia's second innings of 176 at Lord's. W. G. Grace was out second ball in the first innings but saw England home in the second with 75*. Frederick Martin took 12 Australian wickets for 102 but 'Nutty' never played an Ashes match again. The third scheduled match, at Old Trafford, was the first Test to be abandoned without a ball being bowled. W. G. Grace's tourists lost 2–1 on the 1891–92 tour, Australia winning at Melbourne and Sydney, where Bannerman batted for seven and a half hours and scored only three boundaries and England's Bobby Abel carried his bat for 132. England claimed a consolation innings victory at Adelaide where Stoddard scored 134 and Peel 83 and Briggs took 6 wickets in each innings. England won the only Test on the 1891/92 tour of South Africa at Cape Town, where Harry Wood, the Surrey wicket keeper made 134 not out and Ferris, who had earlier played for Australia, took 13 for 91. Billy Murdoch was another Australian turned Englishman on the tour. England regained the Ashes in 1893, with an innings win at The Oval and draws in the other two Tests. W. G. Grace and A.E. Stoddart made three consecutive century opening stands. William Gunn of Nottinghamshire scored his only Test hundred, 102*, at Old Trafford, while Arthur Shrewsbury scored 106 at Lord's. Future England great Ranjitsinhji was one of the unfortunate bowlers as Australia set a new record team score of 843 against 'Oxford and Cambridge Past and Present' in Portsmouth. Andrew Stoddart led England to a thrilling 3–2 victory on the 1894–1895 Ashes tour. Bobby Peel took the final wickets in the first Test victory at Sydney and the second at Melbourne and hit the winning runs in the final and deciding Test at the MCG. England's amazing victory at Sydney, by 10 runs, came after they had followed on with Lancashire's Albert Ward hitting 75 and 117 in the game. J.T. Brown scored 140 for England at Melbourne where England were set 297 to win. He reached 50 in 28 minutes and put on a then record 210 with Ward as England won by six wickets. Tom Richardson took 32 wickets in the Tests. England won all three Tests of the 1895/96 tour of South Africa by resounding margins. Lohmann was unplayable, taking 7 for 38 and 8 for 7 at Port Elizabeth and finishing with a hat trick. He took 9 for 28 and 3 for 43 at Johannesburg and 7 for 42 and 1 for 45 at Cape Town. Having been overlooked for the first Test at Lord's, where Australian captain Harry Trott scored 143 and put on a record 210 with Syd Gregory (103), Shri Ranjitsinhji burst into Test cricket with 62 and 154 at Old Trafford in 1896. His magical batting and Tom Richardson's 13 for 244 were not enough to prevent Australia running out winners by 3 wickets however. Five English professionals went on 'strike' for more money before the Oval Test. Abel, Hayward and Richardson relented, but Gunn and Lohmann never played for England again. England won the series 2–1. The Ashes were lost on Andrew Stoddart's 1897/98 tour, with Australia thumping England 4–1. Australian Joe Darling was the first batsmen to make 500 runs in a Test series, including 101 at Sydney, 178 at Adelaide and 160 in the final Sydney Test, where his hundred came up in 91 minutes. Stoddart's mother died just before the first Test and he was too distraught to play in either of the first two matches. Ranji, batting at number 7 after a throat infection, scored a brilliant 175 in the first Test and took England over 500 for the first time in a game won by 9 wickets but the Englishmen lost the next four heavily. Lord Hawke's tourists in 1898/99 played and won two Tests in South Africa, with sometime Australian Albert Trott taking 17 wickets. Plum Warner carried his bat for 132 at Johannesburg in his maiden Test. The 1899 series against Australia saw two significant developments. For the first time in England, five Tests were played rather than three, with Trent Bridge and Headingley being added to the \\"traditional\\" venues of Lord's, The Oval and Old Trafford. Also MCC and the counties appointed a selection committee for the first time. It comprised three active players: Lord Hawke, W.G. Grace and H.W. Bainbridge who was the captain of Warwickshire. Prior to this, England teams for home Tests had been chosen by the club on whose ground the match was to be played. The peerless Australian Victor Trumper dominated the series. He scored 1,500 runs on the tour, including 300 not out against Sussex and a breathtaking century in Australia's sole, but deciding, Test victory at Lords. W.G. Grace played his last Test at Trent Bridge. F.S. Jackson and Tom Hayward put on 185 at the Oval for the first wicket. England, scoring 576, forced Australia (352) to follow on, but the Australians played out the draw and with it retained the Ashes. 1900–1914: The \\"Golden Age\\" The first Test series of the new century took place in Australia 1901–1902 and was won by Australia who came from one down to take the series 4–1. The England side was a private venture of Archie MacLaren (although the matches were all official Test matches). It was rather an attritional series of matches with only three centuries being scored and only one team innings over 400 (the first innings of England in the First Test at the SCG). Sydney Barnes made his debut for England and took 19 wickets in the first two Tests before being injured in the third and talking no further part in the series. There was a home series against Australia in 1902 which was won by the Australians (2–1). In the drawn First Test at Edgbaston Australia were dismissed for 36 in their first innings (Wilfred Rhodes 7 for 17) but rain meant that the match was drawn. Rain also ruined the following match at Lord's. Sydney Barnes returned to the England team and had immediate success, taking seven wickets in the third Test at Sheffield (the only Test ever to be played there). However England still lost the match. The final two Tests were amongst the most exciting of all time. A brilliant century by Trumper helped Australia to win the match at Old Trafford by three runs. England's batting throughout the series was modest with only one innings of over 300 and with only three centuries scored. The last of these was a match-winning innings in the final Test at The Oval by Gilbert Jessop, who went in at number seven in the second innings with England 48–5 and scored what was then the fastest century in Test cricket in 70 minutes, setting up an improbable England win by one wicket. The last wicket pair of Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst nervelessly acquired the final fifteen runs needed for victory. England toured Australia in 1903–1904, the first time that the MCC had been responsible for an England tour overseas. England regained The Ashes with a 3–2 series win under the captaincy of Plum Warner. In the first Test R.E.Foster made his Test debut and scored 287 in his first ever innings – the then highest ever Test score and a record that was to stand for a quarter of a century. Wilfred Rhodes took 15 wickets in England's second Test win at the MCG –a record that was to stand for thirty years. In the fifth Test England were dismissed for 61 in their first innings on a rain- affected pitch. In 1905 Australia toured England and were beaten 2–0 with three matches drawn. Notable batting performances in the series included centuries by A.C. MacLaren, F.S. Jackson (2), Johnny Tyldesley (2) and C.B. Fry. B.J.T. Bosanquet, the inventor of the googly, took eight wickets in an Innings in the First Test. In 1905–06 Plum Warner took an MCC team to South Africa for the first time and England were soundly beaten 4–1 in the series. England's batting faltered throughout the series with only one team innings in excess of 200 (successive innings of 184,190,148,160,295,196,198,160,187 and 130) and just one individual century (by F.L.Fane in the 3rd Test at the Wanderers). England's only win came at Newlands where the left-arm slow bowler Colin Blythe took eleven wickets in the match. In 1907 there was a home three match Test series against South Africa which England, captained by R.E.Foster, won 1–0. Highlights included another sparkling innings by Gilbert Jessop who scored 93 at Lord's in a partnership of 145 for the sixth wicket with Len Braund who scored a century. There was another fine bowling performance by Blythe, who took 15 wickets at Headingley on a rain-affected match in a match that England won despite having been bowled out for 76 in their first innings. In England's Test series in Australia in 1907–08 Australia won the first Test but England hit back well with a narrow win at the MCG in the 2nd Test in which Jack Hobbs made his England debut scoring 83 and 28. England were outplayed by Australia in the next three Tests and lost the series and the Ashes 4–1. England's batting was fragile throughout the series with only Gunn (2) and Hutchings scoring hundreds. The bowling relied on Jack Crawford), Arthur Fielder and Barnes, who took 79 wickets between them. In a home series against Australia in 1909 England lost 2–1 (two draws) and no combination of players (England used 25 in total in the series) seemed to work. England failed to make 200 in an innings five times and there was only one individual century (by J. Sharp in the 3rd Test). The remarkable Colin Blythe delivered England's only victory by taking eleven wickets in the First Test at Edgbaston, but thereafter Australia, whilst never dominating the England attack, always had the edge. England returned to South Africa in 1909–10 under H.D.G. Leveson-Gower, for a five match Test series and fared little better than on their first visit in 1905–06. The series was lost 3–2 but this disguises South Africa's superiority. The main highlight was Jack Hobbs first (of 15) Test century in the final Test at Newlands, he put on a then record 211 for the first wicket with Wilfred Rhodes. This was one of only two personal hundreds by England batsmen in the series. The bowling attack was weak – although the last of the great \\"lob\\" (underhand) bowlers George Simpson-Hayward had field days in the first three Test matches when he took a total of 21 wickets. Colin Blythe bowled England to a consolation win in the fifth Test with ten wickets in the match. Legspin dominated on the matting pitches, with the ball often bouncing chest high. Vogler took 29 wickets for the home side and Faulkner 29. England toured Australia in 1911/12 under Plum Warner, but Johnny Douglas took over the captaincy when Warner fell ill prior to the first Test. Despite losing that first match at Sydney, a side which boasted Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley, Sydney Barnes and Wilfred Rhodes hit back to take the next four Tests in style. Frank Foster and Barnes dominated with the ball, sharing 66 wickets, while Hobbs, Rhodes and Woolley recorded centuries. Hobbs and Rhodes shared opening stands of 147 at Adelaide and a then record 323 at Melbourne in the next Test where Barnes dismissed Bardsley, Kelleway, Hill and Armstrong for 3 runs in his opening spell. Later in the game, when the crowd barracked Barnes for deliberating over a field setting, he threw the ball down in disgust and refused to continue until order was restored. Frank Woolley also hit 305* in 205 minutes in a tour game against Tasmania. The 1912 home season saw a unique experiment with a 9 Test triangular tournament involving South Africa and Australia but it was an idea ahead of its time and was not repeated. C.B. Fry of Sussex captained the team against Syd Gregory of Australia and Frank Mitchell of South Africa. Jack Hobbs scored 107 against Australia at Lords in a rain ruined game. The Australia v South Africa match, at Lord's, was notable for a visit by King George V, the first time a reigning monarch had watched Test cricket. Barnes took 34 wickets in his 3 Tests against the South Africans. England's 1913/14 tour of South Africa was the last before the onset of World War I, and England dominated the rubber, winning 4–0. Syd Barnes was once again unplayable, taking 49 wickets in four Tests before boycotting the last in a row over his wife's accommodation. Only Herbie Taylor resisted for the home side, with skilful backfoot defence on the matting pitches, scoring 508 runs at 50.8. 1920s England resumed their Test cricket after World War I with a tour of Australia in 1920/21 under Johnny Douglas. After the ravages of the war it was little surprise when England went down to a series of crushing defeats, the first 5–0 whitewash. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better when Warwick Armstrong's men toured England in 1921. Australian fast bowlers Gregory and McDonald battered the English batsmen with a succession of bouncers and Jack Hobbs missed most of the season with first a leg injury then appendicitis. England used 30 players in all. Only one Australian made a century as opposed to 3 for England – A. C. \\"Jack\\" Russell scoring 101 and 102* and Phil Mead 182* – but Australia's 3–0 victory made it 8 Ashes defeats in succession. England resumed the winning habit on the 1922/23 tour of South Africa, under F.T. Mann, winning a pulsating rubber 2 – 1. England lost the first Test but scraped to victory in the next, at Cape Town, by one wicket. Phil Mead scored 181 at Kingsmead, Durban, to ensure a draw and they won the fifth and final match, also at Durban, thanks to Jack Russell's twin centuries in his final Test. This dominance was underlined in England in 1924 with a 3–0 for England. Hopes that the Ashes might be regained were dashed on the 1924/25 tour down under however, Australia thrashing England 4–1, although England scored 8 centuries to Australia's 6. Herbert Sutcliffe scored 734 runs at 81.56 and Maurice Tate broke Mailey's Ashes record with 38 wickets, bowling 2,528 balls in the Tests. England's only victory came at Melbourne, by an innings, after Captain Arthur Gilligan won the toss for the only time. It was England's first Ashes Test win in 12 years. England drew the first four Tests of the 1926 Ashes series and so the series rested on the Oval Test, for which Percy Chapman replaced Arthur Carr as captain and both the 48-year-old Rhodes and 21-year-old Larwood were selected. Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored centuries and Australia lost by 289 runs. The South African team proved stronger than before however and drew the 1927/28 series 2–2. A fourth team was, at last, introduced to Test cricket when the West Indies took their bow in 1928. England won each of the three Tests by an innings, Freeman taking 22 wickets, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although 'electric heels' Learie Constantine did the double on the tour. The England team at this period was as strong as it has ever been and Australia were dispatched 4–1 on the 1928/29 Ashes tour. Hammond scored 44, 28, 251, 200, 32, 119*, 177, 38 and 16 – a total of 905 runs, a new record. Percy Chapman captained the team but barely played again. England, under J. C. White and Arthur Carr, beat South Africa 2–0 at home in 1929 with Herbert Sutcliffe scoring a hundred in each innings at the Oval Bizarrely there were two concurrent England tours in 1929/30, one to New Zealand and one to the West Indies. Surrey paceman Maurice Allom took four wickets in five balls in New Zealand's maiden Test match, including a hat trick, and his 8 for 65 swept England to victory in Christchurch by 8 wickets with the three later Tests drawn. At the same time another England team were drawing 1 -1 in the West Indies under F. S. G. Calthorpe. Forty-year-old Patsy Hendren made 1,765 runs on this tour and Andy Sandham scored 325 at Kingston (out of England's 849) in his final Test. The 'black Bradman' George Headley followed twin centuries at Georgetown with 223 in the same Kingston game. 1930s The 21-year-old Don Bradman dominated the 1930 Ashes series in England, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at Headingley, when Chapman stuck to attacking fields all day, and 232 at the Oval. Australia regained the Ashes. Harold Larwood took only four wickets in the series although K. S. Duleepsinhji made 173 at Lord's on debut. England played five Tests in South Africa on the 1930/31 tour. Chasing 240 to win the first Test at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg they were bowled out by E. P. Nupen, a master on the matting wicket, and drew the next four. New Zealand played their first Test in England in 1931 and their strong performance at Lord's led the authorities to arrange another two that summer, one of which England won. India played their first Test in England in 1932 at Lords, reducing England to 19 for 3 on the first morning before losing a competitive match when they were bowled out for 187 chasing 346. Bill Woodfull evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders. Before the 1932-3 tour to Australia, England had become used to the prolific run-scoring of Don Bradman. The England captain, Surrey's Douglas Jardine chose to develop the already existing leg theory into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body, and Jardine had two very fast accurate bowlers, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce to bowl them. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side. Main article: Bodyline England won the series and the Ashes 4–1. But complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the Australian Cricket Board, which during the tour sent the following cable to the Marylebone Cricket Club in London: :Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England. Later, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the laws of cricket changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg were banned. England won two Tests on the 1933/34 tour of India, the first ever Tests held in the sub continent. England won by nine wickets at Bombay's Gymkhana ground with Bryan Valentine scoring 136 in his first Test innings. Morris Nichols and E. W. \\"Nobby\\" Clark bowled so many bouncers at the Indian batsman that they wore solar topees instead of caps to protect themselves from the ball as much as the sun. Naoomal Jeoomal top edged a Clark bouncer into his head in the third Test, was unable to continue and didn't bat in the second innings. Australia won the first Test of the 1934 Ashes series by 238 runs at Trent Bridge. Clarrie Grimmett took 25 wickets in the series, and Bill O'Reilly 28 as England were spun to defeat. Bradman made 758 runs in the Tests and 2020 on the tour, with Stan McCabe making 2078. Patsy Hendren(132) and Maurice Leyland (153) ensured a draw at Old Trafford and England did manage a rare Test win over Australia at Lord's with Hedley Verity taking 14 wickets in a day and 15 in the match. Bradman (304) and Ponsford (181) put on 388 at Headingley and then 451 at the Oval where England lost by a massive 562 runs. Ponsford scored 266 in his last Test. Nobby Clark bowled some 'leg theory' against the Australians, with little success. Bill Voce took 8 for 66 for Notts against the Australians but withdrew from the attack with a 'leg injury' after Woodfall raised discrete objections. England toured the West Indies in 1934/5 and showed the folly of sending a weakened team as they lost the rubber 2 -1 with George Headley scoring 270 not out in the 4th Test at Sabina Park. South Africa won on English soil for the first time, taking the 5 Test series 1–0 in 1935 with a victory at Lord's by 157 runs thanks to Bruce Mitchell's 164 and Jock Cameron's quickfire 90. Cameron died at 30, of enteric fever, soon after returning home from this tour. India used 22 players in three Tests in England in 1936. A then record 588 runs were scored on the second day of the Old Trafford Test and England too experimented with their team and took the rubber 2–0. The 1936/37 Ashes tour, under Gubby Allen, was a titanic struggle. England, helped by rain freshening the pitch, won by 322 runs in Brisbane and an innings in Sydney where Wally Hammond scored 271 not out. Bill Voce was their spearhead, taking 17 wickets in these two games. Bradman added a record 346 for the sixth wicket with Jack Fingleton at Melbourne and followed that with 212 at Adelaide where his team leveled the score at 2–2. Bradman, McCabe and Badcock all scored hundreds in the decider at Melbourne and Australian took the series 3–2. England beat New Zealand 1–0 in a three Test rubber in 1937. Tom Goddard took 6 for 29 in bowling out the visitors for 134 at the Old Trafford Test as they chased 265 to win. Jack Cowie had taken 6 for 67 for New Zealand and 10 in the match. Len Hutton scored a century after having begun his England career with 0 and 1 at Lords. Prospective tours of South Africa and West Indies fell through in the winter of 1937/38. The 1938 Ashes series was a high scoring affair. Hutton, Barnett, Paynter (216*) and Compton made hundreds at Trent Bridge with the Australians scoring three including Stan McCabe's brilliant 232. Hammond scored 240 in the Lord's Test while Bill Brown made a double ton and Bradman a match saving century for Australia. Old Trafford fell victim to the rain and Australia retained the Ashes with a win at Headingley, thanks to Bradman's century and 10 wickets for O'Reilly and 7 for Fleetwood-Smith. England won the final Test at the Oval thanks to a record Test score of 903 – 7 dec and Len Hutton's world record of 364 in 13 hours, 17 minutes. Bradman, whose score of 334 had been surpassed, was the first to congratulate the 22-year-old Yorkshireman. Maurice Leyland made 187 and the elegant Joe Hardstaff 169 not out. Australia subsided to 201 and 123, batting 2 short, and England won by an innings and 579. Paul Gibb scored 93 and 106 on debut at Johannesburg on England's 1938/39 tour. England scored 11 centuries in the series and South Africa 6. Paynter scored 117 and 100 in the first Test and 243 in the third at Durban. England, 1–0, in the series, returned to Durban to play a deciding 'timeless' Test to the finish. It was abandoned as a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. Needing 696 to win they were, incredibly, 654 for 5, Gibb having scored 120, Hammond 140 and Edrich 219. A record 1981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. The three Tests between England and the West Indies in 1939 were the last before the Second World War, although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played. Len Hutton and Denis Compton, leaders of the bright new batting generation, scored hundreds at Lords where the brilliant George Headley scored a ton in each innings. Hammond became the first fielder to hold 100 Test catches at Old Trafford. England took the series 1–0 as the war clouds loomed over Europe. NotesReferences * *Barker, Ralph & Rosenwater, Irving.

A church is dedicated to him in the village of Kfarsghab in North-Lebanon where his feast day is celebrated on 3 June and 27 August. Life There are several versions of the life of Mar Awtel. This is the version of the Maronite Sinksar along with the versions presented by Youakim Moubarac.Moubarac, Youakim - Pentalogie antiochienne / Domaine Maronite - Tome II - Volume I - pages 17-18 - éditions du Cénacle Libanais - Beyrouth - 1984 Saint Awtel is celebrated by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Jacobites and the Maronites. His place and date of birth vary according to the sources. From an unknown place in modern Turkey for the Maronite Sinksar and born in the 3rd century AD, he is from Lycia for the other sources and he lived during the 6th century AD. His feast day varies also according to the different traditions. But most sources have corroborating deeds: he escaped a forced marriage arranged by his family, spent some time in Byzantium, delivered his fellow passengers during a severe storm, went back to his place of birth after the death of his parents and finally became a monk then a hermit. Version of the Maronite book of saints (Sinksar) North Facade of Saint Awtel Church, Kfarsghab, LebanonMar Awtel was born in mid-3rd century. As a youth he was converted to Christianity and baptised. He pledged his virginity to God but his father wanted him to marry and thereby break his pledge of celibacy. To escape he left for the city Byzantium. While travelling on route in a boat he encountered a severe storm endangering the boat and all on board. He prayed for deliverance and the boat was saved and as a consequence those on board were converted to Christianity and baptized. He remained for 20 years in Byzantium until his father died, whereupon he returned to his home and became a monk. He performed many miracles, one of which was the cure of a pagan man. This cure was the reason for the conversion and baptism of ten thousand pagans. After being a monk for 12 years he became a hermit until he died in 327. Version of Fr.

Youakim Moubarak translated it to French and enriched its contents and published it in his Pentalogie Antiochienne / Domaine Maronite - Tome II - Volume I - year 1984 - Editor Cenacle Libanais - Beirut - Lebanon. Father Sheikho found some information about Mar Awtel in the Jacobites book of saints, in a handwritten copy belonging to Patriarch Ignatius Ephrem II Rahmani. It is also mentioned in the Bibliotheca Orientalis of Assemani and in the calendar of Çlîba the Jacobite, on the dates of October 9 and June 3. Of all those references, he concluded that Awtel or Awtilios was born in a city called Magdal or Magdaloun in the land of Lycia in Asia Minor, in the 6th century A.D. His two parents were pagan but he was converted very young, became Christian and ran away from the paternal home to avoid marriage. He boarded and ran away to the city of Moumista (probably al-Maççîça) delivering his fellow passengers from a tempest where they would have perished. He came to Constantinople, led an ascetic life in one of its monasteries, then came back to his fatherland before spending some time in the region of Antioch,The city of Antioch-on-the-Orontes (modern Antakya) is located in what is now Turkey. Located on the eastern side of the Orontes River, it was founded near the end of the 4th century BC by Seleucus I Nicator, who made it the capital of his empire in Syria. Seleucus I had served as one of Alexander the Great's generals, and the name Antiochus occurred frequently amongst members of his family. then back in Lycia. There, he converted the pagans of this region, christened them and ended his life in the desert in a monastery which he built nearby and where he lived till his death. In the calendar of the antiochian Church of al-Bîrûnî a martyr called Uwaytilyos is mentioned on the date of September 23. But it is not proven whether it is Mar Awtel or another saint. Additional information Father Cheikho magazine Al Maxreq, year X, 1907, page 672-672, Beirut, Lebanon found also that the Byzantines would have called Saint Awtel, according to Fr Peeters, Agios Attaros and that they celebrated his feast day between the 2nd and the 7th of June.

He left the monastery because he did not want to be elected superior. He was served in his ultimate retirement in the desert by a man whom he had cured from the bite of a snake. Saint Awtel's Church, Kfarsghab=The history= Bottom right, the commanding location of Saint Awtel Church in 1896Saint Awtel's church in Kfarsghab, Lebanon is the only church in the country dedicated to this saint. It is built on a rocky promontory presenting steep faces of around 30 meters altitude, commanding the approaches through the Qadisha Valley. Its location is clearly that of a fortified place, echoing the etymological meaning of Kfarsghab#Etymology, \\"the fortified village\\". The first mention of Saint Awtel Church is a date for its renovation in 1470.Abi Khattar, Sheikh Antonios, known as AïnTourini, Moukhtassar Tarikh Jabal Loubnan, in the version of the father Ignatius Tannous AlKhoury revised by Dr. Elias Kattar, editor Lahd Khater, Beirut 1983. , page 139. In fact, the author refers this date to a text of the Patriarch El Douaihy, not present in the events of that year in Douaihi's most important book Tarikh Al Azminah. On the other hand, the historians (including AïnTourini) agree on saying that the construction of the church of Saint Awtel goes to the same period and on the same style as those of Saint Roumanos in Hadchit and another church in Madinat Al Ras (village now extinct). However the Patriarch El Douaihy dates the construction of Saint Roumanos church to the year 1518. in El Douaihy, Patriarch Estephan, Tarikh Al Azminah, in the version of the Abbot Boutros Fahd, editions Dar Lahd Khater, Beirut – 3rd Edition. , page 397. Therefore, the first church of Saint Awtel could have been renovated at the end of the Fifteenth Century Engraving commemorating the extension of Mar Awtel Church in 1776Between 1776 and 1778, the church was extended to accommodate the increasing population of Kfarsghab. The achievement of this renovation is attested by a Garshuni stone inscription in Syriac placed over the main entrance that reads as follow: * \\"Achieved the construction of this blessed temple year one thousand seven hundred and seventy six by the zeal of Sheikh Abou Youssef Elias\\". Left Side of the wooden Inscription from 1795 The Church is separated into two sections: men in front and women in the rear. And in 1795, an intricate woodwork was completed to separate the two sections. It was commemorated by a Garshuni inscription in Syriac Serta Script that reads as follows: * Left Side: \\"This woodwork was achieved by the hand of Master Dumiati [from Damietta, Egypt] in the month of February of year 1795 and that was\\" Right Side of the wooden Inscription from 1795 * Right Side: \\"under the supervision of Father Jibrayeel and Father Brahim priests of the village and the donor was Sheikh Estephan Elias. [May] the Saint patron of the location reward him\\". Door Engraving from 1882 In 1882, the church underwent renovation that was commemorated by engraving on the main entrance door in a mix of Garshuni and Arabic as follows: * \\"Enter into the domain of the Lord painted in year 1882 and bow in his temple\\". The modern bell tower to the West - 1966In the 1950s, A modern bell tower in white stone and red tiles was added over the women entrance to the west. It was quite different from the style of the church. Eventually, it was dismantled in the 1980s restoring the architecture to its origin. In the 1960s, a painting was commissioned to Saliba Douaihy, a young but already established Lebanese artist. This painting of Saint Awtel could be still seen over the altar inside the church. In the 2000s, the square around the church was renovated and embellished in old stone reflecting the beauty of the architecture and the majesty of the site. =The Architecture and style= The Church layout is that of old small Maronite churches, with a single apse and a single nave typical of the 12th and 13th centuries Maronite churches.Atallah, Micheline, Saint Aquilina's Church And Sanctuary Part III, Journal of Maronite Studies, Vol. 3, Issue 4, October 1999 The interior is divided according to Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy’s standard plan with minor differences due to the small size of the church.Abdallah, Charbel, L'architecture d'une église maronite selon le patriarche Douaïhy, Faculté Pontificale de Théologie de l'Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (Liban), 24 November 2010, last accessed on March 4, 2014. St Awtel Church Layout A plain rectangular shape is terminated at its Eastern side by a semicircular half-domed apse. The apse's vault is ornamented with paintings of angels/cherubims on a light blue background. The altar, made of white marble, is centred into the apse and pushed into its wall. The icon representing Saint Awtel is hanging above the altar in the middle of the apse. The altar is separated by few steps from the chancel, which in turn is separated from the nave by other few steps and an iron parapet. The nave is roofed by a series of crossed vaults. It is divided by an intricate wooden separation into two sections: the one in front reserved for men and the rear reserved for women. Each section has two ranks of natural wooden benches and its own thick wooden door. The wooden divider is a piece of delicate art and we know from the inscription commemorating its consecration that it was the work of a skilled artisan from Damietta, Egypt, a city still known today for its excellent wood artisans. A white coating covers the inside walls. Natural light comes through two narrow higher windows on the Southern wall and one lower window on the North wall. Women's Entrance to the West Three higher apertures can be seen on the western wall above the women's entrance: two rectangular narrow apertures and above them in the middle the third aperture made in white stone in the shape of a hexagram, a six-pointed star. The Women's door is encased into atypical heavy slabs of white limestone, and bears on the upper slab an unusual cross. The shape of the cross doesn't figure in the Maronite crosses tradition. It is a combination between a coptic cross and an Occitan cross. The Occitan cross is attributed to Raymond IV of Toulouse, whose family reigned in the county of Tripoli during the Crusades from 1109 till 1289 AD. Kfarsghab was administratively part of the county of Tripoli, which could be an explanation of the origin of this unusual cross. The main entrance of Mar Awtel church built on the ruins of a pagan temple The men's door is also encased in heavy slabs of white limestone. The upper stone bears an engraving of a simple graded cross. A smaller stone has a chalice engraved on it. Then, an engraved white limestone plate tops the whole commemorating the extension of the church in 1776. The door is of heavy oak wood, engraved with biblical verses and a date of renovation in 1882. The flat roof and the roughly hewn stone of the outside walls give the church an aspect of simplicity and austerity. The bell tower situated at the northern edge of the roof slightly to the left of the main entrance is the example of this minimalistic style as it is formed by a simple stone arch housing a medium size cast iron bell. The church is surrounded by a vast square on the Northern and Western sides, cobbled in natural stone. The square is delimited by a natural stone parapet.

His nickname, Jigsaw John, originated in his early career with a dismemberment murder he solved in Griffith Park in which the victim had been cut up jigsaw-style. The moniker caught on because of his ability to piece clues together in difficult cases, resulting in many arrests and convictions.Times, Malnic; 05, May, 1995 He became an authority on serial murders and worked 12 of them, including the 1950s serial killer Harvey Glatman, Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, the Hillside Stranglers, the Southside Slayer, and the William Bonin Freeway Killer case. In the latter, acting on a tip, St. John tracked down the Downey, CA truck driver and, on June 11, 1980, his team captured Bonin in the act of sodomizing a victim. The killer had his murder kit in the vehicle. Investigative technique St. John was renowned within the Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD) for his amazing memory, and dogged determination in working the minutiae that led to solving murders and getting convictions. However, as criminal science became more sophisticated he kept up with the times taking advantage of modern scientific crime analysis, forensic techniques and the benefits of a new computerized age.Case Closed; Famed Homicide Detective Jigsaw John Turns In Badge No. 1.

In the Bonin case, although the killer was in custody, the DA's office was having trouble building a case, until one day Bonin received a letter from the mother of one of his victims begging him to tell her what happened to her son. He confessed to that and all of the other murders. As the trial date neared, St. John approached the deputy DA on the case and said, \\"I've got to tell you something.

W3C and ETSI maintain and update XAdES together. Description While XML- DSig is a general framework for digitally signing documents, XAdES specifies precise profiles of XML-DSig making it compliant with the European eIDAS regulation (Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market). The eIDAS regulation enhances and repeals the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC. EIDAS is legally binding in all EU member states since July 2014. An electronic signature that has been created in compliance with eIDAS has the same legal value as a handwritten signature. An electronic signature, technically implemented based on XAdES has the status of an advanced electronic signature. This means that * it is uniquely linked to the signatory; * it is capable of identifying the signatory; * only the signatory has control of the data used for the signature creation; * it can be identified if data attached to the signature has been changed after signing. A resulting property of XAdES is that electronically signed documents can remain valid for long periods, even if underlying cryptographic algorithms are broken. However, courts are not obliged to accept XAdES-based electronic signatures as evidence in their proceedings; at least in EU, this is compulsory only for \\"qualified\\" signatures. A \\"qualified electronic signature\\" needs to be doted with a digital certificate, encrypted by a security signature creation device, and the identity of the owner of this signing-certificate must have been verified according to the \\"high\\" assurance level of the eIDAS regulation. Profiles XAdES defines six profiles (forms) differing in protection level offered. *XAdES (also named XAdES-BES for \\"Basic Electronic Signature\\"), basic form just satisfying Directive legal requirements for advanced signature; *XAdES-T (timestamp), adding timestamp field to protect against repudiation; *XAdES-C (complete), adding references to verification data (certificates and revocation lists) to the signed documents to allow off-line verification and verification in future (but does not store the actual data); *XAdES-X (extended), adding timestamps on the references introduced by XAdES-C to protect against possible compromise of certificates in chain in future; *XAdES-X-L (extended long-term), adding actual certificates and revocation lists to the signed document to allow verification in future even if their original source is not available; *XAdES-A (archival), adding the possibility for periodical timestamping (e.g. each year) of the archived document to prevent compromise caused by weakening signature during a long storage period. In February 2016, ETSI publishes the document ETSI EN 319 132-1 V1.1.0 as final draft for a European Standard. In this draft, the profiles have been omitted.

It has approximately 350 homes on properties ranging from a couple thousand square feet to many acres, some flat and sunny, some on steep narrow gauge railroad type one-way streets. The population hovers around 425.Camp Meeker Set amidst redwoods directly on Dutch Bill Creek, it gets an average of 55 inches of rainfall spread over about 69 average days during the winter season. History Camp Meeker, 1907 Camp Meeker takes its name from Melvin Cyrus Meeker, a lumber baron who established several mills in the area c. 1866. Located on the North Pacific Coast Railroad (since abandoned), Camp Meeker was a center for logging the coast redwoods that built and then rebuilt San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. After logging the trees, Meeker subdivided Camp Meeker in 1898, and lots (each by with a one-room cabin) sold for $75. Around 1900, it was primarily a vacation place for people from San Francisco. Facilities Camp Meeker is the home of St. Dorothy's Rest, a retreat center and summer camp. Fire protection is provided by the Camp Meeker Volunteer Fire Department. In 2003, the department claimed that Camp Meeker was the only place in Sonoma County which places fire hydrants every . As of December 2001, one-year class wild coho salmon were spawning in Dutch Bill Creek. In 2002 Dutch Bill Creek was part of the captive broadstock program, and since 2006 juvenile coho have been released in the creek as a part of this program. In November 2009, Camp Meeker revamped its recreational park on Dutch Bill Creek by removing a WPA-era dam and installing a bridge in its place. The entire area was rebuilt by PCI, Inc. under contract with the Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District after years of study. Before becoming a village Camp Meeker was a lumber town followed by a summer enclave with the year rounders and the summer folk.

It was released on VHS by MCA. The film features the voice talents of Kath Soucie and Frank Welker. It is based on the book of the same name, by Watty Piper (specifically based on the 1976 illustrations by Ruth Sanderson). The film was also syndicated in the US on broadcast television as an Easter special in March/April 1993.  Plot  Eric, a young boy, is excited about his birthday after reading a book and believes that a train will come for him, much to his teenage sister Jill's disbelief. The next morning, the train station's control tower wakes up and in the roundhouse, Tillie, a young little blue switcher engine, along with her best bird friend, Chip, wakes up four other trains: Georgia, a kind all- purpose engine, Farnsworth, a stuck-up, shiny, new passenger engine, Jebediah, a worn-out, rusty, old engine, and Pete, a gruff, burly, big, strong freight engine. After the tower assigns Farnsworth and Pete their jobs, he declines Tillie's offer to help with the milk train assigned to Jebediah due to her small stature. Georgia is assigned to pull the birthday train. A clown named Rollo leads the toys and friends into the train, including Jeepers, a monkey, Stretch, a basketball player, Missy, a ballerina, Handy Pandy, a panda, Perky, an elephant, and Grumpella, a stuffed bird. However, during her journey, Georgia breaks down and Doc takes her back to the roundhouse. Left behind, Rollo eventually takes Doc's advice of flagging down one of the other engines returning from their daily runs over the mountain. Farnsworth and Pete turn blind eyes to the offer, and Jebediah explains that going over the mountain is too much for him. Meanwhile, despite the tower turning down Tillie's offer to help carry the birthday train, she and Chip sneak past the tower and pulls the birthday train up a mountain. Despite being ridiculed by the animals along the way, Tillie manages to reach the summit after crossing a bridge that collapses but loses the last train car, which snaps off and falls into the river along the way. When Tillie sees the scary cave, she tries to go through the cave. However, the cave says that she is too little. Unfortunately, an avalanche knocks Tillie out cold. Eric is woken up by a thunderstorm and is worried about Tillie and the birthday train. After Tillie regains consciousness, she pulls the train out of the snow using her cowcatcher as a snowplow and down the mountain before they reach the town, much to Eric's delight and Jill's amazement. Although very tired from her long and adventurous journey over the mountain, Tillie is very proud and happy that she could and tells Chip that it was worth it.

Burroughs and artist Malcolm Mc Neill. It began in 1970, when Burroughs was living in London and Mc Neill was in his final year of art school. It first appeared under the title The Unspeakable Mr. Hart as a comic strip in the English Cyclops. When that magazine ceased publication, Burroughs and Mc Neill decided to develop the concept as a book. After a year of research and preliminary design the text of the book had expanded from 11 pages to 50, and a complete mockup had been produced. By this point, the work had been renamed Ah Puch Is Here in reference to the Mayan Death God. Straight Arrow Books in San Francisco agreed to publish the proposed work in 1971 as a \\"Word/Image novel\\" which was to comprise 120 pages, some of integrated text and image, some of text alone and some which featured only pictures. In 1973, Mc Neill moved to San Francisco from London to finish the project. However, the small advance offered by the publisher made any more than a few months of working full-time on the project impossible, and when Straight Arrow closed in 1974 the book was without a publisher. Nevertheless, Mc Neill moved to New York in 1975 to rejoin Burroughs and continue the work. They were unable to find another publisher and after seven years on and off, the project was finally abandoned. It was subsequently published in 1979 (by John Calder and Viking Penguin) in text form only under the original title of Ah Pook Is Here. After 30 years the original visual works were resurrected and restored by Mc Neill for a West Coast showing at Track 16 Gallery in Santa Monica, CA, April 4th to May 2nd, 2009 and a December 2008 showing in New York at Saloman Arts Gallery. Burroughs reads from Ah Pook Is Here on his 1990 recording Dead City Radio; this recording, in turn, formed the soundtrack to the animated short Ah Pook Is Here directed by Philip Hunt and featured music by John Cale.

Its motto is Thorough, which was the motto of the Royal Air Force Electrical and Wireless School.  Mission  \\"To train Eng (CE) officers and Trade Group 4 personnel (Cyberspace Communications Specialists) to agreed output standards in order to enable cyberspace capabilities for the RAF and Defence.\\"  History  The School was originally known as The School for Wireless Operators, and was part of the Royal Flying Corps, when it was formed at the Town Hall, Farnborough in 1915. The school was transferred to the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918 when the RAF was formed by Lord Trenchard, in 1919 the school was moved from Farnborough to RAF Flowerdown in Hampshire. The school had a number of name changes from The Electrical & Wireless School, to No 1 Signals School, until finally becoming known as No 1 Radio School in 1943, when all radio and signal schools were called radio schools and there were 15 in total. In 1950 the school moved from RAF Cranwell to RAF Locking where it remained for the next 48 years, until it was disbanded on 1 Oct 98, where it became known as Communications-Electronics (C-E) Training Wing, 1 School of Technical Training (Det RAF Locking). The school was then re-formed at DSAE Cosford as No 1 Radio School, in Flowerdown Hall on the 60th anniversary of No 1 Radio School in 2003. The school also incorporates the Aerial Erector School (AES) which is based at RAF Digby.  Role  No. 1 Radio School is responsible for Phase 2 and 3 training of RAF Engineering Communications Electronics (Eng CE) officers, Trade Group 4 Cyberspace Communications Specialists (formerly I.C.T. Technicians) and Communications Infrastructure Technicians (commonly known as Aerial Erectors). No 1 Radio School, DSAE Cosford Phase 2 Training: * Phase 2 training provides initial specialist training to prepare Service personnel for their first employment in the wider RAF. Phase 2 training normally follows on from Phase 1 Training, which is initial training in the basic military skills required by all Service personnel. Phase 3 Training: * Phase 3 Training prepares Service personnel for further employment with increased skill base and/or responsibility. It also encompasses training to meet career aspirations and professional development. Training The Radio School currently consists of 3 squadrons to deliver and support all the required Phase 2 & 3 training. These squadrons consist of: * Training Delivery Squadron (TDS) which comprises 5 flights: # Air Defence and Systems (ADAS) Flight - Covers Air Defence RADAR systems, Air Field Navigational aids and communication systems. These courses are primarily Phase 3 operational courses for locations around the World. # Network Applications - This area covers Network Applications and Network Information Systems including Cyber Courses as well as an introduction to Programming. # Network Infrastructure. This flight covers core network installation and fault resolution tasks; specifically: Health & Safety, Data Communications theory and installations, Information Technology Essentials, Introduction to Networks and Structure Cabling. # Networks Deployed. This area focuses on the theory and practical execution of Radio and Satellite Communications from a Phase 2 aspect and delivers the DII Land Deployed Phase 3 training. # Engineering Management Training Flight. The Phase 2 training of Engineering Officers', Phase 2 training of Information Communication Technology technicians in Air Operations and technical documentation as well as the delivery of Trade Management Training for newly promoted Junior and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers. * Academic Accreditation Group (AAG). Deals with all the relevant course accreditation to professional bodies and companies including the management of the No1 Radio School CISCO Academy programme. # Cyberspace Communications Specialist phase 2 students - Lecturers deliver communication principles (Maths, Electronics, Radio) and Information Management principles. # Foundation Degree students - Lecturers deliver advanced communications and Radar principles, CISCO network management training along with Information management and Cyber Security delivery. # Phase 3 training - Lecturers deliver CISCO Network theory and practical training via CISCOs NetAcad platform and through the use of physical equipment as well as Information administration and management training. These courses ensure students are fully prepared for front-line operational environments. *Training Management Support Squadron (TMSS) is split into 2 flights: # Trainee Management Flight (TMF) - Hold responsibility for the discipline, welfare, care and management of all students within No 1 Radio School, whether phase 2 or 3. # Engineering Support Flight (ESF) - Manage the provision, delivery and installation of all engineering requirements within the School, from mobile and fixed IT infrastructure and equipment to Radar systems used in the delivery of training. Cyberspace Communications Specialists The purpose of Cyberspace Communications Specialist training is to: * Train Cyberspace Communication Specialists to meet the RAF's requirement for Cyber, communication, computers, information networks, sensors and detection systems, in order to undertake air operations. Students undertake a 34-week specialist training course at No. 1 Radio School, RAF Cosford. This course prepares the students for their first tour at an operational unit, giving them skills and experiences ranging from Radio Principles to Network Administration and Cyber Security. Communication Infrastructure Technician (CIT) The purpose of CIT training is to: * Provide specialist Working at Height (WaH) and cable infrastructure training. Engineering Officer Further Training (Communications Electronics) (EOFT (CE)) The purpose of EOFT (CE) is to: * Prepare newly commissioned Junior Officers for their foundation tours as cyberspace engineers and information specialists. Upon completion of Initial Officer Training at RAFC Cranwell, students complete a 26-week training course that prepares newly commissioned junior officers for, and provides them with the skills necessary to undertake, the many varied first tours that an Eng (CE) officer might undertake. The key theme throughout the course, which is split over three terms, is to embed an appreciation of how technology is a key enabler of operations. Term 1 of the course provides an introduction to communications doctrine, communications organisations within Defence and the responsibilities of an Eng (CE) officer, as well as an academic module looking at RADAR and telecommunications principles. Term 2 builds on the application of those modules taught during Phase 1, and introduces the officers to cyberspace and information services, systems and applications. The final term of the course consolidates the earlier taught modules and culminates in a scenario-based final exercise that simulates and assesses the officers in the type of environment that they could expect to find themselves in their first tour as Eng (CE) officers. In order to enhance their learning and to continue their development, the officers undertake a number of visits to RAF stations and joint organisations, such as RAF Waddington, Air Command, and the Permanent Joint Headquarters, and undertake an adventurous training and force development package. Qualifications No. 1 Radio School is a Cisco accredited academy, with the training that the students receive being recognised by a wide range of civilian employers and backed by transferable qualifications. Students completing the Defence Cyber Protect training also achieve the CompTIA Security+ (S+) and Cyber Security Analyst (CySA+) qualifications References Category:Vocational education in the United Kingdom Radio School ","title":"No. 1 Radio School RAF"},{"id":"10376237","text":"Salcantay, Salkantay or Sallqantay (in Quechua) is the highest peak in the Vilcabamba mountain range, part of the Peruvian Andes. It is located in the Cusco Region, about west-northwest of the city of Cusco. It is the 38th- highest peak in the Andes, and the twelfth-highest in Peru. However, as a range highpoint in deeply incised terrain, it is the second most topographically prominent peak in the country, after Huascarán. View from the Trek. Salcantay's proximity to Machu Picchu makes trekking around it an alternative to the oversubscribed Inca Trail; this is known as the Salkantay trek. History left The name Salkantay is from sallqa, a Quechua word meaning wild, uncivilized, savage, or invincible, and was recorded as early as 1583. The name is thus often translated as \\"Savage Mountain\\". Directly to the north of Salkantay lies Machu Picchu, which is at the end of a ridge that extends down from this mountain. Viewed from Machu Picchu's main sundial, the Southern Cross is above Salkantay's summit when at its highest point in the sky during the rainy season. The Incas associated this alignment with concepts of rain and fertility, and considered Salkantay to be one of the principal deities controlling weather and fertility in the region west of Cuzco. Mountaineering Salcantay is a large, steep peak with great vertical relief, particularly above the low valleys to the north, which are tributaries of the Amazon River. The standard route on the mountain is the Northeast ridge. Accessing the route typically involves three days of travel from Cusco. The climb involves about of vertical gain, on glacier, snow, ice, and some rock. =Mountaineering history= Salcantay was first climbed in 1952 by a French-American expedition comprising Fred D. Ayres, David Michael Jr., John C. Oberlin, W. V. Graham Matthews, Austen F. Riggs, George Irving Bell, Claude Kogan, M. Bernard Pierre, and Jean Guillemin. All except Oberlin, Riggs, and Guillemin reached the summit.John C. Oberlin and W. V. Graham Matthews, \\"The First Ascent of Mount Salcantay\\", American Alpine Journal, 1953, pp. 387-396. Two years later Fritz Kasparek fell through a cornice near the summit on the NE ridge. On June 17, 2013 Nathan Heald (USA), Thomas Ryan (USA), and Luis Crispin (Peru) made the summit at 10:30am after nine hours of climbing from a high camp at 5,500 m. on the NE ridge. This makes Crispin the first Peruvian climber to summit the mountain. The team took a reading of 6,279 m, S 13° 20.027’, W 72° 32.596’, on a GPS device. , Diario de la Republica, 27 June 2013 On July 31, 2013 a second team led by Nathan Heald (USA), consisting of James Lissy (USA) and Edwin Espinoza Sotelo (Peru) made the summit by the NE ridge.

It was located between the Weser river and the southeast part of the Teutoburg Forest. History The founder of what would become the County of Lippe (1528–1789), then the Principality of Lippe (1789–1918) was Bernhard I, who received a grant of territory from Lothair III in 1123. Bernhard I assumed the title of Edler Herr zu Lippe (noble Lord to Lippe). The history of the dynasty and its further acquisitions of land really began with Bernard II. His territory was probably formed out of land he acquired on the destruction of the Duchy of Saxony following the demise of Henry the Lion in 1180. From 1196 to 1666 the descendants of Bernard II passed their holdings from father to sons for sixteen generations. Thereafter until 1905, a collateral branch passed Lippe from father to sons for eight generations. A distant relation then became the last ruler until the Revolution of 1918 when Lippe became the Free State of Lippe.G. Benecke, Society and Politics in Germany, 1500–1750, Routletge & Kegan Paul Ltd, 1974, p. 41. Simon V was the first ruler of Lippe to style himself as a count (Graf) in 1528. Following the death of Simon VI in 1613, the county was partitioned between his three sons; Lippe-Detmold went to Simon VII, Lippe-Brake to Otto and Lippe-Alverdissen went to Philip I. The county of Lippe-Brake was reunited with the main Detmold line in 1709. Another branch of the family was founded by Jobst Herman, a son of Simon VII, who was founder of the Lippe-Biesterfeld line. From this branch, the branch Lippe-Weissenfeld was later to be separated. Both the Counties of Lippe-Biesterfeld and Lippe- Weissenfeld were sold to the princely line of Lippe(-Detmold) in 1762. The Counts of Lippe-Detmold were granted the title of Imperial prince in 1789. Shortly after becoming a member state of the German Empire in 1871, the Lippe- Detmold line died out on 20 July 1895. This resulted in an inheritance dispute between the neighbouring principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and the Lippe- Biesterfeld line. The dispute was resolved by the Imperial Court in Leipzig in 1905, with the lands passing to the Lippe-Biesterfeld line who, until this point, had no territorial sovereignty. The Principality of Lippe came to an end on 12 November 1918 with the abdication of Leopold IV, with Lippe becoming a Free State. In 1947, Lippe merged into the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Sofi Bonde is now about to release the Swedish made album \\"Heart Machine Service\\" with Swedish songwriter and producer Kim Wennerström. First song out is \\"In an Ambulance\\". Available on iTunes och Spotify. Sofi Bonde recorded her first demo in Paris, and shortly after signed her recording agreement with Independent Records/Bonniers in Stockholm. 2001 her debut album \\"One\\" was released. Legendary songwriter Steve Mac (One Direction, Leona Lewis, Westlife, Il Divo) produced the tracks \\"Back in your arms\\" and \\"Hey boy\\". The rest of the album including the first single \\"Little things\\" was produced by Martin Hansen and Micke Nord and topped the charts at Swedish Radio P4 during the summer of 2001. After the release of the album Sofi got a publishing deal offer and moved to London to develop as a songwriter. She got to travel to USA to collaborate with American songwriters. 2003 she moved to New York to explore a new step in her music career. 2006 her second album \\"Fighting Gravity\\" was released. The new songs gained attention in Los Angeles and she was offered to collaborate with MTV to make her own reality series called \\"Make it in America\\". As it turned out things are rarely as they seem and the collaboration turned into Sofi writing and recording songs for their shows instead such as The Hills, The City and Newport Harbor. Much better! Sofi's licensing successes lead to the recording deal with Atlantic Records. Together with them the placements got bigger and bigger and ended up on shows such as \\"Entourage\\", \\"Gossip Girl\\", \\"The Vampire Diaries\\", \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\", \\"Melrose Place\\" and she scored the end title song \\"When in Rome\\" with the single \\"Heartbling\\". Even though things went well in USA and she was the most aired Swedish artist for a few months on American television she missed home and returned to Sweden. Back in Stockholm she got inspired by the Swedish synth-pop scene and together with songwriter/music-producer Kim Wennerström (Eric Hassle, Orup, Ben Ivory) the album \\"Heart Machine Service\\" was created and the first single \\"In an ambulance\\" (\\"Given, smart and direct synth-pop\\" – Joacim Persson Aftonbladet) is out now.

NEi Nastran was an engineering analysis and simulation software product of NEi Software (formerly known as Noran Engineering, Inc.) Based on NASA's Structural Analysis program NASTRAN, the software is a finite element analysis (FEA) solver used to generate solutions for linear and nonlinear stress, dynamics, and heat transfer characteristics of structures and mechanical components. NEi Nastran software is used with all major industry pre and post processors including Femap, a product of Siemens PLM Software, in house brands NEi Nastran in-CAD, NEi Fusion, and NEi Works for SolidWorks. This software was acquired by Autodesk in May 2014. http://www.3dcadworld.com/autodesk-acquires-nei-nastran-solver/ \\"AUTODESK ACQUIRES NEI NASTRAN SOLVER\\" History The original NASTRAN program came out of NASA’s need to develop a common generic structural analysis program that would be used by all of the centers supporting the space program. A specification was written and a contract was awarded to Computer Sciences Corporation for development of NAsa STRuctural ANalysis (NASTRAN) software. NASTRAN was released to NASA in 1968. Improvements In the late 1960s, Finite Element Analysis software was confined to run on expensive mainframe computers and highly trained specialists were needed to apply the program. In this environment, the aerospace industry was the typical user because they had critical projects which could justify the resources FEA demanded. With improvements to the software and wider use of mainframes, FEA technology gradually spread to large corporations that could afford funding the huge investment in hardware, software, and a dedicated FEA staff. Usage spread from primarily aerospace and military applications to the automobile and maritime industries. The microprocessor revolution and the advent of Personal Computers (PCs) in the 1980s brought tremendous improvements in computing power, significant reductions in computing costs, and the steady development of numerical methods and algorithms. In the mid 1980s, Noran Engineering recognized the long term advantages and impact that the PC hardware revolution could have on the engineering analysis field and embarked on a project to significantly enhance and modernize the original NASTRAN code and port it to PCs. The first commercial version of NEi Nastran for use on PCs was released in 1990. The new code had a number of changes in architecture and programming language compared to legacy Nastran written originally for mainframes. These differences were intended to take advantage of the dramatic changes in computer hardware taking place and provide the code with key strategic advantages for the new PC platform. For example, since the cost of memory was dramatically reduced it was feasible to perform many operations faster in memory that normally were only done on disk. Present day NEi Nastran V10.0 was released in May 2010. It incorporates over 85 customer driven enhancements including the following additions: nonlinear composite Progressive Ply Failure Analysis (PPFA), concrete material model, direct enforced motion, bolt preload, enhanced rigid element features, visualization support for various entities, automatic dynamic plots during nonlinear analysis, transparent max/min, and a new look and feel for its Editor tool. Since August 2014, the NEi Nastran technology is included in \\"Autodesk Nastran 2015\\", \\"Autodesk Nastran In-CAD 2015\\" and \\"Autodesk Simulation Mechanical 2015 R1\\".

The bike is powered by a two-stroke, RC-valve equipped, single-cylinder engine with a redline at 11,000 rpm. The name NSR125 is taken from the NSR500 GP bike.  History and development  There were two models of the NSR125; the JC20 produced between 1988 and 1994 and the JC22 Foxeye produced between 1994 and 2001. They are easily distinguished by the headlights. The JC20 had double round headlight, while the JC22 had a \\"foxeye\\" headlight hence the nickname. Following the success of the NS125 (an earlier model to the NSR), the NSR125 JC20 was designed and assembled by Honda Italia Industriale S.p.A. in Rome, Italy. Grimeca was contracted to produce the aluminium cast frame (2-piece, die-cast, bolt together construction), wheels and brake assemblies. The engine was manufactured by Girardoni with Dell'Orto supplying the carburetor. Marzochi supplied forks and suspension while Pagani provided instrumentation and lighting. The Grimeca rear wheel was 18 inch in diameter, while the front was 17 inch and shod in Pirelli MT-45 tires. The NSR125 JC22 is mostly of Japanese manufacture, with the engine parts and other key elements of the running of the motorbike produced in Japan, it was then assembled in Italy and supplied to its mainly European market. Design changes saw the JC22 to receive a steel fuel tank and visual trim resembling the NR750. Although it is a common mistake to believe the NSR continued production until 2003. This is not the case as they ceased production in 2001 but had leftover stock until 2003/5. The NS125 which was available as an \\"F\\" naked, or \\"R\\" fully faired is commonly mistaken as an NSR of earlier production, although shares no real parts or design similarities. This model is most easily identifiable by its singular square headlight, rather than the earlier NSR's dual round headlights or the later NSR's \\"foxeye\\" design.

She was a dainty blonde with dark blue eyes. In the UK she was called both the British Mary Pickford. and the English Mary Pickford. Lineage and family Her ancestry was English, French, Scottish and Irish. Her Scottish lineage was lengthy and distinguished. She was related to Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll. Her ancestral home, Ware Park, dated to the 15th century. Flora Annie Le Breton was the youngest child of a gentleman of private means, Bertram Le Breton (born 1870), and his wife, and Florence Evelyn Le Breton. She had a sister called Violet (born 1897) and their brother was named Vivian Bertram Le Breton (born 1898). In August 1918, her brother, Lieutenant Vivian Le Breton, who had just weeks before married a Miss Theodora Fairbrother, was killed in action while fighting in France during World War I. Her sister Violet married Major Cecil Haigh and settled in Hong Kong. Education and stage career She trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Le Breton earned a scholarship there at the age of fifteen. Founded by Sir Herbert Tree, the academy grant was presented to her by Sir Squire Bancroft and Sir John Hare. She secured the role of a London flower girl and played opposite Sir Gerald du Maurier for an entire year in the English capital. She was noticed by Andre Charlot, who envisioned her as an English soubrette. He put Le Breton in several revues in which she sang and performed a stiff-legged doll dance that became the highlight of the shows. Film actress Le Breton's film career began in 1920 with a role as Alesia in La Poupee. In 1922 she co-starred with George K. Arthur and Simeon Stuart in Love's Influence, originally titled Love's April. The French heavyweight boxer, Georges Carpentier, made a cameo appearance in the British silent film. Le Breton won many of the London film favourite contests along with actress Betty Balfour. She appeared in the first coloured film made in Great Britain. The Glorious Adventure (1922) starred Lady Diana Cooper and Victor McLaglen. Produced by J. Stuart Blackton, founder of Vitagraph Studios, the film was made in Prizma colour. As a dancer Le Breton and her partner, Cecil Rubens, won the world's amateur dancing championship in February 1923. Le Breton arrived in America in January 1924.This was her second visit; she first visited in 1915, according to New York immigration records Among her early Hollywood films is Another Scandal (1924). She had the third lead after Lois Wilson and Holmes Herbert. Shot in Florida, the film was a production of the Tilford Cinema Corporation. Le Breton was among those considered for the role of Peter Pan in Peter Pan, which was adapted from the novel by Sir James Barrie. She chose not to play additional parts like the vamp character, Mrs. May Beamish, she performed in Another Scandal. She appeared in the melodrama I Am The Man (1924) with Lionel Barrymore. Her last screen credit came in the Columbia Pictures comedy Charley's Aunt (1930). Le Breton played the part of Ela Delahay. Le Breton sent for her mother in Britain and settled her in Beverly Hills, California after she became a star in the US. American stage In her first year in the United States Le Breton acted the part of a waif who inherits the wealth of a long-lost grandfather, Lord Maxwell. The play was Lass o' Laughter. Her character necessitates that she enunciate a Glaswegian Scottish accent. A reviewer praised her appearance, commenting Miss Le Breton's beauty is of the Dresden doll type. In November 1925 she was featured in the Henry W. Savage production, The Balcony Walker, which played the Lyric Theatre in Bridgeport, Connecticut. By March 1926 she had given up her film career to appear in a New York City revue, The Optimists. In a 1928 play, she was Lady Delphine, the romantic object of song and dance man Charles King in the well-received Broadway show, Present Arms, which had a run of 155 performances at the Mansfield Theatre. In March 1929, Walter Winchell, in his gossip column \\"Diary of a New Yorker,\\"'Harrisburg Telegraph page 10, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 5 March 1929. recounted Miss Le Breton's theatrical struggle to win stardom in America, and noted that she was now \\"the headliner and sensation of the bill at a vaudeville theater.\\" In 1933, Le Breton was reviewed favourably for her role in the School For Husbands, which was produced by the Theatre Guild.

The song was produced by Arthur Baker and released by Tommy Boy Records in 1982. The recording came together after DJ and producer Baker met with Bambaataa and the two bonded over the idea of creating a song about their mutual appreciation for the band Kraftwerk. Baker and Bambaataa had worked together previously on the song \\"Jazzy Sensation,\\" and decided to compose a more electronic based version of the hip hop song, as opposed to the more disco-oriented work popular at the time. Along with musician John Robie, the group recorded the single at Intergalactic Studios in New York. Robie duplicated the sound on the record and had Bambaataa's rappers in the Soul Sonic Force rap over it. To create the raps, the lyricist of the group, Emcee G.L.O.B.E., had to develop a style he called \\"mc popping\\", which involved rapping off time, an unusual style at the time. The song was released in 1982 and became popular, eventually earning a Gold record certification in the United States, the first for the group and label. The new musical style on the song later became known as electro. The song features simple lyrics discussing the power of music and having a fun time. After its release, the song began to get airtime on the radio. The use of Kraftwerk's music on the song was done without permission. The band approached the label and Tommy Boy's manager, Tom Silverman, eventually agreed to give Kraftwerk one dollar for every record sold. He increased the price of the single to make a return on the record. Attempts to get a full-length album for Bambaataa were not possible with Tommy Boy initially as Silverman's contract with him was strictly for singles and re-negotiating it proved difficult. \\"Planet Rock\\" later was released on the album titled Planet Rock: The Album in 1986. The song was listed as one of the best singles of 1982 by the NME and was described by Robert Palmer of The New York Times as \\"perhaps the most influential black pop record of 1982\\", noting its influence on \\"both the black pop mainstream and several leading white new- wave rockers\\". Several musicians and groups noted how the track influenced them including Run-DMC, 2 Live Crew, A Guy Called Gerald, Fatboy Slim and Newcleus. The song has been remixed and re-released several times, has been described as one of the definitive electro songs by AllMusic, and has been voted the third greatest hip hop song by Rolling Stone. Background Arthur Baker had moved from Boston to New York in 1981 where he had been DJing, producing and mixing records and working as a music journalist as early as 1976. By his own admission, Baker described himself as a \\"shit dj\\" and was more interested in making music despite not being a musician. His musical work included co-producing a few records under the name Northend with singer Tony Carbone and drummer Russell Presto for West End Records. Baker followed these up in the late 1970s with an album he made that was released by Tom Moulton as TJM, followed by \\"Happy Days\\" a single on North End Records. Along with working in the studio, Baker was also writing reviews for the magazine Dance Music Report, which was owned by Tom Silverman who was starting up the label Tommy Boy Records. Afrika Bambaataa had worked as a disc jockey in the mid-1970s working block parties in the south east Bronx. Bambaataa would play a variety of eclectic music and searched throughout New York to find new records. This led to him discovering music by Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra and Gary Numan. Bambaataa met Silverman at one of his DJ sets, which led to working on releases for Tommy Boy including \\"Let's Vote\\" by Nuri and other tracks for a girl group called Cotton Candy. Silverman was concerned that Tommy Boy's record sales were insignificant. He talked to Baker, the only producer he knew, about producing a record. He had Baker produce \\"Jazzy Sensation\\" for Afrika Bambaataa and the Jazzy 5 which was released by Tommy Boy in 1982. The record was successful; Baker estimated it sold 30,000 records. Silverman suggested a two-record a follow-up which led to Bambaataa and Baker creating a record based on their love of the band Kraftwerk. Baker recalled that when he heard Kraftwerk's song \\"Numbers\\" being played at the Music Factory in Brooklyn, he saw \\"black guys in their twenties and thirties asking, 'What's that beat?' So I knew that if we used that beat and added an element of the street, it was going to work.\\" John Robie was a guitarist and synthesizer player who lived in New York. Robie detested disco music, believing musicians did not have to have talent to make it, declaring \\"you had people playing to metronomes, everyone sounding the same, and lyrics that were nonsensical and generally infantile.\\" Although Robie described himself as starting out as a die-hard rock musician, he was a fan of early hip hop music, discussing in 1991 that the genre was \\"a great form of expression [...] What was great about those early rap records was that there was a melodic content to them, they were music at the same time.\\" Robie began meeting with Bambaataa, who showed off his abilities on keyboards after Bambaataa had asked him if he could play music similar to Kraftwerk. Bambaataa contacted Silverman about Robie's talents, which led to him meeting with Baker to work on \\"Planet Rock\\". Robie later recalled on their work together as an \\"unlikely mix of talents was as much of a phenomenon as their record itself. People from totally different backgrounds with completely dissimilar tastes and styles [...] At the time I remember it feeling pretty bizarre.\\" Production Afrika Bambaataa suggested using drums from \\"Super Sporm\\" by Captain Sky for \\"Planet Rock\\". Baker is not sure when \\"Planet Rock\\" was recorded, stating it was either 1980 or 1981. Prior to going into the studio, Bambaataa recalled working at Silverman's father's house in White Plains, New York, working on a bassline taken from BT Express that was not used. Robie, Bambaataa and Baker recorded \\"Planet Rock\\" at Intergalactic Studio. The group had previously recorded \\"Jazzy Sensation\\" at the same studio. The record was completed quickly, as they did not have a large recording budget. Baker said it took approximately three all-night sessions. During the first they developed the music and a bit of the rap. The next night they worked on the rapping, and the final night mixed the record. The studio's equipment included a Neve console, Studer 24–track tape machine and Urei monitors, a Lexicon PCM41 digital delay, Sony reverb and a Fairlight CMI digital synthesizer. Baker said: > They only had a few things, and so we basically got all of our effects out > of the Lexicon PCM41, including Bambaataa's electronic vocal vocoder sound. > That came through a really, really tight delay, almost like a tight > electronic phasing, and then there was the state–of–the–art Sony reverb. > However, other than that, there weren't a whole load of effects on that > record. The group lacked a Roland TR-808 drum machine they could use but found one advertised in The Village Voice—\\"Man with drum machine, 20 dollars a session.\\" They played the musician the Kraftwerk song \\"Numbers\\" and asked to have that programmed into the drum machine. The 808 was programmed through the Neve console, which Baker described as an \\"amazing mixing board\\". In the studio, Baker experimented with the Fairlight CMI and found a few sounds on it, including one of an explosion, which would be used later on \\"Planet Rock\\". He later lamented the Fairlight's lack of usefulness describing it as a \\"$100,000 waste of space.\\" Robie provided the group with a Micromoog and Prophet-5 synthesizers. Baker later praised Robie's studio work, saying he \\"could play. You'd tell him to play something and he'd play it and add something to it. He was really, really good.\\" Baker said it took about eight hours to get the track in working order and develop it first without any rappers. Bambaataa commented \\"a lot of people think we sampled Kraftwerk but it's just not true. John Robie was a bad-ass synthesizer player, so he was just good in playing stuff, that it sounded like they sampled the record.\\" When asked about how much Bambaataa contributed to the record, Baker felt that he was \\"more of an inspiration\\" and \\"definitely had [an] influence\\" but was unfamiliar with studio equipment. When asked in 1985 about his contributions to his records, Bambaataa said he did not do \\"much rapping\\" but helped develop the records, stating that: \\"They may be written or produced by whomever, but you can be sure I had something to do with getting the sound I want, whether it's a certain chant, keyboard riff, drum pattern or a speed-up on the synthesizers.\\" Bambaataa added that whether he works with Bill Laswell of Material or Baker, he \\"usually act[s] as a co-producer\\" and brings \\"one of my groups to come up with a strong rap.\\" Among Bambaataa's suggestions, was using a beat from Captain Sky's \\"Super Sporm\\". Bambaataa was concerned that people would feel they were copying Kraftwerk, so he proposed adding the beat. The group was nervous about how Kraftwerk would react to \\"Planet Rock\\" and developed a separate melody line for it. Silverman eventually stepped in and had the group use the \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" melody. The unused melody would end up being used on \\"Play At Your Own Risk\\" by Planet Patrol. The music for both \\"Play At Your Own Risk\\" and \\"Planet Rock\\" were recorded on the same tape. Influenced by George Clinton, who had many separate music groups that contained the same band members, Bambaataa formed his groups such as the Soul Sonic Force, which in its original form consisted of about twenty members of the Universal Zulu Nation. The personnel used within the Soul Sonic Force whom Bambaataa performed and recorded with was smaller and contained two separate groups with the same name. The first included performers Mr. Biggs, Queen Kenya, and DJ Cowboy while the second variation of the group included Mr. Biggs, Pow Wow, G.L.O.B.E. and DJ Jazzy Jay. The Soul Sonic Force members that contributed to \\"Planet Rock\\" consisted of rappers Mr.Biggs, Pow Wow, and G.L.O.B.E. When they came in to perform the vocals, Baker said that they \\"hated the music. Not even hated it. They despised it.\\" The rappers wanted to perform something closer to \\"Jazzy Sensation\\" and other tracks that were on the R&B; charts. Baker specifically recalled Mr.Biggs refusing to rap on it. Baker recalled that G.L.O.B.E. eventually got the group to rap it by not rapping exactly on the beat. Baker says he cannot remember where the title \\"Planet Rock\\" came from, but that G.L.O.B.E. wrote all of the song's lyrics except the chorus that Baker wrote. G.L.O.B.E. wrote most of the group's lyrics. Baker said he was certain of this and admitted to stealing the \\"Rock rock to the Planet Rock, don't stop.\\" line from the record \\"Body Music\\" by The Strikers, which had the line \\"Punk rock to the punk rock, don't stop.\\" Jay Burnett, who engineered the song, performed the \\"rock rock to the planet rock, don't stop\\" vocal. Bob Rosa provided some overdubbing for the record and approximately 30 hours were spent recording and mixing \\"Planet Rock\\" before the single was mastered and then remastered. Jazzy Jay, an associate of Bambaataa's, described editing \\"Planet Rock\\" as \\"the most tedious thing\\". He recalled Baker being there during the whole editing process: \\"splicing, cutting tape with a razor blade. What we do now with just a few strokes of the keyboard.\\" Music and style Author and essayist Kurt B. Reighley described \\"Planet Rock\\" as a fusion of hip-hop breaks and \\"icy synthesizer lines lifted from Kraftwerk\\" that \\"laid the blueprint for the genre dubbed \\"electro\\". On its release, the genre of the song was not clear. Producer Rick Rubin said that \\"at the time we barely considered it a rap record\\". while DJ Muggs of Cypress Hill said that on the West Coast, hip hop had not hit until around 1984 and people listening to \\"Planet Rock\\" called it funk. Baker described the sound of \\"Planet Rock\\" as a \\"marriage of electronic music with street culture and black music\\". He expanded on this, comparing the use of Kraftwerk's songs to cover songs, noting that \\"Black music has always had cover records. What I was trying to do was mix in the DJ bits of other records. It was a conscious thing. [...] I tried to create what a DJ would do with records.\\" Although acknowledging the influence of Kraftwerk, Bambaataa said the group was only part of the influence on the sound, naming Gary Numan and Yellow Magic Orchestra as inspiration. Describing the song's sound as \\"electro funk\\", Bambaataa said his idea for the song's sound was for it to be electronic but with \\"a lot of funk and heavy bass\\". He noted the influence of James Brown, Sly & The Family Stone, George Clinton and his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. The Soul Sonic Force's look and stage wear—carved African walking sticks, Mardi Gras style headdresses and Zulu beads, a fashion that Bambaataa called the \\"wildstyle\\"—was compared to those of the bands Parliament and Funkadelic. Author William Eric Perkins described \\"Planet Rock\\" as \\"lyrically simple\\", with lyrics that encouraged the listener to have a \\"fun life and a funky good time\\". The lyrics of \\"Planet Rock\\" celebrated the ability of music to take listeners to the past and the future while encouraging them to enjoy the present. The song contains positive messages about \\"chasing your dreams\\", and to \\"live it up\\" because \\"our world is free.\\" Baker described the Soul Sonic Force's rapper G.L.O.B.E. as the genius of the group. G.L.O.B.E. described himself as an \\"MC popper\\" a style Baker summarized as rapping \\"sort of half- time thing. Instead of being on the beat, being off the beat. That was very different at the time.\\" Pow Wow performed the wordless vocal of \\"zz-zz-zz\\" when he could not remember his lines in the song. Baker later commented that if he could change anything in the song it would have been that verse. Release=Initial release= Prior to releasing \\"Planet Rock\\", Baker played the song in various record stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan asking listeners what they thought of it. In an interview with Billboard, Baker said: \\"Ninety percent of the people [I] asked wanted to buy it right away.\\" One person even offered him $200 for his acetate copy. Baker took the acetate into the Music Factory record shop in Brooklyn. It blew up their speakers because of the track's excessive low-end. Sources vary on the release date of \\"Planet Rock\\". An article in Sound on Sound states it was released in June 1982. The liner notes to Planet Rock: The Album state the release was in April 1982. In an interview in the July 24, 1982, issue of Billboard Silverman says that \\"Planet Rock\\" had only been available for 90 days. Shortly after the production, Jazzy Jay was driving on a freeway and heard \\"Planet Rock\\" on the radio and rushed off to phone Bambaataa to tell him about it. Jay was in shock. Earlier meetings with radio station personnel asking them to play hip hop were met with claims it was not a genre but a fad; they refused to play it. The single peaked on Billboards Hot 100 on September 11, 1982, at number 48 and spent 11 weeks on the chart. It went Gold in the United States by October 1982. The group was concerned that Kraftwerk would be angry with them for using the \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" melody. Karl Bartos, the co-writer of \\"Numbers\\", said that \\"in the beginning we were very angry, because they didn't credit the authors [...] [so] we felt pissed off [...] there was nothing written down saying that its source was \\"Trans-Europe Express\\" and \\"Numbers\\".\\" Kraftwerk approached Tommy Boy and Silverman decided to give the group a dollar for each record sold. As a result, Silverman raised the list price of the record stating that the single became \\"$5.98 list 12-inch, as opposed to a $4.98. But by the time he did that, the record was so hot, people just went for it.\\" Wolfgang Flür responded that \\"[t]hey didn't even ask in the first place whether Kraftwerk was in agreement ... the company that had released the single, Tommy Boy Records, had to fork out a lot of money after the event, but they just increased the price of the single [...] and recouped their fine.\\" =Re-releases and remixes= After \\"Planet Rock\\" had been released Silverman said he wanted a 7-inch edit of the song. He knew that John \\"Jellybean\\" Benitez had a quarter-inch, 15\\" tape machine, which led to Baker and Benitez creating the edit of \\"Planet Rock\\" at Benitez's home. Attempts to get a full- length album for Bambaataa were not possible with Tommy Boy as Silverman's contract with him was strictly for singles; re-negotiating the contract proved to be difficult. The followup single to \\"Planet Rock\\", \\"Looking for the Perfect Beat\\" was released in December 1982. A full-length album titled Planet Rock: The Album was released in 1986, which contained the three other singles \\"Looking for the Perfect Beat\\", \\"Renegades of Funk\\", \\"Frantic Situation\\", and three previously unreleased tracks. On May 5, 1992, a remix Extended play (EP) was released by the group on Tommy Boy, which featured remixes by Karl Bartos, 808 State, DJ Magic Mike and LFO. Ron Wynn of AllMusic felt the remixes were unsuccessful, noting that \\"Planet Rock\\"'s \\"hook was old-school, as was its charm. The newer version lacks bite.\\" Paul Oakenfold created a remix of \\"Planet Rock\\" for the soundtrack to the film Swordfish in 2001 which became Oakenfold's first charting single in the United Kingdom. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic described Oakenfold's remix as turning the song into \\"a seven-minute breakbeat trance anthem -- something that would be considered downright blasphemous in many circles\\" The song was remixed again for the film 808 in 2015, featuring remixes by Kaytranada and Boys Noize. Reception Contemporary reviews, in the United Kingdom, included one by Edwin Pouncey of Sounds who praised an import version of the song declaring it a \\"wiilldd paarrtty monster\\" which \\"once heard is never forgotten.\\" The NME placed \\"Planet Rock\\" at 16th on their 1982 best of the year ranking. Nelson George of Billboard referred to the track as \\"one of the summer's biggest singles\\" in 1982. In The Village Voices 1982 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, the single was voted the year's eighth best. Robert Christgau, the poll's supervisor, called it the year's \\"most influential dance record\\" and \\"potentially as influential as 'Rapper's Delight\\".; . Lynden Barber of Melody Maker wrote in 1984 that the song was \\"probably the single most influential record of the Eighties\\" noting it spawned the electro-funk genre and that lead indirectly to a new \\"revolution\\" in how mainstream soul is conceived, recorded and mixed. Robert Palmer of The New York Times called \\"Planet Rock\\" \\"perhaps the most influential black pop record of 1982\\", noting its influence on \\"both the black pop mainstream and several leading white new-wave rockers\\". Contemporary musicians of the period commented on the track, with rapper Melle Mel saying later that \\"Planet Rock\\" had \\"[h]urt all the other rappers\\" noting that Bambaataa and his crew were \\"the only ones to have this real futuristic, synthesized sound. It hurt us because it ripped everything into a different dimension.\\" Brian Chin of Billboard would later say that Melle Mel and Duke Bootee's late 1982 track \\"The Message II\\" was influenced by \\"Planet Rock\\". Baker referred to the \\"mc popping\\" style that G.L.O.B.E. performed on the track as an influence on Run-DMC. Darryl \\"D.M.C.\\" McDaniels said their group's song \\"It's Like That\\" was \\"basically a 'Planet Rock' flow over a beat.\\" Before hearing \\"Planet Rock\\", Cosmo D of Newcleus who had recorded songs such as \\"Jam On's Revenge\\" and \\"Computer Age (Push the Button)\\" said after completing the track \\"Computer Age (Push the Button)\\" that he \\"started hearing this shit on the air, 'Planet Rock'. And I hear this shit, and I said, 'If that shit is a hit, I know \\"Computer Age\\" is a hit'.\\" In the United Kingdom, DJ Gerald Simpson (A Guy Called Gerald) said that going out dancing he started to hear \\"electro-ey stuff – \\"Planet Rock\\" and Newcleus, that kind of vibe. That blew us away back then – dancing-wise it was perfect. Before that we were listening to jazz, funk and soul, where the music was all played live. But this stuff – you know exactly where the beat's gonna come, so dancing-wise you can experiment a bit more.\\" Norman Cook of The Housemartins began DJing at the age of 18 after hearing \\"Planet Rock\\". He said \\"I wanted to make dance music, not white pop music\\". Cook would later find success under the alias of Fatboy Slim releasing albums such as You've Come a Long Way, Baby and platinum albums around the world. Stationed in the UK during 1980s, Mr. Mixx of 2 Live Crew said: \\"I thought, at the time, that it was the most profound record I'd ever heard. It was the crossover point between electronic dance music and R&B.;\\" =Retrospective= Frank Owen commented on \\"Planet Rock\\" in 1990 in Spin, referring to it as \\"year zero of the new dance music\\", noting that it was still a strong influence on American regional scenes with Miami bass, Detroit techno and Los Angeles hip hop. Owen noted that the influence of \\"Planet Rock\\" declined in New York where he believed that what was once was a \\"radical listening experience\\" had become \\"lost under the weight of endless imitations that followed in its wake.\\" John Bush, a writer for the AllMusic database praised the song, declaring that \\"no single encapsulates the electro era quite like Planet Rock,\\" while finding that \\"[t]he rapping, though not up to later standards, does make an improvement on the rather lame rhymes and lack of rhythm from the first few rap singles to hit the market.\\" François K, a musician, studio producer and engineer who has worked with Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, Diana Ross and The Cure declared that \\"Planet Rock\\" was the song he most associated with New York in the early 1980s, adding that \\"there was nothing else that could touch that record [...] There was nothing that year that could top what \\"Planet Rock\\" did.\\" In 2012, Rolling Stone polled 33 music journalists, executives and hip hop producers and rappers to create a list of the 50 greatest hip hop songs of all time. \\"Planet Rock\\" was placed at number three on the list, with Chuck D of Public Enemy proclaiming it \\"as important as Willie Mitchell or Booker T. were to the Memphis scene. There hasn't been a song like it in hip-hop since.\\" Track listing 12\\" single (TB 823) # \\"Planet Rock (Vocal)\\" – 6:25 # \\"Bonus Beats I\\" – 1:15 # \\"Planet Rock (Instrumental)\\" – 9:16 Credits Credits adapted from the liner notes and expanded with information in the article.

Starting on 7 June at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. The Americans played 15 first-class matches captained by George Stuart Patterson. The match the Philadelphians played against the MCC was to be Patterson's last first-class cricket match. The tour introduced American bowler J Barton King to the international cricketing world. Tour results John Barton King, widely considered to be the best bowler produced by the United States, was a sensation on the 1897 tour. This tour was a very ambitious one for the Americans. They had last toured the British Isles in 1889. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a relatively low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on 17 June. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth on a fourth-wicket stand of 107 runs with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets. Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won while the team lost nine and earned a draw on four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match King again shined by taking 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scoring 46 runs. According to the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs more than anyone else. His average was just over 24 runs each for 72 wickets. In addition to his work bowling, King scored 441 runs with an average of just over 20. Captain George Patterson's best innings batting was 162 runs at Trent Bridge against Nottinghamshire. Controversy Having returned home from the tour, there were claims in the Philadelphia Public Ledger that the Philadelphians had been treated unfairly by the English umpires, but Patterson put those rumors to rest with a letter to the editor of an American newspaper: > My attention has been directed to a letter signed W.S. in the Field of July > 24th, enclosing a clipping from the Philadelphia Public Ledger, severely > criticising the umpiring in the Philadelphian matches during our tour > through England. I wish to state on behalf of the Philadelphia team that the > sentiments expressed in the clipping are not those of the team, and that we > emphatically repudiate any insinuation of unfair treatment. On the contrary, > we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness both on > and off the field. I wish to take this opportunity of making a public > acknowledgement of our indebtedness to Mr. Perkins, of the M.C.C., for the > umpires assigned to us, and to testify, unnecessary though it be, to their > ability and integrity. The calming words from Patterson on the issue seem to have defused the situation in Philadelphia.

The magazine is published by Allured Business Media. It is delivered to 97 countries on a monthly basis, and is geared toward formulators, scientists, researchers, chemists and R&D; management in the industry. The magazine is available in both print and online magazine format. The headquarters is in Northbrook, Illinois. History The publication began in March 1906 as \\"The American Perfumer\\", a monthly magazine published by Ungerer & Company. In September 1906, the name changed to \\"The American Perfumer and Essential Oil Review\\", and the publisher changed to The Perfumer Publishing Company. At that time, the perfumery business was more prominent than cosmetics. By 1935, the Moore Publishing Company bought the magazine. In 1956, Maison G. deNavarre had been writing and editing for the magazine for 24 years, and in January of that year, the owners again changed the magazine’s name to \\"American Perfumer and Aromatics\\". The publication focused on perfumery, aromatics and flavors, but deNavarre incorporated the occasional personal care product; for example, hand creams and royal jelly. In the early years of the magazine, there was no mandatory labeling of product ingredients, and cosmetic companies were afraid to have their scientists publish for fear of giving away trade secrets. In March 1960, the Allured family purchased the \\"American Perfumer and Aromatics\\" from Moore Publishing. In 1961, the name was changed again to \\"American Perfumer and Cosmetics\\". The owners explained this change in the June 1962 issue: “The change in name that you see on the cover, and on top of this page, is in belated recognition of an editorial fact of over 30 years’ duration. During this period this magazine has gradually meant more and more to the cosmetic chemist and pharmacist, as these specialties became the major customer for fragrances. In turn, the perfumer has been more and more involved in the technical problems that new cosmetic materials have forced upon him.” In January 1972 the name was changed to American Cosmetics and Perfumery, recognizing the changes taking place in cosmetic raw materials, cosmetic research and development, and cosmetic business in general. The publisher, Stanley E. Allured, believed the future of the personal care industry existed in new cosmetic raw materials and in new cosmetic product ideas. He would canvass cosmetics companies and hold meetings with R&D; vice presidents and laboratory managers to determine what should be covered in the magazine, as well as to encourage them to write articles for the magazine. In 1973 the title was changed again to Cosmetics and Perfumery. In January 1976, the publication was divided into two separate magazines: Perfumer & Flavorist and Cosmetics and Toiletries. In January 1979, an ampersand was substituted in Cosmetics and Toiletries to produce the current title, Cosmetics & Toiletries.  Other editions  Cosmetics & Toiletries Brazil is the Brazilian version of Cosmetics & Toiletries magazine, published nine times per year in Portuguese. Cosmetics & Toiletries E-newsletter is a weekly e-newsletter, with news, trends and formulations via e-mail. Cosmetics & Toiletries Bench Reference is a directory of cosmetic ingredients and sources for raw materials.

While this bacterium was first isolated from human spinal fluid, it has since been found in many different environments due to its various characteristics and metabolic capabilities. P. stutzeri is an opportunistic pathogen in clinical settings, although infections are rare. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, this bacterium has been placed in the P. stutzeri group, to which it lends its name.  Taxonomy  P. stutzeri is most easily differentiated from the other Psuedomonas spp. in that it does not produce fluorescent pigments. P. mendocina, P. alcaligenes, P. pseudoalcaligenes, and P. balearica are classified within the same branch of pseudomonads as P. stutzeri based on 16S rRNA sequences and other phylogenetic markers. Of this group, P. stutzeri is most closely related to P. balearica and they can be differentiated not only by the 16S rRNA sequences, but also by the ability of P. stutzeri to grow above 42 °C. P. stutzeri has been isolated in many different locations, and since each strain is a little different based on where it was isolated, the P. stutzeri group contains many genomovars. This means that the many strains of P. stutzeri can be considered genospecies, which are organisms that can only be differentiated based on their nucleic acid composition.  Discovery  Burri and Stutzer first described P. stutzeri in 1895 and named the bacterium Bacillus denitrificans II. Seven years later in 1902, Itersonion developed an enrichment culture for P. stutzeri, which was later described by van Niel and Allen in 1952. The enrichment medium is a mineral medium with 2% nitrate and tartrate (or malate, succinate, malonate, citrate, ethanol, or acetate) grown under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C. The organism has been isolated from a wide variety of places such as human spinal fluid, straw, manure, soil, and canal water.  Characterization  Pseudomonas stutzeri is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium that is typically 1–3 microns long and 0.5–0.8 microns wide. It is a microbe that tests positive for both the catalase and oxidase tests. P. stutzeri grows optimally at a temperature of about 35 °C, making it a mesophilic organism, although it can grow at temperatures as low as 4 °C and as high as 44 °C. When grown on a lysogeny broth (LB) medium at 32 °C, this bacterium has a doubling time of about 53 minutes. As the temperature is decreased to approximately 28 °C, the doubling time gets longer and can become as high as 72 minutes. On an asparagine (Asn) minimal medium, however, P. stutzeri has a typical doubling time of about 34 minutes. Despite the differences in doubling time between the two media, P. stutzeri reaches its stationary phase around 10–11 hours after being inoculated, or introduced, into both media. P. stutzeri grows best in media containing 2% NaCl although it can tolerate a salinity, or salt content, ranging from 1–5% NaCl. This bacterium prefers a neutral pH, a pH of 7, but it can grow at a pH as high as 9. P. stutzeri possesses both type IV pili and a polar flagellum, both of which help it to be motile. In relation to metabolism, all Pseudomonas bacteria were originally thought to be incapable of fixing nitrogen. Several Pseudomonas species, including P. stutzeri, however, have since been discovered that have demonstrated the ability to fix nitrogen. In fact, when the genome of the P. stutzeri strain DSM4166 was sequenced, it revealed some genes for nitrogen fixation along with 42 genes that coded for major parts of a denitrification complex. Scientists hypothesize that the genes needed to fix nitrogen were acquired by these specific bacterial species through lateral gene transfer.Similar to other bacteria within the Pseudomonas genus, P. stutzeri strains are heterotrophic organisms that are capable of reducing metals and degrading compounds such as hydrocarbons. Unlike other bacteria within the genus, however, P. stutzeri strains are not fluorescent. = Growth conditions = P. stutzeri strains are capable of growing on several various types of media because they can use different electron donors and acceptors to fuel their metabolisms. The bacterium frequently utilizes organic compounds as its electron donors, some of which include: glucose, lactate, acetate, succinate, pyruvate, sucrose and fumarate. As an electron acceptor, P. stutzeri will either use oxygen, if it is in aerobic conditions, or nitrate, if it is in anaerobic conditions. While the bacterium has been shown to grow on solid media (such as gelatin and agar), liquid media (such as nitrate or nitrite-free media), and even potatoes, it shows optimal growth on peptone or yeast agar. When in aerobic environments, P. stutzeri can even grow on more complex media such as lysogeny and Reasoner's 2A (R2A) broths, with the latter of the two being significantly useful in selecting for specific microbes due to its lack of abundant nutrients. Each of the assorted media produce their own slight variations in the phenotypes of the P. stutzeri colonies that result from growth. Some of these variations include changes in surface film or mucus production, changes in texture (such as addition of ridges), or changes in shape (such as circular to polygon-like). = Colony characteristics = While the microbial colonies of P. stutzeri can alter based on what medium the bacterium is grown on, there are conserved, distinguishable characteristics that are apparent in almost every colony of this species. When examined on solid media, this bacterium has dry, rigid colonies that cling together so tightly it is often easier to remove an entire colony, if needed, rather than just a piece of one. The color of the colonies is usually brown, although it can deviate with a change in media. The shape of each colony mimics that of a crater because the exterior edges are raised, forming a depression in the center. The edges of each colony project outwards often allowing colonies to come into contact with one another.  Metabolism  P. stutzeri is a facultative anaerobe that utilizes respiratory metabolism with terminal electron acceptors such as oxygen and nitrogen. When grown anaerobically, organisms within the genus Pseudomonas are considered to be model organisms for studying denitrification. Strains tested by Stainer and coworkers were able to grow and utilize the following substrates: gluconate, D-glucose, D-maltose, starch, glycerol, acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, propionate, fumarate, glutarate, glycolate, glyoxylate, DL-3-hydroxybutyrate, itaconate, DL-lactate, DL-malate, malonate, oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate, pyruvate, succinate, D-alanine, D-asparagine, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, L-isoleucine, and L-proline and hydrolysis of L-alanine-para-nitroanilide. D-maltose, starch, and ethylene glycol are carbon sources that are not commonly utilized by other pseudomonads as shown by Stainer et. al. = Thiosulfate oxidation = Some strains of P. stutzeri are known to use thiosulfate as an inorganic energy source. In 1999, Sorokin et. al isolated and described seven strains of P. stutzeri that were able to use nitrite, nitrate, or nitrous oxide as electron acceptors in the oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate under anaerobic conditions. The oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate cannot support autotrophic growth as it only yields one electron, therefore strains that perform this are obligate heterotrophs.Thiosulfate oxidation can occur in the presence or absence of oxygen, although it occurs much slower under anaerobic conditions. = Phosphite and hypophosphite oxidation = In 1998, Metcalf and Wolfe enriched for and isolated a P. stutzeri strain WM88 that could oxidize reduced phosphorus compounds, such as phosphite and hypophosphite, to phosphate. To enrich for a hypophosphite-utilizing organism, a 0.4% glucose-MOPS medium containing 0.5 mM hypophosphite was used as the sole phosphorus source with inoculum from a variety of soil and water environments. Specifically, strain WM88 can use phosphite as its sole phosphorus source when grown in succinate- MOPS medium. When grown anaerobically, the researchers showed P. stutzeri is unable to perform hypophosphite oxidation with nitrate as its electron acceptor. However, phosphite oxidation is unaffected under similar conditions. = Hydrocarbon degradation = Aliphatic hydrocarbon degradation  In 1913, a strain of P. stutzeri was one of the first microorganisms to be identified as a degrader of alkanes. There is not much information in the literature about other aliphatic hydrocarbon degrading strains of P. stutzeri, however strain KC has been studied extensively due to its potential biotechnological applications. Strain KC was isolated from an aquifer and it is able to transform carbon tetrachloride to carbon dioxide, formate, and other less dangerous products. Carbon tetrachloride can be a pollutant in soils and groundwater, and according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) it is able to cause kidney damage and even death in individuals exposed to it for long periods of time. For biotechnological purposes, strain KC can mineralize carbon tetrachloride, which is useful for in situremediation of aquifers contaminated with carbon tetrachloride.  Aromatic hydrocarbon degradation  Aromatic compounds, such as benzene, are considered to be environmental pollutants despite their natural prevalence in nature. Strain P16 of P. stutzeri is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degrading bacterium that was isolated from creosote-contaminated soil via a phenanthrene enrichment culture. As the sole carbon and energy source, strain P16 is able to grow using phenanthrene, fluorene, naphthalene, and methylnaphthalenes. In conjunction with the anionic surfactant Tergitol NP10 and phenanthrene, strain P16 has been proposed to be a model for looking at the effects of surfactants on non-aqueous hydrocarbon bioavailability.  Genomics  The inclusion of this bacterium into the Pseudomonas genus was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization and similarity comparisons of the rRNA sequences. Four rrn operons and an origin of replication site have been identified in P. stutzeri. Strains of P. stutzeri are divided into separate genomic groups called genomovars. The genomovar concept was used for P. stutzeri to distinguish genotypically similar strains. Two strains of P. stutzeri can be classified in a single genomovar if DNA-DNA similarity is at least 70% similar. Seven genomovars have been characterized and their genome sizes range from 3.75–4.64 Mbp. These differences in genomovar genomes are believed to have been caused by chromosomal rearrangements during its evolution. The GC content of the genomes of P. stutzeri strains falls between 60 – 66 mol%. P. stutzeri strain DSM4166 is a strain that has been studied and shown specifically to have exactly 61.74% GC content in its circular chromosome. While this strain appears to have no plasmid in coordination with its chromosome, it is thought that the strain has 59 tRNA genes and 4 rRNA operons. When doing global genome comparisons between multiple P. stutzeri strains, it has been found that many of the genomic regions of this bacterium's genome are conserved between varying strains. One of the strains that has been found to vary is strain RCH2. This strain has an extra 244 genes which are believed to aid the bacterium in chemotaxis and in the formation of both a pilus and the pyruvate/ 2-oxoglutarate complex. When this strain was sequenced, it was found to have a 4.6 Mb circular chromosome and three plasmids.  Ecology  Originally, P. stutzeri strains were misidentified with other species in similar growth environments due to the limitations of phenotypically similar bacteria of Pseudomonas. P. stutzeri is found widely in the environment and occupies a diverse range of ecological niches including being found to be an opportunistic pathogen in humans. The habitats and ecology of P. stutzeri are diverse not only because of its ability to grow organotrophically or anaerobically using oxidative metabolism, but also because of its chemolithotrophic properties, its resistance to metals, the wide sources of nitrogen it can use, and the range of temperatures that support its growth. P. stutzeri genes have been found in the rhizosphere region of soil implying the relevance of this bacterium as a nitrogen fixer. This bacterium has been isolated from oil-contaminated soil and marine water/sediment samples. While most Pseudomonas strains that have been isolated from marine environments are eventually transferred to another genus after classification, P. stutzeri is one of the few strains that has not. This strain meets the requirements of being able to tolerate NaCl and it is found in water columns in the Pacific Ocean and sediments in the Mediterranean. These marine strains have many ecological roles including naphthalene degradation, sulfur oxidation, and most importantly denitrification and diazotrophy (nitrogen fixation). There is also evidence of P. stutzeri in wastewater treatment plants. ZoBell, AN10, NF13, MT-1, and HTA208 are the most significant strains isolated from marine environments and have been found in places such as water columns in the Pacific-ocean, polluted Mediterranean marine sediments, Galapagos rifts near hydrothermal vent at depths of 2500 meters, and Mariana trench samples at 11 000 meters. Several other P. stutzeri strains have even been found in other locations such as manure, pond water, straw and humus samples.  Relevance = Health = Several strains of Pseudomonas stutzeri have been found to behave as opportunistic pathogens in humans. It was not until 1973, however, that P. stutzeris ability to cause infection started to become a topic of discussion within scientific literature.The first known infection was observed in combination with a permanent tibial fracture that required surgery. Since that initial infection, P. stutzeri has been able to cause infections within individuals that have a variety of illnesses, including: endocarditis, infections of the bone, eye, skin or urinary tract, meningitis, pneumonia, arthritis, and several others. Some patients even have health conditions as serious as tumors, infected joint cavities and collapsed lungs. Within those infected, P. stutzeri strains have been isolated from the blood, feces, cerebral spinal fluid, ears, eyes, and organ systems (such as respiratory and urinary). When strains of this bacterium are discovered within infected patients they are often accompanied by other pathogenic microbes. While P. stutzeri has caused numerous infections since it has been discovered, it has caused few deaths, giving it a much lower virulence rating in relation to other Pseudomonas species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Despite its lack of major virulence, however, this bacterium still poses a threat to human health because it contains a variety of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. In fact, P. stutzeri has so many resistance mechanisms that antibiotic-resistant P. stutzeri strains have been discovered and isolated for almost every antibiotic family except fluoroquinolones. Some of the more-studied resistance mechanisms include: utilization of beta- lactamases, which are able to cleave penicillins, cephalosporins, and other antibiotic classes, and ability to vary lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane protein components. In order to gain resistance to fluoroquinolones, mutations in the gyrA (gyrase gene) and parC(topoisomerase IV gene) are often needed, mutations which are not as common. Only one strain of P. stutzeri, strain 13, has been found to have mutations that allow it to be resistant to fluoroquinolones. The reason P. stutzeri strains are less of a concern for major antibiotic resistance as compared to other Pseudomonas strains, like P. aeruginosa, is likely due to the fact the strains are less common in clinical settings and thus less frequently exposed to antibiotics. = Environmental = Some strains of P. stutzeri are capable of associating with pollutants and toxic metals, such as biocides and oil derivatives, in such a way that allows the bacterium to promote the degradation of these substances. Other strains of this bacterium have metabolic capabilities, such as metal cycling, that allow for the preservation of essential metals, such as copper and iron, and the degradation of toxic metals, such as uranium and lead. One specific strain of P. stutzeri, strain RCH2, is currently being studied as a potential tool for the bioremediation of soil and water supplies since it has shown an ability to reduce hexavalent chromium concentrations in areas where this pollutant is high. Several other P. stutzeri strains, such as strain A15, have demonstrated an ability to reduce atmospheric nitrogen so they are being explored as agents to help increase plant growth. These strains are specifically being studied for use in rice plants because they have been shown to naturally infect and inhabit the roots of these plants. By living within the roots, P. stutzeri is able to supply the plants directly with the reduced nitrogen compounds they produce. = Microbiological = Several different strains of P. stutzeri have been found to be competent for natural genetic transformation. The frequency of transformation between individuals of the same P. stutzeri strain is typically high. Between individuals of different strains, or between P. stutzeri strains and other Pseudomonas species, however, the frequency of transformation is usually greatly reduced. The complete genome sequence of a highly transformable P. stutzeri strain, strain 28a24, has been determined and is available for observation.

Its original French title is La Kermesse héroïque and it is widely known under that name. A German-language version of the film was made simultaneously and was released under the title Die klugen Frauen, featuring Ernst Schiffner in one of his early film roles. Plot In 1616, when Flanders is part of the Hispanic Monarchy, the town of Boom, in the midst of preparations for its carnival, learns that a Spanish duke with his army is on the way to spend the night there. Fearing that this will inevitably result in rape and pillage, the mayor -- supported by his town council -- has the idea of pretending to be newly dead, in order to avoid receiving the soldiers. But his redoubtable wife Cornelia despises this stratagem and organises the other women to prepare hospitality and to adapt their carnival entertainments for the Spaniards (who insist on entering the town anyway). Such is the warmth of the women's welcome that not only do the Spaniards refrain from misbehaviour, but on their departure the Duke announces a year's remission of taxes for the town. Cornelia allows her husband to take the credit for their good fortune, but she has in the meantime thwarted his plans for their daughter to marry the town butcher instead of the young painter Brueghel whom she loves.

He turned to a short story written at his suggestion ten years earlier by Charles Spaak, set in 17th century Flanders when it was under Spanish occupation. For the visual style of the film, Feyder wanted to pay tribute to the old masters of his native country -- Brueghel, Frans Hals, Pieter de Hoogh -- and an elaborate creation of a Flemish town was undertaken (in suburban Paris) by the designer Lazare Meerson. Sumptuous costumes were provided by Georges K. Benda.Georges Sadoul. Dictionnaire des films (Paris: Seuil, 1983), pp.164-165. The strong cast included Feyder's wife Françoise Rosay and Louis Jouvet. The film was produced by the French subsidiary of the German firm Tobis, and it was made in two versions, French and German, with alternative casts (apart from Françoise Rosay who appeared in both). Reception On the strength of its richly detailed tableaux and the confident manner in which Feyder animated his historical farce, the film enjoyed considerable success in France and elsewhere in the world. The film historian Raymond Chirat pointed to the combination of the admirable sets, the splendid costumes, the biting irony of the story, and the quality of the acting which earned the film a cascade of awards, the admiration of the critics, and the support of the public.Raymond Chirat. Le cinéma français des années 30 (Renan: 5 Continents, 1983), p.34. Georges Sadoul referred to \\"this important work, of exceptional beauty\\".Georges Sadoul. Le cinéma français (Paris: Flammarion, 1962), p.74. Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a good review, praising director Feyder for his ability to add \\"into his ribald story a touch of the genuine, and simple emotion\\". Comparing the film to Restoration prose, Greene claims that the \\"photography moves with a fine strut\\", and summarizes it as \\"an admirable film, a little obscene like most good comedies, and beautifully acted\\". (reprinted in: ) Feyder won the Best Director Award at the 4th Venice International Film Festival in 1936. However, even on its first appearance in 1935 this tale of occupation and cheerful collaboration also caused uneasiness, and the screenwriter Henri Jeanson deplored the \\"Nazi inspiration\\" of the film. It was indeed enthusiastically praised in Germany, and its première in Berlin (15 January 1936) took place in the presence of Joseph Goebbels. (Yet, a few days after the outbreak of war in 1939, the film was banned in Germany and the occupied countries of Europe, and Jacques Feyder and Françoise Rosay subsequently sought refuge in Switzerland.)Georges Sadoul. Le cinéma français (Paris: Flammarion, 1962), p.75. It was in Belgium that the film caused greatest controversy, perhaps for the unflattering portrayal of Flemish leaders in the 17th century, or in suspicion of covert references to the German occupation of Belgian territory during the First World War. At any rate, the release of the film led to brawls in cinemas in Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges.Jean-Pierre Jeancolas. 15 ans d'années trente (Paris: Stock, 1983), pp.176-177. Even two decades later (1955), its enduring reputation irked François Truffaut who wrote, in a broadside against so-called 'successful' films: \\"In this regard, the most hateful film is unarguably La Kermesse héroïque because everything in it is incomplete, its boldness is attenuated; it is reasonable, measured, its doors are half-open, the paths are sketched and only sketched; everything in it is pleasant and perfect.\\"François Truffaut. The films in my life; translated by Leonard Mayhew (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1978), p.35. Nevertheless, this remains probably the most popular and widely known of Jacques Feyder's films.

It was designated a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. Despite its name, it is not located within either the Washington Park community area or the Washington Park park, but is one block north of both. The district was named for the Park.Hayner, Don and Tom McNamee, Streetwise Chicago, \\"Washington Park Court\\", p. 130, Loyola University Press, 1988, The district includes row houses built between 1895 and 1905, with addresses of 4900-4959 South Washington Park Court and 417-439 East 50th Street. Many of the houses share architectural features. The neighborhood was part of the early twentieth century segregationist racial covenant wave that swept Chicago following the Great Migration. The community area has continued to be almost exclusively African American since the 1930s. Architecture Washington Park Court, which runs one-way northbound from East 50th Street to East 49th Street, is a one-city block-long street located at 432 east in the Chicago street numbering system. Officially, it runs from 4900 south to 5060 south in the numbering system. The street and several adjacent homes at one end are recognized as a distinct district within the city, according to the City of Chicago Department of Planning and Development. In May 1990, the district was one of ten that were under consideration for Chicago Landmark status, and it was designated a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. The district was named for the Park, which was designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. The T. G. Dickinson Real Estate Company, which created the subdivision in 1892, mandated setbacks for all properties and originally sold lots in small groups of two or three. Between 1895 and 1905, the tone of the district became clear with the development of its row houses. In 1990, the district contained forty-nine row houses that span a wide variety of architectural styles including Classical Revival and Romanesque. As of 2004, the district contained fifty-one properties. The street hosts residential designs of architect Henry Newhouse and of developers Andrew and John Dubach. At least twenty-five of the lots were developed by the Dubaches and at least twelve of the properties were designed by Newhouse. Their architectural contributions set the tone for the block, which uses mostly brick and limestone houses that share porch and cornice lines. Most houses have mansards or recessed roofs with bay fronts. Demographic change Between 1900 and 1934 the African American population in Chicago grew from 30,000 to 236,000. The population was initially diluted in scattered places, but during this time, due to the change in the demographics of Chicago, it became concentrated in two large strips of land. The racial concentration was enforced by violence for few decades, until restrictive covenants became the preferred way to enforce segregation. Although they were previously rare, racially restrictive covenants among property owners that outlawed the purchase, lease, or occupation of their properties by African Americans became common in Chicago in the 1920s following the Great Migration, especially after the 1926 United States Supreme Court upheld racially restrictive covenants in Corrigan v. Buckley (). During the first half of the 20th Century, The Black Belt was the term for the African-American neighborhood from 22nd Street to 31st Street along State Street on Chicago's South Side. South Side local businessmen and the University of Chicago became alarmed at the prospect of poorer blacks moving from the Black Belt due to a combination of racial succession and economic decline. Because 85% of Chicago was covenanted, most black neighborhoods were bounded by covenanted areas. The Washington Park Court Improvement Association changed its focus from neighborhood improvement projects, such as planting shrubs and cleaning streets, to upholding segregationist policies. When necessary, the organization resorted to violence to pursue its segregationist purpose, and between 1917 and 1921, bombs were used to discourage encroachment into majority white neighborhoods. The bombs were used at the residences of African Americans as well as the properties of real estate agents and bankers. Eventually the term Black Belt included the region from 39th Street to 95th Street between the Dan Ryan Expressway and Lake Michigan. Since the 1930 United States Census, the Grand Boulevard community area has been over 90% African American. In both the 1960 and 1990 Census, the community area was over 99% African American. As of the 2000 Census, the area was 98.2% African American and 0.8% Hispanic.

An RTA can range from a small PDA-sized device to a rack-mounted hardware unit to software running on a laptop. It works by measuring and displaying sound input, often from an integrated microphone or with a signal from a PA system. Basic RTAs show three measurements per octave at 3 or 6 dB increments; sophisticated software solutions can show 24 or more measurements per octave as well as 0.1 dB resolution.  Types  There are generally two types of RTAs: # RTAs employing analog signal processing, and # RTAs employing digital signal processing (DSP). The main difference between the two types is that the analog RTAs use a series of hardwired, analog bandpass filters to break the signal into frequency bands prior to measuring it. Digital RTAs use digital sampling technology and microprocessor based digital signal processing to perform necessary calculations, such as fast Fourier transforms, to perform the measurements and thus do not need analog hardware filters to isolate each frequency band. The digital approach to signal analysis generally yields much higher accuracy and resolution and thus most RTAs currently in production use digital signal processing technology.True Audio FAQ Digital signal processing is more cost effective. = Professional use = RTAs are often used by sound engineers and by acousticians installing audio systems in all kinds of listening spaces: Venues, home theatres, cars etc. The parameters that can be measured are the spectral aspects of sound reproduction caused by effects like resonances and constructive and destructive interference, but not imaging and spatial aspects. In professional audio many systems incorporate an RTA along with a device that also performs equalization. While measuring pink noise or other test tones, such a controller can level out the frequency response by employing a set of adjustments in the appropriate frequency areas according to the system's interaction with the venue's size, shape and construction materials, among other things.

It has published continuously since 1898, making it the longest running Sámi publication still being published. History Nuorttanaste (modern Northern Sámi spelling Nuorttanásti), which means \\"The Eastern Star,\\" was founded by “sled preacher” Gustav Lund, a travelling pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Norway who sought to evangelize Sámi in part by using their native tongue. In 1898, he founded Nuorttanaste in Finnmark, and the paper soon began publishing news articles and letters from readers alongside its religious content. The reporters and correspondents balanced the publisher's desire for religious content with readers' desire to receive news in their native language. The first issue of Nuorttanaste was printed by Lund using a portable printing press. As the paper grew, it established formal offices in Sigerfjord. Over the years it moved several times before setting up its first permanent printing press was in Gáivuotna. The press alternated between Gáivuotna and Oslo for several years before setting up offices in Vuonnabahta in 1960. In 1992, the paper's headquarters moved to Kárášjohka. For much of its history, including during World War II, Nuorttanaste published twice a month; it currently publishes 11 issues each year. It has subscribers in Norway, Sweden, and Finland. =Editors= *1898–1912: Gustav Lund *1912–1916: Ole A.

Therefore the paper played a major role in supporting Sámi literacy, along with Sámi language and culture. For most of its publication history, Nuorttanaste has used the J.A. Friis orthography, which is the same writing system used for the Sámi Bible. From 1948 to 1958, the paper used the Bergsland–Ruong orthography, which was the standard for writing Northern Sámi in Norway and Sweden (but not Finland), before reverting to the J.A. Friis orthoraphy. Since 2004, Nuorttanaste has used the pan- Scandinavian 1979 orthography.

The screenplay by Elmer Rice is based on his 1931 Broadway play of the same title.Counsellor at Law, ibdb.com; accessed August 5, 2015.Counsellor at Law screenplay info, TCM.com; accessed August 5, 2015. Plot The story focuses on several days in a critical juncture in the life of George Simon, who rose from his humble roots in a poor Jewish ghetto on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become a shrewd, highly successful attorney. Earlier in his career, he allowed a guilty client to perjure himself on the witness stand because he believed the man could be rehabilitated if freed. Rival lawyer Francis Clark Baird has learned about the incident and is threatening to expose George, which will lead to his disbarment. The possibility of a public scandal horrifies his socialite wife Cora, who plans to flee to Europe with Roy Darwin. Devastated by his wife's infidelity, George is about to leap from the window of his office in the Empire State Building when his secretary Regina, who is in love with him, comes to his rescue.

Brown and Conway Washburn reprised their roles from the Broadway production.\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com *Vincent Sherman made his film debut in Counsellor at Law. He had previously appeared in a Chicago production of the play. Production L. to. R. : Joseph P. Bickerton, Jr. (theatre producer), Elmer Rice (playwright) and Carl Laemmle Jr. (Universal producer) sign a contract for the film version of Counsellor at Law After directing a series of films he considered inconsequential, William Wyler was happy to be assigned to a prestigious project based on a play that had enjoyed successful runs on Broadway and in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Producer Carl Laemmle Jr. paid $150,000 for the screen rights, an unusually high price tag during the Great Depression, and to ensure the film's success he hired Elmer Rice to adapt his own play.Herman, p. 114 In early August 1933, Wyler met Rice in Mexico City, where he was vacationing with his family, for preliminary discussions about the script. Rice was loath to mix business with pleasure and assured the director he would begin working as soon as his holiday ended. On August 22, he shipped a first draft from his New York office to Universal Pictures. Wyler approved of the screenplay, and principal photography was slated to begin on September 8.Herman, pp. 114-115 Laemmle wanted to cast Paul Muni as George Simon, the role he had created on stage, but the actor declined because he feared being typecast as Jewish. Edward G. Robinson, Joseph Schildkraut, and William Powell were considered before Laemmle decided to cast against type and offer the role to John Barrymore in order to capitalize on his box office appeal. Both Wyler and Rice wanted to cast performers from the various stage productions, and although several screen tests were made, most of the roles were filled by studio contract players. Vincent Sherman, who had been in the Chicago production, was signed to reprise his small role of Harry Becker, a young radical with Communist leanings; he later became a prolific film and television director.Herman, pp. 115-116 Another cast member, Richard Quine, then 13, similarly went on to a career as a director, writer and producer. Soon after filming began, Wyler realized much of the material Rice had excised from his play was necessary to build scenes, and he began incorporating it back into the screenplay. Eventually he worked with both the screenplay and play script at hand, a procedure he would follow when making The Little Foxes in later years.Herman, p. 115 Barrymore had signed for $25,000 per week, and Wyler was ordered to film all his scenes as quickly as possible. What should have taken two weeks ultimately took three-and-a-half because the actor could not remember his lines. After taking twenty-seven takes to complete one brief scene, Wyler decided to resort to cue cards strategically placed around the set. Also adding to delays was Barrymore's heavy drinking, which frequently gave his face a puffy appearance that required the makeup crew to tape his jowls. Between dealing with Barrymore and trying to comply with Laemmle's demands to complete the film on schedule and within the allotted budget, Wyler was tense and irritable and tended to take out his frustrations on the supporting cast.Herman, pp. 116-118 Three months after filming began, the film opened to critical and commercial success at Radio City Music Hall on December 11, 1933.Herman, p. 119 Reception=Box office= The film was a box office success,Hirschhorn, Clive (1983). The Universal Story. London: Octopus Books. p. 80. . described by film historian Elizabeth Kendall as a \\"highbrow hit\\",Kendall, Elizabeth (2002). The Runaway Bride: Hollywood Romantic Comedy of the 1930s. Cooper Square Press. p. 73. . although a New York Times article in November 1934 termed it a commercial disappointment for Universal. =Critical reception= Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times said the film \\"moves along with lusty energy, the scenes being so complete that none of them seems a fraction of a minute too long. Parts of the stage work have perforce been omitted, but where this occurs Mr. Rice and the director, William Wyler, leave nothing in doubt.\\" He praised Barrymore for giving his role \\"the vigor, imagination and authority one might expect\\" and added, \\"The characterization is believable and thoroughly sympathetic.\\"Hall. Mordaunt \\"Counsellor At Law (1933): John Barrymore in a Pictorial Conception of Elmer Rice's Play 'Counsellor-at-Law.'\\" The New York Times (December 8, 1933) The Hollywood Reporter said the film proved \\"the value of having a playwright adapt his own brainchild to the screen.\\" It also praised Wyler for giving it \\"a far better tempo than the play possessed\\" and added, \\"He milks each situation and lets it go without stressing . . . many scenes which could easily have ensnared a less capable director.\\" Years later, in a critique of Barrymore's career, Pauline Kael described his portrayal of George Simon as \\"one of the few screen roles that reveal his measure as an actor.\\"Kael, p. 124 References Notes Bibliography *Herman, Jan, A Talent for Trouble: The Life of Hollywood's Most Acclaimed Director.

He is recorded by Fordun, in his Scotichronicon, and in Extracta ex variis Cronicis Scocie as \\"Robertus de Lavedir 'the good'\\" Early mentions The eldest son of Sir Robert de Lawedre of the Bass (d. September 1337) by his wife Elizabeth (d. before 1358), he was probably born about 1310 and is described in Rymer's Foedera (vol.iii, p. 1022) as the eldest son of Sir Robert de Lawedre, one of the Scottish Ambassadors in 1323 who had been sent to negotiate peace with England. This Robert fils was attached to the train as a page. In a charter in the Calendar of the Laing Charters, A.D. 854 - 1837 (page 10, number 32) there is a Precept originally written in Norman-French by Patrick de Dunbar, Earl of March, to Sir Robert de Lawedre, younger, (le fitz) for heritable sasine of the reversion of the lands of Whitelaw within the Earldom of Dunbar, plus 10 livres yearly from the mill of Dunbar, and the farms and issues of the granter's said town ('ville') of Dunbar, according to the terms of charters to the grantee. Dated at Berwick-upon-Tweed, 20 October 1324. Career and estates In 1328 he was appointed Justiciary of 'that part of Scotland on the North side of the Water of Forth,' his main estate being close to Elgin in the province of Moray. The Exchequer Rolls record that \\"Roberto de Lawedir de Moravia, knight\\", received annual fees from the Exchequer in 1329. Thirty five years later, on 1 October 1363, in a charter of the Great Seal of Scotland (no.163), King David II confirmed a pension of £20 per annum upon the ageing \\"Robert de Lawedre, militi,\\" from this post. Lachlan Shaw writes \\"the first proprietor of Quarrelwood, of whom we have any distinct account, is Sir Robert Lauder or Lavedre. His father, also Sir Robert, was Justiciary of Lothians, and Ambassador to England in the time of King Robert Bruce, and engaged in similar service for King David Bruce. Both father and son seem to have been present at the battle of Halidon Hill, on 20 July 1333, after which fatal event the younger Sir Robert, being Justiciary of the North, hastened to occupy the Castle of Urquhart on Loch Ness, one of the few fortalices which held out against the power of Edward I of England. He held the lands of Quarrelwood, Grieshop, Brightmoney, and Kinsteary, which continued to be possessed by his descendants, in the female line, for many generations. He designated himself as 'Robertus de Lavadre, Dominus de Quarrelwood, in Moravia.' This Robert Lauder obtained a charter from John Pilmore, Bishop of Moray, for good services, of the half davoch [a davoch was at least 416 acres] lands of Aberbreachy, and the lands of Auchmunie, within the Barony of Urquhart, dated at Elgin in the feast of St. Nicholas, 1333. He founded a chaplianry in the Cathedral Church of Moray for his own soul, and those of his ancestors and successors. The Deed is dated at Dunfermline, 1 May 1362, which gift is confirmed by a Writ from King David Bruce, dated at Elgin, the 10 May, in the 38th year of his reign. Sir Robert is said to have had a family of sons and daughters. One daughter was married to Sir Robert Chisholm, and her father conveyed to her, or her husband, in her right, the lands of Quarrelwood, Kinsteary, Brightmoney and others.\\" Sir William Fraser, as well as the Scalacronica (p. 161), mention \\"Robert de Lawder the younger\\" being captured near Jedburgh in a skirmish between his party led by Sir Andrew de Moray and Archibald Douglas when they ambushed the party of Edward Baliol, in 1332. James Young (1884, p. 36/7) also states that this Robert de Laweder fought alongside Archibald Douglas during the battle of Halidon Hill, and quotes a MS Chronicle of England which described the battle. He also cites Wyntown's De orygynale cronykel of Scotland, written before 1424. Bain lists Scots who have been forfeited of properties by King Edward III between 1335 - 1337. Robert de Lawedre fils has forfeited the dower lands in Paxton, Berwickshire which his daughter Mariotta then held from him, the \\"villa\\" [town] of Whitelaw, East Lothian, and half the domain lands of Stenton (where he is described as his father's son and heir), the other half being retained by his mother Elizabeth. Bain also has a charter dated circa 1335 which mentions numerous properties in and around Berwick-upon-Tweed which Robert the Bruce had granted to Sir Robert de Louwedere (another spelling in the same charter is Lowedre) senior, and his son Robert. Berwick having now fallen into the hands of the English, Robert de Lawedre junior is forfeited of these properties which are granted by Edward III of England to Adam of Corbridge. His father having died, young Lauder was also forfeited, in 1337, of his paternal inheritance: the lands of \\"Balmegon\\" (Balgone), \\"Balnegog\\", Wester Crag [Craig], Garvald, Fanulton (Fenton), Newhall, Popil, all in Haddingtonshire, and lastly Auldcathy in Linlithgowshire. The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland have \\"Domini Roberti de Lawedre\\" in 1337 as the owner of lands in Inverness-shire, and Forres. They included \\"Dreketh\\", and \\"Banchori\\". \\"Sir Robert de Lawedre, Justiciar of Scotland on the north side of the water of Forth\\" was present at the siege of Falkland Castle in February 1337 when he was one of the witnesses to a charter by Duncan (or Donnchadh IV, Earl of Fife,1288–1353), to Dame Beatrix de Douglas, widow of Sir Archibald de Douglas, knight, (presumably he who fell at Halidon Hill), of the barony of Wester Caldor, for life, and after her death to her sons and heirs by Sir Archibald. About 1340 Robert de Lawder, Justiciary, was a witness, with James Lord Douglas, Robert de Keith, Henry St.Clair, Alexander de Seaton, all knights, plus the \\"Lord\\" William, Rector of the parish of Morham, East Lothian, to a charter of Euphemia, the widow of Sir John Giffard, Lord of Yester, relating to the tenement of land of \\"Barow\\" (today: Bara, East Lothian). This Sir Robert was also at the Battle of Neville's Cross, as he is mentioned, with others, as being taken prisoner there in Rotuli Scotiae in Turra Londinensi et in Domo Capitulari Westmonasteriensi asservati (London, 1814–19, 2 vols) under date 8 December 1346. Last mention James Young (1884, p. 38) mentions a charter by which this Sir Robert gave some land \\"in and near his burgh of Lauder\\" to Thomas de Borthwick, which is witnessed by John de Mauteland [Maitland], the sixth of the Lauderdale family. J.Stewart-Smith (1898) mentions the same charter and adds that this was possibly in 1370 and that John Maitland's brother William was also a witness. This charter was attested by Sir Robert's son, Alan, and his grandson, \\"Roberto filio Alani tunc Ballio de Lawedre\\". Children Sir Robert's wife is unknown. However there are records of at least five children, three boys and two girls: * William de Lawedre, 'senior', of Burgh Muir, Edinburgh, who died without issue in 1375. * Alan de Lawedre, of Whitslaid (Berwickshire), and of Haltoun House (d. before March 1406/7), his heir. * Mariotta de Lawedre, mentioned as \\"filia Roberti de Lowedre\\" living in a tenement [of land] at Paxton (possibly at Edrington) of which Robert is being forfeited by the English, 1335-36. * Ann de Lawedre, who married Sir Robert Chisholm, from Roxburghshire, and upon whom her father settled much of his northern lands. In the National Archives of Scotland (RH1/2/128) is a charter of Robert de Lauedre, Knt., in favour of Robert de Chesholm of that ilk of lands, rents, etc., belonging to Lauedre, dated 27 July 1366.

The theatre is a historic, 1140 seat entertainment venue in North Tonawanda, New York. The theatre hosts a multitude of performing arts events per year, including live concerts, theatre, dance shows, and movies. The Riviera's “Mighty Wurlitzer” theatre organ has been fully restored, is continually maintained by volunteers, and is famed as being one of two original Wurlitzer demonstrator organs, which the company would use to show off to potential clients in the height of the silent film era. History A local landmark and movie house, the theatre was constructed in 1926 to much fanfare, and was originally named \\"The New Rivera.\\" The first films shown were Upstage starring Norma Shearer and The Mona Lisa. The Wurlitzer Theatre organ installed in the theatre: Opus 1524 was shipped from the nearby (4 mi) Wurlitzer Organ Factory on November 19, 1926. Listed as a Model 235 Special, the organ differed from a standard 3 manual 11 rank Model 235, by substituting an Oboe Horn rank of pipes from the standard Salicional pipes usually found on this model. Other differences included the omission of the standard remote Piano, and a 5 H.P. blower instead of the 7-1/2 H.P. The console was painted and decorated to harmonize with the theatre's interior, by Wurlitzer's Band Organ Artist. The theatre was also a popular vaudeville venue. During the Depression, the theatre was purchased by the Shea's Theater company. At the end of the silent movie era in the 1930s, the Wurlitzer Theatre organ went into disuse and disrepair and was not heard again until 1944, when it was refurbished. The Riviera was sold to Dipson Theatres and then to MDA Associates. The theatre changed hands many more times since then. In the early 1970s, The Niagara Frontier Theater Organ Society (NFTOS) made an offer to purchase the Wurlitzer organ for a substantial amount, along with the provision the instrument must remain in the theatre. This offer was eventually accepted, the NFTOS owned the organ and assured its future. The club enhanced the theatre itself with the purchase of a huge crystal chandelier that formerly graced the Genesee Theatre in Buffalo. Installed in the Riviera's main dome in January 1974, the chandelier measured 10 feet in diameter, 14 feet high, contained 15,000 French crystals and had 3 circuits of 35 bulbs each. A smaller chandelier that came from the Park Lane Restaurant of Buffalo was installed in the Riviera's outer lobby at the same time. Also, added to the stage equipment was a scenic backdrop donated from a Bradford (PA) Theatre. A historic grand piano was also acquired from the same theatre at the same time. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1980. Note: This includes and Accompanying seven photographs Changing economics threatened to shutter or destroy the theatre on numerous occasions, but it is now a great source of community pride for residents of the Tonawandas. Rumor has it that at one point in the 1980s Buffalo-born singer Rick James tried to purchase the theatre for a recording studio. In 1988, the theatre was purchased by the NFTOS, now named the Riviera Theatre and Organ Preservation Society, Inc. (RTOPS), a 501(c)3 non-profit volunteer organization. The theatre was painstakingly restored by volunteers donating thousands of hours of labor and has been continuously operated by RTOPS since then under the direction of different managers. The Riviera is most notable for its Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre organ, which was produced in North Tonawanda, once the home of the Rudolph Wurlitzer Company. In 2008, the organ was re- voiced and restored to nearly original condition, providing a new symphonic sound for concerts and events. The Riviera's Mighty Wurlitzer has provided more entertainment consistently in its original setting than most other Theatre organs, nationwide. Many top name artists, in this country, have performed here in hundreds of concerts over the past 35 years. The Riviera's organ is acclaimed internationally by artist appearances from Europe, Australia, Britain and South America. Several popular organists played their ‘first’ public concert at the Riviera Theatre. The organ has been televised on several occasions, and several commercial recordings have been made on it.  Present & Future  In 2014, the theatre's marquee was fully restored and modernized by Flexlume Sign Corp., and Wagner Signs. This included restoring the original paint colors, neon, and flashing lights. In place of the plexiglass letter board, two LED video screens now display upcoming events, the content of which was specifically created by the Riviera's design specialist, to imitate the grid and original metal lettering on the board. In 2015, like most movie theaters, the Riviera was forced to upgrade to a Digital Cinema system in order to continue to play films, as 35mm films were phased out. This was made possible by grants and generous community donations. The theatre's new digital cinema system boasts optimum cinema picture quality and will continue to carry the Riviera's rich movie history for years to come. Plans are now underway for a capital campaign (Set The Stage), and 23,000sq.ft. expansion of the theatre to include new production and patron spaces, new larger bathroom facilities, an elevator to the balcony level, as well as expanded lobby, bar, and concession facilities. The $6.1M expansion will also include a meeting space, rehearsal and black box theatre performance space to incubate arts groups from around the area. Mission The Riviera Theater is a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to preserve and maintain the Historic Riviera Theatre and the Mighty Wurlitzer Organ and to promote the performing arts. Support from the community and patrons is greatly appreciated and necessary in order for the theater to remain a thriving, regional cultural destination for generations to come.  Leadership and Staff  The Riviera Theatre is owned and operated by the Riviera Theatre & Organ Preservation Society, a 501c3 not-for-profit organization. It is led by a Board of Directors who consist of local community leaders and theatre volunteers. The theatre also boasts a solid roster of hundreds of dedicated volunteers who work countless hours for events as ushers, ticket scanners, box office personnel, concessions workers, cleaners, and organ engineers.

It is currently in the collection of the Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris.Henri Matisse, Le Peintre dans son atelier, 1916-17, Musée National d'Art Moderne, Centre Georges Pompidou, ParisAgence photographique de la réunion des Musées nationaux In this work Matisse depicted himself in his studio on the fourth floor of 19 Quai Saint-Michel, at work on his painting Laurette in a Green Robe (1916). Laurette in a green robe, the painting Matisse portrayed himself working on in The Painter and His Model This painting belongs to the series of Matisse's studio with views of l'Île de la Cité and the Pont Saint-Michel. According to Matisse (when the painting was acquired by the Musée National d'Art Moderne in 1945), this work was painted in 1917. But the picture in progress on the easel, Laurette sur fond noir, robe verte (Laurette in a Green Robe), Metropolitan Museum of Art, is signed and dated 1916.Isabelle Monod-Fontaine, Anne Baldassari, Claude Laugier, Œuvres de Matisse, Paris, Éditions du Centre Pompidou, Collections du Musée national d'art moderne, 1989 The Painter and His Model represents the same model, Laurette, sitting on a pink armchair, silhouetted against the dark background of the studio wall; suggesting the two works were painted around the same time, at the end of 1916.

Art historian Jack Flam further emphasizes the color ratios (the use of black) and composition between the canvas and the MNAM painting and two of the most important works of 1916, Les Demoiselles à la rivière and Les Marocains.

Along with Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, Le bonheur de vivre is regarded as one of the pillars of early modernism. The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage. Description In the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar to the group depicted in his painting The Dance (1909–10). In the picture, there are several nude bodies of women and men in a landscape drenched with vivid color. Inspiration \\"The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially Pablo Picasso, who, in an effort to outdo Matisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed Les Demoiselles D’Avignon\\", writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes Foundation. James B. Cuno and Thomas Puttfarken suggest that the inspiration for the work was Agostino Carracci's engraving of Reciproco Amore or Love in the Golden Age after the similarly named painting by the 16th- century Flemish painter Paolo Fiammingo. Based on the many similarities with the engraving, in particular its theme of pastoral fantasy and its composition with the circle of dancers in the background, Cuno came to the conclusion that Carracci's engraving had a decisive influence on the final composition of Le Bonheur de Vivre.James B. Cuno, Matisse and Agostino Carracci: A Source for the Bonheur de Vivre, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 122, No. 928, Special Issue Devoted to Twentieth Century Art (Jul., 1980), pp. 503–505Thomas Puttfarken, Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and ‘gli Amori de’ Carracci, Burlington Magazine 124 (Apr. 1982): 203–208.Andrew Graham-Dixon, The Dance by Henri Matisse According to Hilton Kramer Le bonheur de vivre, owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the Barnes Foundation which never permitted its reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic principles that had governed his Fauvist paintings which had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too.\\"Kramer, Hilton, The Triumph of Modernism: The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006, Reflections on Matisse, p. 162. (The \\"sequestration\\" Kramer referred to relates to the very limited hours of the museum, when its collection was located in suburban Merion, Pennsylvania; in 2012, the collection was moved to a new, more accessible facility in downtown Philadelphia.) Conservation Le bonheur de vivre features a large amount of cadmium sulfide-based yellow. Portions of the painting containing cadmium sulfide are turning white or brown, degrading the work. University of Delaware Prof. Robert L. Opila, in collaboration with Barbara Buckley, head of conservation at the Barnes, and Jennifer Mass, a senior scientist and head of the Scientific Research and Analysis Laboratory at Winterthur, studied the paint’s material microstructure in an attempt to determine why the cadmium sulfide is changing color.UDaily, Matisse Mystery, Materials science reveals clues about pigment degrading on painting, University of Delaware, Dec. 20, 2011 “It is a very disheartening phenomenon, considering the painting’s position in history,” says Opila, professor of materials science at UD. Preliminary tests carried out by UD doctoral student Jonathan Church at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, show that carbon dioxide is reacting with the cadmium sulfide, causing the formation of cadmium carbonate, which is white. Also, the presence of chloride in the paint appears to be acting as a catalyst for the deterioration. Opila and his research team theorize that the binder, an oil similar to linseed oil, may be turning brown. “The scientific studies being undertaken will contribute significantly to the preservation of the painting and to our understanding of the change that has taken place to the visual appearance of the painting,” says Buckley.

There were around 150 pupils aged 14–16 on the school roll before closure. History Originally known as the Pensnett Secondary Modern School, it was opened in 1932 for pupils aged 11 years and above in the expanding Pensnett area of the Brierley Hill district. Several modern extensions and improvements were added to the original school building over the years. Eric Hancock was the Headmaster of Pensnett Secondary Modern School from 1956 until his retirement in 1972. Hancock had purchased the old organ from nearby St Mark's Church in Brierley Hill, for use by the school orchestra. He also made school uniform and homework compulsory, and was one of the first head teachers at secondary modern schools in the area to give pupils the chance to study O Levels. Eric Hancock died in December 1986 at the age of 79.Dudley News, 12 December 1986 The retirement of Mr Hancock in 1972 coincided with the redesignation of the school as a 12-16 school in September of that year. September 1975 saw the school follow suit of all other secondary modern and grammar schools in Dudley (which Brierley Hill district became part of in 1966) by converting to comprehensive status. It retained comprehensive status until closure; however, the age range was reverted to 11-16 in September 1990. New technology classrooms were added in the early 1990s, with the new department being officially opened in 1993. In September 2007, the school underwent a name change from Pensnett School of Technology to Pensnett High School. Three arson attacks at the school in spring 2010 caused hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage.

However, these plans were scrapped in March 2009 by Dudley Council due to financial technicalities. Dudley Council soon afterwards announced plans to close the school at the end of the 2009/10 academic year. Despite widespread opposition by pupils, staff, parents and members of the local community, the decision to close the school was made on 29 December 2009 with effect from July 2010. However, it remained open for two years as a learning centre for the oldest two year groups in the school, before completely closing in July 2012, bringing an end to 80 years of education at the site. Just after the decision to close the school was confirmed, it was revealed that Pensnett High had once again been the lowest ranking school in the borough for pupils studying for GCSEs being completed in summer 2009.

Reardon, at age 42, perished after being swept to sea by a rogue wave, shortly after climbing a sea cliff at Dohilla in County Kerry, Ireland.Michael Reardon, 42; free solo rock climber is swept away by rogue wave - Los Angeles Times General information Michael Reardon was one of only a few professional free-solo climbers. He traveled the world looking for the next ultimate solo climb, giving motivational speeches and presenting slideshows. Reardon was known for leaving mementos for those who followed him. Examples include plastic tigers attached to bolts, the Ninja Turtles, blow up dolls, and oversized panties in summit registers. He lived with his wife Marci and daughter Nikki in Oak Park, California. Climbing history Reardon started climbing as a child on the boulders in his grandfather's backyard. Together with his cousins, both his climbing skills and his interest in climbing were challenged and developed. Bouldering in a backyard turned to three-day hikes in the Appalachian Mountains, and then to hiking in the Rocky Mountains. Reardon eventually found himself in California where his climbing skills were fostered even further. Reardon’s first formal climb was at Tahquitz, California on a 1,000-foot route called Whodunit (5.9), with a “crusty old climber.” As the story goes, halfway up the route, the crusty handed Michael some gear and told him, “You’ll use these when you’re scared.” After the successful ascent, the pair had enough time to climb a 500-foot 5.7. Reardon had now officially caught the climbing bug. Because he didn’t have any friends to climb with, or any gear of his own, Reardon was forced to start climbing without ropes. He returned to the 5.7 climb, and soon found himself at the top, without having to rely on any ropes. Scholastic history Reardon attended the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating with B.S. degrees in Philosophy and Political Science, then later graduated from the Pepperdine University School of Law with a Juris Doctor Degree. Professional history Reardon acted as the Head of Business Affairs for Harvey Entertainment, then as a Partner/the Head of Production of Black Sky Entertainment. At the time of his death, he owned Jumprunner Productions, a video production company that produced several documentaries about notable rock climbers. Death At 5pm Irish Standard Time on July 13, 2007, Reardon was reported missing after he was hit by a rogue wave and swept out to sea, shortly after climbing down the 600-foot (180m) Fogher Cliff (Lat 51.9236; Long −10.3556) just west of Valentia Coast Guard Station in County Kerry, Ireland. A coastal search was immediately undertaken by the nearby Coast Guard lifeboat, a rescue helicopter, cliff rescue teams and local people, who searched unsuccessfully.http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30200-1275216,00.html His body was never recovered.

The spectrum matches a stellar classification of G8 III, with the luminosity class III indicating this is an evolved giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. It reached this stage in only 550 million years because higher mass stars such as this consume the supply of hydrogen more rapidly than the Sun. The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is . At the estimated distance of Eta Draconis, this yields a physical size of about 11 times the radius of the Sun. From its extended envelope, it is radiating around 60 times the luminosity of the Sun at an effective temperature of 5,055 K, giving it the yellow glow of a G-type star. Eta Draconis B is located at an angular separation of 5.1 arcseconds from the primary. This is an 8.8 magnitude K-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of K2 V. At the estimated distance of this star system, the two stars are separated by a physical distance of at least 140 AU and require at least a millennium to complete an orbit.

The oil on canvas measuring 23 by 26 inches is in the National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C. Matisse's style changed and evolved drastically throughout his career, including a wide and varying collection of paintings depicting the female nude. His Odalisque paintings were inspired by his trip to Morocco. Many of the female subjects in the Odalisque paintings were modeled after Matisse's main model at the time, Henriette Darricarrère. Composition The subject of the painting is a woman sitting in a green and yellow striped armchair. Her figure and the chair take up the majority of the canvas. She is nude except for sheer, gold-trimmed harem pants that covers her legs and touches the floor. The woman is heavily sexualized by her suggestive pose and how Matisse portrays the curvature of her body. Her breasts are round and idealized. The brushwork in the painting is loose and shows the gestural movements of the artist. The painting has very little spatial depth, forcing the viewer to confront the woman in the foreground. The architectural and decorative elements further focus the viewer on the seated female. The shadows and curvature of her body is accentuated in contrast with the flat rendering of patterns in the planes behind her. The red decorative element, possibly a tapestry or a painting, hanging on the wall and the striped armchair that she is sitting in offer movement to the viewer's eye. Matisse's sources This painting is in dialogue with the tradition of the reclining female nude. The history of the depicting the nude female figure is far too vast to contrast Odalisque with Raised Arms with every painting of a nude woman. It is notable that modern painting was especially interested in straying from convention, and teachings from academic art. This slight rebellion can be seen in the manner in which Matisse paints his subject. She is only semi-reclined, her eyes are open, and though she is not engaging with the viewer by eye contact she seems to exude a level of awareness. Her attitude is reminiscent of Édouard Manet's Olympia. The gaze of the prostitute in the painting prevents easy contemplation of her body, she is guarded, she is challenging you, and she is dominating the relationship between the viewer and herself, with her as the object being viewed.Dolores Mitchell, \\"Manet's \\"Olympia\\": If Looks could Kill.\\" Source: Notes in the History of Art 13, no. 3 (1994): 39. Matisse's model Matisse's model for many of his paintings including Odalisque with Raised Arms is Henriette Darricarrière. Darricarrière was born in 1901, she studied ballet, violin, piano, and painting. She sat for Matisse from 1920 to 1927.Jane Aldin, Twentieth Century, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 56, no. 2 (1998): 62. Morocco and the Odalisque Matisse was inspired to paint his Odalisque's by his trip to Morocco in 1912, he argues for the legitimacy of the subject by stating “‘I do Odalisques in order to do nudes. But, how does one do a nude without being artificial? And then I do them because I know they exist. I was in Morocco, I have seen them”Jack Flam, Matisse on Art, (London, 1995), 86. The word “odalisque” is derived from the Turkish word Odalik, which means chambermaid or female harem slave. Matisse would recreate the Moorish interior that he experienced on his trip by decorating parts of his studio with his collections of “oriental” objects such as tapestries, mirrors, ornate screens, decorative wall hangings, and elaborate costumes.Judith Wilkinson, Reclining Nude 1924, Tate Fauvism Matisse created many Odalisque paintings in the nineteen-twenties, when Henriette Darricarrière was his main model, and when he was still working loosely under the style of fauvism. Fauvism in painting is characterized by the isolation of individual brush strokes on the canvas and coloristic freedom that moves away from naturalistic representation.Charles W. Millard, Fauvism, The Hudson Review 29, no. 4 (1976): 578. The repetition of the Odalisque as the subject was in a way a medium for Matisse to work through and explore his artistic purposes.John Elderfield, Pleasuring Painting : Matisse's Feminine Representations, New York, N.Y: Thames and Hudson, 1996, 40.

It was directed by Mark Robson, and stars Douglas Dick, Jeff Corey, Lloyd Bridges, Frank Lovejoy, James Edwards, and Steve Brodie. The original play featured the protagonist being Jewish, rather than black. The National Board of Review named the film the eighth best of 1949. Home of the Brave managed to combine three of the top film genres of 1949: the war film, the psychological drama, and the problems of African-Americans. The film utilizes the recurrent theme of a diverse group of men being subjected to the horror of war and their individual reactions, in this case, to the hell of jungle combat against the Japanese in World War II. Plot Undergoing psychoanalysis by an Army psychiatrist (Corey), paralyzed Black war veteran Private Peter Moss (Edwards) begins to walk again only when he confronts his fear of forever being an \\"outsider\\". The film uses flashback techniques to show Moss, an Engineer topography specialist assigned to a reconnaissance patrol who are clandestinely landed from a PT boat on a Japanese-held island in the South Pacific to prepare the island for a major amphibious landing. The patrol is led by a young major (Dick), and includes Moss's lifelong white friend Finch (Bridges), whose death leaves him racked with guilt; redneck-bigot corporal T.J. (Brodie); and sturdy, but troubled, Sergeant Mingo (Lovejoy). When the patrol is discovered, Finch is left behind, and captured by the Japanese, who force him to cry out to the patrol. The dying Finch escapes, and dies in Moss's arms. In a firefight with the Japanese, Mingo is wounded in the arm, and Moss is unable to walk. T.J. carries Moss to the returning PT boat that covers the men with its twin .50 calibre machine guns. In the film's crucial scene, the doctor forces Moss to overcome his paralysis by yelling a racial slur. From this point on, Moss will never again bow to prejudice. Mingo and Moss decide to go into business together.

After his discharge, he wrote a play called Home of the Brave in nine consecutive nights that was inspired by a photograph of GIs in a South Pacific jungle.

Acquired through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest L'Atelier Rouge, also known as The Red Studio, is a painting by Henri Matisse from 1911, in the collection of The Museum of Modern Art, New York City. Matisse and \\"The Red Studio\\", Robert F. Reiff, Art Journal, Vol. 30, No. 2 (Winter, 1970-1971), pp. 144-147, retrieved online December 25, 2007 In 2004, L'Atelier Rouge came in at No. 5 in a poll of 500 art experts voting for the most influential of all works of modern art, along with works by Pablo Picasso, Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol.1 December 2004 \\"Duchamp's urinal tops art survey\\" BBC News  Formal Analysis  This work depicts Matisse's atelier (studio) that he had built for himself in 1909, entirely awash in one tone of vibrant, rusty red. At 64 inches by 51 inches, the interior still life successfully accomplishes a monumentality while also seeming inviting. Unassertive yellow lines create the outlines of Matisse's furniture, creating objects out of the expansive red space. A grandfather clock sits approximately in the center of the composition, serving as a vertical axis that brings balance and harmony to the spatial discontinuities of the studio. The paintings and objects within the room, seemingly suspended in the sea of red, establish a sense of spatial depth by creating angles and perspective in an otherwise flat picture. They also give the eye a place to rest and bring a sense of harmony to the colors. Most of the objects are painted with whites, blues, and greens, colors that contrast and balance the thinly-applied red paint. There is also a tabletop that dominates the bottom left corner of the canvas, jutting out from the edge as if the viewer were next to it and looking down from a corner of the room. The spatial discontinuities of the table, the objects in the room, the chairs on the right side of the canvas, and the window on the left wall give the sense that this is the artist's environment, dominated by creativity and color more than laws of natural order.  Influences  If one was to put L'Atelier Rouge in the chronology of Matisse's artistic production, it would land immediately after his Fauvist paintings. Created in 1911, the work is a singular, culminating expression of several key aspects of Matisse's artistic development up to that point. That is to say, the painting reflects the influence of Fauvism, Impressionism, Post- Impressionism, his early travels abroad, and his own emerging artistic code. For example, the red that dominates the canvas is evocative of his earlier work The Dessert: Harmony in Red (1908), yet it also illustrates compelling differences: exaggerated forced perspective, thinner washes of color, and a pared down composition. These differences are indicative of Matisse's growing concern with \\"a) the orchestration of pure colors and b) the search for a stable composition with the simplest means.\\" For instance, the painting bears the influence of Impressionism in its lack of focal point, but it is clear that focal point was abandoned in favor of the compositional balance and harmony Matisse so desired. Similarly, the expressive use of color and forced perspective is comparable to Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh's The Night Café, yet once again it is clear how Matisse adapted these elements to his own aesthetic interests. In L'Atelier Rouge, the expressive use of color and lack of focal point work together to create harmony and balance. Even Fauvism, a style which Matisse himself developed with other artists in Paris, leaves its mark on the work in the use of bold color and disdain for realistic, representational painting. Matisse also made several significant trips just prior to the creation of L'Atelier Rouge. He visited an Islamic exhibition in Munich; the Moorish cities of Seville, Córdoba, and Granada in Spain; and St. Petersburg and Moscow.Nicholas Watkins. \\"Matisse, Henri.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed March 2017. One can see how this impacted the development of his aesthetic, as his tones and decorative motifs become more exotic–almost playful in his experimentation with forms and colors.  Legacy  Matisse's technique in L'Atelier Rouge to use just one bold, rich color to create the entirety of the composition–by strategically using the absence of the red–would significantly impact the succeeding generations of Modern artists. This accomplishment is considered by some a direct precursor to color field painting, best exemplified by artists such as Mark Rothko and Kenneth Noland.Alastair Sooke, \\"Matisse.\\" In Modern Masters. BBC. September 27, 2011. For example, upon closer inspection, the pale \\"lines\\"—that carve the objects out of the red space and dictate the perspective of the room—are not lines at all. Rather, the lines themselves are constructed by the absence of the red paint. That is to say, Matisse originally painted the canvas a pale yellow. He then painted over that color with a thinly applied rusty, rich red, leaving thin bands of the under-color to serve as line. This same approach can be seen in works by Frank Stella, although he left bands of raw canvas. Similarly, the technique of layering color to establish depth or perspective—without formal use of line—serves as a crux for most of color field painting.

Its seven-kilometre seashore is lined with pine trees. It is the location of the legend upon which the Noh drama Hagoromo is based; on the second Saturday and Sunday of October, the city of Shizuoka holds a Hagoromo Festival and a performance of the Noh drama takes place near the pine tree of the legend. It was designated as a National Places of Scenic Beauty of Japan in 1922. In 2013 the pine groves were added to the World Heritage List as part of the Fujisan Cultural Site. Overview Miho no Matsubara is renowned as a seashore with green pine trees and sand spanning over seven kilometers. It has a great scenic view of Mount Fuji and the Izu Peninsula across Suruga Bay. Due to its natural environment, it is designated as one of along with its three pine groves. Additionally, it has been selected as one of the top 100 white sand beaches and green pine groves of Japan. It has an old pine tree dating back 650 years called Hagoromo no Matsu and is said to be where the angel wearing a Hagoromo floated down. The Miho shrine nearby preserves a piece of her plumage. Miho no Matsubara is known as the site of the legend of Hagoromo (\\"The Feathered Robe\\"), which is based on the traditional swan maiden motif. The story of Hagoromo concerns a celestial being flying over Miho no Matsubara who was overcome by the beauty of the white sands, green pines, and sparkling water. She removed her feathered robe and hung it over a pine tree before bathing in the beautiful waters. A fisherman named Hakuryo was walking along the beach and saw the angel. He took her robe and refused to return it until she performed a heavenly dance for him. As the angel could not return to heaven without her robe, she complied with Hakuryo's request. She danced in the spring twilight and returned to heaven in the light of the full moon leaving Hakuryo looking longingly after her. (See Arthur Waley, Hagoromo. The No Plays of Japan. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1922.) A statue of Hakuryo watching the dance is at the entrance to the park. On the second Saturday and Sunday of October, the city of Shizuoka holds a Hagoromo Festival near the site of the old pine tree. The Noh play Hagoromo is performed by firelight (Takigi Noh) and also creative dances in honor of the French ballet dancer Hélène Giuglaris are performed. Giuglaris (1916–1951) loved the story of Hagoromo very much but never saw the Noh performance, nor did she visit Miho during her lifetime. Nonetheless, her dying wish was, \\"Bury my hair near the Hagoromo pine tree at Mihonomatsubara beach\\".Helene Giuglaris Above the Mihonomatsubara beach, overlooking the pine tree and the sea, is a monument to Giuglaris, and a lock of her hair lies beneath it. The monument shows Giuglaris holding a Noh mask, and below her figure is a poem written by her husband, Marcel Giuglaris, who visited Miho four months after Elene's death with a lock of hair and her dance costume Pine Grove at Miho, and Helene Giuglaris, English translation (anonymous): The wind of Miho's Breaking waves Speaks of She in Paris Whose life Hagoromo took away. If I listen, my days Will take flight. Present Miho no Matsubara no longer has white sands. The sands are now uniformly black, perhaps from the volcanic rock that first formed the peninsula. One local resident's story is that the Abe River provided the white sand that made Miho such a scenic spot. During construction of the nearby Shinkansen line, too much of the Abe River's white sand was used. Over time, the sea swept away the layers of white sand and no new sand was available to replenish the sand carried out to sea.

Set in the village of Trémolat on the river Dordogne, it tells the story of a deeply troubled butcher (Jean Yanne) who falls in love with the head teacher of the school (Stéphane Audran) but she, though happy to be a close friend, refuses a physical relationship. The film had a total of 1,148,554 admissions in France. Plot At the wedding of the assistant teacher of the village school, the head teacher is placed next to the butcher. She is Hélène, close to age 30 and single, who gets happily tipsy. He is Popaul who, after 15 years in the army, has just come home to take over the family shop and falls instantly for his attractive neighbour. Over the next few weeks they see more of each other, sharing meals, going to the cinema, and exchanging little presents. She says she is no prude, but after an unhappy affair does not want him to touch her. He says he joined the army to get away from a hateful father and repeatedly dwells on awful things he saw in Indochina and Algeria. The peace of the friendly little village is however shattered when a young woman's body is found, killed by a knife, and the police cannot come up with a suspect. When Hélène takes the school for a picnic on a hillside, blood from a second freshly-killed corpse drips onto the children. It is the bride of the assistant teacher, and at the site Hélène finds an unusual cigarette lighter she gave to Popaul. Keeping quiet about it to the police, she hides it in a drawer at home. Next time Popaul calls to see her, she asks him to light her cigarette and he does it with an identical lighter. She relaxes, confident that the lighter beside the murdered woman was not his. He offers to paint her ceiling, coming round to do it one evening when she has to go into town. Looking for a cloth to clean up with, he finds the lighter she had hidden and pockets it. When she gets home and finds the lighter gone, she realises that he knows she can identify him as the murderer. She starts locking all her doors and windows, but he is already in the house and, cornering her at knife point, starts trying to explain what drives him to do these things. When she breaks into tears over his suffering, he thrusts the knife into his abdomen. She drags him into her car and rushes off to hospital. During the drive, he confesses more of the huge psychic burden he has laboured under: On arrival he asks her to give him their first kiss on the lips, after which he dies.

Life Very little is known about this artist other than that he likely came from Casentino. Giorgio Vasari incorrectly identified him as a member of the Landini family and that is the reason why in the past he was referred to as Jacopo Landino. Vasari also incorrectly placed his origins in Arezzo. It is likely he received his training in Florence in the milieu of the Master of St Cecilia. His career appears to have been confined to the first half of the 14th century. He was one of the founders of the Compagnia di S Luca (Company of Painters), which was under the patronage of the Virgin and Saints John the Baptist, Saint Zenobius, Saint Reparata, and Saint Luke and was elected in 1339 its first consigliere.Andrew Ladis. \\"Jacopo del Casentino.\\" Grove Art Online.

Casentino popularized these altars throughout Italy along with artists such as Bernardo Daddi (1280 – 1348) . His work shows the influence of Giotto (1267 – 1337), with whom Daddi apprenticed. Casentino may have spent time in Giotto's workshop and have been a pupil of another Giotto follower, Taddeo Gaddi (1300 – 1366). Casentino also showed an influence from the Sienese School of painting.

It was devised by the Centre Suisse de Formation et de Perfectionnement Horloger and is sponsored by manufacturers and retailers within the horological industry in Switzerland. Origin During the 1960s, and at the request of the U.S. Government, the Swiss government created what would eventually evolve into WOSTEP- Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry FH. It was originally designed to train American watchmakers in techniques of watchmaking that developed in Geneva and the Jura mountains as from the 16th Century. It is important to understand that at the time of the founding of Wostep, America was losing its title as \\"world's largest watch producer\\" to the Soviet Union (mostly making poor-quality everyday watches). As American watch companies continued to slide into oblivion after the end of World War II, some were able to update by purchasing movements from Swiss companies, even establishing their own subsidiaries in Switzerland (e.g. Waltham Watch Company, Hamilton Watch Company, Benrus, Bulova), to keep them going another 10–20 years before folding completely in the U.S. It was this reason that the U.S. requested some sort of formalized training for its best watchmakers. There had always been relatively small imports of ultra-fine Swiss watches, but post World War II the number of watches imported either as partial or complete watches grew exponentially. These \\"modern\\" watch movements were decidedly different from the American companies' products, which grew out of 100 years of manufacturing (starting mass production of quality watches). American manufacturers were not able to develop new products and new methods to compete and were destroyed in record time. Worldwide training programs The Federation developed an 11-month training program in which a watchmaker was flown to Neuchâtel, Switzerland, and trained by any one of many talented instructors that worked at WOSTEP over the years. Recent changes in structure have assured the survival of WOSTEP as a foundation with a beautiful lakefront chateau converted to the school building. With the retirement of long-time director Antoine Simonin and his wife, the next generation has taken the reins and continues to develop courses for full training used throughout the world at their WOSTEP-Partnership Schools. The school also provides a variety of industry-specific training to companies and practicing watchmakers.

It adheres to the Chabad school of Hasidic thought which emphasizes in-depth Torah study, uses the Chabad nusach of prayer, and focuses on the study of Hasidic mysticism. History The Malochim were founded by Rabbi Chaim Avraham Dov Ber Levine HaCohen, also known as \\"The Malach\\" (lit. \\"the angel\\"), who arrived in New York in 1923. Levine had been one of the closest followers of Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn and the tutor of his grandson, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn. Once in New York, Levine became the rabbi of Congregation Nusach Ari in the Bronx. Rabbi Shraga Feivel Mendlowitz, head of Mesivta Torah Vodaas, studied the Tanya with Levine and encouraged his mesivta students to visit him so they could see this luminary. Many of them were inspired and decided to become followers of the Malach, starting a Hasidic quasi-dynasty known as \\"The Malachim.\\" They began to adopt a more Hasidic style of dress, including \\"long black jackets and a very long tallis katan over their shirts, with the tzitzit showing below their jacket hems\\". When the Malachim openly challenged Mendlowitz's authority, they were barred from entering the mesivta by older students and in 1936, left Torah Vodaas to establish their own yeshiva called Nesivos Olam. (According to Nesanel Quinn, the then menahel (director), they left on their own. However, according to Rabbi Meir Weberman, one of the Malach's followers, Quinn expelled them but later apologized.) In any case, Rabbi Mendlowitz had asked Rabbi Yehoshua Baumol (1880–1948) to confirm the permissibility of expelling them after it was done. Rabbi Baumol replied with a formal responsum that it was justified by Jewish Law to expel the few to better serve the education of the many. The same question was presented to Rabbi Dov Berish Elefant, who responded that they should not be expelled. The Malach died in 1938. (The Malach had no formally appointed successor.) Nesivos Olam, located at 205 Hewes St. in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, was led by Rabbi Meyer Weberman ZL, although due to the rabbi's poor health and after his death, his son Rabbi Mordechai Wolf (William) Weberman, a prominent member of Neturei Karta, began serving since the mid-2000s as its semi-official leader. Current leader is Rabbi Melech Flohr of Monsey NY brother of Rabbi Chaim Flohr a Rosh Kollel in Monsey NY Relationship toward other groups=Chabad= According to one leader of the Malachim, one significant difference is that Chabad involves itself with the affairs of the Israeli government, while the Malachim are staunchly anti-Zionist. Also, the Malachim acknowledge only the first five Chabad-Lubavitch rebbes as the legitimate rebbes of Chabad.Mintz, Hasidic People. although some of the descendants of former Malachim have returned to mainstream Chabad. =Satmar= Many descendants of former Malachim have joined the Satmar movement, due to their shared anti-Zionist views. Once a woman is said to have approached a former Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, complaining that her son had become a Malach [Hebrew for \\"angel\\"]. Rabbi Teitelbaum is said to have replied jokingly, \\"Don't worry.

To make matters worse, Anthony's father suffers a series of heart-attacks, keeping him from working and further straining the family's resources. Anthony is desperate to help with expenses and accepts a part-time job from Myra Eells, the elderly librarian of Hoosac Public Library. Working at the library allows Anthony to earn a little money, as well learn more about Alpheus Winterborn, the wealthy and eccentric man who built the library. Rumor has it that Winterborn found something on an archeological dig many years before and hid it for safekeeping in the library, but no one believes the tale to be true. During his chores around the building, Anthony ultimately finds a clue hinting that the treasure does exist and, if clues written by Winterborn himself are followed correctly, they will lead the one to the prize. Anthony knows that finding the treasure will result in money that can help with family finances. But soon Anthony runs afoul of the greedy bank vice-president, Hugo Philpotts, a descendant of the Winterborn family. The two commence dueling searches for the treasure.

A replica of the 1841 Mississippi Rifle over a replica Colt Third Variation .44 Revolving Holster Pistol \\"Dragoon\\"-c:1849 History When Eli Whitney Blake took over management of the Harpers Ferry Armory in 1842, he set about tooling up under his new contract from the U.S. government for making the model 1841 percussion rifle. Machinery and fixtures for making the 1822 contract flintlock musket had to be retooled or replaced in order to produce the lock and barrel of the new model. Whitney, Jr. had the good sense to hire Thomas Warner as foreman, who, as master armorer at Springfield Armory, had just been making the same kind of major changes there. Thomas Warner had spearheaded the drive to equip the Springfield Armory with a set of new, more precise machines, and a system of gauging that made it possible to achieve, in the late 1840s, the long- desired goal of interchangeability of parts in military small arms. (John H. Hall had been the first to accomplish this with the US Rifle Model 1819, which had previously achieved parts interchangeability at Harpers Ferry by the mid-1820s.) Under Warner's tutelage, Eli Whitney, Jr. equipped the Whitney Armory to do likewise. The nickname \\"Mississippi\\" originated in the Mexican–American War when future Confederate president Jefferson Davis was appointed Colonel of the Mississippi Rifles, a volunteer regiment from the state of Mississippi. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with Model 1841 rifles. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. Davis clashed with his commanding officer, General Winfield Scott, who said that the weapons were insufficiently tested and refused the request. Davis took his case to President James K. Polk, who overruled Scott and endorsed Davis' request. The incident started a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.p.2 Taylor, John M. Compassion is Always Due to an Enraged Imbecile in 'While Cannons Roared 1997 Brasseys The Model 1841 was replaced by the minie ball firing Springfield Model 1855, which became the standard issue weapon for regular army infantry, and ultimately the Springfield Model 1861 and Model 1863. By the time of the Civil War, the Mississippi rifle was generally considered old-fashioned but effective. In the rush to arm troops in 1861, many new soldiers considered themselves fortunate to have any rifled arm while many of their comrades carried smoothbore muskets. It was carried by some Union troops up until at least 1863 (the 45th New York Infantry was still armed with theirs until after Gettysburg). Some Confederate cavalry and sharpshooter units used them until the end of the war, as evidenced by surviving Confederate ordnance requisitions. The Mississippi rifle was sometimes referred to as a \\"yagger\\" rifle, due to its smaller size and its similarity to the German Jäger rifles. Design and features The Mississippi rifle was the first standard U.S. military rifle to use a percussion lock system. Percussion lock systems were much more reliable and weatherproof than the flintlock systems that they replaced, and were such an improvement that many earlier flintlock rifles and muskets were later converted to percussion lock systems. The Mississippi rifle was originally produced in .54 caliber, using 1:66 rifling and no provision for fixing a bayonet. In 1855, the Mississippi rifle was changed to .58 caliber, so that it could use the .58 caliber Minie Ball that had recently become standard. Many older Mississippi rifles were re-bored to .58 caliber. The rifle was also modified to accept a sword type bayonet. The first Mississippi rifles had a v-notch sight. This was later replaced with leaf sights with 100, 300, and 500 yard ranges. A ladder sight with ranges from 100 to 1100 yards in 100 yard increments was fitted on some later rifles.

Marins is also known by his alter ego Zé do Caixão (Eng: Coffin Joe). Marins shot the film for the production company Fotocenas Filmes which agreed to finance his project of a new Zé do Caixão film. After the release of the film, producers failed to finance Marins for his project. 24 Horas de Sexo Explícito was Marins' biggest box-office success and two years later, he directed a sequel named 48 Hours of Hallucinatory Sex. Plot Three men make a wager on which one will have sex with more women in a period of 24 hours. They hire an obese and flamboyant gay man to be the judge and keep tally. They get 7 \\"ugly\\" women for the challenge. One man comments to another that \\"these women look like something from a Coffin Joe movie\\". The men gather them at a beach house and the competition begins. One man decides to quit the competition and return home to his wife (veteran Brazilian porn actress Vânia Bournier), whom he finds having sexual intercourse with \\"Jack\\", their German Shepherd dog, in Brazil's first scene of cinematic zoophilia.

They are encouraged until the judge announces the tie-breaker would involve the men performing acts on the judge. The duo flees the beach house pursued by the eager judge as the end screen appears.

He closed out his professional career with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. He played college football at the University of Tulsa. Early years Rhome attended Sunset High School in Texas, where he played football for his father Byron Rhome. He also practiced basketball and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Southern Methodist University. He became a starter at quarterback as a sophomore, registering 74 completions (led the conference) out of 129 attempts (second in the conference) for 693 yards (second in the conference), one touchdown and 6 interceptions. In 1961, he transferred to the University of Tulsa after a 2-7-1 football season, and hence the firing of Head Coach Bill Meek. In 1963 after sitting out a year, Rhome starred at Tulsa, passing for 1,909 yards, 10 touchdowns, and suffering 13 interceptions. He improved as a senior, with 2,870 passing yards, 32 touchdowns and just 4 interceptions, while leading the nation in total offense (3,128 yards). He finished second in the voting for the Heisman Trophy -- to John Huarte of Notre Dame -- in one of the closest elections ever recorded. Rhome held a number of NCAA records, including the largest number of touchdowns in a game, in a season, and the most consecutive passes without an interception in a football season and in his career. Rhome also won the Sammy Baugh Trophy in 1964, and had his Number 17 jersey retired by the school. In 1984, he was inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletic Hall of Fame. In 1988, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. He also was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame, the Texas High School Hall of Fame and the Inaugural Class of the Dallas Independent School District Athletic Hall of Fame. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys= Knowing that he had one more year of eligibility, the Dallas Cowboys selected him in the thirteenth round (172nd overall) of the 1964 NFL Draft with a future draft pick, as would the New York Jets in the 25th round (195th overall) of the 1964 AFL Draft. Rhome began his professional career in 1965 as the third quarterback behind Don Meredith and Craig Morton; he got a chance to start one game that same year against the Cleveland Browns (17-23 loss). He would serve in a backup role until the start of the 1969 season when Roger Staubach joined the team, and at his request the Cowboys traded Rhome to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for a third round draft choice, later used to select Charlie Waters in the 1970 NFL Draft. =Cleveland Browns= In 1969, although Rhome was a backup to Bill Nelsen, the information he provided about the Cowboys offense helped the Browns beat them in a 38-14 Conference Championship playoff win. On January 27, 1970, he was traded to the Houston Oilers in exchange for a third round draft choice, that they gave back to the Dallas Cowboys in payment for their original trade. =Houston Oilers= Rhome would only play as a backup for the Houston Oilers for a year. On August 17, 1971, he was waived after the team decided to keep rookies Dan Pastorini and Lynn Dickey, to back up starter Charley Johnson. =Los Angeles Rams= On August 19, 1971, he was claimed off the waiver wire by the Los Angeles Rams, where he was a backup for one year. On August 24, 1972, he was released after the Rams acquired quarterback Pete Beathard. =Montreal Alouettes (CFL)= In October 1972, he signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League. On December 18, he announced his retirement. Coaching life After he finished his pro playing career, Rhome became an assistant coach at the University of Tulsa. Next, his first of many NFL coaching jobs was with the Seattle Seahawks. Then while with the Washington Redskins, he earned a Super Bowl championship ring. Rhome is also credited with the signing of future hall of fame wide receiver Steve Largent with the Seattle Seahawks.

Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Cavallaro is known for his numerous installation art pieces involving real cheese, including a series of photographs of the iconic 1960s model Twiggy draped in cheese and covering the inside of a New York City hotel room with melted cheese. My Sweet Lord In March 2007, the Lab Gallery at the Roger Smith Hotel in Manhattan announced that it was canceling its planned \\"My Sweet Lord\\" exhibition scheduled for Holy Week because the hotel had received death threats following a radio broadcast by Bill Donohue of the Catholic League. \\"My Sweet Lord\\" is a life- size and anatomically correct depiction of Jesus—with neither cross nor loincloth—in an attitude of crucifixion, and sculpted entirely from chocolate. The sculpture in question is a new version of the original \\"My Sweet Lord,\\" formed from 200 pounds of chocolate which had been damaged by rodents while it was in storage in Brooklyn. Cavallaro discarded the original piece and recast the sculpture. The new work is intended to be displayed with a group of chocolate saints, including St. Francis; Augustine; Michael, Jude, Anthony and Fermin—all made by Cavallaro from sweet chocolate. Bill Donohue was quoted as describing this as \\"one of the worst assaults on Christian sensibilities ever\\" and told Cavallaro in a live interview on CNN \\"you're lucky I'm not like the Taliban, because you would lose more than your head\\" . Donohue even accused him of lying about being a Roman Catholic, and even a Christian at all. Cavallaro won the 1990 Juno Award for Best Music Video for his video for Boomtown, by Canadian singer-songwriter Andrew Cash. He lives in New York City.

He resigned from his post in May 2013 before taking up the position as manager at Shirebrook Town later that month. At the start of season 2015–16 he became manager of Rainworth Miners Welfare. Playing career Watts started out with Rotherham United as an apprentice, but after only two years in the first team he moved on to Sheffield Wednesday. He left Sheffield Wednesday in March 1996, after only 18 league appearances, to play for Leicester City. At Leicester he played as they won the 1996 First Division play-off Final. He also contributed to their run in the 1996–97 Football League Cup, being on the pitch as they beat Wimbledon in the semi-final, but was left out of the final squad itself. Whilst at Leicester he scored once; his goal coming in a 3–1 defeat to Chelsea. Watts wore the colours of five more teams before he arrived at Luton Town on loan in 1999. Luton clearly suited Watts, as he became a first team regular, and made 67 league appearances in two seasons. At the end of 2000–01, he decided to join Australian club Northern Spirit, where he played until 2004, when the club folded. Now retired from the game, he returned to England to set up a business in Worksop. In September 2010 he was appointed assistant manager of Maltby Main and in January 2011 manager of Hallam. On 3 May 2016 Watts, now manager of Nottinghamshire side Rainworth Miners Welfare, was obliged to play once again for a fixture on the final day of the season against Pickering Town; his club were struggling to get a team together due to injuries, work commitments and a youth team cup final. Watts played 54 minutes before replacing himself with substitute Cameron Mitchell. Rainworth lost 4–2. ReferencesExternal links * *Lincoln City F.C.

In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra that studies infinite groups, the adverb virtually is used to modify a property so that it need only hold for a subgroup of finite index. Given a property P, the group G is said to be virtually P if there is a finite index subgroup H \\\\le G such that H has property P. Common uses for this would be when P is abelian, nilpotent, solvable or free. For example, virtually solvable groups are one of the two alternatives in the Tits alternative, while Gromov's theorem states that the finitely generated groups with polynomial growth are precisely the finitely generated virtually nilpotent groups. This terminology is also used when P is just another group. That is, if G and H are groups then G is virtually H if G has a subgroup K of finite index in G such that K is isomorphic to H. In particular, a group is virtually trivial if and only if it is finite. Two groups are virtually equal if and only if they are commensurable. Examples =Virtually abelian= The following groups are virtually abelian. *Any abelian group. *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is abelian and H is finite. (For example, any generalized dihedral group.) *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is finite and H is abelian. *Any finite group (since the trivial subgroup is abelian). =Virtually nilpotent= *Any group that is virtually abelian. *Any nilpotent group. *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is nilpotent and H is finite. *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is finite and H is nilpotent. Gromov's theorem says that a finitely generated group is virtually nilpotent if and only if it has polynomial growth. =Virtually polycyclicVirtually free= *Any free group. *Any virtually cyclic group. *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is free and H is finite. *Any semidirect product N\\\\rtimes H where N is finite and H is free. *Any free product H*K, where H and K are both finite. (For example, the modular group \\\\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\\\Z).) It follows from Stalling's theorem that any torsion-free virtually free group is free. =Others= The free group F_2 on 2 generators is virtually F_n for any n\\\\ge 2 as a consequence of the Nielsen–Schreier theorem and the Schreier index formula. The group \\\\operatorname{O}(n) is virtually connected as \\\\operatorname{SO}(n) has index 2 in it.

The town, situated on the Nankumba Peninsula, is on the southern shore of Lake Malawi and is the busiest resort on Lake Malawi. Cape Maclear is close to the islands of Domwe and Thumbwe on Lake Malawi, and is in Lake Malawi National Park. History In 1859, the missionary and explorer David Livingstone found the Cape, and named it \\"Cape Maclear\\" after his friend, the astronomer Thomas Maclear, who was Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope. In October 1875, a new mission, \\"Livingstonia\\", was set up by a group of members of the Free Church of Scotland. Before the missionaries arrived, the area was controlled by the Muslim Yao people. The graves of some of the missionaries are in Cape Maclear, overlooking the bay. Although Cape Maclear had a good harbour, the poor soil in the area, and the prevalence of the tsetse fly, meant a more suitable base had to be found; the mission moved to Bandawe, near Chintheche, in 1882. Wildlife Cape Maclear and its islands, forests and bay were declared a national park in 1980, creating the Lake Malawi National Park, the first freshwater national park in the world. In 1984, the area became a UNESCO World Heritage site. There are several species of bird at Cape Maclear, including kingfishers, Dickinson's kestrels, and freckled nightjars. There is a museum about the formation of Lake Malawi and its wildlife at Cape Maclear. UNESCO has recommended wildlife preservation at Cape Maclear. Tourism Cape Maclear is \\"a leading tourist destination\\", and is the busiest resort on Lake Malawi. The area is popular with backpackers. There are bars, restaurants, lodges and guesthouses in the town. Activities available in Cape Maclear include snorkelling, hiking, boat cruises, kayaking, and diving. In October 2001, the Malawian government invited investors to fund a $6,000,000 construction of a new 150-room, four-star hotel at Cape Maclear. In June 2003, plans were announced to build an ecolodge on Maleri Island, near Cape Maclear. In February 2005, the Malawian government announced plans to increase ecotourism at Cape Maclear with new accommodation and facilities. These plans proved too ambitious for the fragile Malawian economy and tourist industry. Transport In February 2006, the Malawian government announced plans to build a new road from Cape Maclear to Monkey Bay. The current road is a bumpy dirt track, and there is no regular public transport at Cape Maclear. Regular bus service extends only from Lilongwe to Monkey Bay where private minibuses can be hired for the trip to Cape Maclear. Healthcare There is a medical clinic in Cape Maclear; the Billy Riordan Memorial Clinic was established in 2004, and treats diseases such as dysentery, bilharzia and malaria. There are no diagnostic services or surgery carried out at the clinic. Mags Riordan, who founded the clinic, is the mother of a man who drowned in Lake Malawi, near Cape Maclear in 1999. The clinic is supported by the Billy Malawi Project. Bilharzia is common at Cape Maclear; the incidence of the disease at Cape Maclear is three times higher than the rest of Lake Malawi.

It is today a ruin high above the eastern bank of the Leader Water, south of the burgh of Lauder, in the Scottish Borders. In feudal times it fell within a detached segment of the King's personal Barony of Renfrew. The Tower It stands on an abrupt eminence, shaded with old ash trees, and behind it is a flat open space sufficient for a garden and the offices attached to the residence of a landowner in the ancient warlike times with which it is associated. An old dirt road winds round it in a gully leading north from the Leader Water, the whole immediate area being commanded by the fortress. The walls of this square pele are now in ruins. The huge vault on the ground floor remains largely intact and the turnpike stairs situated within the thick walls still takes one to the first floor level. The ceiling of the vault is of a quarried greywacke that splits into thin slabs, which are fitted edgeways with little art. In the 1880s when more of the building was intact at the top could be seen a square aperture for pouring boiling liquids such as melted pitch on the heads of assailants. The main living apartments were on the third floor, still intact in the 19th century, as was the roof. Both have now collapsed. Several of the foundation stones are immense rolled unsquared boulders, that must have been dragged there by oxen. The northern end is built of unquarried stones, that may have been collected from the fields or the river sides, their angles being worn off like stones rolled by water, or polished by the glacial drift. This end is now badly decayed, not helped by trees rowing through it. Most of the stones incorporated in the building are of greywacke; several of the corner blocks have been picked out; and the dressed stones of the fireplaces and windows have been stolen.\\"History of the Berwickshire Naturalists' Club 1885-1886\\" report of meetings for 1886, p.355.

The first charter was \\"signed in the ancient manor of Whitslade\\" at the Feast of John the Baptist. This indicates that the Tower at Whitslade was already old.

It is a more elaborate document than a standard draft treatment. Some films have been shot using only a scriptment. Origin The term scriptment was originally coined by filmmaker James Cameron, possibly during his early involvement in the development of the Spider-Man film series. In that effort, after the success of his 1984 film The Terminator, Cameron wrote a 57-page scriptment for the first proposed Spider-Man film, which was used by screenwriter David Koepp to write the first draft, incorporating it nearly word for word. \\"After the success of The Terminator, Cameron was announced as writer and director of a $60 m big-screen adaptation of the comic book classic. But thanks to a tangled web of litigation, studio bankrupticies, and wrangling over screenplay credits, that movie never saw light. . . . What remains, however, is Cameron's tantalising 57-page Spidey 'scriptment', a compacted screenplay-cum-narrative that mapped out his entire film in brief. . . . Koepp's first draft is taken often word-for-word from Cameron's story, though later versions were heavily rewritten by numerous screenwriters. Despite this—and much to Cameron's chagrin—Koepp's name is the only one on the screenplay.\\" Cameron's scriptment for Titanic (1997) was 131 pages. The term became more widely known when Cameron's 1994 scriptment for the 2009 film Avatar was leaked on the internet during pre-production, although other directors, such as John Hughes and Zak Penn, had written scriptments before. The scriptment for Avatar and its notoriety caused the spread of the term. Elements A scriptment borrows characteristics from both a regular screenplay and a film treatment and is comparable to a step outline: the main text body is similar to an elaborate draft treatment, while usually only major sequences receive scene location headings (slug lines), which is different from the extensive slug line formatting in standard screenplays, where every new scene or shot begins with an INT./EXT. DAY/NIGHT slug line set above the description or dialogue. However, just as a treatment can be short or long, a scriptment can exist in various degrees of completion depending on how much time the writer has devoted to it and a more fully developed one could have all slug lines in place, a great deal of dialogue, and only require the producer's (or a writing partner's) okay on the direction the finished script should take before proceeding further. In a scriptment, scenes and shots may be separated as paragraphs or sentences and, if it is the writer's style, can also include an occasional explanatory note, such as might be important in an adaptation or a sequel. As with standard treatments, much of the dialogue is summarized in action. The longer the scriptment, however, the more likely it contains dialog scenes that are fully developed. Single words or brief phrases of dialogue can be included within the description and lengthier exchanges are formatted exactly as a regular screenplay, which is the main reason for the \\"script\\" part of the term. The longer the scriptment, the more likely it is written shot to shot as opposed to scene by scene; thus, a long, detailed scriptment does not necessarily equate to a longer movie, as a typical 90-120 page screenplay written with master scenes contains many more individual shots than are immediately apparent. A scriptment can begin with FADE IN: top left and conclude with a centered THE END. It can have a title page like a script and lengthier treatment. It is written single spaced with an empty space between paragraphs and other elements and the pages are numbered in the upper right corner, just as in a screenplay. Work-in-progress manuscript Directors and screenwriters write scriptments as an intermediate stage in development from the draft treatment to the first draft of the screenplay. Like a draft treatment, a scriptment can be anywhere from 20 to 80 or more pages, while regular presentation treatments or outlines only summarize the plot, typically in not more than 30 pages. *For the Batman feature film The Dark Knight (2008), writer David S. Goyer and the film's director Christopher Nolan wrote a scriptment that was then used by Nolan and his brother Jonathan Nolan to expand further into a finished screenplay. \\"I wrote what you'd call a 'scriptment' with Chris over an accelerated month long period, and then we handed it off to his brother [Jonathan], who did the first pass,\\" explains Goyer. *The sci-fi movie Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) reportedly used a scriptment during the screenplay writing process by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Ehren Kruger and director Michael Bay. *Filmmaker Wayne Spitzer used a scriptment while writing the adaptation of author Algernon Blackwood's 1907 supernatural short story \\"The Willows\\". *Comic book writer Warren Ellis has written that he sometimes works in the scriptment style. Presentation manuscript A scriptment can also be a presentation document; that is, one that is sold or handed in as the finished work. *Writer-director-producer James Cameron delivered a 57-page scriptment that he was contracted to write during the development phase of the first Spider-Man (2002) theatrical movie, which he was also going to direct. When Cameron left the project, screenwriter David Koepp expanded it into a first draft script, which was later worked on by other uncredited writers. *In 2005, Sony Pictures paid screenwriter Ken Nolan US $3 million for his 75-page scriptment that was an adaptation of the then-unpublished Whitley Strieber novel The Grays. Variety, August 23, 2005, reported by Claude Brodesser. \\"Sony Pictures will pay Black Hawk Down screenwriter Ken Nolan $3 million for his 75-page 'script-ment' (less than a script but more than a treatment) of Whitley Strieber's as-yet-unpublished alien sci-fi novel The Grays, marking one of the studio's largest payments for a treatment.\\" Nolan had only one produced writing credit at the time, the screenplay for the military film Black Hawk Down, a project for which he had submitted three different scriptments to producer Jerry Bruckheimer and executive producers Mike Stenson, and Chad Oman for approval during the writing process. *Filmmakers Kriv Stenders and Richard Green used the scripment format to make their 2007 film Boxing Day. *The 2008 movie Cloverfield written by Drew Goddard, directed by Matt Reeves, and produced by J.

Yet with just a 65-page \\"scriptment\\" (more than a treatment, less than a script) laying out a film about a bunch of friends who happen to capture on camera the utter destruction of New York by a monster, he went with Mr. Weston's judgment, hedged by Mr. Abrams's assurance that he would be closely involved with the film.

History The 15th century buildings are the remains of the Palace of the Bishop of Lincoln. Although it is often stated as being built in the 15th century, the first (wooden) Palace was actually built in the late 12th century, when records show it as being used to house the Bishops of Lincoln. Subsequently, the wooden structure was replaced by more substantial buildings and a tall brick tower was added in 1475, protected by walls and a moat, and surrounded by an outer bailey. Parts of the complex were demolished in 1632 on the orders of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The Victorian house now present on the site was built in 1872. The Claretian Missionaries were given the site by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Northampton in 1956. Initially it was used a Junior Seminary carrying out the preliminary training of 11- to 18-year-olds aspiring to become Claretian Missionary priests or brothers. The Junior Seminary closed in July 1965. Since then the Towers complex has been developed by the Claretians as a Retreat and Conference Centre. Also located on the site is the Catholic Parish Church of St Hugh of Lincoln, which stands on the site of the great chamber of the medieval palace and was originally built as the chapel for the Junior Seminary. The grounds, but not the buildings, of the Towers are open to visitors at all reasonable times but dogs are not permitted. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. Little now remains of the bishops' moated palace except the great tower, the inner gatehouse, part of the battlemented wall, which used to surround the inner court within the moat, and the outer gate and wall. On 16 July 1551, Henry, Duke of Suffolk and his brother Lord Charles died here from the sweating sickness. They had come to Buckden to avoid the sickness at Cambridge.Strype, John, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 2 part 1, Oxford (1822), 491 In the 1630s Bishop Williams held state at Buckden, entertaining his neighbours with lavish displays of hospitality. The antiquary Edward John Rudge published a history, Illustrated and Historical Account of Buckden Palace, in 1839.

The Palace of Buckden is probably best known for holding Henry VIII’s first Queen, Katherine of Aragon during the King’s Great Matter, from July 1533 until May 1534 until she was transferred a few miles away to Kimbolton Castle, where she died in 1536. She would eventually be buried just north of both Buckden and Kimbolton at Peterborough Cathedral.

The resolution demanded North Korea immediately end its invasion of South Korea, the catalyst for the beginning of the Korean War. The measure was adopted by a vote of 9 support, none opposed, and one abstention. The Korean Peninsula had been divided between occupation forces of the United States and the Soviet Union since the end of World War II along the 38th Parallel. Each government sought to prop up a government on its side of the occupation border, and as the Cold War began, tensions rose between the two Koreas. These culminated in open warfare with the North's invasion of the South on June 25. During this time, the United Nations backed South Korea and considered it the only lawful government. The resolution called on the North to immediately halt its invasion and to move its troops back to the 38th parallel. Seen as a diplomatic victory for the United States, the resolution was completely ignored by North Korea. This brought the UN and the US to take further action, setting the state for massive international involvement and the expansion of the Korean War.  Background  North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung = Division of Korea = At the end of World War II, the Korean Peninsula, which up to that point had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, was divided along the 38th Parallel. To the north, the Soviet Union (USSR) occupied the country, which established itself as a communist state, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under Kim Il Sung. To the south, the United States (US) occupied the country, establishing the Republic of Korea under an autocratic anti-communist leader, Syngman Rhee. As tensions rose between the US and the USSR, each government in Korea claimed it had sovereignty over the whole country. On November 14, 1947, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 112 established a temporary commission to monitor free elections in Korea. The UN had intended to reunify Korea under one government, but the UN commission was unable to enter North Korea. After observing elections in South Korea, the UN stated in General Assembly Resolution 195 on December 12, 1948, that the nation was to be established under one government as soon as possible, and the US and Soviet occupation forces there were to withdraw. As time went on, the North Korean government became more aggressive, and skirmishes between troops of the North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it would drive the UN out of the country. = Outbreak of war = On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of the North Korean People's Army launched a full-scale invasion of the Republic of Korea. The force of 89,000 men moved in six columns, catching the Republic of Korea Army by surprise, resulting in a rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of equipment, and was unprepared for war. The numerically superior North Korean forces overcame isolated resistance from the 38,000 South Korean soldiers on the frontier before it began moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. The North Koreans were well on their way to South Korea's capital of Seoul within hours, forcing the government and its shattered army to retreat further south. News of the invasion quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on the invasion within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting at his home in Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who was reminded of the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and would not be able to hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict. Lie convened the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for its 473rd meeting at 14:00 June 25 in New York City, New York. He began the meeting with a detailed report from the UN Commission on Korea, explained the situation to the delegates, and insisted that the UN take action to restore peace in Korea. According to the UN Commission on Korea, the situation was assuming the character of full-scale warfare. Then, US diplomat Ernest A. Gross gave Muccio's report on the situation. The United States introduced a resolution stating that North Korea's invasion was a breach of peace in violation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. Gross requested that South Korea's ambassador to the United Nations, Chang Myon, be present for the meeting, which was granted. The Yugoslavian delegate requested that a North Korean diplomat be present as well, but this request was not granted. North Korea was not a member of the UN and had no representation in the organization. Myon read a prepared statement calling the invasion a crime against humanity, and said that as the UN had played a major role in the founding of South Korea, it was their responsibility to help defend it from aggression. The UNSC debated the resolution and made amendments and revisions to its wording before passing it.  The resolution  The resolution passed with 9 supports and no opposition. Supporting nations included the United States, the United Kingdom, Republic of China, France, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Norway and India. Aleš Bebler, delegate from Yugoslavia, abstained from voting. The Soviet Union's delegate had boycotted all UN meetings because of procedural disagreements over the permanent security council seat going to the Republic of China (Taiwan) over the People’s Republic of China (Mainland) earlier in the year. Soviet ambassador to the United Nations Yakov Malik had been personally ordered not to attend the UNSC meetings by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. Lie was a strong supporter of the resolution, as he saw the conflict as a challenge to the authority of the UN.  Aftermath  The resolution was seen as a political victory for the United States, as it identified North Korea as the aggressor in the conflict. Earlier in the day, independent of the UN resolution, Truman had ordered the Joint Chiefs of Staff to contact US Army General of the Army Douglas Macarthur, who was in charge of US forces in the Far East. He ordered MacArthur to prepare ships for the evacuation of US citizens from Korea, and authorized him to send ammunition and supplies to Pusan to support South Korean forces in the Seoul-Kimpo area. These would be escorted by US military units. He instructed MacArthur to send a survey team into the country to assess the situation and determine how to aid South Korea. Truman also ordered the mobilization of the US Navy for movement into the region. The US delegation later contacted the Soviet delegation and sent a message requesting that the Kremlin use its influence over North Korea to compel it to comply with the resolution, but the Soviet Union denied the request. With the ineffectiveness of the resolution in de-escalating the conflict, the UNSC convened on June 27 to discuss further actions to take, resulting in United Nations Security Council Resolution 83, which recommended military intervention by other UN member nations to restore peace in Korea. Within days, ships and aircraft from several nations, as well as the first major formations of US troops, were moving to South Korea, setting the stage for a full-scale conflict. In a 2010 column, Colum Lynch of Foreign Policy magazine criticized the resolution as one of the ten worst UN resolutions in history. After the Soviet Union ended its boycott of the council, it used its veto power to block any further resolutions against North Korea. In response, Acheson introduced a new procedure to the UN General Assembly to allow a member state to bypass the UNSC and seek approval in the General Assembly, including recommendations on the use of force, United Nations General Assembly Resolution 377. When this was passed, it allowed for open-ended General Assembly emergency special sessions to address threats to international peace and security for which the UNSC was unable to pass a resolution. Lynch wrote that the creation of this rule caused unintended negative consequences for the United States in 1997 when several Arab states began the Tenth emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly to address the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This session, convened as a way around a US veto, spanned 30 meetings over the next ten years, and has never formally been closed.

Reason Henry Walton Bibb (May 10, 1815 in Shelby County, Kentucky – 1854) was an American author and abolitionist who was born a slave. After escaping from slavery to Canada, he founded an abolitionist newspaper, The Voice of the Fugitive. He returned to the US and lectured against slavery. Biography Bibb was born to an enslaved woman, Milldred Jackson, on a Cantalonia, Kentucky, plantation on May 10, 1815. His people told him his white father was James Bibb, a Kentucky state senator, but Henry never knew him. As he was growing up, Bibb saw each of his six younger siblings, all boys, sold away. In 1833, Bibb married another enslaved mulatto, Malinda, who lived in Oldham County, Kentucky. They had a daughter, Mary Frances. In 1842, he managed to flee to Detroit, from where he hoped to gain the freedom of his wife and daughter. After finding out that Malinda had been sold as a mistress to a white planter, Bibb focused on his career as an abolitionist. He traveled and lectured throughout the United States. In 1849-50 he published his autobiography Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Henry Bibb, An American Slave, Written by Himself, which became one of the best known slave narratives of the antebellum years. The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 increased the danger to Bibb and his second wife, Mary E. Miles. It required Northerners to cooperate in the capture of escaped slaves. To ensure their safety, the Bibbs migrated to Canada and settled in Sandwich, Upper Canada, now Windsor, Ontario. In 1851, he set up the first black newspaper in Canada, The Voice of the Fugitive. The paper helped develop a more sympathetic climate for blacks in Canada as well as helped new arrivals to adjust. Due to his fame as an author, Bibb was reunited with three of his brothers, who separately had also escaped from slavery to Canada. In 1852 he published their accounts in his newspaper. He died in 1854, at the age of 39.

The film was directed by Philip Leacock and based on a story by John Wooldridge, who as an RAF bomber pilot flew 108 operational sorties over Europe.Coldstream 2005, p. 181. Wooldridge, who after the war established himself as a successful film composer before being killed in a car accident in 1958, also wrote the film score and participated in writing the screenplay. Appointment in London is set in an RAF Bomber Command squadron during 1943 and tells of a wing commander's attempt to finish his third and final tour of 30 operations. A sub-plot involves his relationship with a widowed wren in whom an American observer attached to his airfield is also interested. Plot Wing Commander Tim Mason (Dirk Bogarde) runs a squadron of Avro Lancasters based in England. He is nearing the end of his third tour of operations, meaning that he has flown nearly 90 missions over Germany. Having twice volunteered to continue operational flying, Mason is keen to make it a round 90 \\"ops\\", but just as he is nearing the end of his tour he receives orders banning him from further flying. Meanwhile, losses are mounting and several raids are being seen as failures, so that some of the members of his crews, Brown (Bill Kerr) and \\"The Brat\\" Greeno (Bryan Forbes) among them, are thinking that there must be a \\"jinx\\" at work. Soon afterwards, \\"The Brat\\" is caught sending unauthorised telegrams off the station. These turn out to be written to his wife, Pam (Anne Leon), rather than anything more sinister; however, Mason reprimands Greeno for the lapse in security. A few days later, Greeno's aircraft fails to return from a raid and Mason agrees to meet Pam, who has asked to see him. With only one more flight to go, he accepts that the decision to ground him was for his own good, and he visits Brown's aircraft as Brown and his crew prepare to take off on a mission. As the crew board the Lancaster the large 4,000 lb \\"cookie\\" bomb that is part of the bomber's load, slips from the bomb shackles and injures one of the crew. With no time to obtain a replacement crew member, US observer Mac Baker (William Sylvester) takes his place. Mason decides to go as well, to reassure the crew's worries about the jinx, and the bomber takes off. During the attack on the target, the Pathfinder plane directing the raid is shot down, causing the remaining bombers to begin bombing inaccurately. Hearing and seeing this, Mason takes the Pathfinder's place on the radio, broadcasting corrections and accurate instructions, and the bombing becomes accurate again. Listening-in to the Pathfinder's broadcast back in Britain, Mason's commanding officer, Group Captain Logan (Ian Hunter) hears Mason's voice and realises that he's disobeyed orders and flown on the operation. However, Mason's intervention turns the raid from a probable failure to a success, so on Mason's return Logan greets him at his aircraft. At the end of the mission, Mason, along with Eve Canyon, Brown and Greeno's wife Pam, take a taxi to Buckingham Palace to receive an award from King George VI.

He was born in Florence. Probably, but not confirmed as, a pupil of Giotto, de' Menabuoi was notable for his use of bright colour and became a painter at the court of Da Carrara. Pursuing his own archaic style, far removed from Gothic style and realism of his contemporaries Altichiero and Jacopo d'Avanzi, he was to leave no trace in the development of subsequent Venetian painting. In Lombardy he executed a fresco of the Last Judgement in the Abbey of Viboldone, Milan. He then moved to Padua where he completed frescos in the Church of the Eremitani, the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua and most notably at the Baptistery of the Padua Duomo. Between 1375 and 1378 he executed the fresco decoration of the Baptistery of the Padua Duomo, commissioned by Fina Buzzaccarini, wife of Francesco I da Carrara, who intended to use the building as the family mausoleum. Compared with his earlier work, the frescoes show Romanesque and Byzantine orderliness, such as in the great Paradise of the dome, where the scene is organized around a Christ Pantocrator, surrounded by a hypnotic geometric pattern of angels and saints whose halos, arranged in neat rows, appear from below as some kind of magnificent jewellery. Giusto de' Menabuoi died in Padua and his burial site was re-discovered outside the Baptistry.

When the game was released, one of their issues featured the game on its cover and a 12-page strategy guide. In 2019, Retro- Bit released a collector's edition of Metal Storm that included reproduction NES cartridge, game box, full-color instruction manual, certificate of authenticity, M-308 Gunner figurine, M-308 Gunner pin, art prints, and poster. Reception Famitsu gave the game a score of 24 out of 40. Nintendo Power included Metal Storm among a series of games they dubbed \\"Unsung Heroes of the NES.\\" They complimented the game's inventive play control, boss design, and level of challenge. They blamed low distribution for its lack in popularity, and referenced themselves as the best marketing support the game ever received. IGN ranked Metal Storm as #46 on their top 100 NES games list. They called the game a \\"tour de force\\" from a technical perspective, pushing the NES to its technical limits by using simulated parallax scrolling and advanced animation techniques. 1up.com listed the game on their list of \\"Hidden Gems\\" for the NES, and praised the \\"reverse gravity\\" gimmick, which they say adds challenge and makes the game unique. They also stated the game is quite difficult and rather short.

Narrative A native of Constantinople, Arthelais was the daughter of an imperial proconsul named Lucius and his wife Anthusa. She is said to have been pursued by Justinian, who desired her; however, Arthelais had taken a vow of chastity. At her own request, she was sent with three servants to her uncle Narses in Italy, but was kidnapped by robbers along the way. Her servants had recourse to the Church of Saint Eulalia, where they prayed for their mistress' safe return, and gave alms to the poor from their expense money.Dunbar, Agnes Baillie Cunninghame.

From there she went to the Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo to make an offering in thanksgiving. Her uncle Narses went to meet her and brought her back to Benevento.

The Mount Fuji Radar System is a historic weather radar system located on the summit of Mount Fuji, Japan. It was completed on August 15, 1964 \\"Rebuilding Japan— a Transitional Process for Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi Public Affairs Committee, and is now recorded on the list of IEEE Milestones in electrical engineering. When first built, the Mount Fuji Radar System was the world's highest weather radar (elevation 3776 meters), and could observe major weather phenomena, such as destructive typhoons, at a range of more than 800 kilometers. It was designed by the Japan Meteorological Agency and built by Mitsubishi Electric Corporation. The system is notable for its advances in weather radar technology, remote control, and difficulty of construction, as it required the transport and assembly of some 500 tons of material during mountain's short summer. It operated at a frequency of 2880 megahertz, with output power of 1500 kilowatts, and a pulse width of 3.5 microseconds. Its antenna was a circular dish, 5 meters in diameter, of parabolic shape, rotating at either 3 or 5 revolutions per minute, and housed within a 9-meter radome. The system was decommissioned in 1999, as it was superseded by weather satellites. The dome, radar dish and support equipment were relocated to a purpose-built museum in Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi in 2001. It was replaced by an automated weather system in 2004.  References  * Mt.

Vernon Watson (18861952), better known under his stage name Nosmo King, was a popular English variety artist. He was touring the music halls before World War I, but he remained relatively obscure until the 1920s, when he went by Nosmo King. He was the father of actor Jack Watson. Early years Coming from a rural background near Peterborough, Watson showed a leaning towards things theatrical and it was evident that he had a rare talent for mimicry. In 1911, he turned professional, using his real name, doing impressions of the leading comedians of the day. Then, when Frank Tinney, the American black- faced comedian, came to the UK, Watson added an impression of him to his repertoire. He noticed that this impression gained him great applause, and when Tinney returned to the United States, Watson gave thought to a different style of act based on a black-faced personality. Fame Opportunity for this came about in the early 1930s in Leeds, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, which boasted two variety theatres, run by two rival organisations. The Great Depression was beginning to bite, and on hearing that the rival theatre had lost its comic, he determined to double his income by doing both shows (four performances a night), travelling between the two theatres by taxi, disguising himself by blacking up. Watson had the black-face study ready, but was stuck for a name. Then inspiration came to his aid. The scene dock doors backstage were partly open and the two halves read \\"No Smo\\" & \\"king\\". That was it. From then on, the character would be Nosmo King. Nosmo King became a huge star and a household name. The stage act of Nosmo King & Hubert developed when his son Jack Watson joined him as straight man directly from school. Vernon Watson made his last bow and he was to be Nosmo for good when his speciality became long comic monologues. During a later interview, he made two remarkable confessions. Someone pointed out that a cigar-smoking figure was hardly compatible with the name and suggested he gave up. This he found remarkably difficult, but he eventually accomplished it with the aid of snuff. The second confession was that he had never at any time set eyes on Frank Tinney. During World War II, Nosmo King reverted to going solo, the reason being that \\"Hubert\\" had joined up. The end came for Nosmo King early in 1952 when Watson died in his sleep in his Chelsea flat. He is buried in Thorney Cemetery near Peterborough, with \\"Nosmo King\\" on his headstone. Acts One of Nosmo's act starters was when a young pageboy would come over to him carrying his luggage. Once he had handed it to Nosmo, Nosmo would say to him \\"how much do I owe you\\" and the boy would say \\"2 nicker\\" (a colloquialism for two pounds) whilst making a V sign at him. Nosmo took this as an insult and would slap the boy across the face, then the boy would slap Nosmo across his face in return.

In 1997 they won the Sanremo Festival, big category, with the song Fiumi di parole and took part in the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin, ranking 4th.  Career = The beginnings = The two meet for the first time in 1990 in the studio of a record company. Alessandra in that period competed with numerous victories in musical competitions in Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia; Fabio was singer and keyboardist of a group called Vox Populi, with whom he had released a maxi- single entitled I'm So Bad and presented himself as a songwriter to the record companies. From 1990 to 1993 Alessandra, after being launched by Pippo Baudo in the Grand Prix program, makes a series of appearances on television broadcasts. In 1992 he finds himself with Fabio: the two decide to work together and two years later they form Jalisse, taking their name from a character in the television series I Robinson. Jalisse, the poet Younis Tawfik later revealed, in Arabic means \\"diner who knows how to entertain in the tale of fables and music: sit, sit and listen\\". In 1995 the duo participated in Sanremo Giovani with the song Vivo, finishing third in the second evening and acquiring the right to participate in the Sanremo Festival the following year, where they ranked sixth in the \\"New proposals\\" section with the song Set me free. = Victory at the Sanremo Festival = In 1997 they participate again in the Festival, once again by right, thanks to the rule, introduced two years before and present for the last time, which allows the non-winning finalists of the \\"New Proposals\\" section of the previous edition to compete for 4 places among the Champions\\". The song, Fiumi di parole, surpasses the selection and takes first place in the event by getting the Jalisse two prizes, the Golden Lion as winners of the Festival and the Silver Lion as authors (Alessandra Drusian and Carmen Di Domenico for the text, Fabio Ricci the music) [1] [2]. This is a victory that will prove to be among the most discussed in the history of the Festival, for the controversial aftermath that followed, winning among other things with an independent label distributed by Sony Columbia. He also had the resemblance of the song discussed with Listen to Your Heart by Roxette, but no provision was made in this regard precisely because plagiarism is non-existent. [3] During the 1997 Sanremo week, the duo's debut album, The Magic Circle of the World, is released. The result in terms of sales (50,000 copies), certainly not exciting, was also due to the fact that the two come to the Sanremo victory practically from strangers and with an unreleased album. Two months later they took part in the 1997 Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin with the same song, obtaining the fourth place and there was also talk of boycott [4]. The following year they proposed to the commission of the Sanremo Festival the piece The tops of Tibet written and composed by Maurizio Fabrizio and Guido Morra, but they were discarded. In 2009, Gigi Vesigna, in his book Vox Populi, revealed how the defeat of the Jalisse at the event had been driven by Rai: if the Venetian duo had won, Italian public TV would have had to organize the 1998 edition by regulation, an operation deemed commercially disadvantageous given the scarce interest of the Italian public for this event [5]. Italy no longer participated in this musical competition until 2011. Soon the duo is labeled as a \\"meteor\\" in Italy and mistreated by the mass media which, among other things, played on the alleged plagiarism of Fiumi di parole. In fact, thanks to the good placement at the Eurovision Song Contest, they begin a series of concerts and tours abroad, including the United States of America (Boston), Canada, Russia (Moscow) and Chile (Viña del Mar Festival) . In the meantime, the duo's record will be included in the programming of United Airlines airlines and chosen by Fred Bronson for Billboard, as one of the most interesting albums of 1997. The two got married in 1999 and later had two daughters: Angelica and Aurora. The same year, on the occasion of the beatification of Padre Pio, they write the song Luce e pane, sung only during concerts and never put on the market until 2014. In 2000 they released a single, I'll Fly, distributed through the internet, which sees Alessandra soloist. = Return of Jalisse = The return In 2001-2002 Alessandra debuted as an actress in the musical comedy Emozioni directed by Sergio Japino. In the meantime, the husband decides to leave the vocal parts of the songs to his wife and devotes himself to their small independent label, the Tregatti Produzioni Musicali. In 2004 the single 6 desire is released, advertised with an innovative formula: it becomes the soundtrack of a Roman taxi company that inserts their voices and the engraving of the song in the call center. The poet friend Norman Zoia (also author of the portrait Madonna dei Maestri Cantori dedicated to Alessandra Drusian) writes the release \\"A taxi called desire\\" contributing to baptize the initiative \\"Taxi Music of the Jalisse\\". In the spring of 2005 the album Siedi was released in Germany, Switzerland and Austria with the Siebenpunkt.com distribution \\"Edel\\", containing two unreleased tracks and some tracks from the previous album totally revisited, including a Spanish version of Fiumi di parole titled Rios de palabras dedicated to South American fans. The CD Siedi e listen is promoted in Northern Europe and some extracts from the album are included in compilations in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. In Sweden they get third place at the \\"Baltic Song Contest\\" in Karlshamn. The German magazine Für Sie distributes 600,000 copies with the single Jalisse in compilation attached. After the announcement of San Marino's first participation in the Eurovision Song Contest, the Jalisse immediately said they were ready to return by representing the Titan, and subsequently presented a song for internal selection to San Marino RTV. The two participate in the selections of the 2007 Sanremo Festival, but their song Linguaggio universale, written inspired by an essay by the Nobel Prize winner Rita Levi Montalcini, is rejected. In the meantime the second daughter Aurora is born on January 22nd 2007. The album Linguaggio Universale comes out in September, containing 12 poems set to music by Jalisse and narrated by Valeria Ducato, plus the homonymous track and trembling wings of peace. Presented at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, the CD is attached to the book Education, key to the development of the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation published by BCD Editore. In November 2009 the duo collaborates with the Greek site Oikotimes.com analyzing the songs of the JESC (Junior Euro Song Contest) of that year. Also in 2009 they interpret themselves in the film Ex di Fausto Brizzi, performing the song Fiumi di parole in the film. In 2010 they launch the project Crescere together with L'Aquila which involves schools and local artists in writing songs and brings them in concert on June 8 at the Stadio Tommaso Fattori in L'Aquila. In this project emerging and well-known artists work alongside children in compulsory schools in the writing of songs and present them to the Aquila schools with the Province of L'Aquila, the SIAE, the MEI, the AFI, the IALS (Training Workers' Training Institute) ) and private radio stations. The project was conceived in 2005 to highlight pupils' creativity in schools, having their texts written and music by professional musicians and had already involved numerous schools in the province of Treviso. [6] In 2011 they took part in the international Human Rights Tour 50th exhibition in Monselice with a new musical formation that also saw the Paduan guitarist and singer Carlo Zannetti, also known as Poetasternote, on stage. Always with him in 2011 begin a series of concerts and an important collaboration. On the stage of Amnesty International, in addition to \\"Jalisse & Carlo Zannetti\\", Enrico Ruggeri, Eugenio Finardi, Raul Cremona, Chiara Canzian and Andrea Mirò also performed. [7] In 2012 the single Tra rose e cielo [8], written together with the Italian-Iraqi poet Younis Tawfik, escaped from the regime of Saddam Hussein. The song is about a love story of a woman for a man left for a peace mission. The single is accompanied by a colorful video directed by the young director Massimo Toniato and arrives in Iraq on the Christian television Ishtar which broadcasts it in Italian with Arabic subtitles. Two other singles come out later: And if the voice returns in March 2013, linked to the laboratories with prisoners from the San Vittore prison in Milan with the Mike Bongiorno Foundation and on June 14 Where you are with artists from the Czech Republic. On 26 March 2014 Alessandra presented herself to The Voice of Italy but without being chosen by any of the coaches. [9] Also in 2014 they won the \\"Mondragone Città\\" Career Award at the Mondragone Festival, the Campania Festival Award, the Alessandra Corà Award in L'Aquila, the Gift of Humanity Award. They also launch the Song of the Knight, a literary competition for World Knights' Day which took place on September 20th in Fornovo di Taro. The text that he won is written by Andrea Cappabianca, the alchemist forever your knight, and speaks of love as the only alternative medicine that can save a child from his illness; is awarded during the 7th European WILDE prize at Nola. The song is included in the theatrical performance Try to tell me, and in Dado Martino I's film wanna be the testimonial released in Italian cinemas in 2015.

October 2013. Note Jeannette's name is misspelt as Jeanette. David Harvey Crewe (20 October 1941 – 17 June 1970), known as Harvey, and Jeannette Lenore Crewe (6 February 1940 – 17 June 1970) were a New Zealand farming couple (married 18 June 1966 in Auckland) who were shot to death in their home around 17 June 1970. The murders led to the wrongful conviction and subsequent pardoning of another farmer who lived nearby, Arthur Allan Thomas. A Royal Commission set up to investigate the miscarriage of justice found that a detective had fabricated evidence and placed it at the scene of the crime. No person was ever charged with planting the evidence, and the murders remain unsolved. Background In 1962 Jeannette's father had been fined £10,000 for tax evasion, and in order to meet the liability been forced to sell a half share in his farm to his wife. In 1970, the Crewes and their 18-month-old daughter lived on their farm at Pukekawa, Lower Waikato. Jeannette was afraid to be in the house without her husband after bizarre burglary and arson attacks, including one in which clothes were set on fire in a bedroom.Beyond Reasonable doubt?, (2014) David Yallop At the time of her death, Jeannette was about to receive her mother's half share in Jeanette's father, Lenard M. Demler's farm, which adjoined the Crewes'.Justice Denied: Extraordinary miscarriages of justice, James Morton 2015 The bequest to Jeannette had come about after Jeannette's sister had been cut from the will of their wealthy mother, and Demler had removed Jeannette as a beneficiary of his own will in retaliation, though she had no role in the original matter. Jeannette's mother had then re-written her will to bequeath to Jeannette the half share in his farm that Demler lived on. Crime Husband and wife Harvey (28) and Jeannette Crewe (30) were found to be missing from their bloodstained farmhouse at Pukekawa, Lower Waikato on 22 June 1970 by Jeannette's father, Lenard W. Demler (died 4 November 1992) who had been asked to look in on them by an alarmed neighbour because they had not answered the telephone for days. The Crewes' 18-month-old daughter Rochelle was distraught in her cot. Demler left her alone while he went on a farm errand. The Crewes had last been seen on the 17th, and milk, bread and newspaper deliveries on the morning of the 18th had not been collected from the letterbox. No medical opinion that an infant could survive without fluids for five days is supported by any verified case of such an occurrence. Although Rochelle had tissue loss, suggesting she had eaten little or nothing between 17 and 22 June, the degree to which she retained water during treatment indicated that she had not ingested fluids for at most 48 hours before she was found. A witness later reported that he had seen a woman unknown to him on the property on the 19th. Len Demler was the leading suspect due to his propinquity and failure to raise the alarm until prompted, apparent guilty knowledge that Rochelle did not require immediate medical attention, blood of Jeannette's type on his car seat, and a scratch on his neck. Police were also told that Demler probably had access to an unregistered .22 weapon. His behaviour continued to raise suspicion; during police searches of the countryside for the Crewes, he shadowed on horseback without helping, and presciently suggested they would be found in water. However, the evidence against Demler was entirely circumstantial and he strongly denied any knowledge of what had happened to his daughter and her husband. He was also said to have an alibi for one of the intruder incidents as he had been attending dinner with the Crewes when a fire was discovered. Jeannette's body was found on 16 August, wrapped in a duvet bound with copper wire,\\"Forensic History: Crimes, Frauds, and Scandals\\" by Professor Elizabeth A Murray in the Waikato River and her husband's body was retrieved upriver on 16 September. A car axle linked to a neighbouring farmer, Arthur Allan Thomas, had apparently been used to weigh down Harvey's body and was central to police theories about the case, although it did not justify a prosecution. Investigation and trials Both victims had been shot to death with a .22 calibre firearm; Jeannette had broken facial bones from being struck with a blunt instrument. Demler had been considered the main suspect, but the brutality of the assault on her, and the lead investigator's belief that she had been raped, led to doubts that her father was involved. On the basis that the murderer might have used a legitimately held gun, police collected and test-fired 64 registered .22 firearms, 3% of the total recorded as held in the Pukekawa area. A forensic report on 19 August 1970 stated that, of the 64, neither Thomas' [rifle] nor one owned by the Eyre family could be eliminated as the possible murder weapon, but there was insufficient evidence pointing to one or the other.nzherald.co.nz New evidence claims in Crewe case 2 Aug, 2014 Although police suggested to Thomas during an interview that his rifle was used to kill the Crewes, the gun was returned to him on 8 September. On 27 October 1970, the garden at the Crewe house was searched for a third time and a spent cartridge case was found, apparently still lying where the murderer had left it. The case carried marks which showed that it had been ejected from Thomas' rifle. In November, Thomas was arrested and charged. Despite his wife and cousin giving him a strong alibi for 17 June, Thomas was sent for trial on a charge of murdering the Crewes. The prosecution suggested Thomas's wife, Vivien, had been the woman seen at the Crewes' house, although she was not charged. The witness was certain Vivien Thomas, who he knew, was not the woman who he saw. The prosecution said that the motive for the murders was that Thomas had been obsessed with Jeannette, an accusation for which they provided very little evidence. A witness who did give testimony supporting the prosecution's contention that Jeannette had been pestered by Thomas was Demler; he was cross examined about why he had not mentioned such obviously relevant information before the court had begun sitting. Thomas was found guilty of the murders in a 1971 trial, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. He was tried again in 1973 and convicted. Supporters of Thomas started a campaign to bring to public attention that the key evidence against him had serious anomalies. Campaign, pardon and Royal Commission A campaign, led in part by Pat Booth of the Auckland Star, was largely responsible for getting Thomas released with a pardon. Campaigners said forensic work by Dr Jim Sprott had shown that the cartridge case had been planted at the scene and that its method of construction identified it as being from a batch that could not have contained the number 8 bullets recovered from the victims. Following David Yallop's book about the case, Beyond Reasonable Doubt, Thomas was pardoned by Keith Holyoake, the Governor-General of New Zealand in 1979, on the recommendation of Prime Minister of New Zealand Robert Muldoon. Thomas was released after serving nine years in prison. He was paid NZ$950,000 compensation for his time in jail and loss of the use of the farm. A Royal Commission of Inquiry was ordered to review the wrongful conviction of Thomas and reported to the Governor-General in November 1980. The Commissioners found that the spent cartridge case from Thomas' gun, Exhibit 350, had not been left by the murderer, but had been created weeks later by police using his impounded gun and ammunition, then planted at the Crewes'. The Royal Commission's report said that Detective Inspector Bruce Hutton and Detective Sergeant Lenrick Johnston were implicated in the misconduct, and that the prosecution of Thomas for the murders had been unjustified. Despite the Royal Commission describing the conduct of Hutton and Johnston as an \\"unspeakable outrage\\", the New Zealand police never laid charges against any police officer involved in the investigation and prosecution of Thomas. Lenrick Johnston died in 1978. Bruce Hutton died in 2013. The case was made into the docu-drama feature film Beyond Reasonable Doubt in 1980. Status of the case In 2014 an official police review of the investigation into the homicides, at a cost of $400,000 to New Zealand taxpayers, said that evidence available in the murder of the Crewes was insufficient for any new prosecution. The review acknowledged that a key prosecution exhibit in the trials had been fabricated by detectives, but did not appear to accept that they could have been on the wrong track; the review implied that the Crewes' daughter had not ingested any fluids between 17 and 22 June, and said a witness had been mistaken in thinking he had seen a woman on the farm during that period. The review did however rule out Demler having been the killer. Rochelle Crewe expressed satisfaction that a police review of evidence had cleared her deceased grandfather, Demler, of involvement in the murders. The case remains unsolved.

He became involved in the power struggle that enveloped North Korea in the months following the Japanese surrender after World War II. Originally Cho was supported by the Soviet Union for the eventual rule of North Korea. However, due to his opposition to trusteeship, Cho lost Soviet support and was forced from power by the Soviet-backed communists in the north.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p23 Placed under house arrest in January 1946, he later disappeared, and is generally believed to have been executed in the North Korean prison system soon after the start of the Korean War.  Early life  Cho was born in Kangsŏ-gun, South P'yŏngan Province, now in North Korea on 1 February 1883. He was raised and educated in a traditional Confucian styleLankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p10 but later converted to Protestantism and became an elder.Wells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p142 From June 1908 to 1913 Cho moved to Japan to study law in Tokyo at Meiji University.Wells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p87 It was during his stay in Tokyo that Cho came into contact with Gandhi’s ideas of non-violence and self-sufficiency.Eckert, \\"Korea, Old and New\\", p292 Cho later used these ideas of non-violent opposition to resist Japanese rule.  Independence movement  After Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 Cho became increasingly involved with his country's independence movement. His participation in the March 1st Movement led to his arrest and detention, along with tens of thousands of other Koreans. He is also famous for publicly rejecting the Japanese Imperial government's policy of pressuring Koreans to legally change their surnames into Japanese.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p11 In 1922 Cho established the Korean Products Promotion Society with the objective of achieving economic self-sufficiencyWells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p19 and that Koreans could obtain solely home-produced products. Cho intended the Society to be a national movement supported by all religious organizations and social groups, particularly ordinary Koreans.Wells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p142 Due to the Korean Products Promotion Society, his strong non-violent resistance, and leading by example rather than political or social authority, Cho gained respect even from critics, and earned him the title “Gandhi of Korea”.Wells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p143 Despite this record, his encouragement of Korean student enlistment in the Japanese army earned him a mixed reputation with some of his fellow nationalists.  Post World War II activism  In August 1945, with Japanese surrender imminent, Cho was approached by the Japanese governor of Pyongyang and asked to organise a committee to assume control and maintain stability in the power vacuum that would inevitably follow.Kim, The History of Korea, p142 He agreed to co- operate, and on 17 August 1945 formed the Provisional People's Committee for the Five Provinces. The committee functioned to standardize the number of members, duties, and electoral processes for the formation of People’s Committees at the provincial, city, country, township, and village levels.Armstrong, \\"The North Korean Revolution\\", p68 Cho also affiliated this committee to the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence (CPKI).Ree, \\"Socialism in One Zone\\", p87 The Provisional People’s Committee for the Five Provinces generally composed of right-wing nationalists opposed to communism.Lee, The Partition of Korea, p133 When the Soviet forces arrived in Pyongyang following the Japanese surrender they hoped they could influence Cho Man-sik. Cho was at this time the most popular leader in Pyongyang due mainly to his constant resistance to the Japanese and his formation of the Korean Products Promotions Society.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p14Wells, \\"New God, New Nation\\", p137 Soviet officers regularly met with Cho and tried to convince him to head the emerging North Korea administration. Cho however disliked communism and did not trust foreign powers.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p14 Cho Man-sik would have agreed to co-operate with the Soviet authorities only on his own terms, such as extensive autonomy. Cho's conditions were not accepted by the Soviet leaders. Despite his rejection of Soviet requests he was able to remain as chairman of the South P’yŏngan People’s Committee.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p14 On 3 November 1945, Cho also established his own political party: The Democratic Party of Korea. At the beginning it was intended to turn into an authentic political organization of the nationalist right with the aim to bring about a democratic society after Japanese occupation. The Soviets however, did not approve of the Democratic Party of Korea and thus under socialist pressure, Choi Yong-kun was elected the first deputy chairman of the party. Choi Yong- kun was a guerrilla soldier who served in the 88th brigade of the Soviet Union, and was a friend of Kim Il-sung. The party was therefore influenced by Soviet ideals from the beginning.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p22 Soviet faith that Cho Man-sik could become a North Korean leader with Soviet ideals diminished and new hope was placed on the Korean communist Kim Il-sung. Kim Il-sung had trained in the Soviet Army for ten years, rising to the rank of major. Under Soviet pressure, Cho was obliged to reorganize the Provisional People's Committee for the Five Provinces, and accept more communists onto the councils.Lee, The Partition of Korea, p135 The opposing ideologies of Kim and Cho led to a clash between the two men, and the forced power-sharing failed to sit well with either of them. The 1945 Moscow Conference between the victorious Allies discussed the statehood of Korea, proposing a four-power trusteeship for a period of five years, after which Korea would become an independent state. For Cho, this would result in excessive foreign, and particularly communist, influence over his country, and he refused to co- operate.Lee, The Partition of Korea, p145 On 1 January 1946, Andrey Alekseyevich Romanenko, a Soviet leader, met with Cho and tried to persuade him to sign support of the trusteeship. Cho however, refused to sign support.Ree, \\"Socialism in One Zone\\", p143 After Soviet leaders realized that they could not persuade Cho to endorse Soviet trusteeship, they lost all remaining hope of Cho becoming a prominent North Korean leader reflecting Soviet ideals.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p24 On 5 January, Cho was arrested by Soviet soldiers and detained in Pyongyang's Koryo Hotel.Lankov, \\"From Stalin to Kim Il Sung\\", p23 For some time he was kept under comfortable conditions at the Koryo Hotel, from which position he continued to vocally oppose the communists. He stood in the 1948 vice-presidency election, but by then the Communist influence in the country's affairs was too strong, and he was unsuccessful, receiving only 10 votes from the National Assembly. Cho was later transferred to a prison in Pyongyang, where confirmed reports of him end. He is generally believed to have been executed along with other political prisoners during the early days of the Korean War, possibly in October 1950.Armstrong, \\"The North Korean Revolution\\", p123 Cho's removal opened the way for Kim Il-sung to consolidate his power in the north, a position he was able to hold for 48 years until his death in 1994.  Legacy  In 1970, Cho's deeds gained posthumous recognition when South Korean government awarded him the Order of the Republic of Korea in the Order of Merit for National Foundation. The taekwondo form Ko-Dang was named in honour of Cho Man-sik.

Following his retirement from playing he went into management, enjoying most success with Welsh sides Newport County, Cardiff City and Swansea Town, taking all three sides to the Division Three South title. Club career McCandless was born in Craigs near Ballymena, and grew up in Ahoghill, County Antrim, the son of John McCandless, a grocer, and Matilda (née Eyre), a dressmaker.Census of Ireland in 1901 and 1911; National Archives of Ireland. He started his career with non-league sides Ligoniel and Barn before joining Linfield in 1914. He stayed with the Blues for six years, helping them to Irish Cup success in 1916 and 1919 before his performance in a 2–0 defeat to England while playing for Ireland prompted a number of British sides to show interest in signing him. Eventually joining Rangers in 1920 for £2,500, a record fee for an Irish player at the time, he went on to add six Scottish Football League titles to his honours collection while playing at Ibrox where he formed a formidable full back pairing with another Irishman, Bert Manderson. In 1930, by then a veteran, McCandless was given the opportunity to move into football management by Ballymena, where he was appointed player-manager. He returned to Scotland in 1933 to take charge of Dundee before moving to Newport County in 1937, where he helped them to promotion to Division 2 in 1939 despite using just 13 players throughout the season.\\"1920–1943\\" Government of the United Kingdom.

It was located near the park offices on the northern edge of Cache Lake, and was a focal point for the park for many years. Wishing to return the park lands to a more natural state, the Inn was purchased by the Ontario Government in 1956 and removed. Today all that remains are traces of the concrete stairs and platform that met the CNR line, which was lifted after departure of the last train in 1959. Early history The park was established in 1893 as a nature preserve and recreational playground. The railway through the southern and western portions of the park had been built in the 1890s by the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway (OA&PS;), opened for traffic in 1897, and was purchased by the GTR in 1905. Changes to the administration policies of the park since 1893 permitted short-term leases for the construction and the operation of hotels and summer camps to make the park more attractive to tourists. By 1908, the GTR had become well established in Muskoka, southwest of Algonquin Park, as a resort area which the railway promoted as the \\"Highlands of Ontario.\\" That year, the Grand Trunk Railway opened its first tourist lodge, the Highland Inn, which was an immediate success. Located at the Algonquin Park station, near the park headquarters, the Inn was a simple two-story structure with a covered verandah across the front of its main floor, which overlooked Cache Lake. A staircase led from the station platform to the main entrance at the center of the building; there was also an inclined path leading up from the station. In its first years of operation, the hotel proved so popular that land on the west side of Highland Inn was cleared and raised wooden platforms erected, on which tents (supplied by the hotel), were put up to meet the requirements of the rapidly growing tourist trade. Enlargement In 1913, the Highland Inn was enlarged and a west wing was built, along with a three-story central tower and an addition to the east side, extending from the rear of the original structure. Only that first section of the hotel, however, was winterized. The number of rooms included 11 with bath and 61 without one. Running water was supplied from a large wooden water tower at the rear of the hotel. Water was also supplied to fire hydrants, while a standpipe at the station serviced steam locomotives. A canoe livery for rental of canoes and rowboats was built on the shore in front of the hotel. Above the boathouse was a covered dance floor. Other activities for guests included tennis and lawn bowling. There were also large sitting rooms inside and a billiard room for men. In the same year, Nominigan Camp, consisting of a main lodge with six cabins of log construction, was established on Smoke Lake. Camp Minnesing on Burnt Island Lake was also created as a wilderness lodge with similar accommodations. Open only in July and August, both were built by the GTR as affiliates of the Highland Inn. With trains running practically to its front door, easy connections could be made from Toronto or Ottawa. The Highland Inn became popular with tourists from major cities of the Atlantic Seaboard. Nominigan Camp and Camp Minnesing were accessible by wagon road. A nominal charge was made for stage service from Highland Inn. Both outpost lodges were accessible by paddle and portage from Joe Lake station. Nominigan Camp on Smoke Lake could also be reached from the Canoe Lake station. 1925 CNR Algonquin Park pamphletWith the 1923 takeover of the GTR by the Canadian National Railways (CNR), management of the three lodges came under Canadian National Hotels' administration. Like its forerunner, the CNR continued to promote its own hotels, including those acquired from other lines, as well as privately owned hotels, lodges and camps across the railway system. Great Depression and closure An accidental fire destroyed some of the guest cabins at Nominigan Lodge in 1926; they were not rebuilt. With the onset of the Great Depression, Camp Minnesing was sold in 1930 to Henry Burton Sharman. Dr. Sharman was a repeat client at the lodge on Burnt Island Lake, having held his annual religious seminars there since 1923. Nominigan Camp was sold in 1931 and became a private cottage. The Highland Inn closed in 1932. Reopening Ed and Norman Paget of Huntsville reopened the Inn in 1937. By then, a number of changes had taken place to its surroundings. Through train service between Parry Sound and Ottawa was curtailed in 1933 when a flash flood weakened the footings of a steel trestle on the railway, about 3 km east of the Inn. At the same time, timber trestles on the east end of Cache Lake were condemned. The railway was unable to afford repair costs and the government refused to subsidize it. Instead, a turntable was installed west of Highland Inn, enabling scheduled trains from the west to terminate there and return to Parry Sound. In the 1940s, the CNR continued to include the Highland Inn in its listings in tourist pamphlets. Construction of a highway through Algonquin Park was started, partly as a relief project for unemployed single men during the Depression. Part of the road covered the old Nominigan wagon road, west of Cache Lake. By 1948, Highway 60 was paved through the park. Advertisements for the Highland Inn began to appear in the Canadian Automobile Association’s Ontario Motor League Road Book. Final closure In 1954, a new policy for Algonquin Park was announced that was designed to return the park to its original condition. As part of that policy, the Highland Inn was purchased from Ruth Paget by the Ontario Government in 1956. In the following year, it was dismantled and burned. In its place, a grove of planted red pine trees was placed which is now mature enough to explore under the pine boughs the former site of one of Canada's grand railway hotels. Little else remains except for some foundation remnants and an old staircase with an occasional water pipe protruding from the ground. Remains A small interpretive centre consisting of a short section of OA&PS; rails and several plaques has been built along the former railway platform. The plaques introduce the history of the Highland, the OA&PS;, and changes to the park over time.

Playing career Crosby played for Lincoln United in his teens. He had been one of the most promising players in the Lincoln area and regularly appeared for Lincoln City's youth and reserve sides. A slight but skilful player, it was often felt his physique would prevent him turning professional. He was finally given an opportunity in the professional ranks when he joined Lincoln City on non-contract terms in September 1987. However, in a struggling team he found it difficult to make an impact and made just seven appearances for the Imps before rejoining Lincoln United. In 1988, Crosby came to the attention of Grantham Town manager Martin O'Neill while playing for the Lincolnshire County FA side and was soon signed by Grantham on a free transfer. He made just nine appearances for the Gingerbreads scoring twice. He joined Nottingham Forest for £20,000 (a Grantham club record) in December 1987 where he went on to make 152 appearances, scoring 12 goals, during a seven-year career at the City Ground. During his time at Forest the club played in numerous cup finals at Wembley. His most famous goal came against Manchester City in a 1–0 win for Forest. Crosby headed the ball out of goalkeeper Andy Dibble's hand before rolling the ball into an empty net. Crosby spent three games on loan at Grimsby Town, during the 1993–94 season. He joined Huddersfield Town on a free transfer in 1994. Crosby made just 44 appearances for the club, scoring six goals. His spell at the Yorkshire club included an appearance at Wembley in the playoff final. The 1997–98 season saw him play a handful of times for Rushden & Diamonds. He returned to Lincoln United for the start of the 1998–99 season. Coaching career His return to Ashby Avenue was to be short lived and in October 1998 he linked up with close friend Nigel Clough, joining Burton Albion as player/assistant manager. Their first game in charge came at Grantham in an FA Trophy replay at The Meres, in which Albion won 3–0. Crosby made his debut for the Brewers in the 1–1 draw with Nuneaton Borough on 3 November 1998. The 2001/02 season saw Burton win the Unibond Premier Division title and promotion into the Conference under the Clough/Crosby management. Crosby resigned from his position as assistant manager in January 2005, due to work commitments. However, following a short time out of the game Crosby returned to Burton Albion ahead of the 2006/07 season. By Christmas of the 2008/09 season Clough and Crosby had led Burton Albion to a 13-point lead at the top of the Conference National; however, in January 2009 Clough left Burton Albion to replace Paul Jewell as manager of Derby County. In January 2009 Crosby followed Nigel Clough to Derby County taking the position of assistant manager. After the departure of Nigel Clough from Derby County in 2013 Crosby followed Clough to Sheffield United acting as coaching staff.

It is used aboard polar-orbiting, near- Earth weather satellite programs such as MetOp and NPOESS. Purpose LRPT provides three image channels at full sensor resolution (10-bit, 1 km/pixel, six lines/second) in addition to data from other sensors, such as atmospheric sounders and GPS positioning information. The system is an update and replacement of the existing analog system called automatic picture transmission (APT), which has been used since the 1960s aboard NOAA's TIROS polar-orbiting satellites. The APT system provided only two image channels, which were at a reduced accuracy and resolution (8-bit, 4 km/pixel, two lines/second). Compared to the APT system, LRPT images are four times more accurate and contain twelve times the resolution. Further, the additional data from other sensors increases the applications of the satellites and the users who receive the signal. Design LRPT uses a packetized datastream transmitted at an approximately 62 kilobits per second (kbit/s) rate. Each sensor using the LRPT is considered an application and provided a percentage of the transmission bandwidth in the form of a virtual channel. For example, the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imaging sensor is provided approximately 40 kbit/s to transmit its three image channels, and the high-resolution infrared radiation sounder (HIRS) is provided approximately 2900 bit/s. The packetized application system provides the flexibility to transmit and receive new types of data in the future using the same hardware. The datastream is processed using a Reed–Solomon error correction, then convolution encoded, interleaved, and padded with unique synchronization words. The resulting binary stream is approximately 160 kbit/s. It is transmitted as an 80 kiloBaud quadrature phase-shift keyed (QPSK) signal on an RF carrier in the 137 MHz-band, with an equivalent isotropically radiated power level that varies between 3.2 dBW (2 watts) and 8.0 dBW (6.3 watts). To ensure the low-complexity ground stations that previously received the APT signal would be able to access the LRPT signal, a design study was included with the LRPT specification. Labeled Annex 1, it shows the calculations which approximate the worst-case link budget for fixed, omnidirectional antenna reception will be 4.9 dB when the satellite is 13° above the horizon, and improve to 8.6 dB at 30° or higher elevations. Image data The AVHRR image data, in its raw form, consists of three images, each composed of six lines per second, at 2048 pixels per line, using 10-bits per pixel. This yields a raw datarate of 368,640 bit/s; approximately ten times greater than the allocated bandwidth. Therefore, the data is compressed using the JPEG extended DCT compression, adapted to a fixed compression ratio with continuous operation (no header or trailer), to fit the virtual channel size. The imager data is gathered into image \\"strips\\" of 2048 pixels wide and 8 rows tall before being compressed. Each packet contains three of these image strips, one for each image channel. To reconstruct a 2048x2048 image requires 256 consecutive AVHRR image packets. Current status and future Although LRPT is on the European MetOp-A satellite launched on 19 October 2006, LRPT was permanently deactivated on that vehicle after causing interference with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRShttp://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Metop/MetopDesign/HIRS/index.html). Because of the fundamental nature of this interference in relation to the MetOp design, plans to operate LRPT on Metop-B and Metop-C were cancelled. EUMETSAT User Service, July 18, 2008 NOAA-19, launched on 6 February 2009 and still operating as of March 2018, is the last NOAA satellite to carry the old analog automatic picture transmission (APT) system, which dates back to the 1960s. At one point, NOAA indicated it would move to a system such as LRPT on future vehicles, but after the NPOESS program was replaced with JPSS in February 2010, NOAA decided to eliminate Low Rate Data (LRD) transmissions from JPSS.http://satelliteconferences.noaa.gov/2013/docs/Tuesday,%20April%209,%202013/2.5a_POES%20to%20JPSS%20Transition.ppt, see slides 6 and 9 On 8 July 2014, Russia launched the METEOR-M No. 2 weather satellite (also known as METEOR-M2) with LRPT on board. Instructions for receiving LRPT images from this satellite are posted on the Internet.http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-meteor-m-n2-lrpt- weather-satellite-images-rtl-sdr/, slides 6 and 9 On 4 July 2019, the METEOR-M N2-2 satellite was launched.

(see 2004 in music). Originally slated for an October 12 release date, The College Kicked-Out finally saw the light of day on November 2 after being delayed by bootlegging.  Overview  Both the album's cover art and title are a tongue-in-cheek reference to the 2003 grade-altering controversy at Claflin University that resulted in Danny! being accused of not only orchestrating the entire operation, but of accumulating a substantial amount of money from tampering with the institution's academic records; Danny! was subsequently expelled. The College Kicked-Out was just twelve days shy of being released an approximate year after Danny!'s expulsion from the university. Contrary to the title, the album never actually gives any insight to the events leading up to Danny!'s expulsion from Claflin; rather, The College Kicked-Out is, at face value, a formulaic hip-hop record (Danny! slyly references such a formula at the beginning of \\"Second Time Around\\", proclaiming it his \\"obligatory [club] track\\") with much of its content being self-referential. The album showcased sole production from Danny!, establishing him as a notable producer from South Carolina; The College Kicked-Out was also significant for not featuring any guest appearances, making Danny!'s debut record a completely solo effort. The album was the first record of many to come to be released under the 1911 Music/Badenov Records imprint which, according to Danny!, is a record label in name only. The \\"1911\\" is a reference to the year Kappa Alpha Psi, a fraternity he joined at Claflin, was founded and \\"Badenov\\" is obviously homage paid to Boris Badenov, an antagonist from Jay Ward's Rocky & Bullwinkle series of which Danny! is an avid fan. = Reception = The College Kicked-Out was initially met with mixed reviews. Retrospectively, music critics have gone on to say that though The College Kicked-Out is neither a masterpiece nor Danny!'s definitive album, it is a \\"pretty solid debut\\" overall. The album not only helped establish Danny!'s freewheeling and emotional persona (a sharp contrast from the cynical and extremely sarcastic characteristics he would reveal on subsequent albums), but also helped reiterate the ethic of DIY used by many emerging underground hip-hop artists at the time, such as Little Brother, Lupe Fiasco and Tanya Morgan, who too would see moderate popularity on the Internet translate into a recording contract with major or independent record labels. = Availability = Due to the lack of a sufficient budget, only a few hundred copies of The College Kicked-Out were initially pressed up. The record was available only on compact disc and the original copies—complete with liner notes that featured both sample information and phony album credits (for example, sample clearance services are credited to a Hugh Jazfynes, a pun on hip-hop artists having to pay \\"huge-ass fines\\" should they get sued for failure to clear samples)—are very rare and are now considered collector's items. The College Kicked-Out has since been pirated in the wake of Danny!'s recent success—namely, his signing to Definitive Jux, Interscope Records and later Okayplayer—making legitimate copies that much more difficult to authenticate. Following the unfavorable reaction to The College Kicked-Out at the time, Danny! recorded a bonus song, \\"Clap Back\\", and added the track to the second and final pressing of the album in December 2004. \\"Clap Back\\" is the only song on either edition of The College Kicked-Out to directly address the grade-changing incident at his former alma mater and is considered the \\"bridge\\", in terms of artistic direction, between Danny!'s debut album and its follow-up, the darker and more scathing F.O.O.D.

Fidelis managed to organize Alexander's escape. Alexander fled to Como but was captured again. Brought back to Milan, he was once more condemned to death by decapitation, but during the execution the executioner's arms went stiff.

Dream, Interrupted was released exclusively in the United Kingdom (under Danny's birth name, Daniel Swain) on August 14, 2006 (see 2006 in music) prior to seeing a stateside release the following year. Overview Prior to the release of Dream, Interrupted, Danny had released three studio albums (The College Kicked-Out, F.O.O.D. and Charm) that showcased both his rapping and his production skills; Dream, Interrupted helped shift the spotlight solely on Danny's production. Presumably, the record was released under Danny's full name in an effort to distinguish himself from Danny!, his rapping alter ego. The title itself is an allusion to Danny's well-publicized 2006 \\"retirement\\" in which he decided to briefly discontinue, or \\"interrupt\\", his long-time goal, or \\"dream\\", of hitting it big in the music industry. With the success of his third studio album Charm and his subsequent signing to Definitive Jux Records for an EP and music video, Danny has since released a sequel to Dream, Interrupted, aptly titled Dream, Fulfilled. Dream, Interrupted opens and closes with, appropriately, portions of The Sylvers' \\"Cry Of A Dreamer\\". Excerpts from a Marvin Gaye interview are placed within the clips. The album's tagline, \\"23 years. 23 beats. 46 minutes. You do the math.\\" helped listeners grasp the reason for Danny's choice of quantity of tracks and the overall length of the album (though the tagline is erroneous, as both the \\"Intro\\" and \\"Outro\\" aren't instrumentals at all, making the album comprise only 21 beats). The most common theory regarding Dream, Interrupted's format is that the number \\"23\\" was meant to represent the age of both Danny! the rapper and Daniel Swain the producer at the time of its release; the sum of 23 and 23, of course, is 46. This was later confirmed during an interview. The instrumental titles contain either subtle references to events in Danny's career, ethereal connotations or utter nonsense. The \\"hidden\\" meanings behind song titles have been debated on several hip-hop message boards. =Music= With many of the tracks clocking in at just over two minutes long, the concise exploration of various tracks made Dream, Interrupted very similar in style to J Dilla's Donuts, another instrumental album lauded in 2006 with an underlying theme and track titles containing seemingly subtle meanings. Musically, Dream, Interrupted picks up where Charm left off, with the album balancing a sophisticated yet very distinctly upbeat sound with a somber undertone. Over the course of the past few years Danny's production style has evolved from sped-up, \\"chopped\\" soul samples typical of most of his contemporaries to more ambient, jazz-infused offerings that seem to be a hybrid of drum & bass, bossa nova and electronica. This could be attributed to his recent experimentation with sampling songs from out-of-print foreign film soundtracks, specifically from France, Italy and Japan, as well as sound library records from England. Thus, Danny's musical \\"evolution\\" is first documented here on such songs as \\"Listen\\", \\"Twilight Mist\\" and \\"Sea of Tomorrow\\". Occasionally, however, Danny will revert to the sound he first introduced on his earlier work; examples on Dream, Interrupted include \\"I'm Not Ready\\", \\"This Time Around\\" and \\"Salon Des Refuses\\". =Availability= For reasons still unknown, Dream, Interrupted was initially released in compact disc format in various parts of the United Kingdom. As a result, very few copies exist in the US and only a handful of music editors have ever even seen the actual record stateside. However, all of Danny's independent releases have been distributed in limited quantities, presumably due to a lack of a substantial budget. The scarcity of the record in the UK, the virtual nonexistence of copies in the United States, and the meager promotion of the album overall made Dream, Interrupted one of Danny's most mysterious and sought-after projects in late 2006, until it was re-released digitally the following year. For a while following its initial release little else was known about the album outside of its promotional tagline and the occasional interview that Danny would mention it in, when prompted. In 2008 Danny's third instrumental album Dream, Extinguished would significantly eclipse the amount of scantiness and subsequent infringement of Dream, Interrupted due to its abrupt cancellation. Dream, Interrupted's lack of publicity was a sharp contrast to the ubiquity of Charm, released precisely five months prior.

Throughout his life, he demonstrated an enormous appreciation for the jazz culture and music. In 1972 and on the night of the visiting fellows program in honor of Duke Ellington, Owens recalls the night as such: “I was center stage with some of the greatest men in the history of Jazz, and I wanted to perform something really meaningful. Since Jazz music has its roots in spirituals that later developed into the blues, I wanted to express my respect for these men by performing a spiritual and the blues. I looked around. I saw Eubie Blake, Benny Carter, Johnny Hodges, and Paul Robeson. I was standing in the midst of so many of the African American people who had contributed significantly to the history of American culture. What an incredible moment it was! It reconfirmed for me what I had learned in my travels as an artist. Jazz is the heartbeat of the world.” Owens has always held a profound admiration for the art of jazz and displayed an immeasurable respect for the jazz pioneers that set the stage before him. To this day, he exhibits his adoration for music and attempts to share his understanding with everyone who listens. He contributes greatly to the next generation of musicians through his support in different groups and events across the U.S. He may not be famous for his virtuosic solos or unmatchable dexterity; however, he is reverenced as an advocate to musicians everywhere and is internationally appreciated as an accomplished artist that shared his knowledge and music with the world.

The office became more important under the Sasanian Empire. Argbeds were granted their command by the Sassanian emperor (Shahanshah) and were responsible for maintaining the security of their area of operation (usually a trading post, military fortress, or city), fighting the encroaching nomadic tribes such as Bedouin Arabs, White Huns and Oghuz Turks, and resisting the advances of settled enemies such as Romans and Kushans. The Sasanian king usually selected Argbeds from wuzurgan, Iranian noble families who held the most powerful positions in the imperial administration. This rank, like most imperial administration, was mostly patrimonial, and was passed down through a single family for generations.

In 1910 he joined Cardiff City as a player-manager, becoming the club's first manager in their history. He later went on to fulfil the same role at Newport County. Career Davy McDougall played locally for Irvine Meadow. He joined Partick Thistle playing 18 games in the Scottish League Division Two championship winning side of 1899–00. He was also with Rangers without apparently making a first team appearance. In summer 1900 he joined Southern League Bristol City from Partick Thistle making his debut at outside left in a 0–2 defeat at Luton Town on 15 September 1900. He made 11 appearances scoring 2 goals playing on both right and left wings in season 1900–01 when Bristol City were runners up in the Southern League. He also played on both wings in 12 Western League games scoring 2 goals. He rejoined Rangers in the summer of 1901 making 4 appearances in their Scottish League Division One championship winning side of 1901–02.

Personal life Mrs. Carl Meyer and her Children, John Singer Sargent, 1896 Meyer was born in Hamburg, Germany, in a Jewish family, the second son of Siegmund Meyer and Elise Rosa, née Hahn, daughter of Reuben Hahn. He became a naturalised British subject in 1877. In 1883 he married Adèle Levis, daughter of Julius Levis of Hampstead by which he had a son Frank Cecil Meyer and a daughter. Adèle Levis was the subject of the portrait Mrs. Carl Meyer and her Children, 1896, by John Singer Sargent. Career Meyer worked at first for the Rothschild family as their chief clerk and negotiator with the De Beers mining group. He then went on to work for De Beers and became deputy chairman of the company. He was also governor of the National Bank of Egypt, and member of the board of numerous other mining companies. He was also a board member of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC). He was given the title of baronet in 1910. Meyer had a great interest in the arts, constantly showing support for opera, music and the theatre. In 1909 he donated 70,000 pounds to the Shakespeare National Memorial Theatre, now rebuilt as the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. During World War I, Meyer wrote to The Times expressing his disapproval of the tactics used by the Germans in the war, including the sinking of the RMS Lusitania, prompted by a suggestion by Sir Arthur Wing Pinero that Britons of German origin should speak out publicly.

He played a total of 46 games, mostly from the sub's bench, and scored five goals. One of these goals came in a Football League Trophy tie where he scored the winner. Rowe also played for Scarborough and Bury during this time, on loan. He played three games for Bury without scoring, and played 18 for Scarborough scoring twice in all competitions. =York City= Rowe spent three years at York, playing 108 games and scoring 28 in all competitions. He received a £150 fine in March 1998, while playing for City, after pushing a woman into a wheelie bin, admitting to common assault at Selby Magistrates' Court. Also during this time Rowe was loaned out to Halifax Town. =Gillingham= Rowe signed for Gillingham on 23 November 1999 for £30,000 and failed to impress. He played 23 games in all competitions, 14 of those appearances coming from the bench, scoring just four goals during that time. =Hull City= Rowe signed for Hull City in 2001 on a free transfer. Hull turned out to be his last Football League club and scored eight goals in 37 appearances. Rowe then dropped down to non-League, in 2002, to play for Emley. =Non-League career= Only months after signing for Emley, where Rowe played 15 game and scored four goals, he signed for Ashton United. In 2003, he left Ashton for Ossett Town where he stayed until 2005 when he moved onto Farsley Celtic. He stayed there until 2006 and signed for Bradford Park Avenue.

Before Merrill's invention, all wheel-balancing for automobiles, trucks, etc., required removal of the wheel from the vehicle. Most required some form of static balancing without wheel rotation, which was slow and error-prone. Merrill's invention balanced wheels while still mounted to the vehicle, by spinning them at high speed and electronically analyzing the vibrations to trigger a stroboscope. Technicians could then determine where balancing weights should be added.

It records very high quality digital stereo or 4-channel audio on a hand-held unit, and has been called \\"the studio on a stick.\\" Peripherals and uses Included in the retail box are an SD card, desk stand, handle for putting the H2 in a microphone stand, wind screen, 3.5mm TRS to RCA cable, earbud headphones, USB cable and power adapter. The H2's microphones, functionality, and use of standard USB and SD interfaces make it suitable both for recording high-quality sound and in many speech applications. The H2 has been cited by various oral history associations, such as Oral History AssociationOral History Association and Vermont Folklife CenterVermont Folklife Center as an affordable option for recording narrator interviews. The H2's rate of data transfer via the USB 2.0 port is \\"full speed\\" of up to 12 Mbit/s, the same as USB 1.1 and much slower than the widely available USB 2.0 Hi-Speed of 60 Mbit/s. The H2 can be powered either by two standard AA batteries or a power adapter. Recording time with low self-discharge 2000 mAh NiMH batteries is about 6 hours for mp3 bitrate set to 128 kbit/s.  Recorder features  The H2 can record in WAV format (at 96, 48, or 44.1 kHz in either 16 or 24 bit depth). Recording to compressed MP3 format at up to 320 kbit/s or VBR is supported in the 2-channel recording mode. Officially the H2 supports SD flash memory cards, but some SDHC cards of up to 32GB capacity have been confirmed by Zoom to work.H2 Operation Confirmed SD Cards The H2 has a three-way gain input switch, with settings for low (useful for loud sounds, such as a live rock band), medium, and high (useful for speech, such as one or two people podcasting in a quiet room.)

The input jack for external stereo microphones supports plug-in power.H2 datasheet The H2 has built-in microphones, but allows external ones to be used if different characteristics are required. Unlike the H4, the H2 makes no provision for multi-track recording, but its 360-degree polar sound recording can record in 4 channel audio, which can later be converted to 5.1 channel audio using computer software. Typical commercial audio software. Free software The H2 and the H4, can be used as an audio interface to a computer. When connected to a host computer via USB, the H2 can act as a microphone, audio input (with microphone or line input) and output device with stereo line output. It can also be used as a USB file storage device. Typical prices in the United States were around US$350 for the H4n and around $200 for the H2 and H2n.An example of an online store showing the US list prices is Design changes and delays The H2 began shipping on August 21, 2007. This was delayed from the original May 2007 shipping date due as an additional microphone was added; the original three-microphone Mid-Side design was lacking in some respects, and was abandoned in favor of the four- microphone W-X/Y design. The built-in high-fidelity electret condenser microphone capsules are arranged to allow stereo recording and have user- selectable parameters to allow for either a 90- or 120-degree pickup angle.

In 1999 its name was changed to \\"ParisTech\\".Official website,l'histoire et le fonctionnement . Retrieved 27 July 2008 In 2007, ParisTech's status changed to a public establishment for scientific cooperation (établissement public de coopération scientifique). It is headed by a President, assisted by an executive bureau and a secretary general and administrated by a board of directors, supported by a strategic orientation council and a scientific council. The board of directors includes one representative of each college or institute as well as researchers, faculty members, and one representative of the students. Colleges and institutes The member institutes of ParisTech are long-established publicly owned educational and research institutions, many of which were founded in the 18th century. Some deliver a high-level, broad education in science such as Arts et Métiers ParisTech, MINES ParisTech, École des Ponts ParisTech, ENSTA ParisTech, whereas others provide a deeper, research-focused level of expertise in select scientific disciplines, such as AgroParisTech (life, food and environmental sciences), Télécom Paris (telecommunications), Chimie ParisTech (chemistry), ESPCI Paris (physics, chemistry and biology), Institut d'Optique Graduate School (physics and optics), ENSAE ParisTech (Economy, Statistics & Finance). ParisTech is also a member of IDEA League, an alliance between universities in science and technology in Europe, as well as of the ATHENS Programme. The member colleges and institutes are: *École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers (Arts et Métiers ParisTech), engineering school founded in 1780 *École nationale des ponts et chaussées (École des Ponts ParisTech), founded in 1747 *Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l'environnement (AgroParisTech), founded in 2007, as a result of the merger of three agronomy, forestry and food science schools with roots dating back to 1664 *École nationale de la statistique et de l'administration économique (ENSAE ParisTech), founded in 1942 *École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI ParisTech), founded in 1882 *École nationale supérieure de chimie de Paris (Chimie ParisTech), founded in 1896 *École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris (Mines ParisTech), founded in 1783 *École nationale supérieure des télécommunications (Télécom Paris), founded in 1878 *École nationale supérieure de techniques avancées (ENSTA ParisTech), founded in 1741 *Institut d'Optique Graduate School (SupOptique), founded in 1920 Facts and Figures From the official website: *2,000 teachers-researchers *16,500 students (31% of whom are foreign students) *2,500 PhD students *1300,000 alumni Studies: *6,200 Master's degrees delivered every year *181 Master's programmes (teaching unit specialities) with more than 2700 coursesAccording to the online catalogue of curses (listed in external links). *15 ParisTech Masters of Science programmes *73 Advanced master's degrees (MS, Conférence des Grandes Ecoles accredited) *21 Doctorate schools in 28 accredited programs in PariTech schools, or in partnership with science institutes and universities.

However, some institutes also created additional sites on the outskirts of Paris or in other parts of the country. Some years ago, the École nationale des ponts et chaussées eventually moved its educational and research facilities to more spacious facilities in greater Paris, in Marne-la-Vallée (East). SupOptique and part of ENSTA have relocated to the Palaiseau campus recently, as did the ENSAE ParisTech. Besides its Latin Quarter location, AgroParisTech, the ParisTech college that specializes in life, food, and environmental sciences, also is located at eight other sites, including sites on the Parisian outskirts (including an experimental farm used for education and research, at the Château de Grignon in the West of the Paris), in other parts of mainland France, and Guyane. Similarly for Arts et Métiers ParisTech, only the main one of its 8 campuses is located in Paris. The other teaching and research centers are spread in the country, closer to the industrial fabric of each region. Different specializations are available in the campuses, such as Aerospace in Bordeaux and materials science in Metz. Education ParisTech offers a variety of courses, independently or in partnership with other institutions (in particular doctoral and master's degrees), in the core disciplines of science and technology at postgraduate level. Its main programmes are: *the \\"Ingénieur\\" degree (equivalent to a master's degree of engineering) delivering a broad understanding of fundamental Engineering Science and a thorough introduction to Economics, Management and Communication. The admission to the Ingénieur degree is widely known as being highly selective. Students are admitted through nationwide competitive examinations for students having completed two years of Classes Préparatoires in France or abroad, or by virtue of outstanding academic records. *Master of Science (MSc) programmes, courses designed to provide an in-depth understanding in various fields of science ranging from Mathematics to Economics. Admission to ParisTech MSc programmes is open to students holding a Bachelor of Science (BSc) or a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) from a French or international university. Each college or institute has its own specific admissions requirements. *Mastères spécialisés (Post-master professional certificates) enable students which have already completed a master's degree to develop their knowledge in a speciality to a high standard. *Doctoral programmes (PhD): ParisTech laboratories play host to 2000 doctoral students. Thesis enrolment is handled by the ParisTech institute or college to which the host laboratory is attached. *ParisTech institutes and colleges also offer continuing education courses aimed at professionals, accessible with a Bachelor or university degree, with courses to the degrees of Ingénieur, Master, Specialized Master or Doctorate.

McElderry (hard-cover edition), the current edition was published in February 2011 by Imaginator Press. This novel is the first in the Ratha series, also re-titled as The Books of the Named.  Plot  Ratha and her people (the Named) are a clan of a strong sapient cheetah-like prehistoric nimravids. They have laws, languages, and traditions and live by herding the local prey creatures, such as dapple-backs (equids) and three-horns (pecorans), they once hunted. Surrounding the Named are the more numerous non-sentient UnNamed, who prey on the clan’s herds. Mating between Named and UnNamed is forbidden, since the clan believes that the resulting young will be UnNamed animals. Ratha, a young female, bucks the clan tradition of male dominance by training with the herding teacher, Thakur, to become a herder. All the herders are male except for Fessran, a strong-willed female who became a herder before Meoran took over leadership. Attacks by the UnNamed are driving Ratha's clan close to the edge of survival. Only her discovery and use of fire (“The Red Tongue” and the “Creature” of the title) offers the clan a chance to survive. Meoran, the tyrannical male clan leader, opposes Ratha and drives her out of the clan. In exile among the UnNamed, Ratha meets a lone male and discovers that the clan is wrong about some of the UnNamed - he speaks very well and is as bright as any clan member. She dubs him \\"Bonechewer\\". He teaches her to hunt, the two mate and she has his young. When the cubs don’t develop according to her expectations, she realizes that they are probably non-sentient. She flies into a rage, attacking Bonechewer, biting and crippling the female cub, Thistle- chaser and abandoning her mate and the litter. Returning to the clan at Thakur‘s bidding, Ratha re-acquires “her creature”, the Red Tongue. With it, she overthrows and kills Meoran. When the UnNamed attack again, she, Thakur and Fessran lead the clan in striking back with a new weapon, fire. The enemy flees in terror. After the battle, Ratha emerges as clan leader. She makes Fessran chief of the Firekeepers, those who build and tend fire for the clan. The Firekeepers also wield torches in battle. Ratha gives The People of The Red Tongue each a torch, and they fight the UnNamed. Ratha’s victory is bittersweet, however. Her mate, Bonechewer, was fatally injured in the fight and Ratha finds him dying. Despite everything, she still loves him and is wounded by his death. She is also troubled by the changes Red Tongue has made in her people. However, she knows that with the Red Tongue, the Named will survive.

She married art historian and critic Victor Koshkin-Youritzin on August 30, 1970 and together they moved to Norman, Oklahoma in 1972. She was remarried to Brian Bibb in 1980.  Education  Glenda pursued her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in painting at Texas Christian University (TCU). As a student there she won first place in a national intercollegiate painting competition, and graduated magna cum laude with honors in 1967. Continuing her education, Glenda obtained an M.A. in art history from Tulane University in 1970, with her thesis focusing on French Gothic sculpture. During her period as an M.A student she held a three-year Kress fellowship, taught art history, and was curator of collections for the Newcomb College art department. She also worked at Fort Worth's Kimbell Art Museum as a Research Assistant to the institution's director from 1968–1969.  Career  Glenda's painting career as began seriously in 1970 following graduation from her M.A. program. She had established herself as a leading portrait painter and realist by the time she joined the art department at the University of Oklahoma (from 1972-1976) to teach art history and serve as a guest artist on faculty. Glenda has had her work displayed on exhibition in the United States at the Museum of the Southwest, Midland Texas (1975), Museum of Art, University of Oklahoma, Norman (1975), Oklahoma Museum of Art, Oklahoma City (1976), Philbrook Art Center, Tulsa (1978), the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of the City of New York, and Williams College Museum of Art. Beginning in 1980, Glenda's prints were published and distributed by Bruce McGaw Graphics of NYC. From 1986–1987, the Oklahoma Art Center in Oklahoma City honored Glenda with a retrospective of her paintings and portraits. In 1998 she had a show at the Mabee-Gerrer Museum of Art. More than 20% of her work is now owned by museums such as the Louvre, the British Museum, the Hermitage, and the Prado. Although Glenda has been praised for her work in pencil, pen, and lithography, her preferred medium is oil painting. Her painting technique is known for its detailed realism and expressive brush work, which communicates both energy and luminosity. It was during her creation of an inspired painting of Christ, The Lamb and The Lion, in 1992 that she turned to spiritual writing. Glenda has said that before the fall of 1991, when she was asked to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ, she had not considered the possibility of designating an exclusive spiritual purpose to any of her works. She is now a public speaker on spirituality and lives in Fort Worth, Texas.

Home shopping allows consumers to shop for goods from the privacy of their own home, as opposed to traditional shopping, which requires one to visit brick and mortar stores and shopping malls. There are three main types of home shopping: mail or telephone ordering from catalogs; telephone ordering in response to advertisements in print and electronic media (such as periodicals, TV and radio); and online shopping. History The possibility for merchants to show their goods through the world was the first usage of the \\"electroscope\\" (some kind of television apparatus) imagined by the author of the hoax published in the New York Sun, 30 March 1877. \\"The Electroscope\\", The New York Sun, 30 March 1877. The first such attempt at broadcasting shopping news occurred on February 1, 1927 with the establishment of WASN radio in Boston; owned by John Shepard III, WASN boasted reports from fifteen different department stores in Greater Boston every two hours, mixed with pre-recorded and live orchestra music.\\"New Station Will Take Air Tomorrow.\\" Boston Herald, January 30, 1927, p. 6A. Due to technical issues, the format was dropped after five months, and the station eventually merged operations into co-owned WNAC, today known as WBIX. The first experiments at broadcasting home shopping on television occurred in the UK as early as 1934. \\"La télévision permet d'acheter à distance\\", Le Monde illustré, 17 novembre 1934 The home shopping/electronic retailing industry was created in 1977, when small market talk radio show host Bob Circosta was asked to sell avocado-green-colored can openers live on the air by station owner Bud Paxson, when an advertiser traded 112 units of product instead of paying his advertising bill. Hesitant at first, Circosta reluctantly obliged – and to both men's great surprise, all 112 can openers sold out within the hour. Paxson sensed the vast sales potential of home-based commerce, and founded the world's first shopping channel on cable television, later launching nationwide with the Home Shopping Network (rebranded as HSN). Bob Circosta was America's first-ever TV home shopping host,becoming one of the most instantly recognizable salesmen in the United States. Over the next three decades, Circosta sold over 75,000 different products on HSN, netted over 20,000 hours of live, on-air TV selling, and achieved personal product sales in excess of one billion dollars. (The story is disputed; there is some record of Paxson having unsuccessfully tried a similar format in 1969 on one of his earlier TV stations, WNYP in Jamestown, New York.)Fybush, Scott (January 12, 2015). Salary Controversy Ousts Public TV Exec. NorthEast Radio Watch. Retrieved January 12, 2015. The classic television-based home shopping industry quickly became a major player in the retail industry.

Byz., or , Herod., or either or , Plato.), was an ancient town of Sicily, situated in the southwest of the island, on the river Hypsas (today the Belice). It is principally known from its connection with the mythical legends concerning Minos and Daedalus; the capital of the Sicanian prince Cocalus, who afforded a shelter to the fugitive Daedalus against the Cretan monarch, being placed by some writers at Inycum, and by others at Camicus. (Paus. vii. 4. § 6; Charax, ap. Steph. B. s. v. .) It is mentioned in historical times by Herodotus as the place of confinement to which Scythes, the ruler of Zancle (modern Messina), was sent by Hippocrates, who had taken him prisoner. (Herod. vi. 23, 24.) Aelian, who copies the narrative of Herodotus, represents Scythes as a native of Inycum; but this is probably a mistake. (Ael. V. H. viii. 17.) Plato speaks of Inycum as still in existence in his time, but quite a small place (); notwithstanding which he makes the sophist Hippias boast that he had derived from it a sum of 20 minae. (Plat. Hipp. M. p. 282, e.) It is evident that it always continued to be an inconsiderable place, and was probably a mere dependency of Selinus. Hence we never again meet with its name, though Stephanus tells us that this was still preserved on account of the excellence of its wine. (Steph. B. s. v. ; Aesych. s. v.) Vibius Sequester is the only author that affords any clue to its position, by telling us that the river Hypsas (the modern Belice) flowed by it (Vib. Sequest. p. 12, according to Cluver's emendation); but further than this its site cannot be determined.

He is also known as il Chenda because of an inheritance he received from someone with that name. Biography He was born to Francesco Rivarola and Giulia Panizza and baptised by June 1, 1590. Vite de' pittori e scultori ferraresi, Volume 2. by Girolamo Baruffaldi, page 188. As a youth, he became a pupil of the painter Carlo Bononi. In Ferrara, he painted the Marriage of the Virgin in Santa Maria in Vado. He also painted for a San Nicola and a John the Baptist, and a ceiling canvas of the Baptism of St Augustine for Sant'Agostino (now lost); a St Cajetan prays before a Crucifix for the Church of the Theatines; a Destruction of the Brazen Serpent for the church of San Nicolò; and a Martyrdom of St Catherine for the church of San Guglielmo. He painted two canvases (Manna in Desert and Miracle of Loaves and Fish for the parish church of Quartesana. In the chapel of Saint Maria Maddalena de'Pazzi of the church of San Paolo, he painted a St Francis in Glory. He completed an unfinished canvas of Bononi depicting the Marriage of the Virgin for Santa Maria in Vado Baruffaldi, page 197. He was also employed in the production of transient decorations for spectacles, festivities, and also the theater, and was employed in Ferrara by the Count Borso Bonacossi, and in Parma by the Duke. For example in 1631, Borso celebrated a tournament in celebration of the marriage of Beatrice Estense Tassoni, daughter of the Marchese Ferrante, to Giovanni Francesco Sacchetti, brother of Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, then legate of Ferrara. The tournament was held in the Sala dei Giganti, a hall in the Giardino Estense della Fontana. The theatrical presentation represented the story of Alcina the Sorceress, a Fisherman's Tale. In 1636, he worked for the Marchese Pio Enea degli Obizzi in a celebration held in the Prato della Valle in Padua. In 1638, again in Padua, he helped decorate a performance and tournament in the Hall of the Montartone Monastery. In 1638, he helped with the creation of a theatrical tableu, a mixed metaphor of pagan and Catholic themes, set up in a piazza near the Palazzo de' Marchesi Bevilacqua in Ferrara; the occasion was the celebration Coronation of Mary, as the Virgin of the Rosary and the arrival of the new cardinal Ciriaco Rocci. At a cost of over 11,000 crowns, over 80 feet tall and 70 feet long, spouting fireworks, a column in the piazza was converted into a seven headed hydra with each head representing heretic notions of the Virgin Mary. The masque had a cloud descend with Archangel Gabriel, incinerating the hydra.Baruffaldi, page 192-193. He died in Ferrara.

It is also the setting for Raymond Avery Bartlett's 2015 novel, Sunsets of Tulum. History As recently as the early 1990s Tulum Pueblo was a quiet village 2 km (1.5 mi) from the archaeological site, and tourism outside of the ruins was limited to a few small shops and simple cabanas on the beach. As of the 2010 census, population of Tulum Pueblo has grown to 18,233 permanent inhabitants with the addition of a number of residential developments in the jungle areas nearest Tulum's downtown. With the increase in tourism, vacation rentals, small hotels and hostels, as well as restaurants and bars populate the town. Grocery stores, boutiques, bicycle rentals, gyms, tour operators, banks, ATMs, internet cafes, and various other commercial stores are available in Tulum Pueblo. Spanish Language Schools are popular in Tulum, including Meztli Spanish Language School and Jardin Espanol. Since 13 March 2008, the town is head of the newly founded municipality (município), the ninth in Quintana Roo.

Most of them are cabañas built in the traditional Maya style with thatched palm roofs though there are some more high end hotels as well. There are many new restaurants, particularly on the jungle side of the road, some of which have received significant praise in the international press. There are also a few beach clubs and public beaches. Inexpensive cabañas with hammocks are still available, but are rare.

The result was a decisive Assyrian victory. Teumman,Roux, p. 332 the king of Elam, and his son Tammaritu were killed in the battle. Background Under the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III (744-27 BCE) through Ashur-uballit II (611 BCE) Assyria led several campaigns across the known world. However Assyria struggled to maintain control over their closest neighbor Babylonia. In a rebellion against one of Sennacherib's (704-681) rule in Babylon, Chaldean Mushezib-Marduk seized the throne and formed a coalition including the Chaldeans, Aramaens, Elamites, and Babylonians and went to battle in 691 near the city of Halule. The coalition was defeated and Sennacherib began a 15-month campaign against Babylonia, sacking palaces and burning temples. Sennacherib's son, Esarhaddon (680-69) attempted to rebuild Babylonia and establish himself as king. His successors Ashurbanipal (668-27) took the throne in Ninevah while Shamash- Shuma-Ukin claimed kingship in Babylon and continued to rebuild it. While Babylonia was technically independent of Assyria, the correspondence between the two brothers suggests that Ashurbanipal saw Babylonia as a vassal state and exercised control over it. Shamash-Shuma-Ukin began looking for a chance to rebel. A few years before, Teumman (or Te'uman, 664-653 BCE), a known enemy of Assyria, had usurped the Elamite throne, forcing the sons of Urtaki to flee to Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. Teumman demanded they be extradited,Roux, p.332 but Ashurbanipal refused. Teumman began a campaign against Na'id Marduk, Assyria's puppet ruler in the Sealand, around 675 BCE. After pushing out the Assyrian influences, Teumman placed Nabo-usalim on the throne in Ur. Battle and aftermath Teumman, Nabo-Usallim and Shamash-Shuma-Ukin all formed a coalition and marched against Assurbanipal and met his forces on the banks of the Ulai River (hence the name \\"Battle of the Ulai River\\") where they were defeated. Teumman was killed in battle and his head was carried to Ninevah and placed on display in Ashurbanipal's court. Ashurbanipal began a 4-year campaign against Babylonia and placed Kandalanu on the throne to replace his brother. Susa, the capital of Elam was sacked in 647 BCE and Elam never regained its power until the Persians conquered it a century later. =Relief carvings= The Battle of Ulai is well known because of the relief carvings found in Ashurbanipal's palace in Ninevah. These chaotic images portray the torture and death of countless enemy soldiers. The severed head of Teumman can be found in nearly every panel including the panel depicting the king's victory banquet. This is consistent with the Assyrian propaganda \\"which urges viewers to be both fearful and in awe of Assyrian might\\".

Rimstone is made up of calcite and other minerals that build up in cave pools. The formation created, which looks like stairs, often extends into flowstone above or below the original rimstone. Often, rimstone is covered with small, micro-gours on horizontal surfaces. Rimstone basins may form terraces that extend over hundreds of feet, with single basins known up to 200 feet long from Tham Xe Biang Fai in Laos Formation Rimstone dams form where there is some gradient, and hence flow, over the edge of a pool. Crystallization begins to occur at the air/water/rock interface. The turbulence caused by flow over the edge of the building dam may contribute to the outgassing or loss of carbon dioxide from water, and result in precipitation of mineral on this edge. When dams form under running water, they tend to be higher when the passage is steeper. Shallow-gradient dams tend to be lower and more sinuous in nature. Rimstone is one of the most common cave formations, after flowstone, stalactites, and stalagmites. =Concrete derived micro-gours= Calthemite gours on a small rounded stalagmite - a secondary deposit derived from concrete Rimstone or gours can be formed by the secondary deposits derived from concrete, lime or mortar. These secondary deposits consisting primarily of calcium carbonate, are called calthemites and mimics the shapes and forms of cave speleothems to create stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone and gours.Smith, G K. (2016). \\"Calcite straw stalactites growing from concrete structures\\". Cave and Karst Science 43(1), pp4-10. Gours form beneath concrete structures on a floor with a gradual sloping surface or on the side of rounded stalagmites derived from concrete. Most of the calcium carbonate carried by the leachate is deposited as stalactites (when the drop rate is slower than one drop per minute), leaving little in solution to be carried to the ground to create stalagmites, flowstone and gours. The leachate which does reach the ground usually evaporates quickly due to air movement beneath the concrete structure, hence micro-gours are more common. The secondary deposits derived from concrete are the result of concrete degradation, where calcium ions are leached out of the concrete in solution and redeposited on the underside of a concrete structure. Calcium carbonate deposition as micro-gours occur when the solution drops to the ground under the concrete structure. Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the alkaline leachate solution,Macleod, G, Hall, A J and Fallick, A E, 1990. An applied mineralogical investigation of concrete degradation in a major concrete road bridge. Mineralogical Magazine, Vol.54, 637–644. which facilitates the chemical reactions to precipitate any calcium carbonate remaining in solution as a stalagmite and micro-gours. This chemical reaction creating calthemites, is different from that which creates speleothems in limestone caves. Secondary deposits, which create stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone, rimstone etc., outside the natural cave environment, are referred to as “calthemites”. These concrete derived secondary deposits cannot be referred to as “speleothems” due to the definition of the word.Hill, C A and Forti, P, (1997). Cave Minerals of the World, Second Edition.

It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Synopsis ' The Speaker assures a young man that accusations against him do not actually harm him, because beauty is always a target (\\"mark\\") for slander. ' In fact, slander only verifies the worth of the good, as it seeks to be attached to the very best, as (the Speaker claims) the young man is. ' The young man has made it this far, either avoiding or triumphing over vice, yet this praise is insufficient to \\"tie up envy\\", which always increases. ' \\"[I]f a hint or suspicion of badness did not disguise your true appearance, entire nations would be in thrall to you.\\"Kerrigan 1995, p. 262. Structure Sonnet 70 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The fourth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: × / × / × / × / × / A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air. (70.4) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus. The meter demands a few variant pronunciations: The first and third lines' rhyming words, \\"defect\\" and \\"suspect\\" are both stressed on the second syllable.Kerrigan 1995, p. 262. Though it is uncertain how contracted words like this might have been in Elizabethan pronunciation, line ten's \\"either\\" functions as one syllable, and might have been pronounced as one.

LST-1110 was laid down on 28 December 1944 by the Missouri Valley Bridge and Iron Company of Evansville, Indiana; launched on 9 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. Sidney Kolb; placed in reduced commission for transit to New Orleans on 1 March 1945; and commissioned in full on 7 March 1945 with Lieutenant Alton S. Lee, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II, 1945= Following shakedown off Florida, LST-1110 loaded creosote, piles, asphalt, and an LCT and departed New Orleans for Pearl Harbor on 15 April. From Oahu, she carried her cargo on to the Marianas; offloaded the piles and asphalt at Guam; took on gasoline drums at Saipan; and, on 20 June, sailed for Okinawa. She offloaded her cargo onto the Hagushi beaches and embarked elements of the 6th Marines between 26 June and 10 July; then sailed back to Guam, where she discharged her passengers. Availability at Saipan followed; and, at the end of the month, she moved on to the Solomons to load cargo for the Philippines. =Post-war activities, 1945= The war ended on 15 August; and, four days later, LST-1110 departed Guadalcanal. On the 30th, she anchored off Calicoan Island and completed offloading by 11 September. The LST then shifted to San Pedro Bay, whence she proceeded to Lingayen Gulf to join Amphibious Group 8 to participate in the occupation of eastern Honshū. Departing Luzon on 26 September, LST-1110 disembarked elements of the 8th Field Artillery, 25th Division, I Army Corps, at Nagoya on 25 and 26 October; then got underway to return to Lingayen Gulf. In November, she transported Quartermaster Corps personnel to Sasebo, then sailed east. On the 27th, she arrived at Iwo Jima; embarked 20th Air Force personnel; and continued on to Saipan where she discharged her passengers on 5 December. LST-1110 remained at Saipan through December; and, on 8 January 1946, she sailed for Pearl Harbor and the California coast. =1946-1953= Arriving at San Pedro on 11 February 1946, she underwent overhaul at Long Beach; and, in June, proceeded to San Diego where she reported to ComPhibPac for duty. For the next two years, she provided amphibious training and logistic support services along the West Coast. Then, in the summer of 1948, she commenced the first of many Arctic logistic support missions. She departed Port Hueneme on 25 June; proceeded to San Francisco, whence she continued north, with , to Seattle and Alaskan points. Later joined by the ice breaker, , she reached Nome on the 29th; and, on the 31st, moved on to other northern stations: Point Lay, Barter Island, and Point Barrow. In mid-August, she began to move south again and arrived at Long Beach on the 28th. On 16 September, she returned to San Diego and resumed amphibious training and logistics operations along the California coast. For the next five years, she maintained a similar schedule, operating in the arctic during the summer and off California for the remainder of each year. =1953-1957= In the fall of 1953, LST-1110 was dispatched to Hawaii for winter training exercises. In February 1953, she returned to San Diego; and, in September, she sailed west again for her first peacetime deployment to the Far East. Departing San Diego on the 20th, she arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 22 October and began six months of cargo operations and training exercises in Japanese and Korean waters. On 12 April 1955 she departed Inchon for home and arrived at San Diego on the 28th. At the end of June, LST-1110 resumed Arctic resupply operations; and, on 1 July, while deployed, she was named USS San Bernardino County. and USS San Bernardino County (LST-1110) unloading over the beach at Point Barrow, Alaska, during \\"DEW\\" Line support operations, 16 September 1955. She returned to Southern California in October and remained there until February 1956, when she was transferred to Pearl Harbor. She arrived at her new home port on 2 March, conducted operations from there through May; but, in June, she again sailed north. Her reassignment to Pearl Harbor did not change her summer deployments; and, in that year and in 1957, she carried supplies to Arctic bases. On 13 September 1957, she completed her last Alaskan mission. =Decommissioning and sale= On 31 December 1957, she was placed in commission, in reserve; and, on 15 August 1958 she was decommissioned for transfer to the Republic of China. The following day, the transfer was completed, and the LST was commissioned as Chung Chiang (LST-225). USS San Bernardino County was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 February 1959. Chung Chiang was discarded by the Republic of China in 1993, her final fate unknown. Awards LST-1110 received one battle star for World War II service.

Early and family life Howard Carwile was born in Charlotte County, Virginia, to parents Willis Early Carwile (May 6, 1873 – May 10, 1950) and Allie Taylor (July 2, 1887 – November 23, 1968); they were tenant tobacco farmers. Howard was one of 13 children. His great-great- grandfather Jacob Carwile, served as a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. In 1948, he married Violet Virginia Talley (January 28, 1918 – October 21, 1994), daughter of John C.

Education *Graduate of Alma White College, Zarephath, New Jersey *Graduate of Southeastern University Law School, Washington, D.C. Career Howard Carwile was known as a fiery, passionate trial attorney in Richmond, Virginia. He opposed the Byrd Organization in his early years, a machine of Conservative Democrats led by Harry Flood Byrd which dominated Virginia's politics from the 1920s until the mid-1960s. Carwile represented many black clients as a trial lawyer in the 1940s through 1960s in Richmond. He was an ever-vigilant watchdog over the Richmond Police Department and champion for reform of Virginia's prisons and a general political gadfly. He was known for his colorful rhetoric in public, such as calling a city-hall boondoggle he disliked a \\"horrendous heap of hokum\\" and his campaign style, including an automobile completely covered in Carwile bumper-stickers. He was appreciated by Richmonders for his verbal theatrics, and in the 1970s it was not uncommon to hear someone say he or she was \\"shocked and appalled\\", a frequent Carwile exclamation. His case against Richmond Newspapers concerning an editorial by the Richmond Times-Dispatch reached the Virginia Supreme Court in 1954 and was decided in his favor.

The literal translation for Ukupseni is \\"little beach\\" in English, or playa chica in Spanish, thus Playón Chico is a mistranslation, which means roughly \\"Little Big Beach\\". Ukupseni is a small island, roughly ¼–⅓ mi², or 300–400 yd². The population of the island is about 3,000, which gives Ukupseni a population density of 8,000–12,000 people per square mile.  Housing  Houses on Playón Chico Ukupseni is populated by Kuna. The typical housing structure is a \\"pole\\"-style thatch hut, which will house an entire family. Building materials are tree trunks for the main pillars, bamboo poles for support, and various types of leaves for the roof. Walls are typically lashed bamboo or caña blanca (cane). A well-constructed hut can stand for as long as 30 years. The elderly will often be cared for by their children, and so one family dwelling will often house several generations.  Transportation  Ukupseni lays approximately from the Panama mainland. Playón Chico Airport is located on the mainland adjacent to the island. Ukupseni is only reachable by plane, boat, or by foot. There is no road to Ukupseni. There is now a bridge connecting Ukupseni to the mainland. This is extremely useful, as the majority of local agriculture, schooling, the airport, and potable water are on the mainland. Aside from the bridge, the second most popular form of transportation is the kayuco (hollowed-out tree canoe). Kayucos range in sizes and styles. Extremely large kayucos, some more than 4 ft wide are used, and others vary in size down to one-person boats. A typical kayuco is similar to a Western-style canoe. Even though kayukos travel in the ocean they do not have a lateral brace and balance as found on Polynesian ocean-going craft. A distinct, low-profile kayuco is used for navigating rivers.  Economy  Yandup island cabins Ukupseni is mostly autonomous, in that it grows most of its own food. Colombian ships travel through Kuna Yala, and Kunas sell coconuts in exchange for goods, including hammocks and other supplies. Lobster, crab, and fish are sold to seafood airplanes on the Ukupseni airstrip. Community projects are conducted by the local government for various needs throughout the year, and every citizen is required to help. There are two lodges in private islands nearby, Yandup island (1000 meters northeast) and Iskardup (Sapibenega) island. Both are owned and ran by Kunas from Ukupseni, as it is part of the Kuna law that only Kunas can own businesses in Kuna Yala. These lodges also provide jobs as guides, cooks, handymen, maids and other works to Ukupseni's inhabitants, plus a larger income for fishermen and handicraft sellers, being the Mola the most famous handicraft of the Kunas.  Geography  Ukupseni, along with the vast majority of the rest of the San Blas Islands lies atop a coral reef that has broken the surface of the ocean. This island is enlarged constantly by people depositing earth, rock, waste, or other debris in order to create a large living area on the island. The elevation of these islands is about 1½ feet above sea level. Local tides in the area fluctuate the level of the water by 4–11 inches. Occasionally a \\"super-high tide\\" of about 18 inches will saturate the outer parts of the island. There are several reef islands in close proximity to Ukupseni. Most are not inhabited, but some have tourist hotels on them. The closest populated island is San Ignacio de Tupile, a few miles due east. The mainland communities of Irgandi and Ukupa lie to the northwest.

Early life and legal career Grant was born at Alvie, Inverness-shire, Scotland, son of Louis Grant and his wife Isabella, née McBean. He obtained some schooling at Kingdenie and emigrated to Sydney with his parents in 1836 and was articled to Chambers and Thurlow, solicitors. In 1844 he paid a visit to New Zealand and served as a volunteer in the Flagstaff War against the Māoris. Returning to Australia he was admitted to practise as an attorney and solicitor in 1847, and became a partner of Mr Thurlow. In 1850, with a partner, he chartered a vessel and took supplies to California, and in June 1851 was still at San Francisco. Grant returned to Australia on receiving news of the discovery of gold in Victoria and in 1853 was a successful miner at Bendigo, Victoria. He was practising as a solicitor at Melbourne in 1854, and showed much sympathy for the diggers (miners) at the time of the Eureka rebellion in December 1854. The mayor of Melbourne, John Thomas Smith, had called a meeting at the town hall to concert measures for keeping law and order. Grant and Dr J. H. Owens issued a placard asking the public not to go to the town hall, but to attend an open-air meeting on the present site of St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. About 5000 people attended. Grant was one of the speakers and a committee was appointed to interview the governor. At the trial of the Ballarat miners Grant acted as their attorney without fee. Political career In 1855 Grant was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Council for Sandhurst, and when responsible government was established in 1856, was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly for Sandhurst Boroughs (based around current Bendigo). Grant did not stand at the 1859 Sandhurst Boroughs election, but, in October 1959, was elected for Avoca and held this seat until his death. Grant joined the Richard Heales ministry in February 1861 as vice-president of the board of land and works and commissioner of public works, and resigned with Heales in November. Grant was commissioner for railways in the James McCulloch ministry from June 1863 to September 1864 and then became president of the board of lands and works and commissioner of crown lands and survey from September 1864 to May 1868. In 1865 Grant succeeded in passing a land act which promised to be little more successful than previous acts, the conditions being too exacting for poor men. One clause, however, which had been meant to apply to goldfield areas, allowed selectors to take up at a rental of two shillings an acre. Grant interpreted this very liberally and many applicants were allowed to hold four licences and thus farms of were established. However, in May 1869, Grant brought in a new land bill which allowed the selection of up to with conditions of residence, cultivation and improvement at a yearly payment of two shillings an acre, with liberal terms to convert into freehold. Grant was then holding the same position in the second McCulloch ministry as in the previous one, and went out of office in September 1869. The act, however, came into force on 1 February 1870 and, though amended by later governments, was the basis of all subsequent land settlement in Victoria. Grant earned great popularity from it, and was afterwards presented with a testimonial of £3000 raised by public subscription. He again held the lands portfolio in the Charles Duffy ministry from June 1871 to June 1872, was minister of justice in the first Graham Berry ministry for a few weeks in 1875, held the same position in the second Berry ministry from May 1877 to March 1880, and was chief secretary and minister of public instruction in the Bryan O'Loghlen ministry from July 1881 to March 1883. He was able to do valuable work at the education department by insisting on the importance of merit in considering promotions. Grant had a stroke of paralysis in November 1884 and died on 1 April 1885, leaving a widow, a son and three daughters. Grant was buried in Melbourne General Cemetery after a service at Elsternwick Presbyterian Church. A grant of £4000 was subsequently voted by parliament to his family. Grant was regarded as having a genial nature and was generally liked. Although not a great orator, Grant had a clear grasp of questions which commanded attention and was also a thorough and hard- working administrator. His land act cleared up what seemed to be an almost hopeless position, and had great influence in the development of Victoria.

He lived in the 15th century central India. The traditional biographies places him within the Digambara mystic tradition. They also consider him as a ritual reformer for rejecting the authority of Bhattarakas and his emphasis on aniconism and inner realization. He is credited with writing fourteen texts. Texts The following fourteen texts are credited to Taran Svami. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of Thikanesara (now at Khurai temple). Scholars have expressed doubts about his authorship of the Chadmastha Vani as it cites his death and of the Nama Mala as it contains names of his disciples. These texts are classified in five systems mentioned in one manuscript of Thikanesara (now at Khurai temple). * Vicara mata (Reflections) ** Malarohana (\\"Garland offering\\") ** Pandita Puja (\\"Wise worship\\") ** Kamala Battisi (\\"Lotus thirty-two [verses]\\") * Acara mata (Conduct) ** Shravakacara (\\"Lay conduct\\") * Sara mata (Essential teachings) ** Jñana Samuccaya Sara (\\"Collected essence of knowledge\\") ** Tribhangi Sara (\\"Essence in triads\\") ** Upadesha Shuddha Sara (\\"Pure essence of the teachings\\") * Mamala mata (Spiritual purity) ** Mamala Pahuda (\\"Handbook on purity\\") ** Caubisa Thana (\\"Twenty-four topics\\") * Kevala mata (Enlightenment) ** Chadmastha Vani (\\"Sayings of the unliberated\\") ** Nama Mala (\\"Garland of names\\") ** Khatika Vishesa (\\"Special uprooter\\") ** Siddha Subhava (\\"Nature of the perfected soul\\") ** Sunna Subhava (\\"Nature of emptiness\\") The three texts in the Vicara mata category are thirty-two verse compositions. They are the most popular texts of Taran Svami. Malarohana was composed for the marriage of Taran Svami's followers, according to the tradition. It is still read during marriage of the followers. Premi had said that during Daslakshana, the followers gather in the temple and recite Pandita Puja and Mamalapahuda in day and Malarohana and Kamala Battisi at night. K. Samaiya had equated them with Ratnatraya. Some members recite some of these texts daily. Other texts are not well-known. Sravakacara has 462 verses which defines code of conduct for lay followers which draws from earlier Digambara text Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra. The Jñana Samuccaya Sara has 908 verses, and the Upadesha Shuddha Sara has 588 verses. These two texts discuss the Digambara philosophy and metaphysics. The Jñana Samuccaya Sara discusses Ratnatraya, scriptures, the stages of lay spirituality, Anuvrata and Mahavrata, seven types of Jain philosophy, Dravya, Dhyana etc. The Upadesha Shuddha Sara discusses the path of liberation and its hurdles. The Tribhangi Sara has 71 verses which discusses the topics in triads. These four texts are close to the Digambara tradition of philosophy. The Mamala Pahuda is a collection of songs. It has more than 3,200 verses. The Caubisa Thana discusses 24 topics of spirituality to gain liberation. It is mix of prose and verse and about 20 pages in total. The Chadmastha Vani and Nama Mala are short prose texts about nine pages. It has information on Taran Svami and his followers and other subjects. Premi had said that Chadmastha Vani is recited by followers for five days after Diwali. The Khatika Vishesa discusses about Karma in context of the cycle of time. It is mix of prose and verse. The Siddha Subhava and Sunna Subhava are short prose. The Siddha Subhava discusses the purification of soul while the Sunna Subhav discusses ways of destoying ego. Commentaries on six of the main texts composed by Taran Svami were written by Brahmacari Shitala Prasad in the 1930s. Commentaries on other texts have also been done recently. Osho (Rajnish), who was born into a Taranpanthi family, has included Sunna Subhava and Siddhi Subhava as among the books that influenced him most. History After death of Taran Svami, the history of the sect is unclear. The Nam Mala contains around 2000 names but its significance is unclear. Based on oral traditions, Taran Svami had disciples from varied classes and castes. His disciples were from Jain as well from non-Jain background. Some of his disciples had Muslim background. No scholarly study has constructed the early history of Taran Panth due to clear lack of literary tradition. The religious profession is also unclear in the sect. There were some associated with Nisaiji temples. There are no monks in the sect but they had some lay celibates (Brahmachari and Brahmacharinis). Today a large number of the followers of Taran Panth come from six merchant castes of Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. Three of these – Samaiya, Dosakhe and Gulalare – were converts from Murtipujaka Jain communities, and the other three – Asethi, Ayodhyavasi and Carnagar – were converts from Vaishnava Hindu communities as informed to Jain scholar Cort. The total number of the followers of the Taran Panth range from 20,000 to 100,000. R. Samaiya had listed 131 temples and the number of followers just under 20,000 in 1989. Majority of the followers reside in Madhya Pradesh and some in south Uttar Pradesh and northwest Maharashtra. Pilgrimage sites and temples Nisaiji, built by Tarachand Mallusav, 1817. The most important site is located in Malhargadh village in Guna district where Taran Svami spent his final years and where his last rites were performed. The shrine known as Nisaiji (\\"Honoured Memorial\\") is on the banks of the Betwa river. The three-days annual fair known as Phag Phulna (\\"Phag Flowering\\") is orhanised from Falgun Bright Fifth. In the past, there was an annual fair organised in honour of one of his Muslim disciple Ruiya Raman or Ruiya Jin but it is discontinued. Many followers visit here for Chudakarana ritual of their children. The shrine has stone windows and high canopies built in \\"late medieval Rajput\\" style. The style became standard for other shrines. The history of the site is written by Phulchandra who says that the shrine was initially just a chhatri (canopy). In 1817, Taracand Mallusav, a merchant from Nagpur rebuilt the shrine in its current form, the platform with twelve doors and several canopies. He had sponsored the annual fair and one of his family member, Kesaridau, died here. The shrine is simple and has a central marble altar which houses a pile of printed books. Behind it, there is an older stone altar which is considered as the original one. There are a records of patrons of fair from 1817. Since 1933, the fair is organised by the community. There are no images due to Taran Svami's emphasis on aniconism. There are three stone platforms in the Betwa river associated with events in his life. Semarkheri located near Sironj in Vidisha district has a shrine built by Banjaras. Here he spent some time engaging in spiritual activities. The annual fair is organised on Vasant Panchami. It is oldest shrine after Nisaiji and has records of the patrons of the fair dating back to 1881. Sukha near Pathariya village in Damoh district where Taran Svami preached. The old site was in dilapidated condition before the new constructions started in 1938. The annual fair is organised on Agahan Bright Seventh (November–December). The day of fair known as Taran Jayanti and is of recent origin. The shrine at Bilhari village near Katni in Jabalpur district is associated with birth of Taran Svami. The site became focus of community only recently and no annual fair is organised here. There is a memorial dedicated to Himau Pande, one of Taran Svami's chief disciple at Chand village in Chhindwara district. The site only recently became a focus of development by local followers. There was only large platform in the past but now a large temple is built. The annual fair is organised on Jeth Dark Sixth, known as Samadhi Sixth, the death anniversary of Himau Pande. There is also a large platform at Garaula (or Garhaula), near Tindua in Damoh district which is associated with Taran Svami's childhood days at his maternal uncle's house. The temples are fairly simple in design with open spaces and least ornamentation. The marble altars in temple has symbols associated with generalized auspiciousness. Due to aniconic emphasis, there are no images placed in the temples. Sometimes the altar has books of Taran Svami and of other writers from Digambara mystic and philosophical traditions. Rituals and practices The order of the services were organised by Jayasagar in the mid-twentieth century. The temple rituals are as follows: The follower enters the temple and bows to the altar as the sign of respect then recites three verses drawn from Taran Svami's texts known as Tatva Patha or Tatva Mangal in front of the altar. This is followed by singing Bhajans or hymns. If there is a sermon, bhaiji or pande, a local intellectual associated with temple or other intellectuals known as pundit will deliver sermons to seated followers. The sermon ends with everyone standing and singing a hymn known as Abalabali. The ritual ends with the Arati. The Arati has two parts; the first one is dedicated to Dev (God), Guru (teacher) and scriptures while the other part is dedicated to Taran Svami.

Overland Track, Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, Tasmania, Australia, 17 April 2013 by Doug Beckers Eucryphia lucida, Eucryphiaceae (more recent classifications place them in the Cunoniaceae), commonly known as leatherwood, is a species of trees or large shrubs endemic to forests of western Tasmania. An attractive plant utilised in both the horticulture and apiculture industries, it was promoted by the Tasmanian Branch of the then SGAP as an alternative to the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) for Tasmania's floral emblem. It was described as E. billiarderi at one stage, this now being a synonym. Description Ranging from 2–10 metres (6–30 feet) in height, it can sometimes grow to 25 metres (80 feet) in favourable conditions. The small dark green glossy leaves are elliptical in shape and 2–4 cm (1-1.5 in) long. Appearing in spring and summer, the 2.5 – 4 cm diameter white flowers have four petals and resemble small single roses and have a strong fragrance, especially on warmer days. The flower parts are often covered with a sticky sap. Flowering is followed by leathery capsules which mature in autumn. The species was first described by Jacques Labillardière. Distribution and habitat It is widespread and common in moister forests in Tasmania, occurring mainly across the western parts of the state, from the northwest in such places as the Tarkine and through the South West Wilderness. It grows as an understorey plant and prefers wetter climates of 1500–2500 mm annual rainfall. Fossil leaves from Early Pleistocene sediments at Regatta Point in Western Tasmania show similarities to E. lucida and suggest a close relationship. Cultivation Leatherwood is easily propagated by seed or cutting and makes an attractive garden plant. A fast-growing plant, it thrives in well-drained soil in a position with some shelter and extra moisture. It does require regular pruning to keep a neat shape. It is also utilized by Tasmanian beekeepers in the making of leatherwood honey, a noted monofloral honey that has been recognised by the international Slow Food movement in its Ark of Taste. For many years, the Tasmanian Beekeepers' Association has had to lobby the Tasmanian government to ensure continued access to this precious resource, and to protect it from logging. Much of the leatherwood is difficult to access, growing deep within the forests of Tasmania's wild west coast.

Plot Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), a US Census Bureau enumerator is sent to the remote and seemingly idyllic village of Rockwell Falls, North Dakota, to interview residents concerning the population. On the way to Rockwell Falls he is distracted by a woman falling off a horse and his vehicle hits a pothole and bursts two tires. He is eventually picked up by Bobby Caine (Fred Durst), the Sheriff's Deputy, who drives him into Rockwell Falls and helps him find a place to stay. During his stay, Kady notices a number of increasingly strange things about the town, people acting awkward and strange. He also begins to have eerie dreams. Then there was talk of 'the fever' from town folk and several residents treat him as though he was not just a visitor, but has moved to Rockwell Falls permanently. His research reveals that the town's population has remained at exactly 436 for over 100 years. People who try to leave Rockwell Falls seem to meet with bizarre and deadly accidents or just vanish, which the residents believe to be the work of God. Kady becomes romantically involved with Courtney Lovett (Charlotte Sullivan), a local woman and the daughter of his host, much to the chagrin of Caine, who is also in love with her. He also befriends Amanda, a young girl whose father was killed trying to escape from the town and who is being held at the clinic of Dr Greaver, the town doctor, on the pretext of treating her for schizophrenia. Courtney and Amanda both express a desire to leave the town, but are afraid of the consequences of trying. After stumbling upon some books on Biblical numerology, Kady realizes that the townspeople attach a mystical importance to the number 436 and are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the population at that number. Anyone who expresses a desire to leave is treated for the 'fever' by Dr. Greaver with electroshock therapy , etc. It gradually becomes apparent to Kady that the residents of Rockwell Falls have no intention of allowing him to leave. After witnessing the execution of a seemingly willing woman at a town feast, Kady becomes hysterical, and is taken to the clinic to be treated for the 'fever'. He escapes from his host and finds a sympathetic resident who came to the town 8 years ago and was once in the same predicament. He helps Kady plan his escape. After setting fire to the town garage as a diversion, Kady rescues Amanda from the clinic, but is forced to leave Courtney behind after discovering she has been lobotomized by Dr. Greaver. As Kady and Amanda flee the town in a stolen tow-truck, a storm is brewing with dark clouds and lightning strike. Kady then realizes the cross from his dream is in the hanging from the rear view mirror. And the doll from his dream is on the dashboard with the next lightning strike. The pair then hit a semi head on, dying as they try to leave the town. The film ends with one of Kady's co-workers (Christian Potenza), who has come in search of him, being picked up by the Sheriff after his car hits the same pothole that Kady's did, blowing his tires, echoing the beginning of the film.

During his time as CEO of the plant, Agriprocessors grew into the largest kosher meat producer in the United States, but was also cited for issues involving animal treatment, food safety, environmental safety, child labor, and hiring of undocumented immigrants. In November 2009, Rubashkin was convicted of 86 counts of financial fraud, including bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and money laundering. In June 2010, he was sentenced to 27 years in prison. In a separate trial, he was acquitted of knowingly hiring underage workers. He served his sentence in Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville in Mount Hope, New York. In January 2011, his lawyers filed an appeal; on September 16, 2011, the appeals court ruled against Rubashkin. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from that ruling on October 1, 2012. On December 20, 2017, asserting a large bipartisan push for the measure, President Donald Trump commuted Rubashkin's prison sentence after eight years served. Early life and marriage Sholom Rubashkin is the second-youngest son of Rivka and Aaron Rubashkin, a kosher butcher from Brooklyn, New York, born in Nevel, Russia. The Rubashkins are ultra-Orthodox Jews belonging to the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement. \\"The Rubashkin family would fall under Ultra Orthodox, said [Rabbi Moses] Weissmandel.\\" In 1981, Rubashkin married Leah Goldman and spent a year learning in kollel. Afterwards he worked in his father's butcher shop, until he and his wife were sent to Atlanta, Georgia, as emissaries (shluchim) in the Chabad-Lubavitch outreach program. A year later the couple moved to Minnesota, from where Rubashkin commuted to his father's new meat-packing plant in Postville for approximately three years before they relocated there. The couple has ten children. CEO of Agriprocessors In 1987, Aaron Rubashkin opened the Agriprocessors plant in Postville, Iowa, and put two of his sons in charge: Sholom Rubashkin, the second youngest, as CEO;Sholom Rubashkin is named as CEO of Agriprocessors in most sources (e.g. , ), but his being appointed CEO formally is disputed. and Heshy Rubashkin, the youngest, as vice president of marketing and sales. Eventually, Agriprocessors became the United States' largest kosher slaughterhouse and meat packing plant and the only one authorized by Israel's Orthodox rabbinate to export beef to Israel. According to statistics that Rubashkin gave to Cattle Buyers Weekly, Agriprocessors' sales increased from $80 million in 1997 to $180 million in 2002. In 2002, Agriprocessors was ranked as one of the 30 biggest beef-packing plants in America. Under Rubashkin's leadership, Agriprocessors was cited for issues involving animal treatment, food safety,Nathaniel Popper, \\"Kosher Slaughterhouse’s Food-Safety Record Criticized by Regulators\\", The Forward, August 17, 2007 environmental safety,AgriProcessors Inc.

Sholom Rubashkin was replaced as CEO in September 2008.Lynda Waddington, \\"Agriprocessors could face extinction\\" The Iowa Independent, November 29, 2008 Agriprocessors' plants stopped operating in October 2008. On November 5, 2008, the firm filed for bankruptcy. Raid and arrests On May 12, 2008, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security agents raided the plant and arrested 389 workers who had fraudulent identity documentation. At that time, it was the largest raid into a workplace in the United States. On October 30, 2008, one day after the Iowa labor commissioner fined Agriprocessors $10 million for wage violations, Rubashkin was arrested on federal conspiracy charges of harboring undocumented immigrants and aiding and abetting aggravated identity theft. Federal officials claimed that Rubashkin intentionally helped undocumented workers obtain false documentation. After making an initial court appearance, he was released the same day on $1 million appearance bond after agreeing to wear an ankle monitor that tracks his movement, to limit his travel to northern Iowa, and to surrender his and his wife's passports. Rubashkin was arrested again on November 13, 2008, at his Postville home on federal charges of bank fraud. The charges claimed that under his direction, millions of dollars that were supposed to be deposited in an account as collateral for a loan were fraudulently diverted to another account, and were used to fraudulently increase the value of Agriprocessors accounts receivable. After the money was diverted, Rubashkin allegedly ordered the records of these transactions removed from company computers. The charges carried up to 30-year prison terms. Rubashkin was denied release on bail on November 20, 2008, following Magistrate Judge Jon Scoles determination that he posed a flight risk. Scoles took into consideration Israel's \\"Law of Return,\\" which grants automatic citizenship to every Jew and members of his family upon immigration, as well as a search of Rubashkin's house in which federal agents found a bag with $20,000 in cash, several silver coins and passports. The successful use of an argument based on Israel's Law of Return has caused concern among Jewish communities who fear that such claims could be used to deny bail to Jews in general. The ruling was reversed by District Court Judge Linda Reade on January 27, 2009. Rubashkin was released on $500,000 bond and ordered to surrender his birth certificate, his and his family's passports and agree to wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He was not allowed to leave Allamakee County, nor was he allowed on any of Agriprocessors' property and was barred from having contact with potential witnesses. Trials=Federal trials= Rubashkin was convicted in November 2009 on 86 charges of financial fraud, including bank fraud, mail and wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors had claimed the company intentionally defrauded St. Louis based First Bank on a revolving $35 million loan by faking invoices from meat dealers, inflating the value of the company. On November 23, 2009, Rubashkin's second trial on 72 immigration charges was canceled following the government's request to dismiss without prejudice. In its motion to dismiss, the U.S. Attorneys Office said any conviction on the immigration charges would have no impact upon his sentence, writing, \\"dismissal will avoid an extended and expensive trial, conserve limited resources, and lessen the inconvenience to witnesses.\\" Federal Judge Linda R. Reade dismissed the immigration charges without prejudice. On March 3, 2010, Judge Reade denied Rubashkin's motion for dismissal of the financial corruption charges and a request for a new trial. Rubashkin's sentencing hearing took place on April 28–29 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Prosecutors asked Judge Reade to impose a life sentence. After that request came under fire from former Justice Department officials, including six former Attorneys General, one former solicitor general and more than a dozen former United States attorneys, Assistant U.S. Attorney Pete Deegan said in court that the government would seek 25 years, while the defense asked for no more than six years. On June 22, 2010, Judge Reade handed down a sentence of 27 years, two years more than prosecutors had requested. According to a 52-page memorandum which she released the day before sentencing, the judge imposed a 324-month prison term followed by 5 years of supervised release, and ordered Rubashkin to pay $18.5 million to First Bank Business Capital, the plant's largest lender; $8.3 million to MB Financial Bank, another lender; and $3,800 to Waverly Sales, Inc., which received late payments from the plant for cattle. His lawyers requested for him to be sent to Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville due to the services the prison provides to religious Jewish inmates; Reade placed the request and the BOP granted it. His lawyers stated that eventually he wished to be sent to a lower security prison. =State child labor trial= Separate from the federal trials, Rubashkin went on trial on the child labor charges in state court in Waterloo, Iowa, starting May 4, 2010. Prior to the trial, charges against Agriprocessors corporate officer Aaron Rubashkin and plant human resources employee Laura Althouse were dismissed. Additionally, the number of charges in the indictment was amended to 83 from 9,311. Sholom Rubashkin was acquitted of 67 charges on June 7, 2010. However, Agriprocessors, as a corporation, which had already been purchased by Heshy Friedman, entered a guilty plea to the 83 child labor charges and the plant′s human resources manager pleaded to state child labor charges under an agreement with the state. In February 2016 the child labor case against Rubashkin was expunged. =Unsuccessful motion for new trial= On August 5, 2010, lawyers for Rubashkin filed a motion for new trial after having discovered that Judge Reade was more involved in planning the 2008 immigration raid at Agriprocessors′ Postville plant than previously disclosed, claiming that \\"federal law and U.S. Supreme Court rulings would have required Reade to remove herself from the trial.\\" On October 27, 2010, Judge Reade denied the motion. On January 3, 2011, lawyers for Rubashkin filed an appeal for a new trial with the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis. In the brief, four arguments for a new trial were made. According to the brief, government documents that surfaced after Rubashkin's conviction and not made available to the defense showed that Reade was involved in the planning for the federal immigration raid of the Postville plant in May 2008, which it sees as collusion with the prosecution. Reade′s \\"excessive coziness\\" with prosecutors planning the raid raised doubts about her impartiality in the case, the brief claims, and states that as a result Reade should have recused herself, and that Rubashkin is entitled to a new trial or, at a minimum, an evidentiary hearing. Following the filing of this appeal, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) filed amicus briefs supporting Rubashkin′s appeal for a new trial. What has united the three groups is the involvement of the judge in the case with the prosecution, as argued by Rubashkin's defense team, which, according to ACLU′s Iowa legal director Randall Wilson, \\"immediately gave the appearance of unfairness.\\" The ACLU brief says: \\"Mr. Rubashkin's conviction should be vacated and he should get his 'day in court,' with a tribunal that is not an arm of the prosecution. Due Process demands it. The Separation of Powers Doctrine demands it.\\" However, the ACLU still sees in Rubashkin someone who exploited undocumented workers and underage labor, according to Wilson, but sees these as separate issues from the matter of legal principle argued in its brief. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, the government, in a rare move, denied consent to the filing of the three amicus briefs, and filed a Resistance with the Eighth Circuit, attempting to block the court from accepting the brief. Following a law review published in Bloomberg Law Reports, the government filed a brief to withdraw their opposition to the amicus briefs. On March 11, 2011, the government filed their response to Rubashkin's appeal and on April 18, 2011, Rubashkin's lawyers filed their reply brief. The oral argument before the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals took place on June 15, 2011 in St. Louis, Missouri. On September 16, 2011 the court ruled against Rubashkin. Rubashkin's attorney said they would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. =Unsuccessful U.S. Supreme Court petition= In early April 2012, Rubashkin petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, asking the high court to look into his case and sentencing. The petition was denied by the Court. Rubashkin, represented by former US Solicitor General Paul Clement of Bancroft PLLC and Nathan Lewin of Lewin and Lewin LLP, argued that Judge Linda Reade, who met with prosecutors prior to the Postville Raid, could not be impartial, and that his 27-year sentence was excessive for a first-time nonviolent offender. Six amicus briefs were filed with the Supreme Court supporting Rubashkin's writ of certiorari. Amici included 86 former federal judges and Department of Justice officials (27 federal judges, 2 Attorneys General, 1 Inspector General, 2 FBI directors, 4 Deputy Attorneys General and 1 Solicitor General), National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Washington Legal Foundation, 40 legal ethics professors, Association of Professional Responsibility Lawyers, and Justice Fellowship. Responses On May 3, 2011, at a once-a-year House Oversight Hearing of the Judiciary Committee at which Attorney General Eric Holder testified, two members of Congress (Debbie Wasserman Schultz D-FL and Sheila Jackson Lee D-TX) publicly mentioned the case of Sholom Rubashkin to the Attorney General. Forty-five members of Congress have written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to ask questions about the handling of the case. A petition on the White House's \\"We the People\\" website, asking the then President Barack Obama to investigate the Rubashkin case, was submitted on October 22, 2011, with 52,226 online signatures. The White House's response to the petition was that it was unable to issue a comment due to the separation of powers. As to the allegations of prosecutorial unethical conduct, the White House merely assured that the Department of Justice \\"has mechanisms in place to investigate allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.\\" In an op-ed titled \\"Prosecutors, judges decry Rubashkin \\"witch hunt\\" \\" that was printed in the Des Moines Register, Charles B. Renfrew and James H. Reynolds wrote: \\"The explanation as to 'why' the pursuit of Sholom Rubashkin was so overzealous that it bordered on a veritable witch hunt still remains elusive, but the clarification as to 'how' is now punctiliously laid out in both the merits brief and the letter to Mr. Techau: There was false testimony and willful manipulation, and that makes this a shocking case of prosecutorial misconduct.\\" Rubashkin's sentence was commuted by President Donald Trump on December 20, 2017. The administration's position was that Rubashkin was given a much more severe sentence than others who had committed serious crimes and therefore merited the commutation. Commutation On December 20, 2017, President Donald J. Trump commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin. The White House wrote the commutation was \\"encouraged by bipartisan leaders from across the political spectrum, from Orrin Hatch to Nancy Pelosi\\", and was \\"based on expressions of support from Members of Congress and a broad cross- section of the legal community\\", although the action \\"is not a Presidential pardon. It does not vacate Mr. Rubashkin's conviction, and it leaves in place a term of supervised release and a substantial restitution obligation, which were also part of Mr. Rubashkin's sentence.\\" Therefore Rubashkin was released 19 years earlier than planned. Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz had raised Rubashkin's case over lunch with Trump. Opponents of undocumented immigration were upset by the commutation, and reportedly Trump did not answer a reporter’s question that was shouted at him about whether he knew Rubashkin had hired undocumented immigrants.

The philosopher Plotinus was the founder of the school known as Neoplatonism. Porphyry Porphyry, the most important of Plotinus's pupils, was born in Tyre c. 233 AD. He was taught first by Cassius Longinus in Athens, before travelling to Rome in 262 where he studied under Plotinus for six years. After the death of Plotinus, he edited and published the Enneads, which had been compiled by his teacher. He also wrote a biography of his teacher, and many commentaries and philosophical works, some of which survive and is famous for his attacks on Christianity compiled in his Adversus Christianos, of which only fragments preserved by his Christian opponents remain. Amelius Amelius was originally a student of the works of Numenius of Apamea, before attending the lectures of Plotinus in the third year after Plotinus came to Rome, and never left him until the end of his life. Amelius read and wrote voraciously, writing over 100 volumes of sayings and commentaries, none of which survive. His most important convert to Neoplatonism was Porphyry.Porphyry, Vita Plotini, 1–5, 7, 10, 16–22 Castricius Firmus Castricius Firmus was a 3rd-century neoplatonist and disciple of Plotinus.Porphyry, Vita Plotini, 2, 7 Plotinus was on the most familiar terms with him (Zethos), and used to stay with him at his country place, six miles from Minturnae, a property which had formerly belonged to Castricius Firmus. Porphyry stated of Castricius Firmus in the Life of Plotinus, \\"Castricius was excelled by none of the group in appreciation of the finer side of life: he venerated Plotinus; he devoted himself in the most faithful comradeship to Amelius in every need, and was in all matters as loyal to myself as though I were his own brother.\\" Eustochius of Alexandria Eustochius of Alexandria was a 3rd-century neoplatonic philosopher and student of Plotinus. Porphyry stated in the Life of Plotinus, \\"Among closer personal friends was Eustochius of Alexandria, also a doctor, who came to know Plotinus towards the end of his life, and attended him until his death: Eutochius consecrated himself exclusively to Plotinus' system and became a veritable philosopher.\\" Marcellus Orontius and Sabinillus Senators Marcellus Orontius and Sabinillus were 3rd century neoplatonists and disciples of Plotinus.Porphyry, Vita Plotini, 7 Porphyry stated of them in the Life of Plotinus, \\"There were also among Plotinus' hearers not a few members of the Senate, amongst whom Marcellus Orontius and Sabinillus showed the greatest assiduity in philosophical studies.\\" Paulinus Paulinus was a 3rd-century neoplatonist and disciple of Plotinus. Porphyry stated of Paulinus in the Life of Plotinus, \\"The group included also one Paulinus, a doctor of Scythopolis, whom Amelius used to call Mikkalos in allusion to his blundering habit of mind.\\" Rogatianus Rogatianus was a 3rd-century neoplatonist and disciple of Plotinus. Porphyry stated of Rogatianus in the Life of Plotinus. \\"Another Senator, Rogatianus, advanced to such detachment from political ambitions that he gave up all his property, dismissed all his slaves, renounced every dignity, and, on the point of taking up his praetorship, the lictors already at the door, refused to come out or to have anything to do with the office. He even abandoned his own house, spending his time here and there at this friends' and acquaintances', sleeping and eating with them and taking, at that, only one meal every other day. He had been a victim of gout, carried in a chair, but this new regime of abstinence and abnegation restored his health: he had been unable to stretch out his hands; he came to use them as freely as men living by manual labour. Plotinus took a great liking to Rogatianus and frequently praised him very highly, holding him up as a model to those aiming at the philosophical life.\\" Serapion Serapion was a 3rd-century neoplatonic philosopher and student of Plotinus. Porphyry wrote of Serapion in the Life of Plotinus that \\"Then there was Serapion, an Alexandrian, who began life as a professional orator and later took to the study of philosophy, but was never able to conquer the vices of avarice and usury.\\" Zethos Zethos was a 3rd-century neoplatonist and disciple of Plotinus. Porphyry stated of Zethos in the Life of Plotinus, \\"Another friend was Zethos, an Arabian by descent, who married a daughter of Ammonius' friend Theodosius. Zethos, too, was a doctor. Plotinus was deeply attached to him and was always trying to divert him from the political career in which he stood high. Plotinus was on the most familiar terms with him, and used to stay with him at his country place, six miles from Minturnae, a property which had formerly belonged to Castricius Firmus.\\" Zoticus Zoticus was a 3rd-century neoplatonic philosopher and student of Plotinus. Porphyry stated in the Life of Plotinus, Zoticus was a critic and poet, who also amended the text of Antimachus. Zoticus also authored a poem upon the Atlantis story. His sight failed, and he died a little before Plotinus, as also did Paulinus. NotesReferences *Porphyry, Life of Plotinus translated by Stephen MacKenna. London: Medici Society, 1917–1930.

It was founded by Cyrus Poonawalla in 1966. The company is a subsidiary of the holding company Poonawalla Investment and Industries. Overview The company is the world's largest vaccine producer by number of doses produced. The company produces around 130 crore (1.3 billion) doses of vaccines each year. The products developed include tuberculosis vaccine Tubervac (BCG), Poliovac for poliomyelitis, and other vaccinations for the childhood vaccination schedule. As of 2009, the institute was developing an intranasal swine flu vaccine. In 2016, with support from US-based Mass Biologics of University of Massachusetts Medical School, it invented a fast- acting anti-rabies agent, Rabies Human Monoclonal Antibody (RMAb), also known as Rabishield. The company made its first international acquisition when it acquired Biltthoven biologicals, a pharmaceutical company in Netherlands in 2012. COVID-19 vaccine development The company has tied up with pharma firm AstraZeneca, which is developing a vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in partnership with Oxford University. It is reported that Serum Institute would provide 10 crore (100 million) doses of the vaccine in India and other low and middle-income countries. It is estimated to be priced at ₹225 (around $3) per dose. In September 2020, trials were halted by DGCI after a volunteer in Oxford developed illness following a dosage, but were soon resumed after consent by the British regulators. They have also reached an agreement with Novavax for the development and commercialisation of Novavax’s NVX-CoV2373 COVID‑19 vaccine candidate in India and other low and middle-income countries.

The Sasanian victory broke the power of the Arsacid dynasty, effectively ending almost five centuries of Parthian rule in Iran, and marking the official start of the Sasanian era.  Background  Around 208 Vologases VI succeeded his father Vologases V as king of the Arsacid Empire. He ruled as the uncontested king from 208 to 213, but afterwards fell into a dynastic struggle with his brother Artabanus IV, who by 216 was in control of most of the empire, even being acknowledged as the supreme ruler by the Roman Empire. Artabanus IV soon clashed with the Roman emperor Caracalla, whose forces he managed to contain at Nisibis in 217. Peace was made between the two empires the following year, with the Arsacids keeping most of Mesopotamia. However, Artabanus IV still had to deal with his brother Vologases VI, who continued to mint coins and challenge him. The Sasanian family had meanwhile quickly risen to prominence in their native Pars, and had now under prince Ardashir I begun to conquer the neighboring regions and more far territories, such as Kirman. At first, Ardashir I's activities did not alarm Artabanus IV, until later, when the Arsacid king finally chose to confront him.  History  Coin of Ardashir I as king of Pars The location of the battle has not been found. The Arabic chronicle Nihayat al-arab states that the battle took place in bʾdrjʾan or bʾdjʾn, which Widengren translated as *Jurbadhijan (Golpayegan). This is however improbable, due to Ardashir I operating around Kashkar before the battle. According to an unfinished work by Bal'ami, the battle took place at Khosh-Hormoz, which is another name for the notable city of Ram-Hormoz, situated near Arrajan and Ahvaz. This implies that Ram-Hormoz was perhaps another word for Hormozdgan, and also clarifies why the latter is not mentioned by Islamic geographers whilst the former is reported in detail. The town of Ram-Hormoz still endures today, and is 65 km east of Ahvaz, \\"in a wide plain just at the foot of the hills that form the northeastern tail of the Bengestan Mountain of the Zagros chain.\\" According to Shahbazi, \\"the plain nearby is admirably suited for a cavalry engagement.\\" Coin of Artabanus IV () According to al-Tabari, whose work was probably based on Sasanian sources, Ardashir I and Artabanus IV agreed to meet in Hormozdgan at the end of the month of Mihr (April). Nonetheless, Ardashir I went to the place before due time to occupy an advantageous spot on the plain. There he dug out a ditch to defend himself and his forces. He also took over a spring at the place. Ardashir I's forces numbered 10,000 cavalry, with some of them wearing flexible chain armor akin to that of the Romans. Artabanus IV led a greater number of soldiers, who, however, were less disposed, due to wearing the inconvenient lamellar armor. Ardashir I's son and heir, Shapur, as portrayed in the Sasanian rock reliefs, also took part in the battle. The battle was fought on 28 April 224, with Artabanus IV being defeated and killed, marking the end of the Arsacid era and the start of 427-years of Sasanian rule.  Aftermath  Coin of Ardashir I as King of Kings () The chief secretary of the deceased Arsacid king, Dad-windad, was afterwards executed by Ardashir I. Thenceforth, Ardashir I assumed the title of shahanshah (\\"King of Kings\\") and started the conquest of an area which would be called Iranshahr (Ērānshahr). He celebrated his victory by having two rock reliefs sculptured at the Sasanian royal city of Ardashir-Khwarrah (present-day Firuzabad) in his homeland, Pars. The first relief portrays three scenes of personal fighting; starting from the left, a Persian aristocrat seizing a Parthian soldier; Shapur impaling the Parthian minister Dad-windad with his lance; and Ardashir I ousting Artabanus IV. The second relief, conceivably intended to portray the aftermath of the battle, displays the triumphant Ardashir I being given the badge of kingship over a fire shrine from the Zoroastrian supreme god Ahura Mazda, while Shapur and two other princes are watching from behind. Vologases VI was driven out of Mesopotamia by Ardashir I's forces soon after 228. The leading Parthian noble-families (known as the Seven Great Houses of Iran) continued to hold power in Iran, now with the Sasanians as their new overlords. The early Sasanian army (spah) was identical to the Parthian one. Indeed, the majority of the Sasanian cavalry composed of the very Parthian nobles that had once served the Arsacids. This demonstrates that the Sasanians built up their empire thanks to the support of other Parthian houses, and has due to this has been called \\"the empire of the Persians and Parthians\\". However, memories of the Arsacid Empire never completely vanished, with efforts trying to restore the empire in the late 6th-century made by the Parthian dynasts Bahram Chobin and Vistahm, which ultimately proved unsuccessful.

At its opening in October 2009, it became the second bridge connection between Yeongjong Island and the mainland of Incheon. The Incheon Bridge is South Korea's longest spanning cable-stayed bridge. In comparison, it is the world's tenth longest cable-stayed bridge as of January 2019. The bridge provides direct access between Songdo and Incheon International Airport, reducing travel time between them by up to one hour. The section of the bridge crossing the sea, whose concessionaire is Incheon Bridge Corporation, is funded by the private sector. Korea Expressway Corporation and the Korean Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs (MLTM) managed the project. The bridge is located to the south of the Yeongjong Bridge, which was the first bridge connection between Yeongjong Island and the mainland. Construction The main design and build contractor was Samsung C&T; Corporation JV (Daelim, Daewoo, GS, Hanjin, Hanwha, Kumho). Total costs were , including federally funded approach roads. The highway project consisted of government-built sections at three ends and a section in the middle built with private capital. The bridge section is long. The bridge has a cable stayed section over the main sea route to Incheon port. This was the most difficult part to construct, with a main tower high, vertical clearance of , and five spans: a centre span of flanked on either side by spans of and . Adjacent to the center section are approach spans consisting of a series of balanced cantilever spans. Lower-level viaducts consisting of spans connect to land at each end of the bridge. Design Because the bridge is situated in a known seismically-active region, a seismic design of the substructure was adopted. At 12.3 km long, with a main cable stayed span of 800m, the new Incheon Bridge is one of the five longest of its type in the world. Its 33.4m wide steel/concrete composite deck carries six lanes of traffic 74 m above the main shipping route in and out of Incheon port and links Incheon International Airport on Yeongjong Island to the international business district of New Songdo City and the metropolitan districts of South Korea's capital, Seoul. The cable stayed section of the crossing is 1,480 m long, made up of five spans measuring 80 m, 260 m, 800 m, 260 m and 80 m respectively: height of the inverted-Y main towers is 230.5 m. A 1.8 km approach span and 8.7 km viaduct complete the crossing, both constructed with precast prestressed concrete box girder decks. Foundations are drilled piles 3 m in diameter.http://www.mageba.ch/en/project_references/reference_projects/incheon_grand_bridge_south_korea.html In order to accommodate movement between the bridge decks, the Incheondaegyo was equipped with expansion joints weighing up to 50 tons per joint.

The entire complex spans both sides of State Route 526 (named the Boeing Freeway). The factory was built in 1967 for the Boeing 747 and has since been expanded several times to accommodate new airliners, including the 767, 777, and 787 programs.  History and operations  Boeing has had a presence in Everett since 1943. In 1966, plans for a factory in the area to be the site of the construction of the 747 were first announced, after Boeing was awarded a contract worth US$525 million (equivalent to $ million in ) from Pan American World Airways to build 25 of the aircraft. The company purchased north of the then little-used Paine Field, which was operated by the U.S. Army during World War II. The factory was officially opened on May 1, 1967, four months after the first workers had arrived to start construction of the 747.Boeing’s history in Everett  HeraldNet.com Boeing began offering factory tours with the first rollout of the 747 in 1968.

The current passenger variants in production, are capable of carrying 242–290 passengers in a typical two-class configuration, have a range of and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (562 mph, 902 km/h, 487 kn). Production of this plane began in 2006. In February 2011, Boeing announced that some 787 work was being moved to a plant in North Charleston, South Carolina in order to relieve overcrowding of 787s at Everett caused by large volumes of 787 orders. In July 2014, Boeing announced that the 787-10 variant, the longest variant of the 787, would be produced exclusively in South Carolina as the fuselage pieces for that variant are too large for the Dreamlifter to fit for transport to Everett. In early 2020, Boeing announced that it would consider consolidating all of its 787 assembly in a single location. It chose to move all production to South Carolina on October 1, 2020, causing backlash from the Washington state government. These are the 787 variants currently in production in Everett: * 787-8 * 787-9 Airport Aircraft are delivered as a whole from the Paine Field Snohomish County Airport, adjacent to and south of the plant.

In April 1842 Boos-Waldeck and a few other nobles met at Biebrich on the Rhine, near Mainz, to organize a society, which they called the Adelsverein, to promote German immigration to Texas.

She was best known for her 1957 country-pop crossover hit \\"Dark Moon\\". She became one of the first female country music singers to have hit songs cross over from the country charts to the pop charts. She raised cattle and quarter horses in Orting, Washington, with her second husband, Mario DePiano, whom she married in 1969. He died in 1983. She co-founded the record company Dolton Records in the late 1950s, that launched the careers of The Fleetwoods and The Ventures. In 1960, she left Dolton and became part owner of Jerden Records. She married Paul Tutmarc in 1944, and they separated in 1955. Early life and rise to fame Born in 1923 in Seattle, Washington, United States, to John and Doris Buckingham, Bonnie was initially raised in Redondo Beach along Puget Sound. Later, the family (including her five siblings) moved inland to a farm just outside the rural town of Auburn. She began performing at age 16, having taken up playing the guitar as a teenager, which led to her stage name, Bonnie Guitar. She later started songwriting. In 1944 she married her former guitar teacher Paul Tutmarc; the couple had one daughter, Paula (born 1950), but split up in 1955, and Bonnie moved to Los Angeles. Through much of the 1950s, she worked as a session guitarist at quite a few small labels, like Abbot, Fabor, and also Radio Recorders. Working at these places got Guitar noticed as a professional guitarist as she ended up playing on sessions for many well- known singers, like Jim Reeves, Dorsey Burnette, Ned Miller, and the DeCastro Sisters. After working with so many singers, she acquired her own singing aspirations herself and a desire to make her very own recording career in the process. Following the release of her first single, \\"If You See My Love Dancing\\" on Fabor Records, Bonnie heard a demo of \\"Dark Moon\\" from Fabor's owner, Fabor Robinson, a tune written by Ned Miller, with whom she worked as a session guitarist. Robinson was dissatisfied with how Dorsey Burnette sang a version of it and offered it to Guitar. \\"I said, 'I'll give up my royalties and everything just to do this song,'\\" she told Robinson in recounting their collaboration on \\"Dark Moon\\" to Wayne Jancik in The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders. \\"I knew it was up for grabs and somebody was gonna get it. I got it, but he took me at my word, and I really did give up my royalties. It was one of the hardest things I ever put together. Ned [Miller] wrote it, but we tried in maybe five or six different ways in different studios before it came out right.\\" The final version consisted of just two guitars and a bass backing Bonnie.Wayne Jancik, The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders, expanded first edition (Billboard Books, 1998); , p. 35. The song was originally issued under Fabor Records in 1956. \\"Dark Moon\\" was then issued over to Dot Records and by the spring of 1957, \\"Dark Moon\\" hit the pop top 10 list and went into the country top 15 list. Early music success in 1957 When Bonnie's rendition of \\"Dark Moon\\" hit the country and pop charts in the Spring of 1957, she received recognition in the music business. Not only was she one of the few female country singers at the time, but she was also one of the few country singers that had a hit on the Country and Pop charts at the same time. Only one other female country singer was achieving this type of crossover success Guitar was having at the time, which was Patsy Cline, when her single \\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" was a No. 2 Country hit and a No. 12 Pop hit at the same time. \\"Dark Moon\\" brought Guitar a wide audience, and she was soon appearing on quite a few Pop Music programs. Similar to Patsy Cline, Bonnie could not follow-up her crossover success either. Her follow-up to \\"Dark Moon\\" called \\"Mister Fire Eyes\\" failed to make a substantial impact on the Pop charts, making it only to No. 71 there. On the Country charts though, it was again a Top 15 hit. Because she could not follow-up her crossover success, her contract soon ended with Dot Records, and Guitar returned to Washington. Running a record label and re-entering country music in the 1960s Guitar however decided she would form her very own record label called Dolphin Records which she co-founded with refrigerator salesman Bob Reisdorff. When the pair decided to rename the label Dolton Records (they were forced to, due an already-existing Dolphin label name), many of Guitar's singles like \\"Candy Apple Red\\" and \\"Born to Be With You\\" were released. In 1959, her own recording career was superseded by that of a high school trio called The Fleetwoods. The trio was signed to the Dolton label and soon had major Pop Music hits in the Spring and Summer of 1959, with two No. 1 hits, \\"Come Softly to Me\\" and \\"Mr. Blue\\". Soon another group called The Ventures were signed to Bonnie's Dolton label. They too had a monster hit called \\"Walk Don't Run\\". However, Guitar thought it was time she would get her own music career back on foot. She soon left Dolton, and went back to Dot Records where she recorded a series of country albums throughout the 1960s. In 1961, she appeared as herself on an episode of To Tell The Truth with Johnny Carson, Ralph Bellamy, Dina Merrill, and Betty White as panelists. Only White correctly identified her. In the summer and fall of 1963, she took a temporary leave to record a concept album under contract with Charter Records. The album told a romantic story beginning with songs featuring themes about first sight, through courting, going steady, threats from others, getting engaged, getting it broken off, having the man marry someone else and finally having the woman live happily ever after on her own at the end. Unfortunately, the original heyday of concept albums by the likes of Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole had long since been over by 1964, and the new times for concept albums by the likes of the Beatles and Pink Floyd were a few years off yet, so the album was shelved. Even though the album was never released commercially, in its original format, a single was released entitled Outside Looking In, however it failed to show on either the country or pop charts. White-label Charter test pressings of the original concept album exist though, and most of the songs on it found their way onto subsequent albums, with the remaining material such as the country remake version of Dark Moon and Ned Miller's Lucky Star being featured in a 1972 Paramount Records double-album compilation of her work. It was in 1966 that she began a brief stint as one of the most successful female soloists in the country music field. \\"I'm Living in Two Worlds\\" became Guitar's first Top 10 Country hit (the record also hit the pop Hot 100). She scored an even bigger country success in 1967 with the No. 4 hit \\"A Woman in Love\\". That same year, she won the Academy of Country Music's \\"Top Female Vocalist\\" award. In 1968, \\"I Believe in Love\\" was another Top 10 hit. Guitar teamed up with Buddy Killen, and together they had a minor hit duet with \\"A Truer Love You'll Never Find (Than Mine)\\" which was issued in 1969 at a time when Guitar's chart success was starting to fade. Later career and death In the 1970s, Guitar recorded for Columbia Records and MCA Records and had occasional minor hit records. She charted for the first time in many years in 1980 with the single \\"Honey On the Moon\\". In 1986, she recorded for the Tumbleweed label. She later continued performing and playing until she announced she was retiring in 1996. She lived in Soap Lake, Washington, and in 2014 started producing and writing music and still performed on weekends at the age of 92 with her band. Bonnie Guitar died in Soap Lake, Washington on January 12, 2019, at the age of 95.

December 29, 2003. Retrieved on April 14, 2018. A 5 ft 10 in forward, he played college basketball for the Texas Wesleyan Rams for three seasons and led the NAIA in scoring during his senior season in 1946–47. McNeely was the first player ever drafted in the National Basketball Association when he was selected by the Pittsburgh Ironmen as the first pick of the league's inaugural 1947 draft. However, he never played basketball professionally and chose to coach high school basketball instead. Early life Clifton McNeely was born in Greenwood, Texas to Albert McNeely and Fannie Lee Clifton. He attended Greenwood High School for three years before transferring to Slidell High School in Slidell, Texas for his senior year. McNeely graduated in 1937. College and military career McNeely first attended Decatur Baptist Junior College, where he set high-scoring records on the school's basketball team. He transferred to Texas Wesleyan University in 1940, but his \\"shot-crazy\\" style created doubt as to how well he could fit on the team. During his first season at Texas Wesleyan in 1940–41, McNeely established himself as one of the most talented players on the team and was named team captain for the 1941–42 season. He helped guide Texas Wesleyan to an undefeated record during the 1941–42 regular season, with the team's only two defeats coming in the postseason against Sam Houston State in the Southwestern AAU Tournament and San Diego in the Kansas City National Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament. In December 1942, McNeely left the team after volunteering to serve with the United States Army Air Corps in World War II. During his service, he played basketball with the Fort Worth Army Air Field team from 1943 to 1944, and then with the Randolph Field team in 1945. He was discharged on December 31, 1945. During 1946, McNeely played with the Globe Aircraft team. McNeely received professional basketball contract offers following his discharge, including a \\"dollar, two eighty a game\\" deal with the Leonards \\"B\\" team, but elected to return to Texas Wesleyan for the 1946–47 season. He was named team co-captain alongside Hardy Fortenberry. Before the season's start, Texas Wesleyan coach Johnny Edwards stated that McNeely had a good future in professional basketball and could play professionally after he graduated. By the start of 1947, McNeely, nicknamed \\"The Man of a Million Shots\\", was leading the nation in scoring by a margin of 116 points. He missed three games in January 1947 after suffering a fractured wrist. McNeely led his team to a school-best 30–4 record,\\"Wanamaker, Blake Named All-American\\". ramsports.net. March 23, 2011.

He was named to the All-NAIA first-team alongside teammate E. F. Parham. McNeely held the Texas Wesleyan single season scoring record for 62 years until Chris Berry had 740 points in the 2008–09 season. Regarded as a \\"deadly\\" free throw shooter, he also held the Texas Wesleyan record for most free throws made with 213 until that too was surpassed by Berry in the 2008–09 season with 216. McNeely studied Administrative Education at Texas Wesleyan, and completed his master's degree after returning to the university in 1953. BAA draft McNeely was selected with the first pick of the inaugural 1947 BAA draft by the Pittsburgh Ironmen, becoming the first player ever drafted in the National Basketball Association. The Ironmen had earned the first pick in the draft after attaining a 14–45 record in the first season of the Basketball Association of America. However, McNeely was not interested in signing with the team, and ultimately never played a game of professional basketball. McNeely and Gene Melchiorre of the 1951 NBA draft are the only two number-one draft picks in NBA history to never play basketball professionally. The Pittsburgh Ironmen ultimately folded before the start of the 1947–48 season. Coaching career After working for Phillips 66 in Bartlesville, Oklahoma for four months in 1947, McNeely returned to Texas and became the head basketball coach at Pampa High School in Pampa, Texas in 1948. He led the Harvesters to state titles in 1953, 1954, 1958 and 1959. Pampa had a 72-game winning streak from 1952 to 1955. McNeely was offered coaching positions at Texas universities including University of Texas at Austin, Rice University and University of Texas at El Paso, but elected to stay at Pampa. He left the Harvesters with a head coaching record of 320–43. Personal life McNeely married Peggy Jean Gallagher, who was a fellow student at Texas Wesleyan, on June 14, 1947 in Cisco, Texas. Peggy worked as a teacher at Pampa High School during her husband's tenure there. The couple had three children: twin sons Phillip and Michael, and daughter Sheryl. McNeely coached his two sons on the Pampa basketball team, and they would both go on to become high school basketball coaches. Later life and death McNeely worked in school administration following his retirement from coaching in 1960. He served as an assistant principal at Castleberry High School, principal at Bridgeport High School and Denton High School, and administrator at Irving Independent School District before retiring in 1985. McNeely died December 26, 2003, at the age of 84. McNeely was inducted into the Texas High School Basketball Hall of Fame, the Slidell ISD Hall of Fame, the Panhandle Sports Hall of Fame and the Texas Wesleyan University Hall of Fame. Pampa's gymnasium was renamed McNeely Fieldhouse in his honor after his retirement. Former members of the Pampa basketball teams he coached founded the Clifton McNeely Endowed Scholarship in 2002.

He switched sides together with his brothers, Ruslan and Sulim in 1999 during the outbreak of the Second Chechen War and then became the commander of the Russian special forces unit Vostok. Yamadayev was assassinated by a bomb blast in March 2003. Biography During the First Chechen War the five Yamadayev brothers fought against the Russian troops and enjoyed great influence as field commanders. Dzhabrail held the rank of Brigadier General in the separatist forces of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria.”Cleanups”, from Chechnya to Ingushetia , Prima-News, 9 June 2003 When the second war in Chechnya broke out in 1999, the Yamadayevs (including Dzhabrail, Sulim and Ruslan) voluntarily defected to Moscow's side. Since then, Dzhabrail became a prominent supporter of Akhmad Kadyrov, leading an elite special force with a core of several dozen former National Guards of ChRI, then a company-sized local special unit directly answerable to the General Staff of the Russian Army. He also held the position of deputy military commandant of Chechnya. The guerrillas nicknamed him \\"Dzhaba\\", meaning \\"bullfrog\\" in Russian. Assassination On 5 March 2003, Dzhabrail Yamadayev was killed along with three of his bodyguards in his own house in the village of Dyshne-Vedeno by a bomb planted under a couch that he slept on after returning from a two-day operation in the mountains. The explosion was so powerful that the house was almost completely destroyed. President of Russia Vladimir Putin awarded Dzhabrail a posthumous medal and title of the Hero of the Russian Federation, while Dzabrail's brother Sulim took over his command (which in the fall of 2003 was upgraded to a spetsnaz battalion Vostok subordinated to GRU, the Russian military intelligence). According to the 2006 statement by the rebel leader Abdul-Halim Sadulayev, pro-Moscow Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and his father Akhmad were behind the killing of Dzhabrail Yamadayev, and his brother Sulim later killed four of Dzhabrail's personal bodyguards who were involved in his murder.SADULAEV: THE RUSSIANS ARE LOSING , The Jamestown Foundation, 6 April 2006 In May 2008, remains belonging to Vakharsolt Zakayev, a former Vostok officer (platoon leader) who had disappeared about six months after that incident and was assumed to have been executed by his colleagues on suspicion in taking part in assassination, were found in the outskirts of Gudermes.Investigation checks possible involvement of \\"Vostok\\" battalion in murdering Arsamakov brothersA parade of corpses before the decisive battle, Prague Watchdog, 12 May 2008 See also *Ruslan Yamadayev *Sulim Yamadayev References Category:1970 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Chechen field commanders Category:Chechen warlords Category:Heroes of the Russian Federation Category:People of the Chechen wars Category:Russian military personnel Category:Chechen guerrillas killed in action Category:Russian people of Chechen descent Category:Chechen people ","title":"Dzhabrail Yamadayev"},{"id":"10380262","text":"Mark Ayotte (born March 12, 1964 in Ishpeming, Michigan) is a professional basketball referee in the National Basketball Association.

He is particularly known for his part in the Battle of the Saintes during the American War of Independence where he helped pioneer the tactic of \\"breaking the line\\".  Early career  Douglas was born in Carr, Perthshire, Scotland to Charles Ayton Douglas and Christian Hepburn of Kinglassie. Little is known of his early life, although it is established that he could speak six languages. He joined the Royal Navy at the age of twelve, and spent some time in the Dutch service before resuming his career with the British.  French and Indian War  He was a midshipman at the Siege of Louisbourg (1745), promoted to lieutenant in 1753 and to commander in 1759. By the end of the war in 1763, he was captain of HMS Syren. While commanding the Syren, Sir Charles reported the attack on St. John's and took part in recapturing Newfoundland. Following the war, Sir Charles went to Saint Petersburg to help re-organize the Russian navy for Catherine the Great in 1764–1765. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1770 for carrying out \\"a series of curious experiments to determine the different degrees of cold at different depths in the Sea\\". American War of Independence After the American War of Independence broke out in America in 1775, Douglas was given command of a squadron to relieve Quebec from the siege. When he arrived at the Gulf of St. Lawrence, he decided to ram the ice and successfully made his way up the river, surprising the Americans and putting them on the run. He was also in charge of creating a navy from scratch to fight on Lake Champlain, and that small fleet routed the Americans under Benedict Arnold. In 1777, he was made a baronet for his service in Quebec. As captain of HMS Stirling Castle, he took part in the first Battle of Ushant. The Battle of the Saintes, 12 April 1782: surrender of the Ville de Paris by Thomas Whitcombe, painted 1783 In 1781, Sir Charles became Captain-of-the-Fleet for George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, and was with Rodney on his flagship, Formidable, at the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica, where on 12 April 1782, they defeated the Comte de Grasse by breaking the French line. Douglas is credited by many, including Sir Charles Dashwood (a midshipman present at the time who later became an admiral himself), for having the idea for the manoeuvre, but it is a subject of much debate. In 1783, he was made the Commander-in-Chief of North America at the Halifax, Nova Scotia Station, but resigned due to a conflict. In 1787 he became a rear-admiral, and in 1789 was once again made commander of the Nova Scotia station, but died of apoplexy before taking his post.

There is a great deal of confusion regarding the identity of Sir Charles' third wife, whose last name has been variously reported as Baillie, Grew, and Brisbane. It appears that some sources have mistaken his sister, Helena Baillie, for his third wife because she raised his younger children while he was at sea. The name Helen Brisbaine is also an error based on a mistake in The Scottish Nation (1862) where it says she was married to Admiral Sir Charles Douglas when, in fact, she was the wife of Admiral Sir James Douglas. When his eldest daughter, Lydia Mariana, married Rev. Richard Bingham against his wishes, he disinherited her. Following his death, Lydia and her husband sued for a share of his estate, and the case was appealed until finally being decided against them in the House of Lords in 1796. The case is made famous because of a letter Lydia had written to Adam Smith, a friend and distant relative of Sir Charles, requesting his assistance in reconciling the father and daughter. Douglas is buried in the ground south of the church in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh and a memorial lies on the outer south face of the church near the east gable.  Legacy  Sir Charles was known as a mechanical genius,A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen and many of his suggestions for improvements on naval vessels, including the substitution of flintlocks for matches, were adopted by the Admiralty for the entire Royal Navy. He was succeeded as Baronet of Carr by his sons, Vice-Admiral Sir William Henry Douglas, 2nd Baronet, and General Sir Howard Douglas, 3rd Baronet, who became a General, lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, MP for Liverpool, and Lord High Chancellor of the Ionian Islands. Both Douglastown and Douglas Township, (the village of Kennetcook, Nova Scotia and surrounding area), are named after him. The song \\"Caillich Odhar\\" was composed by Nathaniel Gow in his honor.

History The midway of the Delaware State Fair in 2012 The first Delaware State Fair was held in Wilmington, with mentions of the \\"Delaware State Fair\\" being found in newspapers as far back as 1869. In 1878, the Delaware State Fair was moved to Fairview Park Fair Grounds in Dover and held September 24–27. The opening speaker of the 1878 Delaware State Fair was Daniel Henry Chamberlain, former Republican Governor of South Carolina, as well as guest speakers J. Proctor Knott, at the time a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing Kentucky's 4th congressional district, and Samuel S. Cox, then Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing New York's 6th congressional district. In 1917, the state fair moved to Elsmere where the Delaware State Fair Association had purchased property and built a fairgrounds within the town limits, in the area of the current Filbert, Birch, and Dover Avenues. The fairgrounds included racetracks, agricultural exhibits, and stages for various entertainment acts. The Association went bankrupt after the 1924 fair, and its assets were sold off. A new fair association was formed and held the Wilmington Fair, which was sometimes referred to as the Delaware State Fair, in 1927 and 1928 at the fairgrounds in Elsmere. The first fair on the current grounds was held in 1920 and was known as the Kent and Sussex County Fair. It lasted four days and was held on . The Kent and Sussex County Fair changed its name to the Delaware State Fair in 1962. Today the fairgrounds encompass over and feature concerts, wrestling, rodeo, races, agricultural exhibits, a midway, and other typical state fair demonstrations and events. The Harrington Raceway & Casino is also located at the fairgrounds. The property also hosted a Donald Trump rally for his presidential campaign on April 22, 2016. The only cancellations were from 1942 to 1945 due to World War II. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the fair resisted cancellation, although safety modifications were put in place and concerts were cancelled. Concerts The Delaware State Fair has long been a center for regional entertainment, drawing in crowds from the rest of the state, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. It is one of few local concert venues, so has been able to attract many popular acts to Delmarva, among them: Casino Harrington Raceway & Casino operates on the fairgrounds year round and consists of a harness racetrack and a casino offering slot machines, table games, and sports betting.

Band 6, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin 1964  Research  Goldscheider is best known for his work with the somatosensory system, in particular, research of the body's thermoreceptors in regards to localized \\"coolness\\" and \\"warmness\\" spots. He also performed research of localized tactile skin sensitivity that included tests involving \\"pain\\" and \\"tickle\\" sensations. The eponymous terms; \\"Goldscheider's test\\" and \\"Goldscheider's percussion\\" are derived from his research.

In the late 1890s, with neurologist Edward Flatau (1868-1932), Goldscheider performed studies on the structure of nerve cells and their changes under different stimuli. Also, he is credited with describing the skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa, a condition sometimes called \\"Goldscheider's disease\\". Goldscheider died in Berlin.

The plan was put forward because after the Dissolution of the Parliament of 1625, the Duke of Buckingham, Lord High Admiral, wanted to undertake an expedition that would match the exploits of the raiders of the Elizabethan era and in doing so, would return respect to the country and its people after the political stress of the preceding years. Background Following an abortive trip to Spain by Prince Charles and the Duke of Buckingham to propose a marriage between Charles and the Spanish Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the two switched positions and began advocating war with Spain. They persuaded King James to summon a new Parliament which would be invited to advise on foreign policy. The resulting Parliament of 1624 was, at least in the short run, a triumph for Charles and Buckingham, as it strongly advocated war with Spain. However, James had a dilemma stemming from mutual distrust between himself and Parliament. He feared that if he went to war, Parliament would find an excuse to avoid providing the finances to support it. Parliament, on the other hand, feared that if it voted the finances, the King would find an excuse not to go to war. James died shortly afterwards, leaving foreign policy in the hands of Charles, who rather naively assumed that if he followed the policy that Parliament had advocated, it would provide the funds for it. Plan War was duly declared on Spain, and Buckingham began preparations. The planned expedition involved several elements, including overtaking Spanish treasure ships coming back from the Americas loaded with gold and silver and then assaulting Spanish towns with the intention of causing stress within Spain's economy and weakening the Spanish supply chain and resources in regards to the Electorate of the Palatinate. Expedition Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon By October 1625, approximately 100 ships and a total of 15,000 seamen and soldiers had been readied for the Cádiz Expedition. An alliance with the Dutch had also been forged, and the new allies agreed to send an additional 15 warships commanded by William of Nassau, to help guard the English Channel in the absence of the main fleet. Sir Edward Cecil, a battle-hardened soldier fighting for the Dutch, was appointed commander of the expedition by the Duke of Buckingham. The choice of commander was ill-judged because Cecil was a good soldier but had little knowledge of the sea. The expedition began, from Plymouth Sound, on 6 October 1625, but the voyage was plagued with difficulties. Stormy weather threatened the ships, rendering many of them barely seaworthy and causing major delays. By the time the fleet escaped from the storms and arrived in Spanish waters, it had become apparent that they were too poorly supplied to conduct the mission properly and that they were too late to engage the West Indian treasure fleet because of the storms they had encountered; in any case, the treasure fleet had used a more southerly passage than usual. =Cádiz= Fernando Girón de Salcedo, commanding the defence of Cádiz. Cecil chose to assault the Spanish city of Cádiz and after successfully sailing to the Bay of Cádiz and landing his force, he was able to take the fort that guarded the harbour of the city. However, he soon found that the city itself had been heavily fortified with modern defences, and he then began to make serious errors. Spanish vessels that were open to capture were able to get away because most of his forces waited for orders and did not act. The Spanish ships then sailed to the safety of Puerto Real, in the easternmost anchorage of the bay. The ships used in the assault were also largely merchant vessels conscripted and converted for warfare, and the captains or owners of those ships, concerned about the welfare of their ships, left much of the battle to the Dutch. Map of Cadiz (1888) The attack on and capture of El Puntal tower proved a mistake, as that fortification did not need to be captured to be able to attack Cádiz. Diego Ruiz, the deputy field commander at the defence of Cádiz. When Cecil landed his forces, they realised that they had no food or drink with them. Cecil then made the foolish decision to allow the men to drink from the wine vats found in the local houses. A wave of drunkenness ensued, with few or none of Cecil's force remaining sober. Realizing what he had done, Cecil took the only course left open to him and ordered that the men return to their ships and retreat. When the Spanish army arrived, they found over 1,000 English soldiers still drunk; although every man was armed, not a single shot was fired as the Spanish put them all to the sword. =Spanish galleons= After the embarrassing fiasco of Cádiz, Cecil decided to try to intercept a fleet of Spanish galleons that were bringing resources back from the New World. That failed as well because the ships had been warned of danger in the waters and so were able to take another route and returned home without any trouble from Cecil's ships. =Return= Disease and sickness was sweeping through the ranks, and since the ships were in a bad state, Cecil finally decided that there was no alternative but to return to England although he had captured few or no goods and made little impact on Spain. Therefore, in December, the fleet returned home; the expedition had cost the English an estimated £250,000. Aftermath King Charles I of England The failure of the attack had serious political repercussions in England. Charles I, to protect his own dignity and his favourite, Buckingham, who should have at least made sure the ships were well supplied, made no effort to enquire about the failure of the expedition. He turned a blind eye but instead interested himself in the plight of the Huguenots of La Rochelle. The House of Commons was less forgiving. The Parliament of 1626 began the process of impeachment against Buckingham. Eventually, Charles chose to dissolve Parliament rather than risk a successful impeachment.

Early life, and character formation Barbara Jefferis was the daughter of (Arthur) Tarlton Jefferis (1884–1965) and Lucy Barbara Ingoldsby Jefferis, née Smythe (1888–1917). Her father was one of Australia's leading analytical chemists, who was in England working as an adviser to the munitions industry during World War I when Barbara was born. When Barbara was about 6 months old her mother died. Due to the war, her father remained in England and Barbara was taken into the care of her aged maternal grandfather, who was a widower. He died when Barbara was three years old, and she then lived with her paternal grandmother and was absorbed into that woman's extensive group of grandchildren. Jefferis later said, \\"Even as a child, I was determined to be a writer, although I hadn't a very clear idea what that meant. When I was very small I had a slightly younger cousin who always wanted to hear stories, and for some reason I used to write them ... I rather think it was because a story wasn't a story until it was written down.\\" At age eight her father returned from England and was employed at Roseworthy Agricultural Collegehttp://www.adelaide.edu.au/campuses/roseworthy (now part of the University of Adelaide) in the country some 50 km north of Adelaide. Barbara enjoyed the country life but was sent to boarding school after relations soured with her new stepmother. She was educated as a boarder in Adelaide and then began a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Adelaide. In her second year she won the Jefferis Memorial Medal for Philosophy, named in honour of her paternal grandfather, Dr James Jefferis, a Congregational minister, philosopher and natural scientist, who died eight months after she was born. Work In 1939, she left university and moved to Sydney to work as a journalist on The Daily News. Within a short time she married John Hamilton Hinde, a journalist on the same newspaper, and later famous as film critic for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Jefferis later worked at The Telegraph, Women's Weekly, and Pix. The couple's daughter, Rosalind, was born in 1944, with Hinde overseas as an ABC war correspondent. Being a mother caused a transition in work and, as a freelance radio writer, Jefferis went on to write more than 50 radio dramas and dramatised documentaries as well as serials, scientific and educational programmes. In 1953, Jefferis decided to enter the lucrative Sydney Morning Herald prize, given annually for an unpublished novel. Over three weeks she wrote Contango Day, co-winner of that year's award. The novel features the first of Barbara's empowered female heroes. It was published in Britain and America in 1954, developing a pattern of her novels being far better known overseas than in Australia, with her books also being translated into a number of Asian and European languages. Social and professional activities Jefferis was a breeder of Siamese cats, and over four decades, held positions including president of the Siamese Cat Society and chair of the Royal Agricultural Society's Cat Control Consultative Committee. Jefferis was a founding member, and first female president (1973), of the Australian Society of Authors. Awards In 1986, Jefferis was made a member of the Order of Australia for services to literature. In 1995, she was recognised with an Emeritus Award of the Australia Council. Barbara Jefferis Award The Barbara Jefferis Award was created in 2007 in her honour. The literary prize is one of Australia's richest, the result of a $1 million bequest by John Hinde to commemorate his wife of 64 years. The Australian Society of Authors (ASA) administers the Barbara Jefferis Award, which goes to the author of \\"the best novel written by an Australian author that depicts women and girls in a positive way or otherwise empowers the status of women and girls in society.\\" The annual prize is at least $35,000 but is likely to be around $42,000 to match the Miles Franklin Award.

The name, meaning 'golden' in Latin, denotes the gold industries that were alive at the time and which helped foment the ideas of secession. The proposed colony would have comprised the Goldfields, the western portion of the Nullarbor Plain and the port town of Esperance. Its capital would have been Kalgoorlie. The push to secession was prompted by perceptions that the Western Australian colony under Sir John Forrest was parochial, self-serving and evasive towards federating the colony with the emerging Commonwealth. Many inhabitants in the goldfields had come to Western Australia from the other colonies in the previous decade when Kalgoorlie experienced a gold rush and their loyalties were thus not usually directed towards Perth. Sir John Forrest's efforts to secure concessions before fully supporting Federation was alienating these new arrivals. Eventually the proposal was dropped when Western Australia joined the federation in 1901. The name Auralia was used by a journalist writing in the Coolgardie Miner after federation, and before the First World War. In the 1933 secession referendum, the Goldfields was the only region of Western Australia to be against secession, instead arguing for a constitutional convention.

She founded an evangelical branch in England and Sierra Leone, known as the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion. She helped finance and guide early Methodism and was the first principal of Trevecca College, Wales, established in 1768 to train Methodist ministers. With construction of 64 chapels in England and Wales, plus mission work in colonial America, she is estimated to have spent over £100,000 on these activities, a huge sum when a family of four could live on £31 per year. A regular correspondent of George Whitefield and John Wesley, she is also remembered for her adversarial relationships with other Methodists. Personal life Selina Shirley was born in June 1707 at Astwell Castle, Northamptonshire, second daughter of Washington Shirley, 2nd Earl Ferrers, and Mary Levinge. The family moved to Staunton Harold Hall, in Leicestershire when she was 17 and in 1728, she married Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, who lived at nearby Donington Hall. This was arranged by his elder half-sister, Lady Elizabeth Hastings, a well-known religious philanthropist and supporter of women's education. She gave birth to seven children in the first ten years of the marriage, four of whom died young; her husband died in 1746, while she allegedly suffered from poor health. The family were interested in politics, religion and the arts, and commissioned portraits from fashionable artists of the day. Foundling Hospital On 21 April 1730, she became one of the twenty-one aristocratic women whose support Thomas Coram would enlist in his efforts to establish the Foundling Hospital. Securing the support of notably pious women such as Lady Huntingdon as signatories to the Ladies' Petition for the Establishment of the Foundling Hospital lent his endeavour not only respectability but cachet; many of the women were lending their signature where their husbands had previously refused, making the Foundling Hospital 'one of the most fashionable charities of the day.'Elizabeth Einberg, 'Elegant Revolutionaries', article in Ladies of Quality and Distinction Catalogue, Foundling Hospital, London 2018, pp. 14–15, p.15. https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/ladies-of-quality-distinction/ Selina would later provide the Coram with 'financial support for fees, stamp duties, vellum, seals and others expenses [sic] connected with the presentation of the Foundling Hospital Charter for the King's signature.'Ladies of Quality and Distinction Exhibition Catalogue, edited by Kathleen Palmer, Foundling Hospital, London, 2018, p.7. https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/ladies-of-quality-distinction/ The petition was presented to King George II in 1735. Religious revival In 1739, Lady Huntington joined the first Methodist society in Fetter Lane, London. Sometime after the death of her husband in 1746, she threw in her lot with John Wesley and George Whitefield in the work of the great revival. According to Schlenther, it was Wesley who first attracted her to Methodism, noting a visit to his chapel in Donnington (Wood) in East Shropshire, in which a rare exception to egalitarian principles was made and she was offered a private pew. Whitefield became her personal chaplain, and, with his assistance, following problems put in her path by the Anglican clergy from whom she had preferred not to separate, she founded the \\"Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion\\", a Calvinistic movement within the Methodist church. In the earlier part of her life Isaac Watts, Mary, Lady Abney, Philip Doddridge, and Augustus Montague Toplady were among her friends. Lady Anne Erskine (eldest daughter of the 10th Earl of Buchan), was her closest friend and companion for many years in the latter part of Lady Huntingdon's life. Chapel building In 1748, the Countess gave Whitefield a scarf as her chaplain, and in that capacity he preached in one of her London houses, in Park Street, Westminster, to audiences that included Chesterfield, Walpole and Bolingbroke. She held large dinner parties at which Whitefield preached to the gathered dignitaries after they had eaten. Moved to further the religious revival in a Calvinistic manner compatible with Whitefield's work, she was responsible for founding 64 chapels and contributed to the funding of others, insisting they should all subscribe to the doctrines of the Church of England and use only the Book of Common Prayer. Amongst these were chapels at Brighton (1761), Bath (1765), Worcester (c. 1766), Tunbridge Wells (1769), several in Wales, and a small number in London including founding one adjacent to her London home at Spa Fields, Clerkenwell/Finsbury (which resulted in a case being brought before the ecclesiastical courts by the vicar of the parish church of St James). She partly funded the independent Surrey Chapel of Rowland Hill. She appointed ministers to officiate in them, under the impression that as a peeress she had a right to employ as many chaplains as she pleased. In her chapel at Bath (now owned by the Bath Preservation Trust and housing the Building of Bath Collection which is open to the public) there was a curtained recess dubbed \\"Nicodemus' Corner\\" where bishops sat incognito to hear services. Trevecca College and later history Trevecca College, Brecknockshire, depicted in 1824 Following the expulsion of six Methodist students from St Edmund Hall, Oxford in 1768 the Countess founded a ministers' training college at Trefeca (Trevecca) near Talgarth, in Mid Wales, not far from Brecon. George Whitefield preached at the opening ceremony. The college moved to Hertfordshire in 1792, and was renamed Cheshunt College. It moved to Cambridge in 1906.The city of Cambridge – Theological colleges  A History of the County of Cambridge and the Isle of Ely: Volume 3 (pp. 139–141). British- history.ac.uk (22 June 2003).

The Countess had an interest in the British colonies of North America, and issues related to Native Americans and enslaved Africans there. During the mid-1760s, she met and befriended Mohegan preacher Samson Occom, then on a tour of England to raise funds for Indian missions in the British colonies of North America. She became a slave owner herself in 1770 when she inherited Whitefield's overseas estates in Georgia and South Carolina, including the Bethesda Home for Boys. On Whitefield's advice, she bought additional slaves for the orphanage's benefit.Edward J. Cashin, Beloved Bethesda : A History of George Whitefield's Home for Boys (2001), p.101. The Countess promoted the writings and independence of formerly enslaved Africans who espoused religious views compatible with her own. For instance, she supported publication of memoirs, or slave narratives, by Ukawsaw Gronniosaw and Olaudah Equiano. She also used her influence in the world of the arts to secure publication for Phillis Wheatley's 1773 volume of poems, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral by Phillis Wheatley, Negro Servant to Mr. John Wheatley, of Boston, in New England, which was dedicated to the Countess. Because the Countess was ill when Wheatley visited London, the two women never met. Several pieces of their correspondence are extant. Until 1779, Lady Huntingdon and her chaplains were members of the Church of England, with which most Methodists were still connected. That year the consistorial court prohibited her chaplains from preaching in the Pantheon in Spa Fields, Clerkenwell, which had been rented by the Countess. To evade the injunction, she was compelled to take shelter under the Toleration Act. This placed her among classified dissenters. Such prominent members as William Romaine and Henry Venn did not want to be classified in that status, and left the Connexion. After the American Revolutionary War, the Crown fulfilled promises to enslaved Africans and African Americans who had fled rebel masters to join their forces. The British evacuated thousands of former slaves from the colonies, who became known as Black Loyalists. About 3,000 were resettled in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where they were to be given land and supplies. The Countess sent missionaries to these colonies, including John Marrant and William Furmage, to attend to the Black Loyalists. Legacy Selina, Countess of Huntingdon in old age Until her death in London, Lady Huntingdon exercised an active, and even autocratic, superintendence over her chapels and chaplains. Alice Membury, appointed schoolmistress in Melbourne, Derbyshire by Lady Elizabeth Hastings, was ejected by the Countess for 'not turning Methodist'. Selina successfully petitioned George III about the gaiety of Archbishop Cornwallis' establishment, and made a vigorous protest against the anti-Calvinistic minutes of the Wesleyan Conference of 1770, and against relaxing the terms of subscription of 1772. On the Countess's death in 1791, the 64 chapels and the college were bequeathed to four trustees. Amongst them were Dr Ford, as well as Lady Ann, who was requested to occupy and reside in Lady Huntingdon's house adjoining Spa Fields Chapel, and carry on all needful correspondence (which was immense). She did this dutifully until her own death in 1804 and burial at Bunhill Fields. The principal trustee was the Reverend Thomas Haweis, who presided at the Convocation of the Connexion, comprising about 120 chapels. As rector of the Church of England parish at Aldwincle until his death in 1820, he ensured the Connexion kept as close to the Church of England as was possible; many chapels became part of the Free Church of England in 1863. One of the earliest changes under the new trustees was to complete plans to relocate the college. In 1792 it removed to Cheshunt, Hertfordshire where it remained as Cheshunt College, until 1905, when its functions were transferred to Cambridge University. The college was noted for the number of men it sent into foreign missions. In 1795, Spa Fields Chapel, was used by the founders of the non-denominational Missionary Society, which became the London Missionary Society, for preachers contributing to this, its founding meeting. After her death, much of her movement merged with the Congregationalist Church, who came to predominate in the London Missionary Society, and more joined the Free Church of England in 1863, although there are still 25 Connexion congregations functioning in England, with others in Sierra Leone. In her will, she requested no biography of her should be written and none was attempted until 90 years after her death. Obituaries and tributes were written: Horace Walpole described her as the patriarchess of the Methodists, whilst the Roman Catholic, John Henry Newman, commented She devoted herself, her means, her time, her thoughts, to the cause of Christ. She did not spend her money on herself; she did not allow the homage paid to her rank to remain with herself. She was clearly a pivotal figure in the Evangelical Revival. Huntingdon College, in Montgomery, Alabama, is a coeducation liberal arts college named after the Countess of Huntingdon to honour her contributions to Methodism. Huntingdon Street in Savannah, Georgia, is likewise named after her in recognition of her association with Whitefield and John and Charles Wesley in their apostolic works in the Colony of Georgia.

Family By her marriage to Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, she had seven children. Of those, three died in childhood and the death date of a fourth is unknown. Her longest surviving children were: * Francis, Lord Hastings (1729–1789), later 10th Earl of Huntingdon, died unmarried and without issue. * Lady Elizabeth Hastings (1731–1808), Baroness Hastings, the only child to survive her mother, married John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira. * Lady Selina Hastings (1737-1763), died when engaged to Lt-Col George Hastings, without issue.

The series rain in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump from November 2004 to March 2008. It follows a young genius Magical Law Executor, Toru Muhyo and his assistant, Jiro Kusano as they track and find ghosts, then send the spirits to heaven or hell depending on the account of their lives in his magical law book. The individual chapters of the series were collected and published in 18 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha. An anime television series adaptation by Studio Deen aired from August to October 2018 on SKY PerfecTV! and Animax. A second season aired from July to September 2020. The manga is licensed for English language release in North America by Viz Media, which released the eighteen volumes from October 2007 to August 2010 under its \\"Shonen Jump\\" manga line. The anime series is licensed by Funimation.  Characters  ; : :It's said to be the youngest executor graduated from the Magical Law School. Muhyo paired up with Roji and the two formed their own business of exorcising ghosts. Muhyo has a somewhat emotionless personality, showing no sign of pity when dispensing of the ghosts. He seems to be sleeping most of the time (for as an executor of the Laws, large amount of spiritual energy is needed for him to summon the necessary Hellish being to carry out the sentences of various ghosts, spirits). He tries to show no signs of caring for his assistant, Roji, but it immediately becomes evident that he does during dangerous situations, or when one of Muhyo's friends or acquaintances points it out. He is often rude to other people, and keeps a stern face, but deep down, he has a strong sense of Justice. He is also extremely powerful, being able to perform a judgment that normally requires four top-notch executors by himself. Despite Enchu's vile attacks upon him and those he cares for, he still wished to redeem him. Muhyo has shown that he can speak the language of the underworld allowing him to speak with the creatures he summons to carry out his sentences, this talent also allows him to command the creatures to pause or stop the punishment they were delivering. ;, nicknamed : :He is Muhyo's assistant. He's a kind-hearted person, almost to a fault, as it interferes with his ability to exorcise ghosts with a sob story. He is a bit of a whiner and a crybaby. However, he is adept at writing seals to hold back ghosts while Muhyo sentences them. He is knowledgeable on types of ghosts, but has nearly no knowledge on exorcism of ghosts and how to use the laws of magic. He initially feels that Muhyo is rude, mean, and hates him. But as the series progresses, he finds out that Muhyo chose him to be his apprentice even though the normal standard is to choose someone who is the rank of an assistant judge and Muhyo actually deeply cares for him. His power often seemingly fluctuates between strong and weak, becoming stronger when he has more confidence in himself. He was frustrated that Muhyo didn't ever instruct him. In a flashback showcasing how Roji met Muhyo, it was revealed that Roji wanted to learn Magic Law after a friend was possessed and an executor, specifically Page, showed up and saved him; Roji also successfully used an item only an assistant judge could handle. During the Magic Law Examination, it is revealed that he has an extraordinarily high tempering (ren). Roji is definitely more feminine, which causes comedic scenes to emerge sometimes. ; / : :A trouble-making boy who had believed Muhyo and Roji's business was a sham and wrecked their sign. He did not believe in ghosts until the pair saved him from a blood-drinking ghost he had accidentally freed. Afterwards, Kenji grew a liking for the pair, often referring to Roji as \\"Bean Sprout\\" and Muhyo as \\"Onion\\". He always tries to find excuses to hang around their office, as Muhyo has made it a rule never to meet a client after the case is complete unless they bring a new one. ; / : :A photographer who Kenji introduces to the duo. Her late father had made a living producing fake ghost pictures, causing a rift between the two. Nana becomes another of Muhyo and Roji's regular clients after Muhyo sends her father's troubled spirit to the River Styx for purification so he can go to heaven. She is notably well endowed which often causes her to be the target of perverts. It is later revealed that she is a spirit medium. ; / : :A judge and a childhood friend of Muhyo's. He is a pervert who enjoys trying to guess girls' cup sizes (his first appearance was him squeezing Nana's breasts). Yoichi appears to have a crush on Nana, which is unfortunate, since she considers him a creep. However, underneath this exterior resides his experience and wisdom that rival Muhyo's. Yoichi had offered to be Muhyo's partner, but Muhyo had already chosen Roji instead. He's an expert at every type of Magical Law except for Execution. ;, also called : :He was a childhood friend of Muhyo and Yoichi. Unlike Muhyo, he was studious and serious about Magic Law. Enchu had wanted to be an Executor so he could support his family, including his sick mother. Enchu spent hours everyday studying, with his friends not noticing. One day, Muhyo's talent \\"woke up\\", which overtook Enchu and created a desire within him to surpass Muhyo. When Muhyo and Enchu were both up for becoming Executor, Enchu had left because he had learned his mother had died. When he had returned, Muhyo had been promoted to Executor, causing Enchu to break down mentally. He has shown to have some control over ghosts and other spirits through his knowledge of Forbidden Magic Law. He has also apparently become inhuman as at one point he generated ten forearms on a single arm. Despite his grudge, Enchu still cares for others, claiming its better to practice Forbidden Magic Law with friends and retreating in order to save Rio who was Ghosting. Eventually, Enchu was \\"saved\\" from his madness, realizing that his friends never stopped caring about him despite what he put them through. This realization did not keep him from punishment, however, as afterwards, he was sentenced to the Arcanum for an indefinite amount of time. ;, also known as : :She is a Magic Tool Artificer, who is able to make magical tools, but cannot use them herself. She is deeply devoted to her teacher, Rio, and was shocked by the revelation that she was a traitor. When she was younger, she disliked Rio until Rio saved her from an experiment gone wrong. Roji first believed she was a boy when she first appeared. She has three apprentices of her own. She hoped that Rio could be saved, and wished to go raspberry picking with her. After the battle had ended, Biko and Rio lived together since Rio had been sentenced to imprisonment within their home. ; : :Biko's teacher and a skilled Artificer. While she initially seemed to help Muhyo and Roji, she was actually working with Enchu, having grown bitter after no one helped save her mother from an evil spirit. Despite having become a traitor, she was still fond of Biko, but believed that it was too late to go back. When her mother was alive, Rio had to resort to low means in order to make money so that she could take care of her mother. When a spirit attacked her mother, she frantically sought help but was turned down by the executors in her neighborhood. It was revealed that Teeki had intentionally caused the attack on her mother in an attempt to gain Rio as a pawn. When she discovered this, she tried to deny it, then denied that she was able to be saved at all, but soon came to terms with her situation and did her best to turn things around. She lives with Biko, sentenced to imprisonment within their home. According to Muhyo, she is a \\"kissing fiend\\", which is an accurate statement. ;Face-Ripper Sophie / : :An extremely powerful ghost who was once imprisoned in the Arcanum, but released by Rio. In life, she was kept away from parties by her older sister due to her being considered \\"plain\\", and killed people for their faces because she wanted people to think she was pretty. As a ghost, she was able to shapeshift and assume other people's forms. Muhyo used a high- level magical commandment to sentence her for her crimes. As she faded she cried and stated, \\"Sister, why can't I go to the party?\\". She was a very powerful ghost as it took the usage of an envoy that normally requires four executors to summon to defeat her. ; : :A judge of Magic Law. She was assigned to be a guard for the Arcanum, a prison for powerful ghosts including Sophie. When Rio freed Sophie, she nearly became a victim but was spared because Sophie considered her face ugly. She was also nearly strangled by Teeki, but luckily escaped. Since the Arcanum incident, she has become friends with Jiro and escorted him to the Magic Law Academy. In chapter 155, it is revealed that Imai possibly has feelings for Roji. ; : :He was Enchu's right-hand man and a powerful but mysterious foe to Muhyo and Roji. The association had marked him for 800 years or so. He 'meddled' in magic law and when he was finished, he disappeared into thin air. It was unclear what Teeki was; a ghost or a practitioner turned immortal by forbidden law. Teeki was also the one responsible for the fire inside the Arcanum after Rio followed Muhyo and company out into the forest. He seemed to like to killing and destruction, as he laughed at Mr. Maeda when he set the Arcanum ablaze and wanted to kill Muhyo's group instead of retreating. He was the one to introduce Enchu to Forbidden Magic Law. Teeki wore a four-eyed mask and gloves that had the mark of Forbidden Magic Law on them. ; : :The teacher of Muhyo and Enchu, he is very famous within the association. He believes that Magic Law starts with physical fitness. He likes to compose poetry and thinks he's good at it; he also acts as a father to his students (ex. Rushing to Muhyo when he was supposed to be healing, out of relief that he was okay). Although Roji is unaware of it, Page was the practitioner that exorcised a ghost from a friend of his and gave him his tie. He claims that Muhyo and Roji were destined to meet. ; / : :An executor of magic law like Muhyo, and head of the centuries- old Goryo Group Syndicate. While the Goryo group are not particularly strong in magic law, they make up for it with cunning use of strategy; in addition, they perform extremely vicious practices ranging from bribery to murder. Goryo was a jerk who only cared about money and his family's pride, threatening to release ghosts he had exorcised if clients do not pay him, and treating his assistants like trash and discarding them should they fail him. But after the Goryo Group is destroyed by Ark and he is rescued from Tomas, he becomes a better person. ; / : :A judge of Magic Law who worked for Goryo as an assistant. He looks like a clown and is afraid of Goryo's wrath. He was jealous of Roji because Roji was only a clerk who was practically given his current job, with Muhyo no less, while Ebisu had to claw his way to where he is now. He helps Goryo in banishing ghosts and running his company. After Goryo and Muhyo's competition, he was fired by Goryo for failing him in a strategy. Despite that, he is the first to run to Goryo's aid when the Group is attacked. ; :An evil practitioner working for \\"Ark\\". He was once a teacher and Page's friend, but it was revealed that he faked his credentials and was wanted for several crimes. He had an obsession for collecting, anything from teacups to souls, because he paired up with Beelzebub. ;, also called :She was a ghost assassin working for the Forbidden Magic Law group known as \\"Ark\\", working directly under Teeki. She was a powerful spirit with an overwhelming obsession with Roji, and because of this uses her powers of human puppetry to try and kill off Muhyo and kidnap Roji. It was revealed that she always got bullied because she could see ghosts and she wished her knight in shining armor would come and save her. Even her parents forced her out of their house by making her take the exam to become Muhyo's assistant and telling her not to come home. She lost her applicant form on the way and no one wanted to help her except for Roji, who gave her one of his applicant forms. That was when Chiyo fell in love with him. Unfortunately, she met Teeki and was misled by him into using forbidden law. On her way to heaven, Roji told her that he wished he had known her feelings so they could have been friends, but she said she preferred him as her knight. Her passing was the spark of determination within the group to end Enchu and Teeki's terrorization. ;, also called :A swordsman known as 'Mick the Slasher' who worked for \\"Ark\\". However, he had a tendency to do what he wanted, and followed orders in his own straightforward style. Unlike many other Ark members, he was very simple-minded and had no long-term goals other than to move on to the next fight. Seemingly relaxed and casual, he could become rather eccentric in battle, using his whole body as a morphing sword. His parents were evil practitioners who were killed by the MLA after they attacked representatives bearing a treaty. ; :A ghostmaster who worked for \\"Ark\\". She bore a grudge towards MLA for the death of her parents and tried to destroy the MLA, but was stopped by Goryo, then murdered by Buhpu.

The film stars Dylan Baker, Rochelle Aytes, Anna Paquin and Brian Cox. It relates four Halloween horror stories with a common element in them, Sam; a mysterious child trick-or- treater wearing shabby orange footie pajamas with a burlap sack over his head. The character makes an appearance in each of the stories whenever a character breaks Halloween traditions. Despite being delayed for two years and having a small number of public screenings, the film received much critical acclaim and has since garnered a strong cult following. In October 2013, the filmmakers announced that a sequel, Trick 'r Treat 2, is in the works. In 2016, Michael Dougherty and Legendary Pictures teamed up with AtmosFX to create a series of digital Halloween decorations that feature Sam.http://www.slashfilm.com/trick- r-treat-sequel-update/ In 2017, a Trick 'r Treat themed \\"scare zone\\" was added to Halloween Horror Nights, an annual event held at the Universal Orlando Resort, followed by a haunted house in 2018.  Plot  The film takes place over the course of Halloween in the fictional town of Warren Valley, Ohio. Its story is told in a nonlinear narrative, with characters crossing paths with each other throughout the film. At the center of the story is Sam, a peculiar trick-or-treater dressed in pajamas and a burlap sack, who appears to enforce the \\"rules\\" of Halloween. =Opening= In the opening scene, Emma and her Halloween-loving husband Henry return home after a celebratory night. Henry takes a rest in his house while Emma begins tearing down the seasonal decorations before the night's end, and is murdered by an unseen assailant. Henry discovers her mutilated corpse on display with the decorations hours later. =Principal= Charlie, an obese vandal who smashes jack-o'-lanterns, is caught stealing candy from an unattended bowl left by his school principal, Steven Wilkins. Wilkins proceeds to lecture Charlie about the importance of respecting Halloween's many rules and traditions. Charlie begins to projectile vomit, and Wilkins reveals that he spiked the candy with cyanide. While attempting to cover up Charlie's death, he ends up handing out candy to trick- or-treaters, including Sam. Wilkins' work burying Charlie and another child in his backyard is continually interrupted by his young son Billy and his elderly neighbor, Mr. Kreeg, a scarred recluse whose only company is his dog. Wilkins takes Charlie's severed head indoors so he and Billy can carve a jack o'lantern out of it, with Billy seemingly unconcerned if the head is real or not. =Halloween School Bus Massacre= A group of trick-or-treaters – Macy, Sara, Chip, and Schrader – meet Rhonda, a Halloween fanatic, said to be a savant. The group travels to a local flooded quarry where Macy recalls the urban legend of the \\"Halloween school bus massacre,\\" which claimed the lives of eight mentally challenged children died in a school bus on Halloween. The driver, who had been paid by their worn-out parents to dispose of them, was the only survivor of the crash. The group offers eight jack-o'-lanterns as tribute to the dead children. They then pose as zombies to prank Rhonda, who is terrified. When Schrader defends Rhonda, a jealous Macy ends up kicking one of the lanterns into the quarry, causing the undead massacred children to emerge from the dark water. The group flees, but Rhonda alone escapes, leaving the others to die at the zombie children's hands. She briefly encounters Sam while leaving, and the two exchange a nod of respect. =Surprise Party= Laurie, a self-conscious young woman, arrives in town with her sister Danielle and friends Maria and Janet. They pick up dates, save Laurie, who wants her \\"first time\\" to be special and declines their invitation for a get-together to enjoy the town festival instead. Laurie encounters a hooded serial killer, dressed as a vampire, who attacks her. At a bonfire, Laurie's friends witness the man (now severely injured) falling out of a tree and unmask him, revealed to be Wilkins. Laurie appears, having decided to join them for this occasion, and the girls transform into werewolves, devouring Wilkins and their deceased dates. Sam witnesses the feast. =Sam= While Wilkins is burying Charlie's body, Kreeg scares away children to steal their candy, aided by his dog. Sam breaks into his house, decorating it with Halloween memorabilia. Sam, unmasked as a demonic-looking pumpkin-headed child, attacks Kreeg. However, instead of killing the old man, he takes a chocolate bar that landed on Kreeg's lap. Satisfied that Kreeg offered him candy, thus fulfilling a tradition of Halloween, Sam takes his leave from the confused Kreeg. Photographs in the fireplace reveal Kreeg to be the bus driver that killed the eight children. =Conclusion= Later, Kreeg begins giving out candy to children before gazing at the neighborhood. He witnesses Rhonda casually pulling her pumpkin cart along. He sees Billy handing out treats to other kids and enjoying himself. He observes Laurie being dropped off by her sister and friends. He catches sight of Sam watching Emma and Henry returning home, with him going to exact punishment when Emma blows out a jack-o'-lantern. He returns inside, only to receive a knock on the door. Kreeg opens it, revealing the resurrected children waiting for him. The final shots of the film show Kreeg being dismembered, the children having gotten their vengeance.

This teaching has developed through a number of ecumenical councils and the influence of theologians, including the Church Fathers. Historically, the Catholic Church has resisted the acceptance of homosexuality within Christian society. The church provides pastoral care for LGBT Catholics through a variety of official and unofficial channels that vary from diocese to diocese, and senior clergy and popes have recently begun to call for the church to do more. In many parts of the world, the Church is active politically on issues of LGBT rights, primarily to oppose them. The relationship between the Catholic church and the LGBT community has been a difficult one, especially during the height of the AIDS crisis. There have been notable Catholics who were gay or bisexual, including priests and bishops. Catholic dissenters from the church's teaching say that love between people of the same sex is as spiritually valuable as love between people of the opposite sex and that LGBT Catholics are as much members of the body of Christ as heterosexuals are. Catholic organizations that support the church's teaching may campaign against gay rights, or argue that gay people should be celibate or try to become heterosexual. Church teaching The Catholic Church teaches that, as a person does not choose to be either homosexual or heterosexual, being gay is not inherently sinful. According to the Catholic theology of sexuality, all sexual acts must be open to procreation and express the symbolism of male-female complementarity. Sexual acts between two members of the same gender cannot meet these standards. Homosexuality thus constitutes a tendency towards this sin. The church teaches that gay people are called to practice chastity. The church also teaches that gay people \\"must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity\\", and that \\"every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\\" whilst holding that discrimination in marriage, employment, housing, and adoption in some circumstances can be just and \\"obligatory.\\" The church points to several passages in the Bible as the basis for its teachings, including Genesis 19:1-11, Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, I Corinthians 6:9, Romans 1:18-32, and I Timothy 1:10. In December 2019, the Pontifical Biblical Commission published a book that included an exegesis on these and other passages.  History  The Christian tradition has generally prohibited all sexual activities outside of sexual intercourse. This includes activities engaged in by couples or individuals of either the same or different sexes. The Catholic Church's position specifically on homosexuality developed from the teachings of the Church Fathers, which was in stark contrast to Greek and Roman attitudes towards same-sex relations, including pederasty. Canon law regarding same-sex sexual activity has been shaped through the decrees issued by a series of ecclesiastical councils. Initially, canons against sodomy were aimed at ensuring clerical or monastic discipline, and were only widened in the medieval period to include laymen. In the Summa Theologica, Saint Thomas Aquinas stated that \\"the unnatural vice\\" is the greatest of the sins of lust. Throughout the Middle Ages, the church repeatedly condemned homosexuality, and often collaborated with civic authorities to punish gay people. Punishment of sexual \\"vice\\" as well as religious heresy was seen as strengthening the church's moral authority. In more recent times, the Church has responded to gay rights movements by reiterating its condemnation of homosexuality while acknowledging the existence of gay people. In January 1976, the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope Paul VI published Persona Humana, which codified the teaching against all extra-marital sex, including gay sex. Homosexuality was named as such for the first time in a papal encyclical in Pope John Paul II's Veritatis Splendor of 1993, which \\"specifically proclaims the intrinsic evil of the homosexual condition\\".. There he declared that homosexual intercourse is performed by a choice of the will, unlike homosexual orientation which he acknowledged is not a matter of free choice. The church has also been politically active to oppose gay rights movements in the civil sphere. Pastoral care for gay Catholics Beginning in the 1970s, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops taught that gays \\"should have an active role in the Christian community\\" and have called on \\"all Christians and citizens of good will to confront their own fears about homosexuality and to curb the humor and discrimination that offend homosexual persons. We understand that having a homosexual orientation brings with it enough anxiety, pain and issues related to self-acceptance without society bringing additional prejudicial treatment.\\" Bishops around the world have held diocesan events with the goal of reaching out to gay Catholics and ministering to them, and more have spoken publicly about the need to love and welcome them into the church. Pope John Paul II asked \\"the bishops to support, with the means at their disposal, the development of appropriate forms of pastoral care for homosexual persons.” Several assemblies of the Synod of Bishops have struck similar themes, while maintaining that same-sex sexual activity is sinful and that same-sex marriage cannot be permitted. In 2018, in a move regarded as a sign of respect to the community, the Vatican used the acronym LGBT for the first time in an official document. Pope Francis has also spoken out about the need for pastoral care for gay Catholics, adding that God made LGBT people that way. Beginning in the 1960s, a number of organizations have formed to minister to LGBT people. Organizations such as DignityUSA and New Ways Ministry, which advocate for the rights of LGBT Catholics, and Courage International, which encourages gay and lesbian Catholics to be chaste, were established in the United States in response to the push within the United States for greater recognition within the church for gay men and lesbian women. Courage also has a ministry geared towards the relatives and friends of gay people called Encourage. Dissent from church teaching There have been practical and ministerial disagreements within the clergy, hierarchy, and laity of the Catholic Church concerning the church's position on homosexuality. Some Catholics and Catholic groups have sought to adopt an approach they consider to be more inclusive. Dissenters argue that the prohibition on extramarital sex emphasizes the physical dimension of the act at the expense of higher moral, personal and spiritual goals and that the practice of total, lifelong sexual denial risks personal isolation. Other arguments include that the teaching violates \\"the truth of God’s unconditional love for all people\\", and drives \\"young people away from the Church\\". Opponents argue that it is preferable to believe that this element of church teaching is mistaken. The opinion of lay Catholics tends to be more supportive of gay marriage than the hierarchy. Upwards of 70 people have been fired from jobs at Catholic schools or universities because of their marriages to partners of the same sex or, in one case, support for LGBT rights campaigns. When one Jesuit high school refused to fire a teacher after he publicly entered into a gay marriage, the local bishop designated the school as no longer Catholic; the school has appealed his decision. In response to church policy in the area of safe-sex education, AIDS, and gay rights, some gay rights activists have protested both inside and outside of Catholic churches, sometimes disrupting Masses. This includes at the National Shrine in Washington, at an ordination of priests at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, and during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York where they desecrated the Eucharist. Others have splattered paint on churches and drenched an archbishop with water. In 1998, Alfredo Ormando died after setting himself on fire outside Saint Peter's Basilica to protest the church's position on homosexuality. Catholic organizations The Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organisation, has contributed over $14 million, one of the largest amounts in the United States, to political campaigns against same- sex marriage. The Catholic Medical Association of North America has stated that science \\"counters the myth that same-sex attraction is genetically predetermined and unchangeable, and offers hope for prevention and treatment.\\" The Church, however, teaches that sexual orientation is not a choice. Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, has been criticized for describing the church child sex abuse crisis as a \\"homosexual\\" problem rather than a \\"pedophilia\\" problem. Donohue based his claim on the fact that most of the incidents involved sexual contact between men and boys rather than between men and girls. Gay clergy Homosexual clergy, and homosexual activity by clergy, are not exclusively modern phenomena, but rather date back centuries. Donald Cozzens estimated the percentage of gay priests in 2000 to be 23–58%, suggesting more homosexual men (active and non-active) within the Catholic priesthood than within society at large. Instructions from Vatican bodies on admitting gay men to the priesthood have varied over time. In the 1960s chaste gay men were allowed but in 2005 a new directive banned gay men \\"while profoundly respecting the persons in question.\\" Although homosexuality was at variance with Catholic teaching during the Middle Ages, official penalties for homosexual behavior within the clergy, both by the church and temporal authorities, were rarely codified or enforced. Historian John Boswell noted that several bishops in the Middle Ages were thought by their contemporaries to have had gay relationships, and noted a potentially romantic or sexual tone to the correspondence of others with \\"passionate\\" male friends. Some other historians disagree, and say that this correspondence represents friendship. Although homosexual acts have been consistently condemned by the Catholic Church, some senior members of the clergy have been found or alleged to have had homosexual relationships, including Rembert Weakland, Juan Carlos Maccarone, Francisco Domingo Barbosa Da Silveira, and Keith O'Brien. Some Popes are documented to have been homosexual or to have had male sexual partners, including Pope Benedict IX, Pope Paul II, Pope Sixtus IV, Pope Leo X, Pope Julius II and Pope Julius III. Political activity The church has historically been politically active in local, national, and international fora on issues of LGBT rights, typically to oppose them in keeping with Catholic moral theology and Catholic Social Teaching. In various countries, members of the Catholic Church have intervened on occasions both to support efforts to decriminalize homosexuality, and also to ensure it remains an offence under criminal law. The Catholic Church has been described as sending \\"mixed signals\\" regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation: a 1992 teaching said that because sexuality \\"evokes moral concern,\\" sexual orientation is different from qualities such as race, ethnicity, sex, or age, which do not. It added that efforts to \\"protect the common good\\" by limiting rights were permissible and sometimes obligatory, and did not constitute discrimination. The church therefore opposes the extension of at least some aspects of civil rights legislation, such as nondiscrimination in public housing, educational or athletic employment, adoption, or military recruitment, to gay men and lesbians. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published a statement that was characterized by two theologians as claiming that \\"nondiscrimination legislation protecting LGBT people promotes immoral sexual behavior, endangers our children, and threatens religious liberty.\\" It also campaigns against same-sex marriage. Notable lesbian, gay, and bisexual Catholics There have been notable gay Catholics throughout history.. Writers such as Oscar Wilde, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Lord Alfred Douglas, Marc-André Raffalovich, Robert Hugh Benson, and Frederick Rolfe, and artists such as Robert Mapplethorpe, were influenced by both their Catholicism and their homosexuality. Gay Catholic academics such as John J. McNeill and John Boswell have produced work on the history and theological issues at the intersection of Christianity and homosexuality. Some notable LGBT Catholics are or were priests or nuns, such as McNeill, Virginia Apuzzo, and Jean O'Leary, who was a Roman Catholic religious sister before becoming a lesbian and gay rights activist.

Fires in the forest - In April 2007 a wild fire in parts of Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary and the adjoining Nelliampathy forests destroyed hundreds of acres of forest tracts and plantations. One of the reasons for the fires was the lack of pre-monsoon rain in the area. The area used to get rain in during January, February, March and April. In 2007, there was only 4 mm rain in January and after that there was no rain. Nelliampathy was facing an unprecedented drought during that summer. The temperature reached 34 °C in April when the average high is usually 26 °C.Prabhakaran G.

The staff of the tiger reserve engage in picking up these waste materials on a daily basis. Some of these plastic waste are recycled to make keychains, which are sold at the ecoshops located inside the tiger reserve. These key-chains are referred to as \\"Pugmark keychains\\". Demand for expanding the tourism zone - There is pressure from multiple quarters to expand the tourism activities that is currently conducted in the buffer zone of the tiger reserve. This also results in demand for building new roads inside the tiger reserve, which is not an ecologically friendly option. Quarrying in nearby areas - Demand for construction material such as granite has resulted in the destruction of hills and hillocks in the peripheral regions such as Nelliyampathy. A ban on quarrying has been sought in regions such as Muthalamada, Chuliar and Seetharkund.

For several years, he gave the invocation at an annual dinner honoring President Ronald Reagan, and was offered to become the rabbi chaplain of the Senate, an offer he declined. He became widely known for giving public religious benedictions (Brachot) to senior politicians at city council, state legislature, and Congress, where he served as guest chaplain in June 2003, opening the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives with the prayer \\"I stand here today among the jewels of our nation, men and women who are precious, who radiate dedication, and they have been selected as the leaders of our land.\\"Tom Robbins: \\"Rabbi Bunco - An Ally of Senators and Mayors Is Charged With Fraud\\".

In 2004, he was banned from making any contact with prison service officials. As part of the deal with prosecutors of the charity fund pilfering scandal he agreed not to lobby on \\"any matter involving a federal inmate or any other person charged or convicted of a federal crime.\\" Prosecutors alleged that he would ensure favorable prison conditions for Jewish prisoners in exchange for money of donations to his charities.

I haven't accepted his word as God's word yet.\\" Luchins responded that \\"Jewish tradition says that every Jewish soul was at Sinai, and I assume Rabbi Balkany's was there also. We may not have met because he might have been in the back, collecting money.\\" In March 1995, a Rabbinic Court met at Yeshiva University at Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik's suggestion to hear Balkany's charges against Luchins. The court, consisting of three highly respected Yeshiva University Roshei Yeshiva, dismissed all charges against Luchins. =Bob Dole= In 1996 a request for $2.8 million in federal funding for a charitable project Balkany supported was accepted after then-U.S. Senator Bob Dole interceded on its behalf. Dole had been a beneficiary of Balkany's political fundraising and got involved after the proposal had first been rejected by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID).Serge F. Kovaleski: “Dole Fund-Raiser Got Helping Hand; Project Proposal Won Grant After Initial AID Rejection”. The Washington Post, April 8, 1996 The request was in relation to funding to set up computer training programs in Russia, run by the Yeshiva Ohr Torah of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, a controversial rabbi in the Israeli occupied West Bank. Despite the fast-tracking of the payment following an AID meeting with Dole, both Dole and AID denied that there was any excessive influence exacted on the organisation by the then Senate Majority Leader on Balkany's behalf. Balkany subsequently sued Riskin in a Beit Din for $200,000 over non-payment of fees related to his activism on his behalf.Lucette Lagnado: “Dole Emerging at Center Of Dispute Over Yeshiva”. The Forward, January 19, 1996. Riskin argued that he had never asked Balkany to intercede with Dole on his behalf and refused to attend the hearings. =Katherine Harris= In January 2005, there was some controversy over donations made to Katherine Harris by members of Balkany's extended family including the CEO of Agriprocessors. Harris refused to return the donations organised by Balkany after being made aware of the 2003 prosecution against Balkany and the PETA investigation into allegations of animal cruelty at Agriprocessors.Adam C. Smith: “Harris gifts tied to controversial fundraiser - She got 10 $2,000 checks from donors connected to a man known as 'the Brooklyn Bundler'”. St. Petersberg Times, January 27, 2005 =Daycare vouchers= Balkany became a key figure in the distribution of day- care vouchers in New York due to his close ties with Rudy Giuliani and top- aide Bruce Teitelbaum. According to reports in the Daily News, Balkany helped corral for Orthodox Jewish schools more than half the city's total allocation of vouchers.Tom Robbins, Larry Cohler-Esses and Joe Calderone: “Rabbi's big day care coup; B'klyn communities with pull score most vouchers from City”. New York Daily News, January 23, 2000 Balkany offered a full-service operation, charging families a fee to fill out applications for the vouchers, which were in desperate demand all over the city. Nicholas Scoppetta, at the time serving as commissioner for children's services, was sufficiently disturbed by events to refer the matter to the city's Department of Investigation, which opened a probe that was later joined by federal investigators.Somini Sengupta: “Distribution of Vouchers For Day Care Is Scrutinized”. The New York Times, January 30, 2000. Criminal charges and trials=Misappropriation of charitable funds= On August 26, 2003, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that Balkany had been detained on charges that he misappropriated approximately $700,000 in federal grant money.\\"U.S. charges Brooklyn Rabbi in scheme to divert federal grant money intended to aid disabled preschoolers\\", United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, August 26, 2003. Balkany as the President and Director of Bais Yaakov, a Jewish day school in Brooklyn, applied for, in November 1999, and later received a $700,000 Congressional \\"Economic Development Initiative\\" grant administered through the auspices of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. According to the Complaint, he said that the entire grant amount would be used to pay off a mortgage on a building located on the Bais Yaakov property for an entity called \\"the Children's Center of Brooklyn\\" to house educational and therapeutic programs for disabled preschool children. In November 2001, auditors began a preliminary investigation of a number of \\"Economic Development Initiative\\" grants that had been awarded in the New York metropolitan area, including the $700,000 \\"Children's Center\\" grant. In connection with the investigation, auditors allegedly learned that the \\"Children's Center\\" had failed to file any of the regular progress reports required under rules and procedures of the grant. When auditors interviewed Balkany, he insisted the funds had been used to convert a Bais Yaakov building into the \\"Children's Center\\" but he refused to provide the auditors with access to the school's books and records, according to the Complaint.Benjamin Weiser: “Rabbi Accused of Stealing Grant Intended for Disabled Children”. The New York Times, August 27, 2003 Subsequently, investigators obtained records for the Bais Yaakov account at Chase Manhattan Bank into which the grant money had been deposited. Those records reflected that all of the money received from HUD in December 1999 had been withdrawn from the account by early February 2000, a two-month period in which Balkany wrote more than 250 checks drawn against the account. According to the Complaint, further investigation revealed that only one check, for approximately $6000, was used to pay down any of the pending mortgages against the Bais Yaakov property, which at the time of the grant totaled more than $1 million. Balkany diverted the funds to an array of individuals and entities who were not entitled to the earmarked funds. He diverted $300,000 to an Israeli corporation in which his son-in-law was an officer, and another $5,000 to a New York import company run by another son-in-law. He also diverted approximately $80,000 to a variety of other rabbis and Jewish schools and organizations located in Brooklyn. He also wrote out 32 checks against the Bais Yaakov account, totaling approximately $78,000, all made payable to \\"Rabbi Balkany\\" which were subsequently endorsed and either cashed or deposited into a personal account at another bank. He also used thousands of dollars in grant funds to pay for personal items such as life insurance premiums; credit card bills and income taxes. Balkany was charged in the Complaint with theft of government property, filing a false claim, wire fraud and obstruction of justice and released on a bond of $750,000. In a deal with prosecutors in 2004, Balkany agreed to restrictions on his movement, six months probation, full restitution of the monies and admitted that he was wrong in not complying with specific terms of the grant's use. In return the State Prosecutor's Office promised not to pursue the case.Susan Saulny: “Rabbi Will Not Be Prosecuted In Theft of Federal Grant Money”. The New York Times, February 24, 2004. =Hedge fund extortion= On February 18, 2010, Balkany was arrested and charged with extortion, blackmail, wire fraud and making false statements in a Federal Court in Manhattan.Anahad O'Connor: “Rabbi is Charged with Trying to Extort $4 Million from a Hedge Fund”. The New York Times, February 19, 2010. The hedge fund involved was SAC Capital. Balkany received two checks totalling $3.25 million and was arrested shortly after. The complaint filed reported that he claimed that he could prevent a federal prisoner from telling U.S. authorities about alleged insider trading at the firm. According to court records, Balkany told an investigator with U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara′s Manhattan office in a conversation recorded by prosecutors, that SAC had inside tips about two companies which make medical devices and a company which makes molecular diagnostic products. SAC, which has since been riddled with insider trading convictions, had a SAC lawyer alerted prosecutors to the extortion attempt, and a prosecutor said during the trial that Balkany \\"lied\\" and that there was no evidence of illegal trades.“Holder Says Justice Department Probing Wall Street”. San Francisco Chronicle, Bloomberg, November 29, 2010 This was later proven untrue. SAC was involved in multi insider trading convictions and investigations. In February 2011, two former employees were charged with insider trading. Balkany's assertions were further proven correct when in November 2012 federal prosecutors levied charges against additional former SAC Capital traders. Portfolio manager Michael Steinberg was arrested in March 2013 and accused of using inside information to make $1.4 million in profits for SAC Capital. In June 2013 nine former SAC employees were charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. With the conviction of Mathew Martoma on February 6, 2014 after a speedy four week trial, a total of eight former SAC Capital employees have been found guilty. Despite these future disclosers which would support Rabbi Balkany, on November 10, 2010, Balkany was found guilty of all charges.Anahad O'Connor: “Brooklyn Rabbi Is Convicted of Extortion Attempt”. The New York Times, November 10, 2010 On February 18, 2011 he was sentenced to four years in prison.Chad Bray: “Rabbi Given Four Years in Prison in SAC Extortion Attempt”. Wall Street Journal, February 18, 2011 Manhattan federal Judge Denise Cote called Balkany's \\"lack of contrition, remorse and acceptance of responsibility ... profound\\", but gave out a sentence that was less than the seven-plus years recommended under federal guidelines, citing Balkany's \\"lifetime of good works\\" and the \\"generosity of spirit\\" attested to in 87 letters of support. But, considering him a flight risk, she ordered him locked up immediately.Bruce Golding: “Crooked rabbi gets four years for hedge-fund exortion scheme”. New York Post, February 18, 2011 In March 2012 Balkany appealed his conviction, claiming that he should be allowed to present an entrapment defense. The appeal was rejected and the original conviction upheld by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals.Bruce Golding: “Shakedown rabbi loses appeal”. New York Post, March 19, 2012 He was partially released on Wednesday 9/4/13.

Completion of high school was the only prerequisite for admission to a five-year apprenticeship (3 years for those with a university degree). In the spring of 1913, the University of Saskatchewan appointed its first law professor, Arthur Moxon, previously a professor of classics in the University's College of Arts and Sciences. At around the same time, the Law Society of Saskatchewan began offering lectures to articling students in Regina at a school of its own making, later called Wetmore Hall. The following decade would be marked by conflict between the Law Society and the fledgling University law faculty regarding responsibility for legal training in the Province. Ultimately, Wetmore Hall was closed by resolution of the Law Society in 1922 and the University of Saskatchewan inherited full responsibility for the training of aspiring lawyers in Saskatchewan.Beth Bilson, “‘Prudence Rather than Valor’: Legal Education in Saskatchewan 1908-23” (1998) 61 Sask.

Although it shared few design elements with the final production vehicle, it did lend its name to the line.Nick D. \\"1962 Ford Mustang I Concept.\\" supercars.net, April 20, 2016. Retrieved: March 22, 2016.} Design and development Rear view with the engine cover open The original Ford Mustang was a product of the Fairlane Group, a committee of Ford managers led by Lee Iacocca. The Fairlane Group worked on new product needs and, in the summer of 1962, the Group laid out the framework of a new sports car. The automaker made a \\"tentative bid to fill a vacuum between Go-Karts and the Corvette\\" as well as to compete in FIA category 9 (SCCA Class G).\\" Popular Mechanics compared it to the imported MG 1600 Mark II and Sunbeam Alpine Series II sports cars. Designer Eugene Bordinat envisioned a low-cost sports car that would combine roadability, performance, and appearance in a radical layout. Ford designer Philip T. Clark had been working on the low-slung Mustang design in varied forms for years.Leffingwell 2003, p. 43. Bordinat coordinated the development of the styling and oversaw the first drawings into a clay model in three weeks. A wheelbase, front and a rear track were the working dimensions. The body skin was a one-piece unit that was riveted to a space frame. To increase rigidity, the seats were part of the body. The driver could adjust the steering column and clutch/brake/accelerator pedals. Roy Lunn was put in charge as product planner for building the car. His racing car design experience together with his engineering really brought the concept to life. Lunn, working with Herb Misch as the project engineer, \\"designed the chassis to accommodate four-wheel independent suspension, rack and pinion steering, and front disc brakes.\\"http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures--- April/1962-Mustang-Foldout/1962-Mustang-Foldout-07 A lightweight and dimensionally small German Ford Cardinal 1,500 cc 60 degree V4 engine powered the Mustang I. The front-wheel-drive powertrain from Ford Germany's mainstream Cardinal/Taunus sedans was mounted directly behind the cockpit with the engine and 4-speed transmission in a common housing with an axle and conventional clutch. Ford Lead Designer and Executive Stylist John Najjar favored a mid- engined configuration, cooled through two separate radiators on the sides of the car. Najjar also proposed the name \\"Mustang\\" for the concept vehicle. As an aviation enthusiast, Najjar was familiar with the North American P-51 Mustang fighter. He saw some design similarities in the diminutive but sleek profile of the new sports car.Leffingwell 2003, p. 43. The car featured a plastic racing-type windshield and an integral roll bar. Other unique features included a dual-brake line system, telescoping steering wheel, and adjustable foot pedals.http://oldcarbrochures.org/index.php/New-Brochures--- April/1962-Mustang-Foldout/1962-Mustang-Foldout-08 Two versions of the V4 engine were available, an street and a race engine. Racecar builders, Troutman-Barnes of Culver City, California, used the clay and fiberglass body bucks to create an aluminum body. Lunn and his team of engineers finished the prototypes in just 100 days.Leffingwell 2001, p. 15. A total of two cars were built: a detailed, but non-running fiberglass mock-up, and a fully functional car. The \\"exotic was never close to becoming a production car\\" was completed in August 1962. Schematic view of Ford Mustang I =Public debut= The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen, New York on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney lapped the track in a demonstration of the prototype. He reportedly drove the car \\"to 120 ... causing the automotive rumor mill [to begin] churning even faster\\" with reports by Motor Trend that \\"Ford will produce a sports car to compete with the Corvette\\" which was exactly the publicity stunt Lee Iacocca was hoping to achieve. Mueller 2000, p. 21. For the next two years, both Mustang Is appeared at car shows and automotive events as show cars. The model attracted attention, \\"but was too complex for regular production.\\" An unusual use for the cars was to tour colleges as a marketing tool for Ford. After reactions from potential customers and focus groups had demonstrated that the original concept of the Mustang I had limited appeal to the general public, a completely new concept car, the Mustang II, appeared in 1963. With the appearance of this Mustang II concept car, the original \\"Mustang\\" concept car became the Mustang I. Both cars were from Eugene Bordinat's Advanced Design group, which developed 13 Mustang concepts. The original code name for this group of cars was also \\"Allegro\\". One of the cars from this design project actually became known as Allegro. The four-seater Mustang was known beforehand to be the car that would actually be produced for sale using the first generation Ford Falcon platform. Based on a four-seater configuration and using a front-engine layout based on the Falcon, the Mustang II was much more conventional in design and concept and closely resembled the final production variant that would appear in 1964. Nearly the only design element that remained from the original Mustang I were the fake louvers that recreated the radiator scoops of the two-seater. Final disposition The one operational Mustang I was donated to The Henry Ford Museum in 1982. Davis 2014, p. 36. References=NotesCitationsBibliography= * Clark, Holly.

This region, containing a village of the same name, is poetically referred to as the Heart of Šumadija. Geography The Gruža is a micro- region and makes the southern part of the Šumadija region of central Serbia (also called High Šumadija). It is bounded by the West Pomoravlje to the south, the mountain of Gledićke planine and the Levač region to the east, the Takovo and Lepenica regions to the north and the Kotlenik mountain to the west. The central part of the region is the depression of Gruža (Gružanska kotlina; Cyrillic: Гружанска котлина) in the river valley. Due to its geographical location, in the center of Serbia, it is nicknamed the Heart of Šumadija. The region is very fertile and thus almost exclusively an agricultural area. Even though populated by many villages (58 settlements), they all have small population and are increasingly depopulating, despite the land's fertility. Population fell from 23,192 in 1971 (56 inhabitants per km²) to 16,148 in 2002 (only 39 inhabitants per km²), as previously very much developed industries in the nearby towns of Gornji Milanovac, Kraljevo and Kragujevac constantly attracted the manpower from the Gruža region (for example, the density of population in the neighboring Lepenica region, where the city of Kragujevac is located, is over 280 inhabitants per km²). The Gruža river valley in the center of the region is the route for the regional Kragujevac-Kraljevo road and railway.

Owned by Alpha Media, it broadcasts an adult album alternative (AAA) format. Its studios are on Pineview Road in Columbia, while the transmitter tower is located near Bicentennial Park along the Congaree River in downtown Columbia. The station operates an FM translator, W235CH on 94.9 in St. Matthews, South Carolina. History WNOK 1230 AM signed on January 1, 1947 featuring local as well as national programing from the Mutual Broadcasting System. In the early 1950s, WNOK had added a UHF TV station on Channel 67, eventually changing to Channel 19 by the early 1960s. (WNOK-TV was sold by 1977, becoming WLTX.) Also, an FM station on 104.7 was added in 1958, which is where WNOK's call letters reside today. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, WNOK programmed various music genres known then as \\"Block Programming.\\" In the end, Top 40 won out and, by the mid-1960s, it was full-time Top 40. However, after making little headway against WCOS, it tried \\"The Now Sound\\" in 1967, a mix of MOR and light rock/pop. It also affiliated with CBS during that time. In late 1970, it returned to Top 40 and briefly gave WCOS a good run for its money. In 1980, the station changed to country and disco formats under the call letters of WXAP. Neither format lasted more than six months and the WNOK call letters were reclaimed at the end of the year. The station eventually simulcasted parts of WNOK-FM's Top 40 (now known as CHR) format, although much of the remaining broadcast day was still automated under Adult Contemporary and CHR formats. By the fall of 1985, the automation was finally done away with and WNOK was simulcasting full-time with the FM. In the fall of 1987, WNOK dropped the simulcast, becoming an AOR/Classic rock hybrid as \\"Rock 1230\\". However, FM station WMFX signed on shortly afterwards with a similar format, taking away the station's potential audience. In September 1988, the station became \\"Oldies 1230\\" under the WODE call letters featuring an oldies format. Unfortunately, FM WPRH became WOMG in the spring of 1989 with a similar format, again taking away much of the station's audience. In the fall of that year, Price Broadcasting, then-owners of longtime urban contemporary outlet WOIC 1320 AM announced that they were dropping the call letters and format for a simulcast of sister FM, WOMG. In order to prevent any public outcry, arrangements were made with WODE to move the WOIC call letters, format, and staff over to 1230 AM. WOIC spent much of the 1990s as well as the early 2000s under various urban-flavored formats. In 2003, WOIC became an affiliate of ESPN Radio. This lasted until 2005 when the ESPN programming was moved to sister FM station WZMJ and WOIC was re-launched as an Air America Radio affiliate. At times, WOIC's ratings have surpassed WISW's, especially during sporting events, because of the performance of teams on WISW, compared to the performance of teams on WOIC (Clemson Tigers (WOIC) versus Gamecocks). In the 2007 calendar year, teams broadcast on WOIC carried postseason football and basketball coverage; teams broadcast on rival WISW did not, leaving more revenue and higher ratings for these events, which have helped WOIC's ratings against WISW, even though the postseason months are not calculated on Arbitron ratings for the specific days. Until January 25, 2010, WOIC was in a unique position because of the nationally syndicated liberal shows (Air America) that contrasted with the local population. Even though Columbia, South Carolina is relatively progressive compared to the rest of South Carolina, the state is viewed as the 'reddest state' and generally conservative to paleo-conservative with small enclaves of progressives. WOIC's programming was a mix of liberal (progressive) nationally-syndicated Air America shows and locally produced public interest shows. The weekend show lineup was mostly local programming and helped balance the nationally syndicated overall flavor of the station. There were a number of daily center-left local programs that were heard Monday through Friday. WOIC's line-up served the people of Columbia, better than most, because of the amount of local programming and the ability of listeners to be able to interact with the local show hosts. Especially on the weekends, WOIC was 'Friends and Neighbors' radio. Changes began to the lineup on January 25, 2010 due to the bankruptcy filing of Air America. Dr. Gene Garris' Americas Radio Show originated from WOIC. Dr. Garris and frequent co-host Dangerous Doug Kendall talked about American Exceptionalism, liberty issues, 2nd Amendment issues, shooting sports, and the best things about being an American. Randy Eargle was an editor tasked to outdoor activities and shooting sports. The show had local and national guests. The station is owned by Alpha Media through licensee Alpha Media Licensee LLC, which also owns Urban Contemporary WHXT, Urban AC WWDM, Modern rock WMFX, and Hot AC WARQ in the Columbia radio market. In July 2012, \\"The Zone\\", a local afternoon sports show, moved from WZMJ. On December 27, 2013, it was announced that the ESPN Radio format would return to WOIC on January 1, 2014 and the station would be rebranded as \\"ESPN Columbia 1230 AM.\\" On September 30, 2018, WOIC dropped ESPN Radio and began stunting with a loop of Robert Plant's \\"29 Palms\\"' as 94.9 The Palm; on October 1, the station switched to adult album alternative under the same name. On October 11, 2018, WOIC changed their call letters to WPCO.

He also works at the Independent Pro Wrestling Association Wrestling School and has trained several wrestlers who later worked for major promotions. Professional wrestling career Cicero was trained for his career in professional wrestling by former WWF Champion Ivan Koloff. In 1994, he held the Carolina Championship Wrestling Alliance Tag Team Championship as a member of a tag team known as the Country Club along with Steve Storm. Later that year, the teamed with Brian Perry to form the Rat Pack. On November 17, they won a tournament to become the promotion's first tag team champions. On March 25, 1995, they lost the title to the team of Billy Simmons and Sean Powers. They regained it the following month and held it for just short of one year, but their second and final title reign together came to an end when Sean Powers substituted for Cicero in a loss to Guido Falcone and Jimmy Torture. In 1996, he appeared in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), where he formed a tag team with Balls Mahoney in a loss to Spike and Buh Buh Ray Dudley. Cicero also had matches in ECW against Taz and Axl Rotten in 1996 and 1997. In December 1996, Cicero wrestled against Mahoney, who was using the ring name Boo Bradley, in the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation (MEWF), and defeated him to win the MEWF Mid-Atlantic Championship, which Cicero held for six months. He continued to compete for MEWF and held the promotion's Tag Team Championship a total of four times in 1997, three times with Steve Corino and once with Julio Sanchez. In July 1997, he competed for the National Wrestling Alliance's NWA 2000 promotion, where he won a battle royal to become the first NWA 2000 Heavyweight Champion. He held the belt for over five months before a loss to Lance Diamond. In 1997, he wrestled for the West Virginia-based Championship Pro Wrestling. He competed against his former student Christian York and defeated him at the promotion's \\"Hot August Night\\" event. He was also scheduled to compete at a fundraising event at Chantilly High School in Chantilly, Virginia, but it was cancelled due to concerns about the \\"cartoonish stereotyping\\" of gimmicks such as Cicero's \\"Wiseguy\\" persona. Cicero also made his debut with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1997. He wrestled several matches for the WWF as a jobber; this included a handicap match on the January 12, 1998 episode of Raw is War, in which Cicero teamed with Lance Diamond in a loss to Kurrgan. Cicero continued to compete for the WWF until late in 1998. While wrestling on the American Atlantic Coast for the Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance in 1997, Cicero competed in a tournament to determine the promotion's Heavyweight Champion. He made it to the final round but ultimately lost to Salvatore Sincere. He later claimed the belt after defeating champion Lance Diamond on February 19, 1998. He held the belt for almost four months before dropping it to Buddy Landel. He later formed a tag team with Cueball Carmichael, and the pair held the promotion's Tag Team Championship twice in 1998 and 1999. He also appeared regularly in Maryland Championship Wrestling (MCW). He formed a tag team with Julio Sanchez to compete in a tournament for the initial MCW Tag Team Championship. They made it to the final match on August 18, 1998 but ultimately lost to The Headbangers. The following month, Cicero and Sanchez won the title belts by defeating The Headbangers. They held the belts until November, when they dropped them to Stevie Richards and Earl the Pearl. Cicero regained the title the following year, however, while teaming with Romeo Valentine; they held the belts for over four months before losing them to The Bruiser and Jerry Lawler. Cicero also held the promotions's Heavyweight Championship, as he defeated The Bruiser for the title on July 19, 2000. He dropped the belt four months later to Adam Flash; his rivalry over the belt with Flash continued, as Cicero regained it that December before losing it to Flash again in May 2001. While competing for MCW, Cicero also wrestled in the Pennsylvania-based Allied Powers Wrestling Federation (APWF), where he held the APWF Heavyweight Championship for one month in 1999 before dropping it to Stevie Richards. He was also awarded the APWF Television Championship on July 30, 1999, which he held until October 2001. Also in 2000, Cicero teamed with Dino Devine in Atlantic Terror Championship wrestling to hold the promotion's tag team title. The duo won the belts on July 15 and held them until the following January, when they dropped them to the team of Mark Shrader and Gregory Martin. One of the promotions in which he is currently wrestling is Gimmicks Only Extreme Underground Entertainment (GOUGE), a company located in North Carolina in which he has teamed with Eskimo Joe and \\"Boogie Woogie Man\\" Rob McBride. Cicero is also the head trainer of the IPWA Wrestling School; among those trained by Cicero is WWE wrestler Joey Matthews. On December 29, 2012, Cicero was inducted into the MCW Hall of Fame.

It centers on the last days of Ray's own life, who was already known worldwide for his 1955 classic film Rebel Without a Cause. It was screened out of competition at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.  Summary  The film is a collaboration between Wenders and Ray to document Ray's last days due to terminal cancer in 1979. The film is partially an homage to Ray who had a strong influence on Wenders' work, and partially an investigation on life and death. Ray's influence on Wenders includes Ray's \\"love on the run\\" subgenre as well as his film noir photography. The film features excerpts from Ray's movies The Lusty Men and his unfinished final work We Can't Go Home Again. The sequence featuring the former excerpt was shot at Vassar College, at which Ray presented the movie and then gave a lecture, which itself is excerpted. Nicholas Ray appears in a minor role in Wenders' film The American Friend. Wenders' science fiction film Until the End of the World is named for the last spoken words in Ray's 1961 Biblical epic film King of Kings. The film crew is extensively featured onscreen. Jim Jarmusch, Ray's personal assistant at the time — and later a notable film director in his own right — can be briefly glimpsed at the 50:28 mark sitting at an editing console. When Wenders goes to the Vassar campus to attend a lecture, a brief one-man performance is seen on-stage. It is Franz Kafka's story \\"A Report for an Academy\\", about an ape who becomes a man. The American independent film director Jon Jost has recently come out against Wenders' status as the sole co-director, saying that Wenders \\"used his celebrity\\" to push Jost and Raúl Ruiz (director) out of the project that they had been the creators of.

He was the youngest son of Thomas Lenox Napier Sturt, a puisne judge in Bengal for the British East India Company, and Jeanette or Jeannette, née Wilson. One of his older brothers was the Australian explorer Charles Sturt. Evelyn arrived in Australia at the age of 20, and by 21 he was appointed the Commissioner of Crown Lands for all of the new colony. Two years later, he resigned and then overlanded sheep and cattle from Bathurst to Adelaide to take up a large parcel of land as a grazier. Between 1849 and 1878, Sturt served as Police Magistrate and Superintendent of Police in Melbourne. Biography=Early life= Evelyn was educated at the Sandhurst Military College, and in 1836, at the young age of twenty, he migrated to New South Wales, travelling on the Hooghly, a ship of 466 tons which had previously been used as a convict transport vessel and was under the command of George Bayly at that time. Sturt arrived in Sydney on 12 October that year. Making an impression on the authorities, Evelyn was appointed, only 4 months after his arrival, as the Commissioner of Crown lands and was based in Yass from 20 February 1837. Being only 21 years of age he was sometimes referred to as 'the boy commissioner'. =Sheep and cattle farming= Sturt resigned his post as Commissioner of Crown Lands in 1839 and decided to take sheep and cattle overland from Bathurst to Adelaide, at the time a massive distance of 1200 km. His partners in that successful venture were Charles Campbell, James Stein, and a Mr Hardy. After occupying country at Willunga, South Australia in the Mount Lofty Ranges, he took up Compton station in the Mount Gambier district in 1844. Again Evelyn was favoured by the authorities when he was granted ownership of the land in the area ahead of the Henty brothers who, despite also spending five years from 1839 to 1844 dealing with resistance from the Buandig (or Buandik) people, were the original Aboriginal inhabitants of the area., were not granted the land ahead of Evelyn. Although he continued to encounter many difficulties, and left to hold a new position as Police Magistrate in 1849, he did not dispose of the lands until 1853. In 1853, Sturt wrote about the River Murray area, which his explorer brother Charles Sturt had named in 1830: \\"As for the Murray ever becoming an agricultural country, the notion is absurd ... there is hardly a settler on the Lower Murray who can luxuriate in a vegetable.\\" =Duties with the Melbourne Police= While still at Mount Gambier, South Australia, Evelyn was offered and accepted an appointment as the Police Magistrate in Melbourne in 1849. In the following year he accepted the position of superintendent of the Melbourne Police, and attempted to reconcile what he described as the great inefficiency of the District (Melbourne and County of Bourke) Police Force arising from their scattered and isolated stations and a lack of constables of police. Sturt found his troubles to be influenced by various gold rushes, which took a toll on police numbers – indeed he reported in December 1851 that he had lost forty of his fifty staff to resignation. In early 1853, Sir William Mitchell assumed Sturt's position of Superintendent of police and Evelyn was reappointed as magistrate for Melbourne, serving for the next twenty-five years. It appears that he was not afraid of brandishing his authority and in 1854 when he was appointed to the commission of inquiry into the Bentley hotel affair at Ballarat – seen by many to be a precursor to the Eureka Stockade - he recommended dismissal of some corrupt government officers and compensation to some of those who had suffered losses. Evelyn also was appointed as a member of the royal commissions in 1861 that reported on the disastrous Burke and Wills expedition. In 1869, he took a brief leave of absence from his position and returned to England (with his wife) and was present at the death of his brother Charles Sturt who had returned to live in England some 18 years earlier. Evelyn returned to his position but was dismissed in the Black Wednesday retrenchments of January 1878, and then accepting a pension, he left with his wife for England. =Marriage= Evelyn remained unmarried until 36, but then in 1852 he married Mary Frances, who was a daughter of the Church of England Reverend J. C. Grylls. They had no children, and later lived in Brighton, Victoria. =Death= In 1885, when returning to Victoria from another trip to England aboard the Perkin, Evelyn contracted a severe case of bronchitis. He died, aged 69, on 10 February 1885, the day before reaching the Egyptian city of Port Said. Evelyn's body was returned to England for burial. Evelyn County, New South Wales and Sturt Street, Ballarat, Victoria are named in his honour. Memoria Evelyn Creek, New South Wales, was named after Sturt, by his explorer brother, Charles Sturt.

Route description The southern terminus of SR 211 is at a large 3-way junction with US 51 / SR 3 just south southern Dyersburg. SR 211 begins as an unsigned route concurrent with US 51 Business inside the city limits of Dyersburg. SR 211 briefly overlaps with SR 104 near downtown Dyersburg and with US 51 on the north side of the city. The route in this area is mostly a two-lane facility with a few four-lane and five-lane sections with a maximum speed limit of . North of Dyersburg, SR 211 is constructed as a two-lane route and is predominately rural in nature. This route passes through downtown Newbern and intersects SR 77 before continuing north toward Trimble. The northern terminus of SR 211 is at Trimble at a 4-way at-grade intersection with SR 105.

When he tried to drive them back, elves appeared and he had to play the flute for them to dance. They let him go at night but insisted he come back the next day. Next evening, he dropped the flute and stepped on it, and lamented it, telling the elves that it was made from the heart of a cherry tree. The elves offered another cherry tree. He chopped the tree, tricked them into putting their fingers in, and pulled the ax out, so that they were trapped. They told him where to find Mogarzea's soul, and he brought it back to him. Then he and Mogarzea brought the tree with the elves back to Mogarzea's father's court. At court, the boy asked Mogarzea how to marry a fairy of Sweet Milk Lake. Mogarzea told him. He went to the lake and played the flute. A fairy appeared and danced. On the third day, he plucked the rose from her hair and did not give it back, however she pled; so she married him at the emperor's court. But every year they and their children went back to Sweet Milk Lake to bathe.

Published quarterly, it is the trade union recommended magazine for UK union health and safety representatives. Hazards has also jointly developed a NewsWire with LabourStart which provides health and safety news headlines for union websites as an RSS feed. History Hazards was conceived in January 1976 as the Hazards Bulletin by Charlie Clutterbuck, Alan Dalton and Tony Fletcher - all members of the British Society for Social Responsibility in Science (BSSRS) - in response to the introduction of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. The three had been involved in the production of the BSSRS magazine Science for People (SfP), which \\"provided brief coverage of topical science matters from a radical standpoint as well as reporting on the work of BSSRS\\", and increasingly found themselves addressing organised labour events on the subject of industrial hazards. Clutterbuck said later: \\"We recognised that there was a lot of different people becoming more interested in health and safety matters, because it was more \\"political\\". We saw health and safety at the very core of the crunch between capital and labour. We wanted those people to keep connected with each other and thought a magazine may help.\\" The title of the magazine was inspired by the book The Hazards of Work: How to Fight Them (1974; Pluto Press) by Patrick Kinnersley. Following publication of his book Asbestos: Killer Dust (1979; BSSRS) Dalton was successfully sued for libel in 1984 by Robert Murray, a former medical adviser to the Trades Union Congress. In the book Dalton had criticised Murray's pro- asbestos industry views and claimed that they were contrary to his position within the union movement. Although Murray was only awarded £500 damages, Dalton's legal costs of £30,000 bankrupted Hazards Bulletin. The magazine relaunched under the truncated title Hazards the same year. Recognition Hazards is the winner of The Work Foundation Workworld Media Award 2007 and 2008 for online journalism. The judges commended the magazine for its \\"depth and seriousness, and its spiky determination to campaign for those at the rough end of working life.\\" In 2008, US occupational safety magazine EHS Today named Hazards editor Rory O’Neill one of the 50 most influential health and safety leaders of the last decade. O'Neill is a professor of occupational and environmental policy research at the University of Liverpool and the occupational health and workplace safety adviser for the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), representing global unions on a number of UN panels.

A stockwhip is a type of whip made of a long, tapered length of flexible, plaited leather or nylon with a stiff handle the thong able to piviot along the handle easily. Stock whips are used when mustering cattle.''  Origin and uses  The Australian stockwhip is said to have originated from the English hunting whip, but has evolved into an entirely new type of whip. It was designed to move mobs of cattle by making it crack, which would encourage the mob to keep moving. It is not usually used for sheep. Throughout Australia stockmen and drovers have used the stockwhip since the early 19th century and it is still the preferred whip used by Australian cattlemen and women today. The stockwhip is part of most mounted stockmen’s equipment and may be used to keep in contact with other riders, as a weapon against a snake, to lead a horse or dog, or as a counter - by tying one knot for every one hundred head of livestock counted. A stockwhip is part of the regulation equipment in stockman challenges and some Australian Stock Horse events. Competitions known as a \\"stockman’s chop\\" are held in which a rider must canter down a row of pegs with paper pieces attached and \\"chop\\" these pieces off with the whip. Whipcracking events are a popular form of competition for juniors through to the older family members.  Composition of an Australian stockwhip  Unlike the American equivalent (Florida Cow Whip which is made of inexpensive nylon) an Australian stockwhip is usually made of redhide or sometimes greenhide leather but can also be made of kangaroo hide. Because a kangaroo is a native animal, and cattle are a lot cheaper and abundant, kangaroo hide stockwhips are more expensive. Only the most expensive whips are made from kangaroo hide and they often have a fully plaited handle. Kangaroo hide allows the whip maker to produce the fine plaits for which the kangaroo leather stockwhip is renowned.  Sizes of Australian Stockwhips  The size of Australian stockwhips are measured by the length of the thong (length doesn't include stock, keeper, fall or cracker). Australian stockwhips can be as short as 3 feet (child's whip) or as long as 10 feet (3 metres). The standard Australian stockwhip is 6 feet (1.8 metres) long. Stronger people generally prefer a larger and heavier whip to be used on horseback.Charlton & Co. Pty Ltd, 1983 Catalogue Small and light whips that are designed for crowded environments such as cattle yards are called yard whips. Yard whips are swift and easy to use.  Parts of an Australian Stockwhip  Stockwhip Parts The five parts of the Australian Stockwhip are the stock (the handle), the keeper, the thong, the fall and the cracker. =The stock= The stock is usually made of cane and usually has a part plaited leather grip. The stock of an Australian stockwhip is usually longer than the bullwhip. The most noticeable difference between a bullwhip and an Australian stockwhip is that the handle of a stockwhip is not integrated into the thong. Instead the handle is attached to the thong by a keeper, to stop the thong from slipping off. The advantages of this design are many but is mainly that the stock can be easily replaced if it falls off but some times it may be hard to put on if it falls of. = The keeper = The keeper is the part of the whip that connects the stock to the thong. The keeper is made of a wide strip of leather passing over the end of the whip handle. It loops through end of the thong and is then joined to the stock. = The thong = The thong is the long, plaited section of whip. Redhide whips are usually made of four plaits due to ease and speed of construction but some people prefer 6 plait. A kangaroo hide whip is made, usually, with 8 or 12 plaits, but can be made even finer by cutting the strands narrower prior to construction. This doesn't make a better whip, just a finer and more costly one. The thong is the part of a stockwhip that is measured. =The fall= The fall is a single piece of tapered rawhide or redhide leather which is about 60 centimetres (24 inches) long and attached to the end of the thong. The fall suffers the most wear and tear of the whip because the movement of a whip is faster towards the end due to the whip's tapered design. The fall is weaker than the thong because it only a single strand (not plaited). It is essential for a whip owner to have a decent, high quality fall attached to their whip. =The cracker= A cracker, part of a stockwhip The cracker (in the US called a popper), is a twisted piece of short rope (approx 10 cm) with a frayed end. The cracker is essential and keeps the whip in good condition, and also aids in producing the crack. A cracker is frequently replaced, according to need and the discretion of the whip user, and may be made of cord or horsehair. Crackers are often made from hay band (also known as baling twine) which is easy to find and make into a cracker, and is also a cheap alternative to buying a pre-made cracker. Cracking techniques The main techniques used when whipcracking are the cattleman's crack and round yard. The sound is created when the velocity of the cracker breaks the sound barrier and creates a sonic boom. The cracker at top speed can achieve more than three times the speed of sound. =Cattleman's crack= The whip is swung backwards over the shoulder and then forward. =Over-Head Crack= The whip cracker spins the whip anti-clockwise (if right-handed) over his or her head. When the whip is approximately 90 degrees to the right of the whip cracker, he or she swings the whip in the opposite direction. It is one of the simplest techniques, yet it can be one of the loudest used in whip cracking.  References Further reading The Aussie stock whip Text and words by a retailer demonstrating how R. M.

Fleming is often confused with his contemporary, Judge William Fleming, who also served in the Virginia legislature (but from Cumberland County in the middle of the Commonwealth) and who was a delegate to the Continental Congress.Gordon, Armistead C., Jr. \\"William Fleming\\". Dictionary of American Biography Early and family life This William Fleming was born in Jedburgh, Scotland in the Kingdom of Great Britain on February 7, 1727.Edmund P. Goodwin, Colonel William Fleming of Botetourt (Roanoke: Progress Press 1976) p.3 explains how an Act of Parliament in 1751 changed the English calendar to begin on January 1 rather than March 25, leading to massive confusion in dates applicable to children born in the first quarter of the year. His parents were Leonard and Dorthea Saterthwaite Fleming, who lived on Lake Windermere and registered four children in the Hugil Parish records and in Edinburgh. William Fleming studied in Dumfries with Mr. Trotter, then apprenticed with a surgeon for three years in Dumfries and Kirkudbright, then worked with an apothecary in Kendall, where he survived the measles and reportedly avoided the revolt of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and the disastrous defeat at Culloden. In 1746, Fleming began formal study of medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He then entered the Royal Navy, supposedly serving as a surgeon's mate and surviving capture and imprisoned by the Spanish. After his release, Fleming resigned from the navy and emigrated to Virginia.Goodwin pp. 4–5 notes that no archive indicates Fleming graduated, nor was commissioned, nor held captive, only that he said he arrived in Virginia in July 1755, but that the Nansemond County Upper Parish Vestry book indicates Dr. William Fleming received payments from 1751 to 1754 During leave in Staunton, Virginia in 1761, Fleming met Anne Christian (1744–1810), daughter of Col. Israel Christian (a wealthy landowner and the county's representative in the Virginia House of Burgesses) and his wife Elizabeth Starke. They married in 1763 and soon agreed to care for George Helvick, a three-year-old orphan. Their first son would be named Leonard Israel Fleming to honor his grandfathers. Their longest surviving daughter, variously known as Annie or Nancy C. Fleming Baxter (1801–1870) would marry the president of Washington College and later Hampden-Sydney College, Rev. George A. Baxter (1772–1841). Career During the French and Indian War, Fleming was commissioned an ensign in Williamsburg, Virginia. He initially became the surgeon for Captain McKenzie's company, then recruited for Captain Bell's company, and finally joined Captain Hog's company as its surgeon. Capt. Hog's company was assigned to protect Fort Dinwiddie near Warm Springs as part of George Washington's Virginia Regiment and was told to rendezvous with experienced scouts in Augusta Court House before heading further into the Appalachian Mountains. Fleming served as a surgeon under Major Andrew Lewis, and experienced many attacks by the Shawnee, as well as severe clothing and food supply problems during what became known as the \\"Sandy Creek Voyage,\\" because they reached the headwaters of the Clinch River and the streams that form the Big Sandy River. Weathering problems in accessing his promised bonus for serving as the unit's surgeon, Fleming received a promotion to Second Lieutenant the following spring, although Capt. Hog was demoted after complaints at Fort Vaux. By fall, surgeon Fleming was assigned to Lewis' headquarters at Fort Dickenson on the Cowpasture River near present Millboro,https://www.northamericanforts.com/East/vanorwest.html but his request to transfer to the regular army was ignored. In 1758, he accompanied Major Lewis and Virginia troops northward in what became known as the Forbes expedition, after General John Forbes, who assembled many colonial troops at Raystown, Pennsylvania north of Fort Cumberland and attacked the French at Fort Duquesne. Fleming continued to participate in the Anglo-Cherokee War in 1759–1761. =Medicine and real estate= Historic marker in Staunton, Virginia. When the war ended in 1763, Miller settled at Staunton, Virginia, and practiced medicine. Although a Presbyterian rather than a member of the Church of England, he was elected to the Augusta parish vestry in 1764, indicating his rising social status after his marriage, as well as his community involvement (the vestry being responsible for providing social services in the county). In May 1765, his social position had increased further and he was elected to his first political office, as justice of the peace, on the same day as he increased his real estate holdings by purchasing 560 acres from William Beverley.Goodwin pp. 20–21 In 1768 Fleming retired from medicine in Augusta County and moved southward with other settlers and built \\"Belle Mount\\" or \\"Belmont\\" on land his father-in-law gave him in the Roanoke Valley. These gifts, his medical practice, and his further investments in land individually and through the Loyal Company of Virginia eventually made Fleming wealthy. In 1769 he acquired his first indentured servant, and the following year Botetourt County was split from what had been the vast Augusta County. Fleming became a justice of the peace in the new county, and later justice of the county court, which eventually ordered the establishment of a Court House. Soon, the Virginia General Assembly authorized a subdivision around the courthouse which became the Town of Fincastle, and the county seat.Goodwin pp. 23–25 Militia service In Dunmore's War (1774), Colonel Fleming led the Botetourt County militia along with other troops under the guidance of the experienced Col. Andrew Lewis at the Battle of Point Pleasant. Fleming continued to lead his men after being shot twice. However, a third, more serious wound forced his withdrawal. The musket ball that lodged in his chest was never removed and often caused him pain. The Virginia General Assembly awarded him £500 in compensation. He never fully recovered, so that lingering wound prevented his military service in the American Revolutionary War.Hoyt, William D., \\"Colonel William Fleming in Dunmore's War, 1774\\" – Journal of West Virginia History (Volume 3, No. 2 (January 1942), pp. 99–119) Political career A patriot nonetheless, Fleming remained active in politics during the American Revolution, representing a western district as a member of the Senate of Virginia. He succeeded his brother-in-law William Christian and in turn was succeeded by him in 1779 so Fleming could address matters in the mountains.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619–1978 (Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 127, 132, 136 However, Fleming continued his political involvement as a member of the Governor's Council. In January 1781, British forces invaded Virginia and scattered the remaining Virginia legislators from Richmond, as well as forced governor Thomas Jefferson to flee into the mountains. When the legislature reconvened at Staunton, Jefferson's term had expired, and so Fleming, as senior member of the Virginia Council present, acted unofficially as governor. He served in this capacity from June 4 to 12, when the reconvened legislature elected Thomas Nelson as the next governor. During this brief time, Fleming called out the Virginia militia to oppose the British invasion by Benedict Arnold, Banastre Tarleton and others. The legislature retroactively legalized his actions.The statutes at large: being a collection of all the laws of Virginia, Virginia resolution from June 23, 1781 legalizing Fleming's actions as governor. For this reason, Fleming is listed as the third governor of the commonwealth.Selby, John E. The Revolution in Virginia, 1775–1783. Williamsburg, VA: Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, 1988. During and after the War for Independence, Fleming headed commissions to Kentucky to settle land disputes and attend to other official business, including auditing the accounts of various officials in the new state's western region as the war ended. In 1780, the General Assembly formally abolished Kentucky County (which he represented alongside neighboring counties) and established Fayette, Jefferson and Lincoln Counties. In 1784 Fleming attended one of the conventions held in Danville, Virginia, which paved the way for Kentucky's separation from Virginia. His final public service was as one of Botetourt County's two delegates to the 1788 Virginia Ratifying Convention (alongside Martin McFerran).Leonard, p. 172 Although Fleming had reservations about the new U.S. Constitution, he voted in favor of ratification as his constituents had instructed.Grigsby, Hugh Blair.

William Fleming died at his home on August 5, 1795, and was buried in the family graveyard in what decades later became Hollins, Virginia.Goodwin pp. 69–70 His widow would rest beside him in 1810, and become the namesake of the Nancy Christian Fleming Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Their daughter Annie would marry a prominent Presbyterian clergyman, Rev. George Baxter, who presided over Washington College (under the supervision of this Fleming and other trustees), although only his widow ultimately survive the American Civil War in Lexington, Virginia, not very far from where her parents had courted.

In particular, the United States feared that victories by communist forces would cause South America to become isolated from the United States if the governments of the Central American countries were overthrown and pro- Soviet communist governments were installed in their place. Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, the United States often pursued its interests through puppet governments and the elite classes, whose members tended to ignore the demands of the peasant and working class. In the aftermath of the Second World War and continuing into the 1960s and 1970s, Latin America's economic landscape drastically changed. The United Kingdom and the United States both held political and economic interests in Latin America, whose economy developed based on external dependence. Rather than solely relying on agricultural exportation, this new system promoted internal development and relied on regional common markets, banking capital, interest rates, taxes, and growing capital at the expense of labor and the peasant class. The Central American Crisis was, in part, a reaction by the lower classes of Latin American society to unjust land tenure, labor coercion, and unequal political representation. Landed property had taken hold of the economic and political landscape of the region, giving large corporations much influence over the region and thrusting formerly self-sufficient farmers and lower-class workers into hardship. Countries=Nicaragua= Contra rebels marching through Jinotega in 1985 The Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) overthrew the 46-year-long Somoza dictatorship in 1979. However, the United States opposed the Nicaraguan revolution due to their communists sympathies and support from Castro's Cuba, and backed an anti-left wing Counter-revolutionary rebellion against the Sandinista government. =El Salvador= Fought between the military-led government of El Salvador and the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), a coalition or umbrella organization of five left-wing militias. Over the course of the 1970s, significant tensions and violence had already existed, before the civil war's full outbreak. The United States supported the Salvadoran military government and supplied them with 4 billion dollars, trained their military elites, and provided them with arms over the course of a decade. Israel also actively supported the government forces and was El Salvador's largest supplier of arms from 1970 to 1976. The conflict ended in the early 1990s. Between 75,000 and 90,000 people were killed during the war. =Guatemala= Memorial to the victims of the Río Negro massacres Following a CIA-backed coup ousting Jacobo Arbenz in 1954, civil war ensued in Guatemala between 1962 and 1996. In Guatemala, the Rebel Armed Forces (FAR) fighting against the government were based exclusively in rural areas, and were made up of a large peasant and indigenous population. They ran a multifaceted operation and led an armed mass struggle of national character. Guatemala saw an increase in violence in the late 1970s, marked by the 1978 Panzós massacre. In 1982 the resurgent guerrilla groups united in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity. The presidency of Efraín Ríos Montt (1982-1983), during which he implemented a strategy he called \\"beans and bullets\\", is widely considered the war's turning point. The Guatemalan government and the severely weakened guerrillas signed a peace agreement in December 1996, ending the war. Over 200,000 people died over the course of the civil war, disproportionately indigenous people targeted by the Ríos Montt headed military. On 10 May 2013, Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide and sentenced to 80 years in prison. =Honduras= Going into the Central American Crisis, Honduras's economy was framed by stagnating agricultural production, de-industrialization, deteriorating terms of trade, the continuing problems of the Central American common market, the decline of international financial reserves, salary decline, and increasing unemployment and underemployment. Honduras, like El Salvador, was increasingly dependent on economic assistance from the United States. In Honduras, efforts to establish guerrilla movements foundered on the generally conservative attitude of the population. Nevertheless, fears that the civil wars wracking its neighbors might spread to the country led to the killings and disappearances of leftists, spearheaded by the army's Battalion 316. Relatively stable Honduras became a key base for the Reagan administration's response to the crisis. US troops held large military exercises in Honduras during the 1980s, and trained thousands of Salvadorans in the country. The nation also hosted bases for the Nicaraguan Contras.

A common legacy of the Central American crisis was the displacement and destruction of indigenous communities, especially in Guatemala where they were considered potential supporters of both the government and guerilla forces. Peace efforts Several Latin American nations formed the Contadora Group to work for a resolution to the region's wars. Later, Costa Rican President Óscar Arias succeeded in convincing the other Central American leaders to sign the Esquipulas Peace Agreement, which eventually provided the framework for ending the civil wars.

Stanfield was a complete forward, capable of scoring with either foot and his head. He was also comfortable playing as centre-forward, inside-left or inside-right. He was the most capped international footballer during the 19th century, Ireland’s record goalscorer during the 19th century and remains the most capped Distillery player of all time. Club career Stanfield joined Distillery in 1886 from Genoa FC and by the end of the decade had scored over 90 goals. During the 1889–89 season he scored hat-tricks in four consecutive games and helped Distillery win an Irish Cup/County Antrim Shield double. During the 1890s Stanfield became a Distillery legend, making 147 competitive appearances and scoring at least 105 goals. He scored at least seven hat- tricks during the 1890s and scored the winner in the 1894 Irish Cup final. He also scored the winner in a play-off for Irish League title in 1896, helping Distillery win a treble. By the time he retired, Stanfield had played 181 competitive games for Distillery, scoring 178 goals. He also played in a further 115 friendlies, scoring a further 62 goals. During his career at Distillery, his team mates included fellow Irish internationals Billy Crone and Jack Reynolds. International career Stanfield made his international debut for Ireland on 5 February 1887, aged 17 years and 344 days, in a 7–0 defeat to England at Bramall Lane, Sheffield. Stanfield scored his first goal for Ireland in 4–1 against Wales on 19 February 1887. This was also Ireland’s first ever win. On 7 February 1891, Stanfield scored four goals in a 7–2 win over Wales and as a result became the first Irish player to finish as top scorer in a British Home Championship. During the 1894 championship, Stanfield scored three goals in successive internationals. The highlight of the three came on 3 March 1894 at the Solitude Ground in Belfast, when after thirteen attempts Ireland finally avoided defeat to England. Against an England team that included Fred Spiksley and Jack Reynolds, who had since switched allegiances, Stanfield’s goal inspired Ireland to come back from 2–0 down to gain a 2–2 draw.

It is located the Haßberge Nature Park. Origin of name =Houses of Springs= Josef Braun explains the name Brennhausen in his place-names book as \\"the houses by a water source\\", meaning, in this case, a spring. Braun bases his statement on the fact that immediately next to the settlement, a stream springs forth which flows into the river Saale. Braun discovered that the form Brenn- is a written form, changed from the spoken dialect, which is based on the old form Brünn. =Houses of Brunicho= Dr. Heinrich Wagner presents a very different view in his Historischen Atlas von Neustadt/Saale (Historical Atlas of Neustadt/Saale). Wagner believes that the origination of the name had nothing to do with the houses by a water source, but rather that the name of the estate is derived from the old German given name, Brunicho. Under this scenario, the founder of Brennhausen used his own name, as was the custom of that time, for the naming of Brunechenhusen. Officially documented The first known mention of Brennhausen in an official document was in the year 1182. In this document, Graf Poppo von Henneberg, (VI?) leased to his faithful Wolfram, among others, a tenth of Brunechenhusen. On 29 August 1237, Graf Poppo von Henneberg VII declared that his vassals \\"Deynodapifer and Theodericus, so-called von Blanckenberg,\\" must repair the damage done to the Brunechenhusen property when it was unjustly withheld from the abbot and the Bildhausen convent. Truchseß von Brennhausen Probable order of construction Truchseß von Brennhausen coat of arms in courtyard The Truchseß von Brennhausen is a genealogical branch of the Truchessen von Wetzhausen which descends from a Hans Truchseß (1260–1330). He had holdings in Wetzhausen, Brennhausen, Sternberg and Essfeld. In the official property record book of the Bishop of Würzburg, Gottfried III von Hohenlohe, with records from 1317 to 1322, it was written that one Truchseß von Blankenberg, and possibly the so-called Hans Truchseß, had holdings in Brennhausen. In another record book of the Prince-Bishop Albrecht von Hohenlohe, used from 1345–1372, it was written in 1345: “Johannes Truchseß von Alsleben owns also a tenth of Gabolshausen, a tenth of Poppenhausen, a half-tenth of Ermershausen, a tenth of Brennhausen, and a half-tenth of Maroldsweisach.” In 1343, Hans Truchseß was mentioned in a directory of Wetzhausen. It was written: “Notation regarding Mr. Hansen Truchseß, soul of a knight of Brünnhausen and his wedded wife. Owned Wetzhausen, Brünnhausen, Eßfeld and part of zu Sternberg.” His four Sons inherited these four places after his death and started four independent lines which later branched out even more. Diez, the actual founder of the Wetzhausen line, was given by his father, Hans, all of Wetzhausen and one third of Brennhausen. Hans Truchseß the Younger (1309–1370) received two thirds of the Brennhausen holdings and part of Sternberg. Hanns had his residence in Brennhausen. Brennhausen remained in the Truchseß family until 1542 when Georg Truchseß died with a brief intermission around 1500. Anna, daughter of Philipp Truchseß took Brennhausen into a marriage with Hans von Berlichingen, a vassal of Wilhelm Count von Henneberg. After Hans von Berlichingen death, Anna sold Brennhausen to pay her husband’s debts and Brennhausen ended up with Dietz Truchseß. Bauernkrieg and the Burning of Brennhausen Both documentation and physical evidence strongly suggest that Brennhausen burned in 1525 during the Bauernkrieg or Peasants (or Farmers) Revolt. The beams of the roof and the entrance to one of the cellars date from right after 1525. Stone work also suggests that the floor levels changed at some point. Also G.P. Höhn in his 1747 Lexicon Topographicum states that the peasants set fire to it in 1525. 1542-1681 Coat of arms in courtyard of Hans Günther von Brennhausen and his second wife, Felicitas Agnes Leschin von MülheimIn 1587 Brennhausen was occupied by Georg Wilhelm von Kotzau. By 1593, the Truchseß family were back at Brennhausen. In 1619, the brothers Otto, Heinrich and Adam von und zu Bastheim along with Georg Wilhelm and Veit Ulrich Truchseß von Wetzhausen purchased Brennhausen for 24,597 gulden. =Günther von Brennhausen family= In 1642, a Franz Günther, a simple farmer's son from Kützberg by Schweinfurt, was ennobled with the family name “Günther von Brennhausen” and given the fief of Brennhausen from the Bishopric of Würzburg. From 1635 to 1647, Franz was the Commandant of the fortress at Königshofen. Franz’ son Hans, also a distinguished military man, received Brennhausen. Hans and his second wife Felicitas Agnes Leschin von Mülheim coat of arms are in the courtyard. The transfer to their minor son, Johann Georg Hartmann Günther von Brennhausen, upon Hans' death was held up in court in part due to Felicitas Agnes being protestant. The 1675 case was eventually won in 1679 and invested in 1680, only to have Johann Georg Hartmann pass away in 1681. Photo (c.1950) of coat of Arms of the Bibra family in inner courtyard 1681 - present: Brennhausen goes to Bibra family In 1681, the von Bibra family received Brennhausen instead of Burgwallbach as part of an out of court settlement of a lawsuit dating from 1602 when the Prince Bishop Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn refused to transfer family fiefs between cousins. This type of transfer was routine but during the Counter Reformation, the bishop refused a transfer to the Protestant cousins. Initially a fief to the Bibra family, it was converted to personal ownership after the end of feudalism and in 2002 transferred to the Stiftung Brennhausen (Foundation) by the family. =Seifert/Seyferhold incidents= Ludwig Ernst von Bibra who moved to Brennhausen and married his housekeeper, Katharine Seifert on 22 October 1734. She was the daughter of a linen weaver and a midwife in Rentwerthausen which is a village next to Bibra. In 1736 they had a son, Friedrich Gotthelf and in 1739 a second son, Karl. On 8 February 1740 Katherine was raised to the nobility by Emperor Karl VI and given the name von Seyferhold. Only five months later (16 July 1740) Ludwig Ernst died and his cousin at Bibra, Johann Philip seized Brennhausen by force and dispossessed the widow and her two children. She appealed to the Imperial Court (Reichshofrat) and twelve years later on 28 April 1752 she won an order from the court that Johann Philip must return the property to her sons and pay damages. When Johann Philip children died without children, Bibra was transferred to Katharine’s younger son Karl own son, Karl Friedrich.WILHELM FRHR.

Brennhausen the Village In past centuries there were more houses at Brennhausen. Anton Rottmayer in Statistisch- topographisches handbuch für den Unter-Mainkreis des königreichs Bayern published in 1830 describes Brennhausen as having: one castle, seven residences, one mill with two mill stones, ten families, 56 residents, 22 Catholics, 34 Protestants with the Protestants going to Sulzdorf for church and school and the Catholics going to Obereßfeld. In 1832, Johann Wilhelm Rost, described fifty-one inhabitants in twelve families lived at Brennhausen. Ten of them were Catholic, thirty-six Lutheran, and five Jewish. The Catholics went to church in Untereßfeld and the Lutherans in Sulzdorf. Until 1848, Brennhausen had original jurisdiction over its own affairs. In 1915 (WWI), Brennhausen had six residences besides the castle but only two were inhabited. The other four were dilapidated.

As it is with many Lebanese towns, its mosques embrace the churches and similarly its residents where they stand by each other at every occasion. The village name combines the Syriac words aitha, meaning temple, and foukhar, meaning pottery. Together they refer to a pottery production center. The mountain to the north of the village is steep and not useful for agriculture. To the east and south, the mountains have gentle slopes, and terraces are formed to use the land for agriculture. People cultivate several products including wheat, mulberries, cherries, figs, apples, grapes and olives. Water sources are available mainly from springs such as Ain el-Arish. Until the present, the inhabitants of the village partially depended on this spring as a source of water. Water and a pleasant climate would have been attractive reasons for the settlement of the village in the early A.C. periods. Many of Aita el-Foukhar's residents have left for bigger cities in Lebanon while some still live in Aita. Others have emigrated to North and South America, Australia, Africa, Middle East, Europe, and many other places in the world. Between 1975 and 1990, only minor developments were recorded due to the unstableness of the circumstances. In 1998 the first municipality council was elected and a major development on the infrastructure was started. A new sewage system was installed as a part of regional West Bekaa and Rachaya districts Network. As for the drinking water system, a new well was dug with a capacity of 3 inches per minute, and a public water tank was built on a higher location to feed the 200 houses of the village with drinking water. A huge water filter was installed as well after the tank to ensure a clean water to the inhabitants of Aita. A new network of 6 miles of water tubes was installed to deliver the drinking water to houses.

Its students come from all over Lebanon, as well as the Middle-East and around the world. With two campuses, one in the Lebanese capital Beirut and the other in the urban hillsides (Ain Aar), the school educates over 3,500 students each year. The school was established in 1891 and is chartered in Massachusetts, US. The Vision of International College is to inspire learners of today to be global citizen leaders of tomorrow. History The International College was founded in Smyrna (now İzmir), Turkey in 1891, by Alexander MacLachlan, a Canadian educator, as the American Boys’ School. The first class of five students graduated in 1895, and it was renamed the American Collegiate Institute for Boys. In 1913, IC opened an elementary school, and added the French language Section Secondaire in 1926. In 1936, Dr. Bayard Dodge of the American University of Beirut invited IC to come to Beirut and affiliate with AUB as its preparatory school. As a result, IC was known for many years as \\"The Prep.\\" During its first year in Beirut, IC welcomed 901 students from 37 countries representing 16 religious sects. IC welcomed students from all over the Middle East, who came as boarders living in Thomson and Sage Halls. IC separated from AUB in the 1960s, naming a separate board of trustees and admitted women to become a co-educational institution. During the Lebanese Civil War under the leadership of Dr. Alton Reynolds, students and teachers of all religious sects continued to attend classes in Ras Beirut. It evolved to become a leading institution of education in the Middle East with the inspiration of some exemplary Directors such as Mr. Sadik Umar and Mr. Elie Kurban. In 1988, a satellite campus was constructed in Ain A’ar, far from Beirut, to accommodate the children of alumni in that area. The Ain A’ar campus continues to serve students from pre- school through middle school. In 1997, IC achieved dual accreditation by the Council of International Schools and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Schools The early childhood program in the Preschool addresses the whole child through an integrated approach and aims to develop a close relationship between educators, parents and classmates. The learning environment provides a warm, friendly and joyful atmosphere which advocates itself to learning through inquiry. All content is taught using the target languages of Arabic, English and French and works within the PYP curricular framework. The Elementary School covers grades one through five (ages six to eleven). The medium of instruction is either English or French, although Arabic is mandatory for all students. An Arabic program is made available in IC to students who have lived abroad and qualify for exemption from the regular programs. The Middle School is a four-year cycle covering grades 6 through 9. It offers three programs: the Lebanese Program prepares students for the official Lebanese Brevet examination; the College Preparatory Program is an English medium non-Brevet program; and the French Program is non-Brevet program taught in French that prepares the student for the official French Baccalaureate examination. All programs require the teaching of Arabic, English, French, Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, Physical Education, Arts, Information Technology (IT), Music and Theatre Courses. Grades 6,7, and 8 also receive Technology instruction. 1 The Secondary School is a three-year cycle made up of four separate programs: The Lebanese Baccalaureate Program which follows a curriculum set by the Lebanese Ministry of Education; The French Baccalaureate Program which follows a curriculum set by the French Ministry of Education; the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Program; and The American College Preparatory Program (CPP), a non-baccalaureate diploma program. IC's Ain Aar campus holds two schools. The Lower School for students from nursery to Grade 3 and the Upper School for students from Grade 4 to Grade 9 inclusive. Both Ain Aar schools follow the same curriculum as applied in the Ras Beirut campus.  Secondary School programs  The Lebanese Baccalaureate Program, which follows a curriculum set by the Lebanese Ministry of Education, is available to all students in either an English or French track for core subjects including math and sciences. In the French track, English is taught as a third language and vice versa. In both tracks, Social Studies, History, Geography, Civics, Sociology and Economics, are taught in Arabic with the study of Arabic literature and language mandatory. In the second year, students chose a focus in humanities or sciences, and specialize in the third year. The French Baccalaureate Program, which follows a curriculum set by the French Ministry of Education, is designed to meet the needs of foreign and Lebanese students who wish to pursue the French Baccalaureate. All core subjects are taught in French. Upon successful completion of the Lebanese or French Baccalaureate program, students are eligible to enter at the sophomore level in all Lebanese and many European and North American universities. Some students pursue both the Lebanese and French Baccalaureate simultaneously. See Secondary education in France. The International Baccalaureate Program is a two-year curriculum with an assessment component. The IB diploma is recognized by universities around the world. Students admitted to the IB program must hold a second nationality in addition to Lebanese, or must obtain an exemption from the Lebanese official program allowing them to engage in a non-Lebanese program. A good knowledge of English is a prerequisite as it is the language of instruction and also a school average of around a 79. The \\"College Preparatory Program\\" is a two-year curriculum designed on the American High school System. Students admitted into this program must hold a foreign passport. Courses taken are extensive and rigorous. Calculus, micro and macroeconomics, and worldwide literature are some of the things taught in courses such as Math, Biology, Economics, Global Issues, English, Arabic, French, Art, Music, Physical Education, and History.  Community Service Program  Participation in the Community Service Program is mandatory for all IC Secondary School students. Students select two community projects per year, ranging from helping to raise awareness of environmental issues, volunteer at orphanages, and centers for the aged, infirmed and disabled.

The Fallen Soldier Battle Cross, Battlefield Cross or Battle Cross is a symbolic replacement of a cross, or marker appropriate to an individual service-member's religion, on the battlefield or at the base camp for a soldier who has been killed. It is made up of the soldier's rifle stuck into the ground or into the soldier's boots, with helmet on top. Dog tags are sometimes placed on the rifle, and the boots of the dead soldier can be placed next to the rifle. The purpose is to show honor and respect for the dead at the battle site. The practice started during or prior to the American Civil War, as a means of identifying the bodies on the battleground before removal. Today, it is a means of showing respect for the dead amongst the still living members of the troop. It is commonly seen in the field or base camp after a battle, especially among American troops in Afghanistan or Iraq. While it is used less today as a means of identification, it still serves as a method of mourning among the living, as attending the funeral is not always possible for soldiers still in combat.

Written by Al Jourgensen, it is the opening track and the only single released from their third studio album, 1988’s The Land of Rape and Honey. The song features distorted vocals, guitars and compressed drum machine loops. The song was an underground hit. The music video—which was said to get a regular airing on MTV—features gritty black and white machinery, gears, symbols, the band playing live, Paul Barker on a motorcycle, strobe-like montages of eyes (which are the only elements presented in color), and what appear to be neo-Nazi skinheads.

The track was later featured in the 1990 science fiction horror movie Hardware and the 1995 Hong Kong action comedy film Rumble in the Bronx. The 2017 action movie Atomic Blonde (taking place in 1989) features a cover of the song by Marilyn Manson.

In his youth, George Covode was noted for his athletic proportions, being tall and well built and peculiarly fitted for the hardships of military life. He was educated in Ligonier Academy and Elders Ridge. After he left school, he engaged in mercantile pursuits for some years, but not with much success. In 1858, he married Annie Earl of Somerset County, Pennsylvania, who died a few months after their marriage. He remarried a few years afterwards to Bettie St. Clair Robb, a granddaughter of Arthur St. Clair, a major general in the Continental Army and the ninth President of the Continental Congress. The two had one child, Sarah. Civil War Col. James H. Childs and officers of the 4th Pennsylvania Cavalry at Antietam, with Covode at left (1862) At the start of the Civil War in 1861, Covode enlisted as a private in Company D of the 4th Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, raised in Ligonier Valley, Pennsylvania. During the election of officers, he was chosen as first lieutenant. The company was soon transferred to Camp Campbell near Soldiers' Home in Washington, D.C.. Covode was later promoted to captain of the company, and on March 12, 1862, to major as the 4th Pennsylvania was moved rapidly to the front. Covode and his men marched to Yorktown, Virginia, and soon saw action in the battles of Malvern Hill and the Second Bull Run. During the fall of 1862, the regiment was encamped on the north bank of the Potomac River near Hancock, Maryland, but soon participated in the fighting at Antietam, and later at Fredericksburg. In 1863, Covode fought at Chancellorsville, Gettysburg and others. On one occasion in Falls Church, Virginia, Covode and his troops were entirely surrounded by the Confederate troops, but dashing against them he used his sword so skillfully that he opened a way for his men to follow and all escaped. His strength made him a power in hand-to-hand contests of this kind, but in addition he was almost without any personal fear. In camp life, he was described as jovial and was always unusually good natured. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on December 8, 1863, and was made a full colonel on May 28, 1864. =Death= Covode was known to be very near-sighted, which caused trouble for him in identifying people at a far distance. On June 24, 1864, while in command of a brigade in Virginia, he mistook some Confederate skirmishers for his own troops and rode toward them. He discovered his mistake too late and, as he was turning to ride away, he was shot in the arm and stomach by an enemy volley. In the retreat, he was left within the enemy lines and died a few hours later. He was interred in West Fairfield Cemetery in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.Colonels in Blue References Category:1835 births Category:1864 deaths Category:Union Army colonels Category:People of Pennsylvania in the American Civil War Category:Union military personnel killed in the American Civil War ","title":"George H.

Then, after his playing career, he became the highly successful head baseball coach of the University of Arizona Wildcats, winning 860 games and three College World Series championships over 24 seasons (1973–1996).Obituary (December 24, 2017), ArizonaWildcats.com Kindall was born in Saint Paul, and graduated from Washington High School before attending the University of Minnesota. In 1956, as a student-athlete at Minnesota, his Golden Gophers won the NCAA Division I baseball championship; 20 years later, Kindall became the first man to win College World Series titles as both a player and a head coach.USA Today December 24, 2017 He is also the only batter to hit for the cycle in the history of the College World Series and was elected to the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007. Playing career Kindall batted and threw right-handed and was listed as tall and . After his 1956 College World Series triumph, he signed with the Chicago Cubs as a bonus baby. The rules of the time mandated that such players be kept on the MLB signing club's 25-man roster for two full seasons before they could be optioned to minor league baseball. Kindall appeared in 104 games for the Cubs over the 1956 and seasons and collected only 38 hits (although six were home runs), batting a poor .161. Finally, in 1958, he was able to gain further experience in the Cubs' farm system, playing for two seasons and part of a third for high-level affiliates. He made the major leagues for good in and was the Cubs' starting second baseman for the latter half of that season, then split the job with Don Zimmer in . With standout youngster Ken Hubbs coming up through the organization, Kindall was traded to the Cleveland Indians on November 27, 1961, for pitcher Bobby Locke. In , he responded by playing in a career-high 154 games, and setting personal bests in hits (123), home runs (13) and runs batted in (55). He led all American League second basemen in assists with 494. Offensive struggles plagued Kindall during his MLB career. He batted above .205 only three times: 1960 (.240), 1961 (.242) and 1962 (.232). He reverted to a reserve role in , playing shortstop and first base as well as second base, and was traded to the Minnesota Twins, now his \\"hometown\\" team, in a three-way deal during June 1964. His final MLB campaign saw him contribute to the pennant-winning 1965 Twins. He started 101 of the team's 162 games at second base.

No one since with at least 2,000 at-bats has a lower career batting average than Kindall's .213, but he did have above-average power for a second baseman.

A tamadaFrom Common Circassian *tħamada (compare Adyghe тхьаматэ (\\"foreman of a village; boss; master; chairman; (dated) husband\\") and Kabardian тхьэмадэ (\\"foreman of a village; boss; master; chairman; (dialectal) bridegroom, wooer\\")), probably from Ottoman Turkish (damat; \\"bridegroom; son-in-law; sovereign's brother-in-law\\"), from Persian (dâmâd; \\"bridegroom; son-in-law; father-in-law; sovereign's brother-in-law; lover, wooer\\"). The suggestion that the word tamada derives from words meaning \\"head of the table\\" in Georgian is a folk etymology: see tamada at the English Wiktionary. () is a Georgian toastmaster at a Georgian supra (feast) or at a wedding, corresponding to the symposiarch at the Greek symposion or the thyle at the Anglo-Saxon sumbel. At all supras regardless of size, there is a tamada, or toastmaster, one person who introduces each toast. Georgians like to say that the tamada is dictator of the table, but it would be more appropriate to compare him to a leader or even a teacher. Tamada traditionally ought to be eloquent, intelligent, smart, sharp−witted and quick−thinking, with a good sense of humor since very often some of the guests might try to compete with him on the toast making. At the Georgian table, a tamada is considered to help bridge the gap between past, present and future, toasting ancestors and descendants as well as the other guests at the table. A toast can be proposed only by a tamada; the rest are to develop the idea. Some toasts take a traditional form; for example, for some toasts all men have to stand up and drink wine in silence. In many cases, however, the guests vie to say something more original and emotional than the previous speaker, and the whole process grows into a sort of oratory contest. Historically the tamada had more control over the table than he does today. For example, members of the supra were supposed to ask permission before leaving the table and the party. If they got the permission they could be toasted by the tamada and other members before leaving. If the first toast is to the tamada, it is proposed by someone else, generally by the host, who proposes the nomination of the tamada. Choosing a tamada Bronze statue from the 7th century BC discovered during archaeological excavations in the city of Vani. This statue is the statue of a Tamada, a toastmaster. The sheet also pictures amphora that were used at this time to carry and to stock the wine. Stamp of Georgia, 2007. If the supra is very small, in someone's home with only a few guests, the role of tamada won't be specially assigned, but rather simply assumed by the head of the household. At very large occasions, such as wedding or funeral banquets, the tamada is chosen in advance by the family, who ask a relative or friend who is known to be a good tamada to lead the supra. At mid-size occasions, however, the people of the table themselves choose the tamada. The choice depends on several factors. There may be a senior person at the table to whom the role naturally falls. In some groups there will be one man who regularly is the tamada because he enjoys it and is good at it. Sometimes groups of friends who gather frequently will rotate the responsibility of being tamada. In many cases, when it comes time to choose, one person – often the oldest member of the table – will propose a candidate for tamada by saying something like, “Kote should be our tamada, shouldn't he?”. Others express agreement and, if Kote raises no serious objections, the person who first suggested the choice raises his glass and proposes the first toast to the tamada – “Kotes Gaumarjos” (to Kote). The supra participants do the same. The newly toasted tamada initiates new toasts from then on. It might be the case, however, that Kote doesn't want to be tamada. Perhaps he feels that the senior person is suggesting his name ought to be the tamada. Maybe he was tamada last night and has a hangover, or is driving and can't drink, or would like to leave the gathering early, or just doesn't like to be tamada. He would refuse the job, perhaps pleading some excuse. Then the people at the table propose someone else as tamada, who may be willing to take up tamada−hood and may not be, and so on, until someone at the table agrees to be tamada, and the first toast is drunk to him. If the tamada has been chosen in advance by the family, the senior member of the family will initiate the drinking by proposing the first toast to the tamada directly, without any preceding discussion. Following the proposal of this first toast, each member of the supra toasts the tamada with a fixed phrase or two and drinks his glass. On this toast people drink quite quickly, almost in unison, and without any verbal elaboration on the theme of the toast. Some frequently heard phrases on this first toast include “Kotes Gaumarjos” (to Kote), where Kote is the name of the person who will be tamada, or “Kargad chaatarebinos es supra” (\\"May he lead this supra well”, or “May he cause us to have a good time”). There is only one common circumstance where the first toast is not to the tamada, and that concerns usually small, less formal supras where the host himself is tamada. In that case, the host simply assumes the role, as noted above, and proposes the first toast to a particular theme (discussed below). Qualities of a good tamada Begos' friends by Niko Pirosmani. A tamada holding a kantsi (horn) and introducing a toast at a keipi (festive supra) A good tamada is selected for his possession of a number of special qualities. First of all, a good tamada is one who is good with words, who speaks clearly and cleverly, who can say in an original way things which are heard over and over again at every supra. The best tamadas are extemporaneously poets. Secondly, a good tamada must be able to organize well, as he is almost entirely in charge of the entertainment. He has to decide which toasts to drink when, and how often to propose new toasts, so that a good rhythm is established. He has to orchestrate singing or dancing, if there is such, between stretches of toasting, so people stay attentive and entertained. This relates closely to a third quality of a good tamada: sensitivity. The tamada should have a good feel for the mood of the table and try to maintain a pleasant upbeat atmosphere in which all members are participating. The table should have a kind of unity, said one Georgian, which is the responsibility of the tamada. He should notice if certain members begin to pay less attention and draw them back, perhaps with a special toast or by making them “alaverdi”. He should be able to sense how much people have drunk, and increase or decrease the pace of the toasting as needed. (In general, the pace of toasting is faster earlier in the evening and slows down once everyone reaches a certain level of inebriation.) Part of this includes recognizing when the guests are at the proper level of inebriation for him to propose more abstract or emotional toasts. If the tamada knows the people at the supra well, he will be able to tailor his toasts to the guests, encouraging them to have a good time. Fourthly, a good tamada has to be somewhat forceful in order to get people to pay attention to the toasting and to get everyone to drink each toast. This gets harder as the evening wears on and some people would rather talk than toast. Last, but not at all least, a good tamada must also be a good drinker; the tamada is expected to empty his glass on each toast, but it is considered disgraceful for him to actually get drunk. Both the tamada and the other guests are expected to propose a toast to every person at the Georgian table. Every speaker tries to distinguish the most interesting, original and praiseworthy features of a person toasted. The Georgians do not consider this flattery, but a way to encourage the good traits. They believe when a person is told that he is kind and honest he will find it difficult to do evil; when he is told he is generous he will try not to be greedy.

He studied at Antwerp's Royal Academy of Fine Arts from 1916-1918 and at the University of Leuven from 1918–1923, graduating as an agronomist with chemistry as his primary subject. Delhez began exhibiting caricatures and surrealist work while in college. Taking up a role as manager of his family's car company, he continued his artistic interests, publishing a series of prints in 1925. In 1925, Delhez's parents died in a road accident. He left his job as manager of his father's motorcar company and moved to Argentina, working as a draughtsman, architect and contractor in Buenos Aires from 1926–1933. He then moved to Bolivia, before moving back to Argentina in 1940. He settled in Chacras de Coria and took a post as professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, National University of Cuyo. While in Bolivia, Delhez produced a set of forty illustrations for the Gospels, and twenty-one for Lord Dunsany's \\"A Dreamer's Tales\\", while in correspondence with the author. The Gospel woodcuts are notable for using South American settings for the illustrations. The sculptor Lorenzo Domínguez made a marble image of Delhez in the early 1940s. Delhez became better known from the 1930s, with what is considered to be his best work beginning during his time in Bolivia. His major themes included the Gospels and the Book of Apocalypse, illustrations for various literary works including books by Dostoevsky and Baudelaire, a series of woodcuts entitled Architecture and Nostalgia, the Dance of Death series, illustrations for Juan Draghi Lucero's \\"Las Mil y Una Noches Argentinas\\" (One Thousand and One Argentinian Nights), portraits and self-portraits, and abstract works including the so-called Bagatelle-Linos. He was exhibited, either alone or in conjunction with other artists, in Europe, the United States, Canada, South and Central America, and Japan, including cities such as Brussels (his sisters arranging a show of his \\"A Dreamer's Tales\\" works), Antwerp (Plantin-Moretus), at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C., and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Victor Delhez tended to produce short runs from his blocks, often eight copies of each print labeled as artist's proofs, which has left some of his work scarce in original form. Many of his works were intended for use as illustrations for literary works and are commonly known in their published format. A mid-1950s catalog of his work prepared in conjunction with an exhibit of his works in Breda, Netherlands includes more than 900 items, with an unknown number of additional works prepared during the final decades of his life. The catalog organizes Delhez's woodcuts into thematic categories. Two books examining Delhez's artistic work were completed during his lifetime - Fernando Diez de Medina's 1938 study, \\"El Arte Nocturno de Victor Delhez\\", and a 1969 study by Guillermo Petra Sierralta, \\"Victor Delhez: Apocalipsis, Danza Macabre, Grabado en Colores\\". Delhez has continued to receive attention in the years since his death. In 2014, Pope Francis (a fellow Argentinian) used a Delhez woodcut depicting the Nativity as the illustration for the Vatican Christmas greeting card. In 2015, two major exhibits of his works were held at the Museo de Artes Plásticas Eduardo Sívori in Buenos Aires, Argentina and at the Casa Municipal de Cultura in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. In 2016, two additional major Delhez exhibits took place at the Espacio Cultural Julio Le Parc in Mendoza, Argentina and at the FeliXart Museum in Drogenbos, Belgium. In 2015, scholars Roxana Jorajuria and Gabriela Menéndez presented a paper discussing Delhez as a pioneer Latin American modern artist at the Congreso Nacional e Internacional de Historia del Arte, Cultura y Sociedad, held at the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza, Argentina. Delhez's works are found in numerous museums, including more than 350 prints in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels, about 275 prints at the State College of Florida, Manatee-Sarasota in Bradenton, Florida, about 100 prints held by the Museum Plantin-Moretus in Antwerp, Belgium as well as works at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, at the Baltimore Museum of Art (which issued in 2014 a video blog concerning a Delhez print, Scherzo in Gold, from his Dance of Death series), and in museums in Argentina and other South American locations.

Following in the tradition of its predecessors, The Black Bass for MSX and The Black Bass for NES, the objective is to win a tournament by catching the largest fish in the time allotted. The Blue Marlin features four tournament rounds (one in Florida and the other three in Hawaii). It was re-released in 2016 as a built-in game for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console. Gameplay In the middle of the oceans, players can find plenty of fish to catch. The player controls a fisherman who is competing in a tournament. The objective in each round of the tournament is to catch the largest billfish. These fish include blue marlin, black marlin, striped marlin, swordfish, and sailfish. Other fish that can be caught include dorado, barracuda, tuna, and sharks. As the player fights fish, there may be several events that occur that the player must respond to, such as a smoking reel or a marlin attempting to cut the line on the propeller. Other events are static, such as the fish biting off the line or the fish becoming exhausted. Each of these events changes the dynamics of the fight, such as how much line the fish has or how tired the fish is. There are three attributes that the player can increase as they fight more and more fish. These are Muscle Power (ability to pull in heavier fish), Body Strength (ability to fight a fish longer and with more power), and Skill (ability to respond to events properly). Password system The Blue Marlin features a password system to save the player's progress. A password is generated at the end of every tournament round, and after the tournament is completed (with the player victorious). If the player uses this password to begin a new tournament, they can start over with all of their attributes from their previous game. Reception Allgame gave this video game a score of 4 stars out of 5 in their overview.Rating information for The Blue Marlin at allgame Entertainment Weekly gave the game a C- and wrote that \\"NES' The Blue Marlin is a fishing game in which you sit for long stretches in front of the television set, reel in the occasional fish, then sit again for long stretches in front of the television set.

It is the α-ethyl analog of MDPEA and MDA and the methylenedioxy analogue of α-ethylphenethylamine. BDB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 150–230 mg and the duration is listed as 4–8 hours.J entry in PiHKAL BDB produces entactogenic, MDMA-like effects. Although pleasant and euphoric, BDB is also fairly sedating and some users feel that the lack of stimulant effect makes it less enjoyable than other similar drugs. Additional side effects associated with BDB include nystagmus and dizziness. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of BDB. Animal studies and anecdotal reports show that BDB is a slightly more potent serotonin releasing agent than its methylated sister compound methylbenzodioxylbutanamine (MBDB; \\"Eden\\", \\"Methyl-J\\"). However, it is more commonly known as a metabolite of the N-alkylated analogues MBDB and ethylbenzodioxylbutanamine (EBDB; \\"Ethyl-J\\") which have appeared in methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; \\"Ecstasy\\", \\"Adam\\", \\"Empathy\\", \\"Molly\\", \\"E\\", \\"X\\", \\"XTC\\") tablets. Although BDB itself has not been reported as being sold as \\"Ecstasy\\", urine analysis of \\"Ecstasy\\" users suggest that this drug may have appeared as a street drug, although it is unclear whether the positive urine test for BDB resulted from consumption of BDB itself or merely as a metabolite of MBDB.

It stars Jane Fonda in the role of Nora Helmer and David Warner as her domineering husband, Torvald. In the United States, the film was broadcast nationally on the ABC television network. Losey's version of the classic play was extensively adapted for film. From Ibsen's expository dialogue, entire new scenes were developed by British dramatist David Mercer and integrated through a number of invented sets. Plot Set in nineteenth century Norway, Ibsen's A Doll's House focuses on the married life of banker Torvald Helmer and his wife Nora. A young middle- class couple with three small children, their seemingly respectable marriage is revealed to be a broken and bloodless matter. The Helmers live in an unequal partnership, dominated by Torvald. Although he professes to love her, Torvald constantly chides Nora for what he calls her careless and childlike nature; he often calls her his \\"doll\\". He proudly thinks of himself as the family's breadwinner and protector, but he remains unaware of the secret that Nora holds: she had saved him, when he had become seriously ill and very nearly destitute. Without his knowledge, she had borrowed a large sum of money so that he could temporarily retire and recuperate. She told him the money had been inherited from her family; in truth it had been a private loan from Nils Krogstad, one of Torvald's coworkers. Nora has been scrupulously repaying him in small installments skimmed from her household allowance. Torvald, it turns out, already holds the boorish Krogstad in contempt for various reasons. When Torvald is appointed bank director, one of his first acts is to fire his unlikable coworker. The desperate Krogstad attempts to blackmail Nora – she must persuade Torvald to keep him on the job, or he will tell all about the secret loan. Its existence would be embarrassment enough for Nora, but Krogstad threatens to reveal the most shocking news of all: Nora had forged her father's signature as a co-signer on the contract. The story includes important subplots regarding the unexpected tenderness of Krogstad (toward Nora's friend Kristine, his old flame) and the quixotic love interest (toward Nora) of the elderly Dr. Rank. But the essential conflict comes when Torvald gets a letter from Krogstad describing the loan. Indignantly, Torvald pours scorn on his wife for her morals, intellect, and financial sense; he cuts short her explanations, and declares that she will be allowed no hand in raising their children. His fury seems infinite until suddenly a second letter from Krogstad arrives. It contains Nora's contract, complete with forged signature and surrendered without explanation. Torvald holds the incriminating evidence in his hand, utterly relieved, and begins to make weak apologies for his outburst. But in the meantime Nora has had a transformational realization about her love and marriage. She stands up to Torvald, explains her new vision, and then – against all customs of the day – walks out on him forever. Cast * Jane Fonda – Nora Helmer * David Warner – Torvald Helmer * Trevor Howard – Dr. Rank * Delphine Seyrig – Kristine Linde * Edward Fox – Nils Krogstad * Ingrid Natrud – Helene the maid * Pierre Oudry – Olssen the porter * Anna Wing – Anne-Marie the nanny * The Helmers' children were portrayed by Morten Floor (Bob), Tone Floor (Emmy), and Frode Lien (Ivar). * Krogstad's son and daughter were portrayed by Dagfinn Hertzberg and Ellen Holm. Adaptation Ibsen's three-act play was adapted to a screenplay by Losey in collaboration with British dramatist David Mercer.Gardner, p. 234. The original script takes place in a single room in a single day, but the Mercer/Losey version is much wider ranging. Much of the expository dialogue of Act I is converted into an extensive prologue. Events that are only discussed by the actors in the Ibsen play – such as the early friendship of Nora and Kristine, the romance and breakup of Kristine and Krogstad, the life- threatening illness of Torvald, and the death of Nora's father – are all fleshed out in full separate scenes at the start of the film.Gardner, pp. 234; 239. The one-room setting of Ibsen's original is a deliberate device suggestive of Nora's isolation and her imprisonment within her marriage. In the film, however, multiple locations outside the Helmer house are used for visual explication, and to lend dramatic emphasis to plot points. Even within the house, the camera moves from room to room, revealing not just the physical comforts of their home but also its confining nature – its \\"deadly insularity\\".Gardner, p. 239. The combined effect of Losey's alterations have been praised by some critics for giving the work a comprehensively cinematic quality, and make it \\"a film rather than a photographed play\\". Losey intended his added scenes to step beyond a plain visualization of Ibsen's dialogue and achieve artistic merit in their own right. Critic Colin Gardner has commented on one example at the start of the film: \\"just as we see Nora and Kristine skidding excitedly across the surface of the pond, we also spot a static, black-coated figure lurking ominously outside the teahouse in the exact centre of the shot (i.e. at the spatial vanishing point). This turns out to be Krogstad, steeling himself for his fateful rejection by Kristine. The sweet purity of youth is thus already tainted by the acrid taste of the social outcast – the future man of vengeance – and the source of Nora's own financial enslavement.\\"Gardner, p. 240. Other critics found Losey's bold changes to be off-putting, even blasphemous. Writing in The New York Times, Nora Sayre complained bitterly that the film had been \\"fattened with feeble lines and even short scenes that the old genius didn't write\\". Production Filming took place in the Norwegian town of Røros, where local residents served as extras for the exterior scenes. The cinematographer was Gerry Fisher, who had a long history of working with Losey beginning in the mid-1960s during the director's British period and including such titles as Accident (1967), The Go-Between (1971), and Don Giovanni (1979). French composer Michel Legrand provided the musical soundtrack, a \\"bright, horn-dominated neoclassical score\\".Gardner, p. 240. Release A Doll's House was first aired in the United States on the ABC television network on 23 December 1973.Erskine, et al, p. 97. It had been shown at the 1973 New York Film Festival, and was screened at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, but wasn't entered into the main competition. In June 1980, it was given a nine-day run at one of the Laemmle Theatres in Los Angeles. Losey's film was one of two English-language versions of Ibsen's play released in 1973: the other version was directed by Patrick Garland and stars Claire Bloom and Anthony Hopkins.Erskine, et al, p. 95. The coincidental competition for a relatively small audience meant commercial difficulties for both films. Reception The choice of Fonda for the principal role has always elicited some commentary on her casting and performance.Bleiler, p. 165.Maltin, p. 640. Known as a high-profile supporter of feminism, Fonda took the role at a time when the U.S. women's rights movement was at its peak.Erskine, et al, pp. 95–96. Many film critics praised Fonda's work – Leonard Maltin cited it as the main reason to see the film (which he otherwise deemed only \\"moderately successful\\"). Charles Champlin likewise praised her performance, and wrote that her contemporary persona dovetailed well with Mercer's dialogue, which \\"skillfully drops the stilted period rhetoric without going colloquial or slangy\\". Some critics have suggested that the film suffers under the weight of Fonda's public image. Professor Neil Sinyard wrote, \\"Perhaps the star's own feminist associations obscure our vision of the character's blind and painful quest towards self- awareness and undermine the shock of Nora's startling decision (startling, that is, to a nineteenth century audience) to walk out on her husband and children.\\"Sinyard, p. 176. More bluntly, Rex Reed wrote that Fonda's \\"star personality\\" undercut her performance in an otherwise admirable production: \\"One never believes her as the macaroon-munching birdbrain or the charming coquette or the toy wife. In the great scene of defiance at the end, she takes the film with a tank\\".  Cast and director conflict  Fonda's feminist sensibilities not only informed her performance but also her relationship with Losey. The director, who had a history of stormy relationships with his leading ladies, earned the ire of both Fonda and Delphine Seyrig before the film was even released. In a letter from June 1973, Fonda assailed Losey for making \\"anti-feminist remarks to the press\\", and charging that \\"your [Losey's] inability to deal with, to countenance, strong women... has done irreparable harm to the film\\".Gardner, p. 231. On a personal note, she added: \\"I was never able to penetrate your paranoia or snobbery while we were working together\\". Losey, for his part, grumbled that Fonda had \\"little sense of humor\\" and \\"was spending most of her time working on her political speeches, instead of learning her lines\\".

It was directed by David Thacker and first broadcast on BBC 2 on 21 November 1992, and was later shown on PBS's Masterpiece Theatre in the United States. Plot summary Torvald and Nora Helmer are married in Norway for eight years with three children. Nora comes home from shopping for Christmas and the husband admonishes her for over spending. He expresses his love for his 'songbird' and gives her some extra money. Torvald is the man of the house and Nora only wants to please him. They have a sick friend Dr. Rank who visits daily. An old friend of Nora comes for a visit. Kristine is now a widow and in need of a job. She hopes Nora will help her to get work at the bank where Torvald has just been promoted. Nora tells Kristine that no one takes her seriously but she has a secret. To save her sick husband's life, she borrowed money to afford a one year trip to Italy for treatment. For years she has been paying back the money without her husband's knowledge. Nils Krogstandt visits Nora and he too wants her to influence her husband this time to not fire him at the bank. Krogstandt lent Nora the money and she forged her dying father's signature on the IOU. He threatens to expose the loan to her husband and to bring criminal charges of forgery. Being blackmailed Nora feels hopeless but tries to get Krogstandt's job protected. She hints to her husband that Nils will spread false lies about them. Torvald tells his wife that Krogstandt has forgery in his past and he would look weak at the bank for not following up on his decision. He dismisses Krogstandt who in turn writes a tell-all letter that arrives in the Helmer's locked mailbox. Nora does not think she is a bad person because she got the loan for love. She needs to stop her husband from seeing that letter. Kristine advises to just go tell Torvald everything. Nora thinks her strict and moral husband would never understand. She consults family friend Dr. Rank and thinks maybe he could lend her the payoff. Before telling the doctor her problem, Rank tells her he is soon to die and nobody remembers the dead. He also declares his love for her to her shock and dismay. Nora thinks about suicide as a solution but dismisses it. Kristine had a prior relationship with Krogstadt and she wants a chance to get the letter returned before it is opened. Nora and Torvald go to a Christmas dance and afterward he expresses his love but Nora stops all of his advances to the point he is just going to open the mail. He reads the exposure letter and explodes. He calls his wife a hypocrite and a liar. How could his wife do this to him and what about his reputation at the bank. His reaction is all about himself. It turns out that Kristine's efforts are successful and a second letter arrives with a retraction and the incriminating IOU enclosed. Torvald is pleased the scandal will not be known. He forgives his wife of any wrong she may have done. Nora has a revelation after her husband's \\"I'm saved\\" declaration about his honor. She insists they have a talk for the first time in eight years. She is going to leave him. He asks about love and her duty to him as her husband and to the children. She has a duty to herself. The reaction to the letters were only about him with no defense of his wife and her role. To his dismay the marriage is over. She tells him she no longer loves him and releases him of any duty due her and leaves.

As a child, Massey acted for the BBC in radio children's programmes. She attended King's College London and graduated in Latin, Urdu and English. She had aspirations to train as an actress; however, her mother frowned upon such a career. Massey's mother refused to allow her to attend drama school after the death of her father, so she was forced to use subterfuge to fulfil her acting ambitions. Career She began her career as an extra. Her first film role was in Sink the Bismarck! (1960), where she was used to translate and report a news section from the film into Urdu — announcing the sinking of the British battleship . She continued to work extensively on radio in English, Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi as well as for the German service of the BBC. Years later she acted in Tribunal, a ZDF television serial in German, with leading European actors. She joined the Afro-Asian Committee of Equity and continued to work in film and television. Roles for Asian actors were scarce during her early career, but she was given parts in series such as Crossroads (1964); Within These Walls (1976); The Next Man (1976); Z-Cars (1976–1977); Target (1977); Mind Your Language (1977–79); Play for Today (1977, 1978); Empire Road (1979); Angels (1981); Minder (1982); The Jewel in the Crown (1984); The Bill (1984); Albion Market (1985); Chance in a Million (1986); Madame Sousatzka (1988); Great Balls of Fire! (1989); Brookside (1989) playing Manju Batra and Pie in the Sky (1994). In the mid-1990s she was cast as the recurring character Auntie Satya in Radio 4's daily agricultural soap opera, The Archers, fulfilling one of her life's ambitions. Massey was the second actress to play the role. She had initially been asked to audition for the part, but was forced to turn it down due to work commitments. A year later she was offered the same part when the role was recast. Her character makes occasional appearances to visit her niece, Usha Gupta (Souad Faress). In 1997 she was cast in the popular BBC soap opera EastEnders. She played Neelam Kapoor, the domineering mother of market-trader Sanjay (Deepak Verma) until 1998. Other acting credits include Arabian Nights (2000); Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years (2001); Perfect World (2001); Doctors (2002); All About Me (2003); Chicken Tikka Masala (2005). Massey's theatre work includes The Great Celestial Cow (Royal Court), Conduct Unbecoming which toured Canada as well as the UK, Song for a Sanctuary (Lyric Hammersmith) and Women of the Dust (Tamasha Theatre and Bristol Old Vic). She also played Kasturba in Mahatma versus Gandhi in the BBC Home and World Services and Harvey Virdi in Calcutta Kosher, a play on the Indian Jewish Community of Kolkata.\\"Metro Plus Delhi\\", The Hindu Archive.

Wąkx!istowi, the Man with the Human Head Earrings,\\" in Skinner (1925) 457–458. He also appears in a Twins myth, where his is called Wankistogre, \\"Man-in-the-Earring\\". Small & Small, in Skinner (1925). and Hocąk (Winnebago) nations.For the ethnology of the Hocągara, conducted between 1908 and 1912, see Paul Radin (1923). He has different names. Only in Hocąk literature is he known as \\"Red Horn\\" (Hešucka), but among the Ioway and Hocągara both, he is known by one of his variant names, \\"He Who Wears (Man) Faces on His Ears\\".Radin (1948) 124. In Harrison, 112–114, he is called Wągíšjahorùšika, \\"Wears Man Faces on His Ears\\". Radin, \\"Intcohorúcika,\\" 65-67; Foster, (1876–1877) vol. 1, #3: p. 3 col. 1; Danker and White (1978) 24-25; McKern 1929). This name derives from the living faces on his earlobes (Hocąk), or earbobs that come to life when he places them on his ears (Ioway). Elsewhere, he is given yet another name, \\"Red Man\\" (Wąkšucka), because his entire body is red from head to toe. Red Horn was one of the five sons of Earthmaker, whom the Creator fashioned with his own hands and sent to earth to rescue humanity. During his sojourn on earth, he contested both giants and water spirits, and led war parties against the bad spirits who plagued humanity. As Wears Faces on His Ears, he is also said to be a star, although its identity is a subject of controversy. Under the names \\"One Horn\\" (Hejąkiga) and \\"Without Horns\\" (Herok'aga), he and his sons are chiefs over the small hunting spirits known as the herok'a and the \\"little children spirits\\". Red Horn, as chief of the herok'a, has a spiritual and sometimes corporeal identity with the arrow. Archaeologists have speculated that Red Horn is a mythic figure in Mississippian art, represented on a number of Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC) artifacts. The son of Earthmaker According to legend, Red Horn is one of the five great soteriological spirits fashioned by the Creator's own hands, sent to earth to make the world safe for the least endowed of Earthmaker's creation, the \\"two-legged walkers\\". The first spirit to be sent down to earth to help humanity was Trickster (Wakdjąkaga), whose foolishness made it necessary to recall him. Earthmaker next sent down Bladder (Wadexuga), whose arrogance led to the loss of all but one of his 20 brothers, so he too was recalled. Then Earthmaker made Turtle (Kecągega) and charged him to teach the humans how to live, but Turtle brought them war, and was in his turn recalled. The fifth and last of these heroes dispatched by Earthmaker was Hare (Wacdjįgega), who conquered all the bad spirits who had preyed on humanity. By accident, however, he introduced death, but made up for it by creating the Medicine Lodge, by whose discipline members could achieve immortality. Earthmaker made Hare in charge of this earth, and to each of the other three spirits he gave an otherworldly paradise to govern. The penultimate savior figure in this series was Redhorn. He had quite nearly succeeded, but was killed in a wrestling match with the enemies of the human race. Although later revived, he too was recalled, although the reasons for his failure are obscure. One source suggests that it was a lack of gravitas. > Then Earthmaker (Mą'ųna) sent down another son, He who Wears Human Heads as > Earrings. He went around talking to people, but they would always fix on his > earrings which were actual, living, miniature human heads. When these little > heads saw someone looking at them, they would wink and make funny faces. In > the end, He who Wears Human Heads as Earrings could not accomplish the > mission either.Danker & White (1978) 24-25. Informant: Felix White, Sr. Unlike all the other soteriological spirits, Red Horn is not assigned a paradise over which to rule; and the Medicine Rite omits any mention of Red Horn from its account of the sons of Earthmaker.Jipson (1923) 410-411. These facts indicate that Red Horn may have been a recent addition to the role. Meeker even suggested that a certain notable Piegan contemporary of the same name may have simply been elevated to divine status.Meeker (1901) 161-164. More recently, Lankford held a similar view: \\"... Red Horn was a recent addition to the Winnebago pantheon diffused possibly from the Blackfoot tribe.\\"Lankford (2007) 124. Red Horn's adventures A contemporary painting of Turtle, Red Horn and Storms as He Walks done in the style of a Southeastern Ceremonial Complex engraved whelk shell. The adventures of Red Horn are set out in a set of stories known as the \\"Red Horn Cycle\\". The Red Horn Cycle depicts his adventures with Turtle, the thunderbird Storms-as-He-Walks (Mą'e-manįga) and others who contest a race of giants, the Wąge-rucge or \\"Man- Eaters\\", who have been killing human beings whom Red Horn has pledged to help. In the episode associated with this name, Red Horn turns himself into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race Red Horn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his hair into a long red braid called a he, \\"horn\\", in Hocąk. Thus he becomes known as \\"Red-horn\\" (he-šucka) and as \\"He who Wears (Human) Faces on His Ears\\" (įco-horúšika). In one episode an orphan girl who always wears a white beaverskin wrap is pressured by her grandmother to court Red Horn. Despite the girl's adamant refusal, the grandmother insists. She eventually relents and goes off to find Red Horn, who is surrounded by other girls. She teases him, and unexpectedly, he smiles at her. The other girls were jealous, they push and shove her and tell her \\"You don't know anything.\\" Red Horn and his friends prepare to go on the warpath and are camped just outside the village. During this time the women bring the warriors moccasins and the she brings a pair to Red Horn, who accepts them. When the warriors return from battle, they play a prank and have the sentries proclaim that Red Horn and one of his friends are dead. The grandmother begins to cut the hair of the orphan girl, as if she were already Red Horn's wife. When he comes into view and it is apparent that he is not dead, the grandmother laments \\"I have wrecked my granddaughter's hair.\\" The victors dance for four days, and many of the young men approach Red Horn to recommend their sisters to him. He takes no interest, and asks instead, \\"Where does the girl in the white beaverskin wrap live?\\" At night Red Horn shows up at the girl's lodge and lies down next to her. Her grandmother throws a blanket over them and they are married.Radin (1948) 115-136. In another episode, with their lives staked on the outcome, the giants challenge Red Horn and his friends to play kisik (lacrosse).Radin (1948) 123-129; McKern (1929) 215-230. Hocąk myths depicting lacrosse are tabulated in Lankford (2007) 83. The best giant player was a woman with long red hair just like Red Horn's. The little heads on Red Horn's ears caused her to laugh so much that it interfered with her game and the giants lost, but Red Horn married the girl with the red hair.Radin (1948) 123-129; McKern (1929) 215-230; Radin, Redhorn's Nephews, 1-16; Harrison, 112-114. The same episode occurs in a lacrosse game in which the hero is called \\"White Cloud\\" — Radin, \\"The Roaster\\". The giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Red Horn and his friends to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Red Horn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain. Red Horn as a star There is a little-known myth of great importance that identifies Red Horn as a star. Ten brothers lived together in a longhouse. The eldest, Kunu, had four arms. The youngest brother was called \\"Wears Faces on His Ears\\" (įcohorúšika), because he had living human faces on each of his ears. By dancing all night and performing the hunting rite by which game is seduced, they were able to gain wives for themselves. However, the second brother, Hena, was jealous because his youngest brother had gotten the fattest woman (hinųk šį), so he persuaded his other brothers, all except Kunu and the next youngest, to join him in a plot to rid themselves of Wears Faces on His Ears. They brought him to the lodge of a beautiful woman who in reality was a water spirit (wakcexi). She persuaded him to go to the back of her lodge, where he fell through a trap door into the underworld. There he was made captive by the bad water spirits (wakcexi šišik). Loon and Otter were the nephews of the water spirits. Each made an impassioned plea to free the young man, but the bad water spirits were determined to eat him, so Loon and Otter left the underworld for the earth where they have lived ever after. Wears Faces on His Ears broke his chains as though they were made of string, then grabbed a fire brand and began to club the water spirits to death and to set their realm aflame. He tracked down the woman who had tricked him and chased her through the underworld, where she tried to hide as a tubercle on a weed. Just the same, he found her out and killed her. When he returned to earth, he discovered that in his absence the rebel brothers had abused his two loyal brothers. The disloyal brothers had in reality been foxes and coyotes. When Wears Faces on His Ears struck Hena with his club, he was transformed into a fox. Thus, the wicked brothers lived as animals thereafter. Wears Faces on His Ears and his two loyal brothers were stars.Radin, \\"Intcohorúcika,\\" 65-67. Without any reference to this story, much has been said about the stellar identity of Red Horn. In 1945, many years after his field work, Paul Radin suggested that Red Horn might be identical to the Morning Star (of Venus), known to the Hocągara as Wiragošge Xetera, \\"the Great Star\\".Radin (1945) 57. Most archaeologists have accepted this suggestion.Brown, \\"The Cahokian Expression,\\" in Townsend & Sharp (2004) 105, 114; Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2000) 231-232; Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000) 10; Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2004) 146, 148-149, 150 (where one of his sons is identified with Morning Star), 203; Hall, The Cultural Background of Mississippian Symbolism, in Galloway (1989) 241-242, 257; Hall (1997) 148-149; Reilly, \\"People of Earth, People of Sky\\", in Townsend & Sharp (2004) 132-135. However, just three years later, he was less certain, saying only that Red Horn was \\"either evening- or morning-star\\",Radin (1948) 41-42, 50. and in 1954 he changed his position yet again, asserting that Red Horn, \\"probably is identical with the Evening Star\\".Radin (1954) 13. This may in part rest on the identity of Evening Star as \\"the red star\\" (wiragošge šuc). After an extensive discussion of the problem, Lankford summed up by saying, \\"It appears that the safest conclusion for this study of Morning Star traditions is to accept the Winnebago divinities [Red Horn, Blue Horn, the Twins] as possibly stellar figures but to allow them to remain without a celestial name, insofar as ethnoastronomy is concerned.\\"Lankford (2007) 125; the Morning Star and Red Horn problem is discussed on pages 72-125. Nevertheless, the very end of our story identifies Red Horn, in his form as Wears Faces on His Ears, as a fixed star, probably Alnilam of Orion. > \\"The one star that is shining most greatly of the trio, it is he. The > greatly shining white one, and the blue one, and the red one; and > Icohorúšika was the yellowish one. And the other ones, his older brothers, > are also stars. They are the trio that are bunched together [the Belt Stars > of Orion ?].\\"Égi že tanihajega wiragošge wa’ųnąkše. Hitanike wiragošgežą > horokanakąnąpra hanątc´ herenagi, žee e hereže. Horokanakąnąpra skanąga co, > hánąga šujanąga zinisganąki ereže, įcohorúšika. Égi hijanénąka, hiniwahira, > hišge wiragošge hireže. Hitanike stonąki e herereže. Radin, \\"Intcohorúcika,\\" > 65-67. Morning Star, of course, is not a fixed star. Their lack of identity is confirmed in another story in which Man Faces on His Ears coexists with Morning Star.Harrison, 92-117. The connection between fixed stars and living beings on the ears finds a parallel in another Hocąk story in which Polaris (the North Star) has hummingbirds as earrings.\\"So in the morning he went out wearing a hummingbird on each ear.\\" Égi hainigiži, daniakanąkanąkera a'aki horušikanąga reže. Radin, \\"The Dipper,\\" 91 (Hocąk syllabary with an English interlinear translation). Red Man, Chief of the Herok'a In the Red Horn Cycle, when a human chief offers his daughter as a prize in a race, all the fastest spirits in creation show up to compete. Nevertheless, a completely unknown person wins the race by turning himself into the fleetest of all things, an arrow, and shooting himself ahead of all the other competitors. The victor declares that he goes by the name \\"Red Horn\\", but that the spirits know him as \\"Wears Man-Faces on His Ears\\". The episode shows that Red Horn has a mystical identity with the arrow. There are two unpublished stories that reveal Red Horn's sagittary nature. The first is \\"Chief of the Horok'a\\", and the other is its variant, \\"The Red Man\\". In \\"Chief of the Herok'a\\", a great hunter lived with his wife and two small children. He told his wife to avoid his deer traps, but she ignored him, and whenever she went out, she was caught in one of the traps. No trap in which she was caught ever worked again. Finally, he had to shoot his own wife to save his family from starvation. He sent his two children to where his other sons lived, and on the way, the children saw the signs in the sky that their father had been overcome by their mother's brothers. On the way, the little boy was kidnapped by a group of berdaches who had the power to change their size. He made good his escape and joined his sister and brothers. In time the little boy grew up and married a beautiful woman. His mother-in-law would send him on impossibly dangerous missions in order to kill him, but every time he emerged victorious. Among the spirits participating in the feasts that were held afterwards were Turtle and the Forked Man, who had two bodies joined at the waist. The young man allowed his sister to choose her husband from among the assembled spirits, and she picked the Forked Man. The old woman had a nightmare, and when she awoke, she said that the young man must play the game wegodiwa with them.The word wegodiwa, alternant regodiwa, of unknown meaning, is foreign, undoubtedly Algonquian. He agreed. The young man with his spirit friends sat on the edge of a cliff while the old woman walked out into the thin air. She and her daughters gave a loud shout, and a gale force wind issued from above, yet the young man and the good spirits held fast. After four such attacks, the good spirits triumphed. The sons of the old woman were the ones who were making the wind. The young man, now in the form of Without Horns (Herok'aga), stood on the water and told his brothers to make the \\"herok'a breathings.\\" They uttered, ahahe, ahahe, and as they pulled their empty bow strings back and forth, their opponents fell over dead. The young man, Herok'aga, became chief over the village that was once ruled by the slain brothers. In time Herok'aga had a daughter, and when it was time for her to be married, he set up an ordeal designed to test the worth of her suitors. Finally, a Forked Man succeeded, and the couple set out for his home up above where he lived with his grandfather. One day as she was looking into the fire, she saw a head that was made red by the heat, yet it had tears rolling down its cheeks. The head explained that she was his granddaughter and that the old man there had beheaded him and placed him in the fire. She lifted the head out of the fire and put it in a white deerskin. When the Forked Man returned home, the head explained to him all that had happened. The husband demanded that his grandfather tell him where the headless body was, and they went out and found the body wandering around Red Hill. They brought it back and made a sweat bath in which the head was reattached to the body. Once he emerged whole again, he cursed the old man to become an owl. The grandfather whose head was reattached, is the chief of the herok'a. His son is the chief of the little children spirits who have the same power as the herok'a.Radin, \\"The Chief of the Heroka.\\" From this story we learn that the elder man is chief of the herok'a, but his son, even though his name is Without Horns (Heroka'ga), is chief over the little children spirits. Both sets of spirits are able to kill with empty bows, just as though they themselves were the arrows. In \\"The Red Man\\", the older man kills his wife because he has caught her making love with a bear. The man who killed him, rather than being turned into an owl, is killed by Trickster and Hare. With a stroke of his club, Hare shattered him into a thousand pieces of flint. The man known to us as \\"chief of the herok'a\\", in this story is brought back to life and called \\"Red Man\\" (Wąkšucka), since his body is entirely red in color.Radin, \\"The Red Man\\". Who is Red Man, chief of the herok'a? It would be left to speculation were it not for a story parallel to the Red Horn Cycle, where it is said of Red Horn, \\"'Without Horns' (herok'a) they call certain beings, he (Red Horn) was their chief; his sons were the chiefs of beings called 'childish people', they say.\\"Radin, \\"Redhorn's Nephews,\\" 16. Therefore, it is Red Horn who is Red Man, chief of the herok'a, and his sons are chiefs of the little children spirits. Both of these are tribes of lilliputian hunting spirits, whose spiritual essence is the arrow, and whose symbol is the bow. From another unpublished story, “The Baldheaded War Club”, we learn more about Red Horn and the herok'a. Trickster (Wakjąkaga) acquired an enormously powerful war club, and to fulfill his role as a savior of humanity, called together a war party to attack the evil spirits who had lorded it over humanity. The members of this select war party were Turtle, Wolf, Sleets as He Walks, Great Black Hawk, Red Horn, Otter, Loon, and the Twins (Flesh and Ghost). Under Trickster's leadership, all kinds of foolish mistakes were made, so a different war leader stepped forward at the critical moment when they were being charged by the evil spirits. > Then the war leader said, \\"Now then, attendants! I will help you,\\" and at > the war leader's forehead stood a single horn, and it was very red. This he > took off and struck the water with it, and the water burned like fuel, and > there all the bad things were burned up. Then the leader said, \\"Now then! > from henceforth you will no more call me \\"One Horn\\". Here the humans are > being abused and here I have used my horn, therefore, the humans shall ever > call me, \\"Without Horns\\", because I have caused myself to be without any,\\" > he said. That is why they call them herok'a, meaning \\"ones without > horns\\".Rave, 54-56. In this variant, Red Horn is first named \\"One Horn\\" (Hejąkiga),The name Hejąkiga, \\"One Horn,\\" occurs as a common personal name in a number of different Hocąk clans. See Radin (1923) 170-172. then \\"Without Horns\\" (Herok'aga), a name which elsewhere is given to his son. This is merely a reflection of the cross-generational identity of Red Horn and his sons. In one story the son of Red Horn is called by one of Red Horn's old lovers by the name \\"Red Horn\\";Radin (1948) 134-136. and in another story, the father of Red Horn is Wears Man-Faces on His Ears, another form of Red Horn himself.McKern (1929): 215-230. The he, \\"horn\\", in the names He-jąki-ga (\\"One Horn\\"), He- rok'a-ga (\\"Without Horns\\"), and He-šuc-ka (\\"Red Horn\\"), can be understood in these sagittary terms. In the myth known as \\"The Brown Squirrel\\", the hero of the story terrorizes a bad spirit by constantly pointing a red cedar horn at him. The horn is usually called \\"the red protruding horn\\" (he-pųjoge-šujera). However, once it is simply called he-pųjogera, \\"the protruding horn\\".Radin, \\"The Squirrel,\\" 80. Since the original word is in Hocąk syllabic orthography, which is highly ambiguous, it is difficult to determine the exact form of the word. The word meaning \\"protruding\\" is probably pųjoge, from pųc-hoge, or pųc- joge, akin to pųc, which means, \\"the snout of an animal (the projecting part of the face)\\". At the very end of the myth the bad spirit is turned into a brown squirrel and told, \\"Humans you tried to abuse, so ever after will boys shoot you with protruding horns (he-pųjogera).\\"Wąkšikra kšakša nąš'įną. Nįge hocįcįnįk he-pųjoge hibonįgišara hiranihekjaną. Radin, \\"The Squirrel,\\" 84. Therefore, arrows are horns, and paradigmatically, red horns. Consequently, the name Hešucka (\\"Red Horn\\") not only refers to his red braid or \\"horn\\", but to his mystical identity with the arrow. It is also the reason why the race over whom he is chief is called \\"without horns\\", since they fire their bows without the need of an arrow. In a race, the Red Horn is triumphant over all the spirits, for he himself is the arrow he shoots to victory. Red Horn's sons \\"Hero Twins\\" emerging from a crack in the back of a raccoon-faced Horned Serpent called a Sinti Shaui by the Choctaw.The horned serpent with the raccoon face is apparently the same as the Choctaw sinti shaui, a symbol of the earth. Townsend suggests that the two beings emerging from it are the hero Twins (in Winnebago, these would be the nephews of Bluehorn). The original was engraved on a marine whelk shell photographed as fig. 42 in Townsend, \\"American Landscapes, Seen and Unseen,\\" in Townsend & Sharp (2004) 31-33. The original is in the Museum of the American Indian, Cup 192, Craig B. The artwork is based on a drawing of the engraving in Phillips & Brown (ca 1975-1982) plate 192. Colorized by the artist (Herb Roe). An earlier rendering of this is found in Hamilton (1952) 228, plate 104B, entitled \\"Two Snake Dancers\\"; see Phillips & Brown, \\"Theme of Intertwined Snake-men\\", 131-133, fig. 186. For similar examples from this source, see Cup 197, Craig B (132, fig. 187), Cups 189 & 194 (132, fig. 188). The two wives of Red Horn were pregnant at the time of his death. Red Horn's first wife, the girl in the white beaverskin wrap, gave birth to a son who had the same red hair and human heads hanging from his ears as his father. Red Horn's second wife, the giantess, also gave birth to a red haired boy, but with living faces where his nipples should have been.In another variant, the second brother has man-faces on his shoulders — Radin, \\"Redhorn's Nephews,\\" 11. The sons were spared by the giants and grew up to be very large. One day the eldest son went out to fast in order to get a blessing from the thunderbirds. He went to seek his visions at a place not far from a broad prairie where the giants had a village. He knew that the head of his father, whose hair had by now turned white, hung from a lodge pole there. When he called out to the spirits with a death song, the kind sung by prisoners about to be executed, the giants who heard it would immediately jump into the fire. When the old men of the village saw that so many of their people were jumping in the flames, they guessed at the cause, and ordered four warriors to guard the scalp pole. Two of the guards painted themselves red and the others painted themselves black. Red Horn's two sons decided then to retrieve the heads of their father and his friends. They use their powers to make special red and black arrows to kill the guards, then grabbed the heads and ran with them. As the boys ran they shot the giants with their arrows, each arrow killing many giants. When they ran out of arrows, they used their bows as clubs, almost wiping out the giants completely. A little girl with a boy that she packed on her back are spared so that the race of giants do not become extinct, but they are thrown to the other side of the sea so than will no longer be a threat. The two sons then burn the bodies of the giants and grind up their bones and spread the powder around their own village.Radin ( 1948) 131-132; Radin, \\"Redhorn's Nephews,\\" 1-16. The two sons take the head of Red Horn and ask their mothers to sleep with it, but each replies, \\"How can I sleep with that, it is only a skull?\\" The boys take all three heads and lay them in a bed in the middle of the lodge. The next day Red Horn, Turtle, and Storms as He Walks are all found alive and sleeping in the bed. Where the sons had scattered the powdered bones of the giants, all the people that the giants had killed were also found alive and sleeping. When Red Horn's wives saw this, they shouted, \\"Oh, our sons have brought our husbands back to life again!\\" The boys picked up their fathers and carried them around like children.Radin (1948) 131-132. In another variant, it is the men who carry the sons of Red Horn on their backs — Radin, \\"Redhorn's Nephews,\\" 1-16. In honor of this feat, Turtle and Storms as He Walks promise the boys special weapons. In another episode, the sons of Red Horn decide to go on the warpath. The older brother asks Storms as He Walks for the Thunderbird Warbundle. After some effort, it is produced, but the thunderbirds demand that it have a case. A friend of the sons of Red Horn offers his own body as its case. The boys take the Thunderbird Warbundle and with their followers go on a raid to the other side of the sky.Radin ( 1948) 132-134; Radin, \\"Redhorn's Nephews,\\" 1-16. Hall has shown that the mythic cycle of Red Horn and his sons has some interesting analogies with the Hero Twins mythic cycle of Mesoamerica.Hall, \\"The Cultural Background of Mississippian Symbolism\\"; Power (2004). Red Horn in archaeology Some images found in or near the SECC area may be of Red Horn, his companions, and his sons.Reilly, \\"The Petaloid Motif\\". Scattered throughout most of this area are relics of prosopic earpieces,The word \\"prosopic\\" derives from Greek πρόσωπον, \\"face\\". which must have given the wearer an appearance strikingly like that of mythical Red Horn. Other artifacts, such as the bilobed arrow, may shed light on an obscure name held by Red Horn in his youth, \\"He Who is Hit with Deer Lungs\\". Intricately carved effigy pipes have been recovered as well, one of which, nicknamed \\"Big Boy\\", has been widely identified with Red Horn. There also exist numerous depictions of a raptorial bird whose head has many human features. James A. Brown has argued that this \\"Birdman\\", who is often shown wearing prosopic earpieces, is also a form of Red Horn. Pictographs found in caves have also been related to Red Horn. Salzer contends that the scene of Panel 5 at the Gottschall Rockshelter represents Red Horn and his friends confronting the giants. At Picture Cave, discovered by Carol Diaz-Granados, there exists a pictograph the central figure of which wears prosopic earpieces, leading to the suggestion that he represents an early form of Red Horn. =Prosopic earpieces as SECC artifacts= A Long-nosed god maskette excavated from the Yokem Mound Group in Pike County, Illinois, now in the N.M.A.I. In the Ioway version of the Red Horn story, Wears Man-Heads in His Ears puts on a pair of prosopic earpieces which come to life.\\"6. Wąkx!istowi, the Man with the Human Head Earrings,\\" in Skinner (1925) 457-458. Prosopic ear ornaments have been found throughout much of the S.E.C.C. culture area in archaeological excavations and are called \\"Long-nosed god maskettes\\".Williams & Goggin (1956); Hall (1991) 30-33; Pauketat (1994) 83, 85, 91; Hall (1997) 147-149; Pauketat (2004) 114-116, 170-171; Staeck (1994); Diaz-Granados (2004) 148. See a map of their distribution in Salzer & Rajnovich (2001) 62, fig. 48; and in Hall (1991) 32. They are typically made of either copper or shell, which were highly valued materials. Most wampum belts, for instance, are made of shells strung together. In contemporary Hotcąk the standard word for wampum is worušik,Foster (1876-1877) sv \\"beads (wampum)\\"; J. O. Dorsey (1888); Houghton, \\"Turtle and a Giant\\", 16; J.W., Untitled, 2; R.S., \\"Snowshoe Strings\\", 17. a word which also denotes earrings.Miner (1984) s.v.; see Harrison, worušige- nąka, \\"the earbobs\\". It is a contraction of wa-horušik, \\"something suspended from the ears\\".The name \\"Wears Faces on His Ears\\" is made from the same stem: Ico-horušik-ka. In one story, wampum is simply called horušik (R.S., \\"Snowshoe Strings\\", 21). This shows a linguistic \\"memory\\" of a time when at least certain earpieces were considered to be wampum. The S.E.C.C. artifacts have a high degree of uniformity except for the size of the nose, which may be either short or extraordinarily long and even crooked. The face is shield-shaped, and has a crown with a notch at its top center rim. The mouth is just a short slit, but the eyes are perfectly circular and large in proportion to the head, giving them an owl-like appearance. The first of these was discovered in Big Mound within St. Louis in 1870, where they lay beside the skull in a grave.Richards (1870); Williams & Goggin (1956) 23; Hall (1997) 147. Since then nearly two score of these artifacts have been discovered in an area encompassing at least ten states.Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000) 1. S.E.C.C. pictorial art shows figures with long-nosed god maskettes on their ears, recalling the appearance of Red Horn and his sons.Phillips & Brown (ca 1975-1982); Brown (1996) 539, fig. 2-108a; Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2000) 212; Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000): 4. One of these is a sculpted pipe bowl, nicknamed \\"Big Boy\\", showing a seated young man wearing short-nosed prosopic earpieces (discussed below). They came to be called \\"Long-Nosed God\\" mask(ette)s because they were correlated with depictions of what appeared to be a deity with a very long nose.See Williams & Goggin (1956) 55-58. One of these has in addition to a long nose, a bilobed arrow attached to his hair, and a single long braid, all characteristics associated with Red Horn.Williams & Groggin (1956) 36, fig. 18. On the other hand, such beings often have a curl at the end of their noses, either bending up or down, a feature not found on their maskette counterparts. In addition a great many prosopic earpieces have only a short nose. This has led Duncan and Diaz-Granados to develop a different theory to account for the variation in nose sizes. They believe that the prosopic earpieces represent the Twins, and that they were worn by war captives who were being assimilated into their new tribe. This is chartered by one surviving Twins myth, in which the wild brother has a very long nose in contrast to the normal nose of his domesticated brother. When the wild Twin is re-adopted into his family, the father trims the nose. Ex hypothesi, the size of the nose on the prosopic earpiece given to the adopted captive was trimmed to reflect the degree to which he had been assimilated.Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000) 6. =Struck with Deer Lungs and the pipe ceremony= Not surprisingly, given his status as Chief of the Herok'a, Red Horn has a special connection to deer. The Red Horn Cycle tells us of the time when Red Horn, the youngest brother, was following his other brothers to a race to which he alone was not invited. > The people were saying, \\"Kunu (eldest born) has come and the one at whom > Kunu used to throw deer lungs, his youngest brother, he has also come > along.\\" So Kunu looked behind him and, sure enough, there was his little > brother following, wearing an untanned deerskin blanket turned inside out. > The fur was on the outside.Radin (1948) 115. His cervid identity is expressed in his going about in the outward form of a deer. Right up to the end of the story, Red Horn is known only by the name \\"He who Gets Hit with Deer Lungs,\\"Radin (1948) 115-118. The name is found only in translation. Kunu explains to his wife, \\"Once I told him to fast and he refused so I threw a deer lung at him and that is the reason why they called him by that name but no one ever hit him with a deer lung.\\"Radin (1948) 118. So Kunu had been giving him the lungs to eat, since he had refused to go without food. Far from being a poor cut of meat, it is something special. In one story, the dogs decide that if their master gives them the deer lung hanging in his lodge, they will make him prosper in game.Radin, \\"A Man and His Three Dogs\\". The reason for the gourmet value of deer lungs (ca raxúra) is explained in connection with an episode in a story entitled \\"The Fleetfooted Man\\": > There a Hotcâk village was. To a great warrior was born a baby boy. It was > very good. He grew larger, and when he was old enough to eat, whenever his > father could, he would feed him only deer lungs. He wanted him to be able to > run fast, that is why he did it.žigi Hocąk' cínoknôkšgúni. wągwášoše xetéra > hocįcįnįgią gicoínegi. p'įxjį. xetéhi nąúže, hahí warújenįk gip'į´giži ca- > raxúra šana rúcgigis'áže. sagerékjege wágiúnąkše. StCyr, \\"Fleetfoot,\\" 18. It should come as no great surprise that a diet of deer lungs might be thought to empower a person to have lungs like those of a deer, and the capacity for speed that this endowment would bequeath. So when the youngest brother is struck with deer lungs, it expresses the notion that Red Horn is someone who will have lungs like a deer and therefore a fleetness of foot that will rival a cervid. Indeed, his victory in the foot race, the major event of this episode, is a mere confirmation of this achievement. So the name that is presented as a misnomer, turns out on an esoteric level to be an understated description for the spirit who travels as fast as an arrow. Archaeologists have attempted to connect the name with a widespread pipe ceremony associated with the affirmation of kinship and adoption.Hall (1997) 151. Duncan & Diaz- Granados (2000) 1-26. These factors enter the discussion because of the relationship between Red Horn and his sons. Red Horn finds a twin in one of his sons, and a near twin in the other. It is said in the Red Horn Cycle, after the friends of Red Horn have given his sons gifts of their trademark weapons, \\"Then Red Horn said, 'My sons, I have nothing to give you, for I am not your equal and, besides, you are already just like me.' And indeed they were.\\"Radin (1948) Red Horn Cycle, §11. Most of all, the sons of Red Horn brought their father back to life. These facts have led archaeologists to see the story of Red Horn in terms of the immortality of reproduction: a man lives on in his sons, to whom he gives a genetic patrimony that makes them just like himself.Brown, \\"On the Identity of the Birdman\\" (2004) passim. Consequently, ceremonies of adoption become highly relevant to the understanding of Red Horn, since they represent a ceremonial way of conveying the fundamental meaning of the Red Horn epic. Aside from the knowledge held by Hocągara ceremonial people themselves, little is known of sacred pipe and adoption ceremonies among the Hocągara, so Hall attempts to generalize from what he concludes is a nearly universal, pan-Indian, post-contact pipe ceremony of adoption. Its paradigm is the ceremony of the Osage, a people related in speech to the Hotcągara, and Hall uses the colonial-era French term, \\"calumet\\" instead of the Osage or Hocągara names for their ceremonial pipes.The separation of the Osage from the Hotcągara dates to ca. 1000 A.D. Springer & Witkowski (1982) 69-83. Hall sums up his basic argument: > In the Iowa version the two boys put the heads of Human-head-earrings and > his two friends on the earth and shoot three arrows into the air, after > which the owners of the three heads come to life. This recalls the use of > the symbolic gesture with arrows -- the calumets -- to mediate the > reconception of the adoptee in the (Pawnee) Hako ceremony. More important, > it recalls the third name by which Red Horn or He-who-wears-human-heads-as- > earrings was known -- He-who-is-hit-with-deer-lungs -- because the owl > feathers attached to the calumets represented deer lungs. The calumet stems > represented windpipes as well as arrow shafts, and the combination of > windpipe and lungs was believed to introduce a quickening breath into the > nose of the adoptee that then descended into his chest and gave him life. > Logically, the name He-who-is-hit-with-deer-lungs could derive from a ritual > in which an impersonator of He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings was > symbolically requickened with the calumets.Hall (1997) 151. Pressing this > line of argument, Hall connects this name to the Bi-Lobed Arrow Motif of the > SECC, arguing that it may be a graphic depiction of the ceremonial pipe. > Hall, The Cultural Background of Mississippian Symbolism, in Galloway (1989) > 239-278. The Osage actually have a Deer Lung Clan which is active in the ceremony. =Big Boy= carved stone pipe nicknamed \\"Big Boy\\". \\"Big Boy\\", which was uncovered from the Great Mortuary of Craig Mound at Spiro,Brown (1996) 523b. is a large effigy pipe weighing 11 lbs., 8 oz., probably made of bauxite.Hamilton (1952) 34-35. Spectroscopic analysis has yet to be carried out on this artifact — Brown (1996) 523b. It is likely that it was originally a sculpture that was only later converted into a pipe bowl.Brown (1996) 523b. \\"Both of the holes interrupt the 'feather' or 'spade' pattern on the blanket without their being a border or rim around the holes. Just such an absence of rim would be consistent with holes drilled after the blanket pattern had been finished.\\" This remarkable artifact was first illustrated in 1952.Hamilton (1952) 33-34, plates 9-10. The figure is nude, with his hair arranged in an occipital bun and a long braid hanging over his left shoulder. His only body clothing is a cape draped over his back. The cape has a \\"spade\\" or feather design, leading most archaeologists to conclude that it was a feather cape, a mantle well known from many Native American cultures in historical times.Hamilton (1952) 34-35. Willoughby (1952) 113, comments, \\"We may be sure that feather garments from capes to long cloaks were not uncommon use throughout the United States from New England to California in early historic days, although but few of them have been preserved. Some of them were not only warm and serviceable, but were beautifully wrought in attractive designs in various colors.\\" However, it seems unlikely that it actually is a feather cape. > The blanket ... is decorated with a \\"spade\\" design, which, considering the > accuracy of detail and faithfulness of depiction in the rest of the pipe, is > a detail that should be interpreted literally rather than figuratively. In > this light, the \\"spade\\" design elements should be regarded as part of the > blanket itself.Brown (1996) 523b. It once bore a heavy coat of red ochre, some of which is still visible.Hamilton (1952) 35; Brown (1996) 523b. He also wears a flat cap with a raised border around its top which has an \\"ogee\\" design in negative relief. Brown believes that this cap \\"appears to be a case for displaying a copper plate.\\"Brown (1996) 523a. The subject of the sculpture also wears a rich, triple-strand necklace of wampum beads. His most interesting feature, however, is a pair of prosopic ear ornaments, clearly of the Short-Nosed God type.Williams & Goggin (1956) 35-37, 53. Brown (1996) 523a, thinks that the noses are short because of the \\"limitation the material places on the sculpture\\". Reilly, on the assumption that the SECC clay effigy pipes are of divine subjects, concludes, because of Big Boy's long red braid and prosopic earpieces, that he must represent \\"Morning Star\\" (by which he means Red Horn).Reilly (2004) 132. James A. Brown leans strongly towards this view, but voices a note of caution: > All told, we have in this figure a remarkable combination of the very > elements by which the Red Horn hero-deity of the Winnebago is identified in > myth. Although this might suggest that the Red Horn identification can be > extrapolated into deep antiquity, caution is dictated because of the > inherent ambiguities attendant upon the sources of our information, to say > nothing of the time spread involved.Brown in Reilly & Garber (2004) 99. In a departure from the received opinion, Duncan and Diaz-Granados contend that the prosopic earpieces represent the Twins and were used by captives being adopted into the tribe. Consequently, they view Big Boy as a representation of such an adoptee, and not as Red Horn himself.Duncan & Diaz- Granados (2000) 6. =Bird Man= Another figure found in SECC artworks is a raptor with a largely human face, who is often depicted wearing prosopic earpieces. This werebird, known as \\"Birdman\\", is also thought by some to be a form of Red Horn.Brown, \\"On the Identity of the Birdman\\", 56-106. =The Gottschall pictographs= Gottschall Rockshelter (a horizontally shallow cave), located in Muscoda, Wisconsin, contains about forty pictographs. Robert J. Salzer began to excavate the site in 1982, eight years after it had been rediscovered.Salzer (1993) 84-85. He identified Panel 5 to be of special interest, since it is a composition containing several figures that seem to be engaged in a single action.Salzer & Rajnovich (2001); Salzer (1997). For the initial descriptions of the site, see Salzer, \\"Preliminary Report\\" (1987); Salzer, \\"Wisconsin Rock Art Site\\" (1987); Salzer, \\"Introduction\\" (1987). Panel 5 is dated with a good measure of confidence to the tenth century A.D.Salzer & Rajnovich (2001) 3. At the outset, Robert L. Hall, the leader in the field, pointed out to Selzer that one of the figures in Panel 5 appeared to have attributes associated with the Red Horn mythology. > The character in your Fig. 4 has a pattern around each nipple which > resembles the long-nose god maskettes. The face[s] of the maskettes are of > the same outline as that found around each nipple on the pictograph. I first > interpreted the two parallel lines above the \\"face\\" outline as the red horn. > I now feel that they represent the long nose of the long-nosed god in a > face-on perspective which the artists could not quite handle. That leaves > the nipples for the mouth and tongue, and remember that the little faces > stuck out their tongues when manipulated. The stone Big Boy pipe from Spiro > had long-nose god maskettes on each ear, and I would guess that is what Red > Horn also wore on his ears and was the reason he was called He-who-wears- > human-heads-as-earrings.Hall (1997) 150. This is a letter from Robert L. > Hall to Bob Salzer dated July 31, 1982 (Hall (1997) 191 nt. 45). Salzer identified the other figures as being two giants, one of whom was the woman that eventually married Red Horn, and other pictographs seemed to be of Turtle and Storms-as-He-Walks, all of whom had gathered together on the occasion of the great lacrosse game between the good spirits and the giants.Salzer & Rajnovich (2001) 21-33. Salzer believes, contrary to Hall,Robert L. Hall remarks (1997) 191 nt. 45, \\"Salzer ... identifies as Red Horn himself the figure I identified as the son of Red Horn by the red-haired giant, although the figure in the cave has no little heads on his ears, as either Red Horn or Red Horn's son by the woman with the white beaver skin wrap could be expected to have had.\\" that the figure to the far right is not a son of Red Horn, but Red Horn himself.Salzer (1993) 88; Salzer & Rajnovich (2001) 63-67. The reason why we do not see prosopic earpieces is that part of the tail of the bird in the center of the panel has been painted over Red Horn's ears.Legacies News (2005) 8-9. Most archaeologists have accepted the idea that the panel is devoted to Red Horn mythology,Salzer & Rajnovich (2001); Pauketat (1994) 83, 85, 91. Pauketat (2004) 117-118, 131. although a few others have been highly skeptical.\\"It may indeed be that some of the paintings were meant to record the Red Horn myth, but the evidence falls short of convincing.\\" Mason (2000) 255. See also, Richard Dieterle in Legacies News (2005) 8-9. See \\"Gottschall: A New Interpretation.\\" =Picture Cave= The Red Horn panel from Picture Cave, Missouri.The drawing is by Richard Dieterle, based on a photograph in Carol Diaz-Granados, \\"Marking Stone, Land, Body, and Spirit,\\" in Townsend & Sharp (2004) 148, fig. 20. In Warren County, Missouri, there is a site appropriately styled \\"Picture Cave\\".Discovered in 1990 by Carol Diaz- Granados. See Diaz-Granados (Duncan) (1993). As its name suggests, it contains a wealth of pictographs, including one that has been identified with the Hotcąk spirit Red Horn (Wears Faces on His Ears).Diaz-Granados (1993); Hall (1997) 148; Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2000) 212; Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000) 4; Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2004) 146-150; Diaz-Granados, \\"Marking Stone, Land, Body, and Spirit,\\" in Townsend & Sharp (2004) 148. Other pictographs in Picture Cave have been dated from about 915 AD to 1066 AD, although the age of the \\"Red Horn\\" pictograph has so far not been determined. It differs stylistically from the other pictographs in the cave and has a patina of silica which may suggest that it is older than the others.Duncan & Diaz- Granados (2000) 4. Almost solely on the basis of the prosopic earpiece, Duncan connects the main character of this scene with Red Horn. He describes the chief figure in the panel as \\"Morning Star (known by the Winnebago as Red Horn)\\",Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2004) 146, and 148-149 (where they say he is also called \\"Hawk\\"), 150 (where one of his sons is identified with Morning Star), 203. an identification which has now become universal among archaeologists (see the section above, \\"Red Horn as a Star\\"). He also believes that the Red Horn of Picture Cave is carrying the head of Morning Star, which he describes as an act of self-resurrection. Nevertheless, at one point Duncan says, with respect to the \\"Red Horn\\" pictograph, \\"This 'early' Braden style rendering conforms to the description of He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings, or Red Horn, after he wrestled with the 'giants'. Red Horn's head is described as being carried by one of his sons ... this is an unmistakable scene at Picture Cave that is finely and delicately rendered and includes a substantial use of white pigment.\\"Diaz-Granados & Duncan (2000) 212; much the same is said at Duncan & Diaz-Granados (2000) 4.

He has been an offensive coordinator for five different National Football League (NFL) teams, the Detroit Lions from 2004 to 2005, the St. Louis Rams from 2006 to 2007, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 2008 to 2011, the Oakland Raiders from 2013 to 2014, and the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2015 to 2016. During 2017, Olson served as the Los Angeles Rams quarterbacks coach replacing Chris Weinke. In 2018, Olson returned to Oakland to be their offensive coordinator, reuniting him with former mentee quarterback Derek Carr. Coaching career=Purdue University= Olson was offensive coordinator and quarterback coach at Central Washington University from 1990-1993, where he coached 16 year NFL veteran quarterback Jon Kitna. While at Central, Olson also coached the university's wrestling team. Prior to joining the CWU coaching staff, he was a graduate assistant at Washington State University for three seasons. He coached the defensive backs at WSU for one season and was the linebacker coach for two years. He also coached running backs at Spokane Falls Community College in 1986. After leaving CWU, Olson coached quarterbacks at Purdue University, where he played a key role in helping OC Jim Chaney in the development of future Pro Bowler and Super Bowl- winning quarterback Drew Brees. Under Chaney and Olson, Brees was a Heisman Trophy finalist in 1999 and 2000 while winning the Maxwell Award as the nation's most outstanding player in 2000. Olson previously served as the quarterbacks coach of the Detroit Lions, where he worked with Joey Harrington. He served as Lions offensive coordinator following the firing of Steve Mariucci and the demotion of Ted Tollner during the 2005 season. =St. Louis Rams= He was the offensive coordinator of the St. Louis Rams from 2006-2007. In his first year with the Rams in 2006, he helped guide a high-powered offense that ranked sixth in the NFL in total offense (360.4 yards per game) and a passing offense that ranked third (247.6) in the NFC. Under Olson's direction the Rams became just the fourth team in NFL history to produce a 4,000 yard passer (Marc Bulger), a 1,500 yard rusher (Stephen Jackson) and two 1,000 yard receivers (Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce). Bulger, Holt and Bruce were all selected to the Pro Bowl. Bulger also posted career-highs in passing yards (4,301), passing touchdowns (24), and passing attempts (588) and completions (370) while ranking second in the NFL in interception percentage (1.4%). Jackson also had a career-year in 2006, leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage with 2,334, and he led all NFL running backs with 90 receptions and was fifth in the NFL in rushing yards with 1,528. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= In January 2008, Olson was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to be their quarterbacks coach following the dismissal of Paul Hackett. On September 3, 2009, the day before the team's final preseason game, the Buccaneers announced that Olson would replace Jeff Jagodzinski as Offensive Coordinator. Olson was responsible for the development of QB Josh Freeman, the 17th overall pick in the 2009 draft. Under Olson's guidance, Freeman threw for 8,898 yards and 51 touchdowns in his first three seasons as a starter. In 2011, Freeman ranked eighth in the NFL with a 62.8 completion percentage and 13th with 3,592 passing yards. In Olson's second season as offensive coordinator with the Bucs in 2010, Freeman ranked sixth in the NFL with a 95.9 passer rating while throwing for 3,451 yards, 25 touchdowns and only six interceptions. Olson helped guide the Buccaneers to one of their best offensive seasons in team history, setting franchise records for yards per play (5.61), average per rush (4.64 yards), average per pass play (7.21), passer rating (96.2) and fewest interceptions thrown (six). The Buccaneers also finished with the fourth-most points scored (341), third-most yards in total offense (5,362) and second-best third down percentage (42.2%) in a single season in team history. The Buccaneers were the youngest team in the NFL in 2010 and WR Mike Williams, a fourth-round draft pick, finished the year leading all rookie receivers in the league in every major receiving category while setting a single-season team record with 11 touchdown receptions. RB LeGarrette Blount's 1,007 rushing yards led all rookie running backs and he became just the second undrafted rookie running back in NFL history to finish with over 1,000 yards. It marked the first time since 1968 that a team had two different players lead all rookies in rushing and receiving yards. He was fired on January 2, 2012, after his team posted a 4–12 record. =Stints with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Oakland Raiders= In January 2012, Olson was hired to be the Assistant Head coach/quarterbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars. In January 2013, Olson was hired to be the offensive coordinator of the Oakland Raiders, taking over for the recently fired Greg Knapp. In 2014, Olson was fired as offensive coordinator of the Oakland Raiders. On January 21, 2015, Olson was hired to be the offensive coordinator of the Jacksonville Jaguars. On October 29, 2016, Olson was fired from Jaguars following a loss to the Tennessee Titans. =Los Angeles Rams= On January 18, 2017, it was announced by the Los Angeles Times that Olson would be hired by the Los Angeles Rams to serve as the quarterbacks coach, under head coach Sean McVay. =Return to Oakland= Following the Rams elimination from the playoffs, Olson returned to the Oakland Raiders as their offensive coordinator under returning head coach Jon Gruden. Personal life Olson is a 1981 graduate of Richland High School. At Richland, he lettered in football, baseball and wrestling. In football, he earned all-conference honors at quarterback and linebacker. He played two seasons at Spokane Falls, earning all-conference quarterback honors in 1982, prior to transferring to Central Washington University in Ellensburg, Washington.

He devoted his entire career to violin making. He was a very prolific violin maker, making more than 700 instruments including violas and cellos. His son, Pietro Sgarabotto (1903–1990), born in Milan, retired 1971, still produced masterworks as late as 1979; both worked for their entire lives in Italy as master violin makers. Gaetano S. worked initially in the city of Vicenza for many years before moving to Milan in 1901 to work for Leandro Bisiach. He moved to Parma in 1926, where he stayed almost without interruptions until his death in 1959. His son, Pietro, continued in his father’s profession and also became a master violin maker in his own right. Today one speaks within initiated circles with the utmost admiration of the brief, but prestigious dynasty of violin makers Sgarabotti. This refers to the historical presence of both these masters who, apart from creating their own master instruments, spent much of their time passing on experience to young violin makers. Indeed the activity of the Sgarabotto makers was very influential in the violin making school of Parma, Cremona and elsewhere. Much could be said about their combined influence on the cultural heritage within the musical world of string instruments, and of the enormous regard and esteem with which all their students and musicians held the masters. The greatest interest by posterity, of course, centers on their combined oeuvre, on the set of master violins from their hand left for us to play and admire. The works of both the Sgarabotto makers can be readily identified by their meticulous choice of materials, the workmanship always being exquisitely “manual” in every phase of the making of each instrument, and showing extreme precision and loving care to detail. The violin making of the Sgarabotto makers is always graceful, that of the father Gaetano said to be presenting a lighter touch whilst the graduation used by Pietro is more consistent. The sonority and general musical quality of these master violins of course shall forever be residing in their handling by the musicians and experts who are fortunate enough to play a Sgarabotto violin, viola, violoncello…. Gaetano e Pietro Sgarabotto-Liutai Violin Makers 1878-1990 Editrice TURRIS 1991 Gaetano Sgarabotto in his workshop 1929 Quotes Liuteria Parmense - In Parma, the 20th century tradition (of violin making) commenced with Gaetano Sgarabotto, who served his apprenticeship in the workshop of the Bisiachs, and can therefore be traced back to a Milanese origin. As is known, after the death of the last great Cremonese Masters after the middle of the 18th century, only the Cerutis remained in Cremona to prevent that memorable tradition from dying out completely. It was the Antoniazzis who undertook the task of transferring the scant knowledge saved from oblivion from Cremona to Milan. However the most important event for the renaissance of violin-making in Lombardy was certainly the meeting between Riccardo Antoniazzi and Leandro Bisiach; the latter, thanks to his talent, his taste and his business ability succeeded in founding, at the end of the 19th century, a workshop which soon gained international fame. Bisiach was an outstanding figure in the commerce of antique violins but above all had the merit of raising a generation of great luthiers, among whom for example Sderci, Borghi, Ornati and Garimberti come to mind. Gaetano Sgarabotto, another of Leandro Bisiach's pupils was born in 1878 in Vicenza; while still very young he had demonstrated a talent for violin- making. After his experience in Milan, Gaetano moved to Parma in 1926 and two years later was given the task of directing the School of Violin-Making which had been annexed to the Conservatory of Music. The school concluded its experience after nine years, in 1937, but in the meantime had distinguished itself for the quality of its teaching. The proof of this is that luthiers such as Sesto Rocchi, Raffaele Vaccari and of course Gaetano's son Pietro were among its pupils. Gaetano was a most prolific and eclectic maker, and created instruments drawing inspiration from many different authors. Among this great variety of styles, his preferences were for the Amatis' models and Guadagnini forms. After the closure of the school Gaetano lived in Parma for long periods, from 1942 to 1948 and again from 1957 until his death in 1959. His son Pietro, who was also a musician, lived and worked at length in Parma before being called to teach in the school of Cremona. For almost half a century, this experience of the first public School of violin-making seemed to have died out forever. But evidently the memory of this tradition was still alive because in 1975 the School returned to its place in the Conservatory under the direction of Renato Scrollavezza.\\" Liuteria Parmense Bibliography Gaetano e Pietro Sgarabotto-Liutai Violin Makers 1878-1990 Editrice TURRIS 1991 References * * Gaetano e Pietro Sgarabotto-Liutai Violin Makers 1878-1990 Editrice TURRIS 1991 * Jost Thoene, Italian & French Makers (2006) * Marlin Brinser, Dictionary of 20th Century Italian Violin Makers (1978) * Carlo Vettori, I Maestri Del Novecento (1992)  Versari Artemio, Modern Violin Making in the Emilia-Romagna Region (2002) * Liuteria Parmense External sources Bisiach Family Heritage. by Philip J.

It was the first game designed by Cartwright. The idea for Barnstorming came to him as he watched a biplane one day while driving home from work.Classic Gaming at GameSpy Gameplay The player must pilot a biplane through a series of barns in the shortest time possible while dodging windmills, weather vanes, and geese. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time. There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course. Originally, a player with a time or better of 33.3 seconds on game 1, 51.0 seconds on game 2, or 54.0 seconds on game 3 could send Activision a picture of their screen and receive membership in the Activision Flying Aces and receive a Flying Aces patch.

Episcopacy On April 4, 2005, Jackels was consecrated by Archbishop Joseph Fred Naumann of Kansas City, Kansas. Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, and Thomas J. Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona served as co-consecrators. Among other bishops in attendance were Bishop Paul Coakley of Salina, Kansas; Bishop Ronald Gilmore of Dodge City, Kansas; and Eugene Gerber, bishop emeritus of Wichita. Because of the size of the crowd in attendance and the small size of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, Jackels' consecration took place at the larger Church of the Magdalen. =Bishop of Wichita= Bishop Jackels joined the other three Kansas bishops in approving a pastoral letter opposing embryonic stem cell research. He has spoken against same-sex marriage and abortion, as well. He also opposes the death penalty and has written in the diocesan newspaper, Advance, in favor of what he views as more just immigration laws. He also voted to approve language changes in the Mass to bring the English translation into a better accord with the original Latin at the June 2006 meetings of the USCCB in Los Angeles. In areas outside of doctrine, he is active in promoting Catholic education, and helped to establish the Drexel Fund which calls for donations to help financially strapped Catholic schools within the diocese. The diocese has 48 seminarians, one of the highest numbers of seminarians per capita of diocesan Catholics in the United States. On May 30, 2008, Jackels served as a co-consecrator to Auxiliary Bishop James D. Conley of Denver, Colorado, who was a priest of the diocese of Wichita prior to his appointment on April 10, 2008.Profile at Catholic Hierarchy website Bishop Jackels joins young Catholics in the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. =Archbishop of Dubuque= On April 8, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Jackels archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque.

It is set in Orange County, California and involves an evil clown as a serial killer. The film was released direct-to-video on May 29, 2007. Plot Brandon Meeks (Edward DeRuiter), Tony (Haven Lamoureux) and their girlfriends, Brittany (Jessica Landon) and Tiffany (Nicole Cavazos) arrive at the fast food restaurant Hella Burger. Upon placing an order at the drive-thru, the drive through teller insults them and Tony breaks into the restaurant to confront the teller. He searches the restaurant and Horny the Clown, the mascot of Hella Burger and the one who had been insulting the group over the drive-thru intercom, jumps out and attacks him. Brandon enters the restaurant to look for Tony and ends up finding him dead, with his face in the fryer. He is then attacked and murdered by Horny with a meat cleaver. Horny then proceeds outside and kills both Brittany and Tiffany when they discover the bodies of their boyfriends in the backseat. Meanwhile, Mackenzie (Leighton Meester) is having a house party with her boyfriend Fisher (Nicholas D'Agosto), and friends Val (Sita Young), Van (Penn Badgley) and Starfire (Rachael Bella). The group find a ouija board and decide to ask it what their future will hold, to which the ouija board spells out \\"N1KLPL8\\", a message that is unclear until the next day when the group see a news bulletin, showing the message is the license plate on Brandon's car. The following day at school, Val is ambushed by Horny in the locker room. Mackenzie complains that someone stole her camera at the party, but after school the janitor, Eddie (Sean Whalen), gives her the camera. Mackenzie stays behind to develop the photos, and discovers that they show the deaths of the four murdered teenagers. Horny chases Mackenzie into the gymnasium, where she finds Val's head has been placed in a modified microwave, to which it is turned on and causes Val's head to explode, killing her. Horny chases Mackenzie throughout the school, where she finds Lenny has been hanged, before bumping into a police officer, who fails to find any bodies. Mackenzie is taken down to the police station with her mom, Marcia (Melora Hardin) and dad, Bill (Paul Ganus) to be questioned by Detective Brenda Chase (Lola Glaudini) and Detective Dwayne Crockers (Larry Joe Campbell). The two detectives don't believe Mackenzie's story, but do suspect Lenny as the killer. The next day, the detectives visit Jack Benjamin (John Gilbert), the owner of Hella Burger, who proves to be no help in solving the case. That night, Mackenzie and Fisher get ready to work at a carnival's haunted house. As they work, they have an argument with Chad (Tyler King) and Tina (Maliabeth Johnson), before they go into the ride. Suddenly, the lights are switched off. Chad is decapitated off- screen and Tina is stabbed to death by Horny. Mackenzie and Starfire enter the haunted house and find Fisher in a state of shock after witnessing the murders. Mackenzie goes to visit Fisher in the hospital with Marcia. Mackenzie becomes annoyed with her mother as she now believes she is hiding something from her, as all the so far murdered teenagers are the children of her old high-school friends. Detective Chase overhears this and questions Tina's father, Bert (Robert Curtis Brown). Meanwhile, Horny attacks Spanky and Chuck inside the funhouse inside Hella Burger, killing them both. As Mackenzie arrives home, Marcia finally admits that when she was young, she and her friends accidentally killed Archie Benjamin (Van De La Plante), Jack Benjamin's son, on his 18th birthday at Hella Burger, and now his vengeful spirit has returned from the dead to kill the children of his murderers as revenge for being bullied and harassed by them, along with the rest of his peers. Mackenzie and Fisher are attacked by Horny in a house, resulting in Mackenzie being knocked unconscious and Fisher being cornered. Fisher manages to unmask Horny, whose eyes become bloodshot upon looking at Horny's burnt and deformed face. Archie then hurls Fisher through a window. Meanwhile, Detective Chase and Detective Crockers come to the house and find Jack Benjamin behind his own bed, trying to hide from Archie, and they arrest him believing that he is behind the murders. Mackenzie wakes up in Hella Burger, tied to a chair with her mouth gagged and surrounded by the bodies of her friends. A birthday cake is in front of her, as it is now her 18th birthday. Horny appears and reveals his true plan before dousing her with gasoline and holds a lit candle close to her face, about to repeat what Marcia did to him years ago. Marcia arrives and shoots Archie in the mouth but with no effect, who in turns chokes her out. Mackenzie takes a drink of whiskey from a flask that she has with her and holds it in her mouth. Horny torments her with another candle while cackling evilly at her face to face, unaware that Mackenzie has the whiskey in her mouth. She spits the whiskey at him, setting him on fire. Mackenzie and Marcia escape as Horny burns to death. Mackenzie and Marcia rush to the hospital to see Fisher, whose eyes are still bloodshot, revealing that Archie's spirit has possessed Fisher's body. Mackenzie goes in to see him only to find the window open and his discarded clothes thrown outside on the ground, implying that Archie will continue his murderous rampage through Fisher's body. Detective Crockers goes to Hella Burger and places an order at the drive thru, only for Horny to jump onto the hood of his patrol car, killing him through the windshield off-screen.

Cowles and Kuhn were two of the original organizers of the Slamdance Film Festival.https://slamdance.com/slamdance-extended-family/ Shane Kuhn received a master's degree in Screenwriting from the American Film Institutehttp://www.davesaysmoviesmatter.com/interview-shane-kuhn.html, but was relatively new to Hollywood, having previously written novels. After feeling unable to express his creativity the way he wanted to, he discontinued his work as a writer/director and returned to novel writing, as well as working in advertising and motion graphics. In an interview with Who Asked You?, Kuhn stated, \\"When I write a novel, the world is massive, the characters vivid, and there are almost no constraints. Screenwriting is constrained and technical. It’s very difficult to add deep layers to that kind of work. Movies are a directors’ medium, full stop. TV is different. Writers can live and breathe in that world, but not movies. You have a finite amount of time/pages and a very unforgiving story structure. Not to mention the fact that you might sell the damn thing only to have it sit on a shelf FOREVER. To me, screenwriting is like failing to follow Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory rules. It’s tempting, but a total waste of your golden ticket.\\"https://whoaskedyoublog.wordpress.com/2017/08/18/interview-with-shane- kuhn/ On the contrary, Cowles continued to write several other screenplays after Drive-Thru, but did not direct any other films. The writers of this film paid homage multiple times to John Carpenter's Halloween. Leighton Meester's character's name Mackenzie Carpenter is a clear reference to John Carpenter, in addition to a famous line spoken by Jamie Lee Curtis in the film (\\"Go down to the Mackenzie's and call the police.\\") Additionally, when Fisher comes into the room, there is a point-of-view shot which bears a heavy resemblance to the intro of Halloween, and he is then seen in blue coveralls similar to those worn by Michael Myers. Casting Drive-Thru starred Leighton Meester and Penn Badgley, who both later starred on The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl. The film was cast by Amy Lippens and Stephanie Laffin, who have worked as casting directors together on films such as Saw II, Nine Lives, and Keeping Up with the Steins. Meester and Badgley are not the only cast members who went on to have successful acting careers. Drive-Thru also stars Melora Hardin, who later starred in films such as 17 Again and 27 Dresses. Another Drive-Thru star, Nicholas D'Agosto has since acted primarily in television, starring in shows including Grace and Frankie, Gotham, and Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23. Cinematography Vincent E. Toto was the cinematographer for Drive-Thru. The year before, he was the cinematographer for another horror film, Dark Ride, which received a similar audience response. The camera used for this film was a Panavision Panaflex Gold II. Editing Editing was done by Daniel R. Padgett, who has worked in the editorial department of many films of different genres, including The Royal Tenenbaums and Space Jam.https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0869397/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr16 Filming Drive-Thru was shot in Los Angeles, California. Release The film was released on DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment on May 29, 2007 and in Canada by Maple Pictures at the same day. Before Drive-Thru was released in the United States and Canada, it was released on DVD in Germany two months earlier, as well as being released on television in the UK on March 31, 2007. Besides these four 2007 releases, Drive-Thru went on to premiere in Mexico (May 2009) and Germany (May 2011). Drive-Thru was released under several different titles depending on the country, such as Burger Kill (Canada and France), Fast Food Killer (Spain), and Death Burger (Japan). The USA working title of this film was Hellaburger. Reception Popcorn Pictures gave the film a negative review, writing \\"Really hard to sit through despite the promise of a killer clown, Drive Thru is eighty-three minutes of pure fast food junk. Like a fast food burger, it may look good when you pick it up but as soon as you take your first bite, you realize you’ve made a horrible mistake and all you’ve got left is an ultimately fatty concoction of things that are bad for your health.\\" Dread Central panned the film calling the film's dialogue \\"painfully bad\\" and criticized the film's ending. DVD Talk called it \\"routine slice and dice dreariness\\", criticizing its inadequate humor, \\"callous characterization\\", and lack of actual scares. Despite the negative reception, the film has gained a massive cult following. Legacy Drive-Thru continues to get the attention of horror film critics, having several film review articles and videos made about the film between 2019 and 2020. The film is often included in watch lists regarding killer clowns. Drive-Thru was featured in two different episodes of Phelous & the Movies.

It is primarily notable for the substantial ruins of a Byzantine and early Islamic town which are clearly visible above the ground, as well as an older Roman village (locally referred to as al-Herri) located to the southwest of the Byzantine ruins.  Overview  The ruins from atop the barracks Umm el-Jimal is a large village located in northern Jordan less than 10 km from the Syrian border. It is located in the Hauran, the northern desert region of the country. Despite this aridity, Umm el-Jimal is surprisingly well suited for agriculture, and its livelihood and economy is largely derived from agricultural and pastoral sustenance. The ruins of an ancient village lie in the midst of modern Umm el-Jimal. The ruins date from the Nabataean through the Abbasid periods. The earthquake of circa AD 749 did major damage, but the community survived well into the Abbasid period. In the early twentieth century the area was repopulated by the Druze and then the Bedouin Msa'eid tribe.  History  The village of Umm el-Jimal originated in the first century AD as a rural suburb of the ancient Nabataean capital of Bostra. A number of Greek and Nabataean inscriptions found on the site date the village to this time. During the first century, the population of the site is estimated at 2,000-3,000 people. Upon the foundation of Provincia Arabia in AD 106, the Romans took over the village as Emperor Trajan incorporated the surrounding lands into the empire. In the village, the Romans erected a number of buildings including the Praetorium and the large reservoir near the castellum. After the Rebellion of Queen Zenobia in 275, Roman countermeasures included the construction of a fort (Tetrarchic castellum) that housed a military garrison. As Roman influence in the area gradually diminished, the area once again became a rural village. During the 5th and 6th centuries, Umm el-Jimal prospered as a farming and trading town in which the population jumped to an estimated 4,000-6,000 people. However, after the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the village population diminished even though building projects and renovations continued to take place. In circa 749, an earthquake destroyed much of the area and Umm el-Jimal was abandoned like other towns and villages. The village remained uninhabited for nearly eleven hundred years until the modern community developed in the twentieth century. = Prehistory = Little is known of pre-historical times in Umm el-Jimal, aside from the few scattered remains of what appear to be settlements of nomadic hunter- gatherer tribes. In some of these places it is possible to find chert knapping stones and some prehistoric tools. In the nearby wadis the remains of kites, which are large animal traps, have been found. The prehistoric people would have used these to catch large groups of animals at once (Hoksbergen 2010). Benjamin Hoksbergen, \\"The Oldest Components: The Paleolithic at Umm el-Jimal,\\" Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan 54 (Amman 2010). = Nabataean = The Nabataean peoples were the first to build permanent homesteads in the area in the first century AD. The settlement was mainly a farming community and a trading outpost dependent on Bostra, the nearby capital of the Nabataeans. Though the evidence for this village survives only in fragments, there are numerous Nabataean inscriptions from this period, mostly tomb stones. At least two men mentioned on these served as members of the Bostra City Council (de Vries, Bert).Bert de Vries et al, Umm el-Jimal: A Nabataean, Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic Town in Northern Jordan, Vol. I, Supplement, Journal of Roman Archaeology, 1998. = Early Roman = As the Romans continued their conquest of the surrounding areas, the Nabataean king saw his state's demise as inevitable, so he ceded his kingdom to the Roman emperor Trajan in AD 106. The Romans named the newly acquired territory Provincia Arabia and promptly set up local governments. The Praetorium, so named by H. C. Butler in 1905, may have been built for this purpose in the third century AD. = Late Roman = Everything changed after the rebellion led by Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in AD 275. The local people were no longer allowed to govern themselves, but had to submit to harsh foreign rule. Due to its location on the fringe of the Empire, Umm el-Jimal became a military outpost complete with a garrison and a new Tetrarchic-era fort. As Roman imperial power began to diminish, this earlier castellum lost its military function, and Umm el-Jimal gradually transformed from a military station to a civilian town. Paradoxically, from the point of view of the local Arab residents of the Hauran, this change may have been viewed as liberation rather than decline. = Byzantine = The Roman provincial administrators were replaced by Byzantine rulers in the fifth century. One of the rulers, Dux Pelagius, built smaller military quarters. These quarters were the later castellum, which is now known as the Barracks. As the local population gradually converted to Christianity the town reemerged as a prosperous agricultural and trading community. The 150 houses still standing today were constructed in this period, the fifth and sixth centuries. In the sixth century there was an explosion of church construction, 15 of which can still be seen today. The population continued to grow, reaching an estimated 6,000 inhabitants. In the seventh century, however, power of the region was ceded to the Islamic Umayyad Empire. = Umayyad = The Islamic era at Umm el-Jimal began in 640 when the Rashidun Caliphs took control of the area. Much remodeling was done throughout the site so as to repurpose buildings to suit their own needs. The Praetorium and House XVIII are examples of buildings repurposed as dwelling places, while House 53 was possibly repurposed into a mosque. Despite all of this, the population decreased and the site was slowly abandoned with the help of an earthquake in circa 749 that destroyed many buildings and set much of the architecture off balance. The site was completely deserted under the Abbasid Caliphs in the ninth century. = Arab Revolt = T.E. Lawrence wrote of \\"ruined Um el Jemal\\", \\"There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind in these Roman frontier cities, Um el Jemal, Um el Surab, Umtaiye. Such incongruous buildings, in what was then and now a desert cockpit, accused their builders of insensitiveness; almost of a vulgar assertion of man's right (Roman right) to live unchanged in all his estate.\\"  Religion = Nabataean = There are a number of altars to Nabataean gods located on the site of Petra, including Dushara Aarra. Dushara, a god of Petra, is linked to Aarra, the patron god of Bostra, who become a unique regional deity. Both the Nabataean and Greek versions of his name can be seen inscribed on the die (middle section) of an altar, found in the western area of the ruins. Another god present at the site is Zeus Epikoos, a mixture of Zeus and the local deity Epikoos. In this case an altar was found in a courtyard, representative of a regional god. The altar found at Umm el-Jimal suggests personal devotion by a local resident to this deity. The third deity found at Umm el-Jimal is Solmos, who is not known elsewhere and may also be a local deity, perhaps only worshipped by the people of Umm el-Jimal and the immediate surrounding area. His name is found only once, on an altar inscription in the main ruins of Umm el-Jimal. Because this is the only known evidence of the worship of Solmos, it is reasonable to believe his worshipers were relatively few and localized. There is evidence on tombstones and small altars scattered throughout the site that suggests the worship of other deities, perhaps personal or familial gods not worshiped communally.Bert de Vries, \\"Between the Cults of Syria and Arabia: Traces of Pagan Religion at Umm el-Jimal.\\" Studies in the History and Archaeology of Jordan X. Amman: Department of Antiquities of Jordan (2009): 177-192. = Early Roman Pagan = Due to the tolerant nature of the early Roman occupation, little was contested during this period. The people of the region were able to continue their religious practices they had followed prior to the Roman occupation. Thus, it is likely that many of the regional gods like Zeus Epikoos and Solmos were still worshiped as the local deities. Late Roman Temple = Late Roman = After the rebellion of Palmyra most of the regional religious practices stopped altogether. This was due to harsh restrictions that were implemented by the Roman government to ensure that the people would not rise up again. There is evidence however, that a small Roman shrine surviving in House 49 may have served the garrison that was stationed in the Tetrarchic castellum. Late Roman Temple = Christianity/Byzantium = The West Church The Byzantine Empire is representative of the Christianization of the Roman Empire by Constantine in the early fourth century AD. The change in religious affiliation influenced even the far reaches of the Empire, and is therefore evident here in Umm el-Jimal. Christian symbols can be found throughout the site carved into stone and by the architectural influences. The doctrinal shift in clergy-laity (parishioner) relations is represented by the addition of altar screens in the front of the churches and narthexes to their entries. Besides Christianity's influence through the construction of multiple churches on the site, some complexes may have had monastic use. The later castellum (Barracks) was converted into a monastery by the addition of a chapel to the main building. The towers, which were also added, are inscribed with the names of the four archangels and other Christian inscriptions. The inscriptions give the impression that these successful residents relied for protection more directly on God, to whom they felt close, rather than on an emperor who seemed so far away. = Islam = Umayyad Umm el-Jimal appears to have been part Christian and part Muslim with the two religious groups coexisting under the policy of the Dhimma. Scholars debate the idea that some of the churches in Umm el-Jimal were converted into mosques. In these former churches, the apse was blocked off and the focus of the structure's space was shifted south towards Mecca. Whether this is the case or not, it is more evident that two houses were converted to mosques with typically Umayyad plans and a small tower on the exterior of its west face indicating the presence of a minaret. The predominant Muslim modern community is served by several newly constructed mosques outside the antiquities (de Vries, Bert).  Location  The village of Umm el-Jimal is located in the semi-arid region of Jordan known as the Southern Hauran, at the western edge of the desert Badiya region. The area consists mainly of the igneous rock basalt, which was used as the primary building material. Basalt also served as a natural insulation which was extremely important in the area. In the cool winter months the basalt blocks would trap the heat from the sun and then radiate that heat throughout the structure, thus acting as a natural heating source. In the hot summer months it would serve as a cooling unit because the dense nature of the blocks trapped the cool air within the structure, despite the fact that temperatures exceed 100 °F. The volcanic nature of the soil has made it one of the most fertile areas in Jordan and Syria.  Demographics  The estimated population during the Nabataean period is unknown, because evidence of a residential community was obliterated by the later construction phases. However, because the town was likely a major trading post along the same route as Bostra, the population could have been several thousand strong. Numerous Nabataean and Greek tombstones testify to their presence. Based on the number of structures, the peak population was likely in the sixth century perhaps 3,000-7,000 people. In the Byzantine and Umayyad periods houses were occupied by both people and pastoral animals. In the Umayyad period a smaller number survived at Umm el-Jimal. While some buildings were not occupied, it was still a prosperous place and some new farmstead-type houses were constructed with characteristic Umayyad mangers. By 900, the town was abandoned. It is unknown as to why, but it was most likely due to the same reasons that the greater population of the wider region of Syria decreased; i.e., plague, draught, earthquakes, etc. (B. de Vries). Aside from these basic numbers, the general range of poor to wealthy households is largely unknown for most of the different eras of occupation. The location of the site suggests that it was rather small, but the number of buildings and churches suggest otherwise (de Vries, Bert).Bert de Vries, \\"Paradox of Power: Between Local and Imperial at Umm El-Jimal,\\" Ch 53 in Crossing Jordan: North American Contributions to the Archaeology of Jordan.

Equinox Publishing, Ltd, 2007. http://www.ichaj.org/contributions-volume.php=\\"4\\"  Archaeology  Excavation site C2 Umm el-Jimal was rediscovered in the nineteenth century, during a time of Western interest in antiquities. The first systematic survey was completed by the Princeton University Expedition to Southern Syria in 1905 and 1909. The first recorded visit to the site was by William John Bankes (1786-1855) in 1818 who conducted a brief description of Umm el-Jimal. Between 1818 and 1905 many Westerners passed through the site and made a few recordings but all were brief and inconclusive. Howard Crosby Butler led the Princeton Expedition and his papers (PES II: 151) contain a more exhaustive account of those who came to Umm el-Jimal between 1818 and 1905. Butler remained at the site for two weeks mapping the site and drawing diagrams of several of the buildings. Butler's work has proved invaluable in guiding others to the site and in garnering further interest in studying the site. His survey of 1905 provided the groundwork for the field work still being conducted today. G. Corbett came to Umm el-Jimal in 1956 to study the Julianos Church and much of his work corrected the mistakes made by Butler. Corbett also refined how Umm el-Jimal is thought of today by demonstrating that many of the buildings were constructed reusing pieces from earlier buildings. In 1972 comprehensive work was started at Umm el-Jimal by Bert de Vries of Calvin College. The ancient village was further mapped out and detailed work conducted refining the theories surrounding the nature and history of the village. The work has included conservation practices. In 1977 the walls of the Barracks were fortified with cement to prevent more collapse. The gate area of House XVIII was also fortified in 1983 with modern cement. Excavations were conducted during field work between 1972 and 1998, though the nature of the excavations was for survey and research and not for uncovering buried ruins. Since 1998 the work has centered on presentation and visual documentation of the site. Started in 2009, efforts are currently being conducted to make the site more presentable to the public (421-435).Bert de Vries, \\"The Umm el-Jimal Project, 1993 and 1994 Field Seasons,\\" Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan 39, 1995, pp. 421-435. A significant component of this effort is the development of a virtual museum with site tours, a compilation of the research and publications, and presentation of the heritage of the modern community and its relationship to the antiquities at www.ummeljimal.org . In 2014, extensive damage was done to the site by tomb raiders. Sparked by rumors of gold, looters have destroyed many tombs. \\"The looters are looking not only for gold but for ceramics, glassware, lamps, masonry and bits of jewelry, all of which quickly find their way into the global antiquities trade.\\"  Notes  External links  * www.ummeljimal.org Category:Populated places in Mafraq Governorate Category:Tourism in Jordan Category:Roman sites in Jordan Jimal Category:Byzantine sites in Asia ","title":"Umm el-Jimal"},{"id":"10382585","text":"Atlantis is an album by American jazz musician Sun Ra and his Astro-Infinity Arkestra, released in 1969 by El Saturn Records.

Roeser (July 23, 1928 – May 29, 2011) was a Chicago-based conservative writer and broadcaster, who broadcast for many years on WLS 890 AM talk radio.See Tom Roeser's page at WLS He also was the founder and former chairman of the editorial board of a Chicago Internet newspaper, The Chicago Daily Observer, as well as a lecturer, teacher and former vice president of the Quaker Oats Company. Early life and education Roeser was born in Evanston, Illinois on July 23, 1928 and graduated from Saint Juliana elementary school and the William Howard Taft High School in Chicago. He graduated from Saint John's University (Minnesota) in Collegeville, Minnesota with a bachelor's in English literature. He continued his education in graduate studies at DePaul (English), Loyola University of Chicago (political science) and Harvard University (political science). He was a former John F. Kennedy Fellow at Harvard University and a fellow with the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation based in Princeton, New Jersey. Professional career After a short time spent in the advertising agency business in Chicago, Roeser moved to Minnesota in 1953 to become the city editor of the Saint Cloud Daily Times, serving also as a stringer for the Associated Press. He was named director of research and news-information for the Minnesota Republican party in 1955 where he stayed until 1958, supervising the party's communications program, including media coverage and advertising. In 1958 he was named press secretary to a newly elected Republican congressman, Rep. Albert H. Quie of Minnesota. The following year, 1959, he served in addition as press secretary to Rep. Walter H. Judd of Minnesota, then the ranking Republican on the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs. In 1960 with election of a Republican governor of Minnesota, Elmer L. Andersen, Roeser was appointed news secretary and supervised news dissemination for state government. At the completion of Andersen's term, Roeser returned to the Minnesota Republican party in an enhanced role: director of communications where he served from 1963 to 1964 when he left to return to Chicago to initiate a program of public affairs and government relations as well as community relations for The Quaker Oats Company. Roeser launched Quaker's government relations program as well as its urban affairs program in the inner city of Chicago and at plant locations throughout the company. He remained in this position with Quaker Oats until 1969 when he was recruited by the Nixon administration as an assistant to the United States Secretary of Commerce to begin a new federal program involving aid to minority business enterprise. He formed the nation's first program to assist minority business (now the Minority Business Development Agency). In 1970 in a dispute with the Nixon administration which, he felt, was not serious about the program, he recommended the abolition of his own agency. This was highly unpopular and he was let go by the administration, but which also appointed him as director- public affairs and Congressional relations for the Peace Corps. As a foreign service officer, he managed the agency's worldwide communications and advertising program until The Quaker Oats Company requested he return to it — which he did in 1971 — after which he became its vice president-government relations. He became the first corporate lobbyist to be appointed Fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of Government, serving in its Institute of Politics where he taught in addition to continuing his role — on leave — at Quaker. Shortly thereafter he was named a Woodrow Wilson International Fellow in Princeton, New Jersey. On returning to Chicago to resume full-time duties at Quaker he also taught after hours at the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania; the Kellogg School, Northwestern University; Loyola University of Chicago; DePaul University; the University of Illinois-Chicago and Saint John's College, Oxford. In addition, while continuing his work at Quaker, he became an op-ed writer for The Chicago Sun-Times, following which he wrote for The Chicago Tribune and wrote op-eds for The Wall Street Journal.  Political work  Long active in Chicago civic, religious and political life, Roeser was a founder of Project LEAP (Legal Elections in All Precincts), the city's anti-vote-fraud organization, was president of the City Club of Chicago for seventeen years and its chairman; was chairman, founder of the Republican Assembly of Illinois, an organization of grassroots conservative Republicans, and a co-founder of Catholic Citizens of Illinois. He was a member of the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars, a board member of the Howard Center, Rockford and program chairman of Legatus (Chicago), an organization of Catholic CEOs and was vice chairman of Haymarket Center, Chicago, a leading rehabilitation center for victims of alcohol and substance abuse. Broadcasting career Roeser began hosting a talk show on WLS-AM in Chicago in 1994. He began on a fill-in basis, substituting for Ed Vrdolyak alongside Ty Wansley. Vrdolyak quit the show in May 1994, and then, after Illinois Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra first agreed to take the radio host job replacing Vrdolyk and then decided against it in August 1994, Roeser again began hosting alongside Wansley. He retired on May 21, 2011.Tom Roeser Retires From His WLS-AM Show, Chicago Radio and Media May 22, 2011WLS Radio's Tom Roeser Retires, Illinois Review, May 21, 2011 He was a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. Writing Roeser authored the book Father Mac: The Life and Times of Ignatius D. McDermott, co-founder of Chicago's famed Haymarket Center. His Op Ed columns appeared in the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune and The Wall Street Journal. He was Chicago correspondent for The Wanderer, the oldest national Catholic weekly in the United States and wrote on his own blog, blog.tomroeser.com. In addition to hosting his own talk radio program, \\"Political Shootout\\" on WLS-AM, Chicago, he appeared as a commentator on The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS, on BBC and often on Chicago Tonight on WTTW-TV Chicago Public Radio and on Inside Politics on WBEZ Chicago public radio. In addition, he was an occasional guest on Beyond the Beltway with Bruce DuMont, a coast-to-coast television and radio program broadcast weekly. Teaching His teaching career included service as adjunct professor of public policy at the Wharton School of Finance, University of Pennsylvania; the Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University; Loyola University of Chicago; DePaul University of Chicago; the University of Illinois-Chicago; Roosevelt University of Chicago and Saint John's College, Oxford University.  Personal  Roeser was married from 1959 until his death to the former Lillian Prescott of Chicago. The couple were parents of four grown children, two sons (Thomas F., Jr. and Michael J.) and two daughters (Mary Catherine Magnor and Jeanne Roeser) and is grandfather to 13.

The collection begun after World War I, and the museum was officially opened in 1942. The museum has collections totaling about 100,000 objects, most of which are antiquities and medieval finds from excavations undertaken by the Directorate General of Antiquities. About 1300 artifacts are exhibited, ranging in date from prehistoric times to the medieval Mamluk period. During the 1975 Lebanese Civil War, the museum stood on the front line that separated the warring factions. The museum's Egyptian Revival building and its collection suffered extensive damage in the war, but most of the artifacts were saved by last-minute preemptive measures. Today, after a major renovation, the National Museum of Beirut has regained its former position, especially as a leading collector for ancient Phoenician objects. History=Origin= 19th century engraving of the Kaiserswerth deaconesses building in Beirut In 1919, a small group of ancient artifacts collected by Raymond Weill, a French officer stationed in Lebanon, was exhibited at a provisional museum in the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses' building in Georges Picot Street, Beirut. Meanwhile, a forerunner of the Archaeological and Fine Arts Service began to assemble items from the region round Beirut. The initial collection was rapidly expanded under successive antiquity directors with the addition of finds from the excavations led by Dr. Georges Contenau at Saida and Ernest Renan at Saida, Tyre and Byblos. Donations of private collections included those of Henry Seyrig’s coin collection, General Weygand in 1925 and Dr George Ford, the Director of the American Mission School of Sidon, in 1930. =Foundation= The National Museum, Beirut In 1923, the \\"Friends of the Museum Committee\\", headed by Bechara El Khoury, then Prime Minister and minister of education and fine arts, was created to raise funds to build a national museum. The founding committee included: Alfred Sursok, Marios Hanimoglo, Albert Bassoul, Omar Daouk, Kamil Eddeh, Ali Jumblat, Henry Pharaoun, George Faissy, Assad Younes, Hassan Makhzoumi, Joseph Farahi, George Korom, Jean Debs, Wafik Beydoun and Jack Tabet. The committee accepted the plans presented by architects Antoine Nahas and Pierre Leprince-Ringuet. Construction began in 1930 on a plot of land donated by the municipality near the Beirut Hippodrome, and was completed in 1937. The opening of the museum was scheduled for 1938, but was postponed because of the political situation in the lead-up to World War II. The National Museum of Beirut was finally opened on May 27, 1942 by President Alfred Naqqache. Until 1928, the conservation of the Lebanese National Museum was put in the hands of Charles Virolleaud, the director of the service of antiquities and Philippe de Tarazzi, the Lebanese conservator of the National Library. The collection continued to grow under the direction of Mir Maurice Chehab, head curator for 33 years, until the start of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. =Closing and devastation= Detail from a sarcophagus showing a Phoenician ship, Sidon, 2nd century CE In 1975, with the outbreak of the Lebanese war, Beirut was split into two opposing areas. The national museum and the directorate general of antiquities were on the demarcation line known as “Museum alley” which separated the warring militias and armies. Conditions in the immediate vicinity of the museum rapidly worsened, as the museum endured shelling and bombing, and was turned into a barracks for combatants. \\"Museum alley\\" became a checkpoint controlled by various Lebanese militias, or the Syrian or Israeli armies, who opened and closed the road under short-lived truces. The authorities decided to close the museum. The first protective measures inside the museum were initiated by Mir Maurice Chehab and his wife during alternating fire-fights and moments of truce. The vulnerable small artifacts were removed from their showcases and hidden in storerooms in the basement, which was then walled up, banning any access to the lower floors. On the ground floor, mosaics which had been installed in the floor were covered with a layer of concrete. Statues and sarcophagi were protected by sandbags. When the situation reached its worst in 1982, the heavier artifacts were encased in wood and concrete. Tyre Phoenician necropolis stela When the final cease-fire was declared in 1991, the museum and the Directorate General of Antiquities were in a state of near-destruction. The museum was flooded with rainwater and the outer facade was badly marked by bullets and craters from shells. Militiamen who occupied the premises had covered the internal walls with graffiti. The state of the museum collection was also very serious: the small objects had been left in the storerooms for more than fifteen years in a totally inappropriate environment. The national museum had been built on a high water table, which caused a dangerous increase in humidity, and collection of water inside the storerooms. The large stone artifacts has been left in their emergency casings without any ventilation and traces of corrosion from salts were visible on the lower edges of the stone monuments. The wing adjacent to the Directorate General of Antiquities was devastated by shells which started a fire, destroying documents such as maps, photographs, and records, as well as 45 boxes containing archaeological objects. All of the laboratory equipment was lost. During the war, some items were looted and are now exhibited in Turkish museums, whilst others have been auctioned. Ironically, these had been stolen from external stores, mainly in Byblos and Sidon, in which they were kept to avoid damage and looting. =Reopening and renovation= The first plans to restore the national museum came in 1992 from Michel Edde, then Minister of Culture and Higher Education. The proposal to tear down the concrete walls and cases which protected the national treasures was turned down by the general director of antiquities, Camille Asmar, since the museum still had no doors or windows to prevent further looting. Ghassan Tueni donated the funds for the museum's massive new main door. Once the doors and windows were put in, the decision was made to pull down the concrete wall that protected the entrance to the basement. Restoration work started in 1995 and focused on the building itself, and the inventorying and restoration of the collection. The museum was officially inaugurated on November 25, 1997 by then president Elias Hrawi but only parts of the ground floor and basement were made accessible since the remainder of the building was still under repair and important modifications were needed to meet the requirements of modern museology standards. The museum was again closed to the public in July 1998 to achieve restoration works. On October 8, 1999, the museum re-opened its doors to the public under the patronage of president Emile Lahoud. The rehabilitation of the National Museum was undertaken by the Ministry of Culture, the Directorate General of Antiquities and the National Heritage Foundation, to the plans of the French architect, urban planner and designer Jean-Michel Wilmotte. In 1999 the Lebanese government started a massive campaign to recover antiquities that were stolen or traded during the civil war.. Many artifacts were recovered from warehouses or private homes since Lebanese law dictates that any item more than 300 years old belongs to the state. In 2011, the ground floor restoration lab was moved and a new exhibition hall, named after prince Maurice Chehab was opened to the public. =Basement reopening= One of the anthropomorphic sarcophagi from the Ford collection, marble, 4th century BCE Opening of the underground gallery was scheduled for November 2010,Beirut Museum to Open Basement in November – Jad Aoun but was delayed for technical and financial difficulties. Restoration works for the floor were begun in 2014 under the initiative of Lebanese culture minister Rony Araiji and were carried out with financial and technical support from the Italian government who provided €1.2million for the project through the Italian Development Cooperation. The basement was finally reopened on October 7, 2016 with an official ceremony presided by Tammam Salam, the Lebanese prime minister and the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Paolo Gentiloni. The basement collection showcases funerary art and practices beginning with articles dating back from prehistory until the Ottoman era. Collection highlights include 31 Phoenician anthropomorphic sarcophagi from the Ford collection, a fresco depicting Mary the mother of Jesus dated to CE, and which is believed to be one of the oldest discovered representations of Mary in the world. Other artifacts of note are the naturally preserved Maronite mummies of ‘Assi el Hadath cave in the Qadisha valley and the frescoed tomb of Tyre. Architecture Museum interior The museum was designed in a French inspired Egyptian Revival architecture by the architects Antoine Nahas and Pierre Leprince-Ringuet, and built with Lebanese ochre limestone. It comprises a basement, a ground floor, a mezzanine floor and a terrace; the central block is covered by a glass roof, above the mezzanine, giving natural overhead light. The whole site is approximately , and the exhibition floor space totals . The immediately adjoining museum annexes and administrative offices occupy about . Collections The National Museum of Beirut currently exhibits 1300 artifacts from its collection of approximately 100,000 objects. The museum displays follow a chronological circuit beginning in Prehistory and ending in the Ottoman era. The circuit begins on the ground floor where 83 large objects are displayed, these include sarcophagi, mosaics statues and reliefs. The upper floor displays 1243 small and medium-sized artifacts arranged by chronological order and by theme in modern showcases with soft lighting and magnifying glasses that emphasize the aesthetic aspect of the artifacts. Neolithic Flint point from Byblos =Prehistory= The collection has prehistoric artifacts from early hunter- gatherer societies ranging from the Lower Paleolithic (1M–150,000 BCE) to the Neolithic (9000–3200 BCE), typically spearheads, flints, hooks and pottery. These were found in caves and rock shelters all over Lebanese territory. Around five hundred prehistoric sites have been surveyed in Lebanon as a whole, and around fifty sites in Beirut itself. =Bronze age= The Bronze Age (3200–1200 BCE) saw the birth of Lebanon's first fortified villages, the development of commercial and maritime activities and the invention of the world's first alphabet in Byblos. This collection includes the Museum's masterpiece: the sarcophagus of Ahiram, which holds the oldest text written in the Phoenician alphabet. Collection highlights: * From the Temple of the Obelisks in Byblos: ** The Byblos figurines: gilded bronze, Obelisk temple – Byblos, 19-18th century BCE. ** Decorated knife:gold and ivory, Obelisk temple – Byblos, 19-18th century BCE. ** Fenestrated axes: gold, Obelisk temple – Byblos, 19-18th century BCE. ** Statuette of Reshep: gilded bronze, Obelisk temple – Byblos, 19-18th century BCE. ** Abishemu obelisk: * From the Byblos royal cemetery: ** Sarcophagus of King Ahiram: limestone, Byblos royal cemetery, 10th century BCE. ** King Ip Shemu Abi's crown and scepter: gold and bronze, Royal cemetery, Byblos, 18th century BCE. ** King Abi Shemu's jewelry collection: gold and precious stones, Royal cemetery, Byblos, 18th century BCE. * Duck shaped cosmetic box: ivory, Sidon, 14th century BCE. =Iron age= The Iron Age (1200 – 333 BCE) in Lebanon saw the climax of the Phoenician civilization, which culminated in its maritime expansion and the transmission to other cultures of the alphabet (which was attributed by the Greek legend to the Tyrian Cadmus). During this period, after an era of autonomy, the city-states of the area came under Assyrian, Babylonian and Persian hegemony. The occupying civilizations influenced Phoenician ceramics, jewelry and ivory work, statues, and sarcophagi. Key highlights of the collections include: * the Ford collection of anthropoid sarcophagi: marble, 4th century BCE. * votive statues from the Temple of Eshmun: marble, Bustan esh Sheikh, 4th century BCE. * capital with bull protomes,: marble, Sidon, 5th century BCE. =Hellenistic period= Umm al-Amad The Hellenistic period (333 – 64 BCE) In 333 BCE, the decisive victory won by Alexander the Great over the Persian king Darius III opened Phoenicia to the Greek conqueror. After Alexander's death, Phoenicia first came under Ptolemaic rule from Egypt, then, after the Battle of Panium, under the Seleucids based in modern Iraq. The Seleucids abolished local monarchies, and appointed governors (bearing Greek names) to rule the Phoenician cities. Greek influence, which had made its way to Phoenicia during the Persian period, now became stronger. Figurines found in Kharayeb show Aegean influence on local craftsmen. This spreading Hellenization interacted with the local Semitic population substratum, which remained faithful to its gods and its language. It resulted in an artistic and architectural symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm al-Amad and Bustan esh Sheikh. Collection highlights: * Sanctuary of Eshmun tribune: marble, Bustan esh Sheikh (near Sidon), ca. 350BCE. * Statue of Aphrodite: marble, Beirut * Greek gods figurines: terracotta, Kharayeb * Multiple Thrones of Astarte from around Lebanon Sarcophagus with Achilles legend Seven Wise Men Mosaic: Calliope, surrounded by Socrates and seven wise men (Baalbeck, 3rd century A.D.) =Roman period= In 64 BCE, the military expedition of the Roman general Pompey put an end to the anarchy prevailing in the Seleucid Empire, and Phoenicia became part of the Roman world. But Roman civil wars continued to disrupt the region until 31 BCE, after which, with the reign of Augustus, the pax romana extended over the area. The pax romana favored international trade, and local industries in silversmithing, glass, textiles and ceramics developed. Roman Period (64 BCE – 395 CE) section collection highlights include: * Achilles sarcophagus: marble, Tyre, 2nd century CE. * Drunken Cupids sarcophagus: marble, Tyre, 2nd century CE. * Abduction of Europe mosaic: Byblos, 3rd century CE. * Statue of Hygieia: marble, Byblos * Calliope and the seven wise men mosaic: Baalbeck, 3rd century CE. * Dionysus bust: marble, Tyre, 3rd century CE. =Byzantine period= After the death of Theodosius I in 395 CE, the Roman Empire was divided into a western and an eastern empire. The Lebanese cities were attached to the latter, and converted to Christianity which became the state religion in 392. The emperor ordered the destruction of pagan temples, but cults like those of Adonis and Jupiter Heliopolitanus were kept alive by the local population and survived in some form for centuries. Artifacts from the Byzantine period (395 – 636 CE) include: *The \\"Jealousy\\" mosaic: Beirut. *Elements of a church chancel: marble, Beirut. *Coins and jewelry collection. =Arab conquest, Mamluk period= The Arab conquest of Lebanon was completed in 637 CE. The expansion of the coastal cities, which had slowed down after earthquakes in the 6th century, revived during the Umayyad period. Their harbors and shipyards showed renewed activity, and the hinterland saw extensive irrigation work for agriculture. Lebanon was directly affected by the various dynastic changes which brought to power successively the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Seljuks, Ayyubids and Mamluks. During this long period, Islam spread and Arabic became the language of the administration, then progressively replaced local dialects among the population. Artifacts from the Mamluk period (636 – 1516 CE include coins, gold jewelry, and glazed terracotta bowls. Publications Maurice Chehab initiated in 1936 the museum's first publication, the Bulletin du Musée de Beyrouth (\\"Beirut Museum Bulletin\\"), which reached 36 volumes before publication was stopped in 1986 by the civil war. The journal covered archaeological finds, sites and ancient civilizations. In 1995 the Museum and the Lebanese British Friends of the National Museum foundation resumed publication of a bi-annual journal entitled Archaeology and History in Lebanon (). BAAL (\\"Bulletin d’Archéologie et d’Architecture Libanaise\\" – Lebanese Archaeology and Architecture Bulletin) is an annual journal issued by the Directorate General of Antiquities in cooperation with the Lebanese Ministry of Culture in keeping in the tradition of the Beirut Museum Bulletin. The first volume of BAAL was issued in 1996; the journal publishes research papers, excavations and archaeological surveys and reports.  Location and facilities  The museum is located in Beirut's Mazra'a district on the intersection of Abdallah al-Yafi avenue and Damascus road; it is flanked by the Beirut hippodrome and the Directorate General of Antiquities building. A small theater and a gift shop flank the ground floor entry hall.

He was an engineer and the technical director of Telefunken. He was crucial in the development of wireless technology in Europe. Arco served for a time as an assistant to Adolf Slaby, who was close to William II, German Emperor. Until 1930, Arco was one of the two managing directors of the company. He participated in the development of high performance tube transmitters. Together with his teacher, Slaby, he was considerably involved in the study and development of high-frequency engineering in Germany. He was a Monist and a pacifist. Between 1921-22, he was a chairman of the German Monist Federation. Early years Plaque commemorating the first radio transmission in Germany, on the Church of the Redeemer in Sacrow/Potsdam. Arco was born on the estate of his father, Count Alexander Karl von Arco, in Großgorschütz, Upper Silesia, Prussia (now Gorzyce, Poland). He belonged to the Arco family, of Italian origin. His noble title was abolished when Germany became a republic after the First World War. As a child he was interested in machines of all kinds, but after graduating from the Maria Magdalenen High School in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland) in 1889, he did not study engineering sciences, but instead attended mathematical and physical lectures at the University of Berlin. Afterwards he took up a military career, a family tradition. After three years with the military, however, he left to study mechanical engineering and electro-technology in the technical university in Charlottenburg, Berlin, from 1893. There he became acquainted with Professor Adolf Slaby, who had participated in Guglielmo Marconi's transmission experiments on the coast of the English Channel. Building on these attempts, Arco and Slaby in the summer of 1897 used the free-standing bell tower of the Church of the Redeemer, Potsdam, as an antenna, to verify and understand Marconi's experiments. Here the first German antenna system for wireless telegraphy was established. On 27 August a radio transmission to the German naval base \\"Kongsnaes,\\" 1.6 kilometers away, was successful. In 1928 a plaque was fixed over the door of the bell tower of the Church of the Redeemer to commemorate to this feat. In the centre of the plaque, which is made from green dolomite, is Atlas with the globe, surrounded by lightning and the text: \\"At this place in 1897 Professor Adolf Slaby and Count von Arco erected the first German antenna system for wireless communication\\". On 7 October 1897, the first radio link from Schöneberg to Rangsdorf in Berlin was successful, and the following summer Jüterbog, about 65 km (40 mi) southwest of Berlin, could be reached. AEG In 1898, at the end of his studies, Arco went to work as an engineer at the Kabelwerk Oberspree plant of AEG. At first Arco was responsible as a laboratory engineer for testing various electrical cable types, but also, through continued contact with Slaby, introduced and developed wireless telegraphy at AEG. Telefunken Patent disputes between Siemens and AEG resulted in both companies, at the behest of William II, German Emperor, founding a common enterprise, the Society for Wireless Telegraphy Ltd. The company's telegraphic address, Telefunken, eventually became the company name. Arco greatly increased the power and range of early transmitters. In this regard he surpassed the Löschfunkensender of Max Wien, which had already exhibited a substantially better efficiency than the Knallfunkensender of Ferdinand Braun, and in addition could send on a narrow frequency band. Nauen radio station  Arco's greatest service lay in the development of the large radio station at Nauen, 20 miles west of Berlin, thereby helping Telefunken to become a firm of worldwide reputation. In 1909 he equipped it with a Löschfunksender, a quenched-spark transmitter, and Nauen changed from being a research station into a station with regular radio traffic. Now contact could be made with the African colonies and naval vessels at sea. A decade later, in 1918, the transmitting power had increased tenfold. The station used a new transmitter technology introduced in 1912, a high frequency alternator (similar to an Alexanderson alternator) with magnetic frequency multiplier converter. This permitted the production of undamped continuous waves with high power. This development was due to the substantial involvement of Arco. It stimulated electron tube experiments. Philosophical and ideological activities While Slaby continued working in the university, Arco pursued philosophical activities. He associated himself with the Monist movement and the Berlin Circle for Empirical Philosophy, as well as the pacifist movement during the First World War as a founding member and chairman of the Bund Neues Vaterland. He belonged to the German Monist League, whose chairman he was from 1921 to 1922. In 1923 he was joint founder of the Society of Friends of New Russia, because of which he celebrated his 60th birthday in Moscow, which was unusual for someone in his position. He was an advisory member of the Abraham Lincoln Foundation, a German branch of the Rockefeller Foundation. Death and afterwards After his death, Arco was accorded the honour of a civic funeral by Berlin. The tended grave is in the Südwestkirchhof Stahnsdorf, a large cemetery southwest of Berlin. The Berlin Senate had a memorial plaque erected at Albrechtstrasse 49/50 in the Mariendorf area of Tempelhof. In Charlottenburg, Havelstrasse was renamed Arcostrasse in 1950, in memory of this pioneer of radio engineering. Also in Nauen, where Telefunken has had a working transmission station since the beginning of the 20th century, there is another road named after him. The town of Arco, Idaho, was named after him in 1903. In 1955 this small town in eastern Idaho became the first community in the world ever to be lit by electricity generated by nuclear power.

Early years Born in Castiglione delle Stiviere, Beschi got his secondary education in the Jesuits' High School at Mantua. After becoming a Jesuit in 1698, he was trained in Ravenna and Bologna from where he requested and obtained, from Superior General Michelangelo Tamburini, permission to be sent to the Jesuit mission at Madurai in South India. Sailing from Lisbon he reached Goa in October 1710, from where he proceeded immediately to South India. He arrived in Madurai in May 1711. In South India Inspired by what was done in China, Beschi adopted the native Tamilians' lifestyle in his life and in his missionary work. For example, he adopted the saffron coloured robe generally worn by a sannyasi (Indian ascetic). He visited several important centres such as Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram, Thanjavur and, of course, Madurai to learn the Tamil language. He met with persecution in 1714–15 and escaped a death sentence. This gave him more time to master the Tamil language in which he soon showed great proficiency. During the first six years, he worked as a missionary in Elakurichy, a town near Tiruvaiyaru. Then he served as parish priest in Kamanayakkanpatti, one of the oldest mission centres in Tamil Nadu. He worked in the Thanjavur area till 1738 and settled in 1740 on the Coromandel coast where he remained till the end of his life. He helped build the Poondi Matha Basilica at Poondi near Thanjavur, Vyagula Matha Church at Thanjavur, The Perianayagi Madha Shrine, Konankuppam at Mugasaparur in Konankuppam, and Adaikala Maadha Shrine at Elakurichi. These churches are now Catholic pilgrim centres. He died at Ambalakaadu in Thrissur, Kingdom of Cochin (now a part of the state of Kerala), and is buried at Sampaloor, where his tomb can be seen. Robert Caldwell, one of the eminent Tamil liguistics and historians, in his book 'A Political and General History of Tinnevelly (present Tirunelveli) in the Presidency of Madras: From the Earliest Period to the Cession to the English Government in AD 1801' opines that, based on the writings of his biographer and the letters written to Europe at the same time, \\"It is certain from authentic records that Beschi was \\"Rector\\" of Manapar (present Manapad) in 1744 and that he died there in 1746. This was in the 66th year of his age and the 40th of his residence in India. It is very probable that Manapar was the first place in the Tamil country where Beschi resided after he left Goa, in consequence of which he might naturally wish to end his days there.\\"http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/robert-caldwell/a-political- and-general-history-of-the-district-of-tinnevelly-in-the-presidency-hci.shtml He, in the same book (page 243) further states that his body was laid in rest in the oldest church of Manapad which has been now completely buried in the sand.http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/robert-caldwell/a-political-and- general-history-of-the-district-of-tinnevelly-in-the-presidency-hci.shtml Contribution to Tamil literature TamilNadu government's paper advertisement paying homage to Veeramamunivar Constantine compiled the first Tamil lexicon - a Tamil-Latin dictionary. He also compiled the comprehensive Chaturakarati (சதுரகராதி), a quadruple lexicon containing words, synonyms, and categories of words and rhymes. He translated and explained in Latin the \\"Thirukkural\\", an epic poem of Thiruvalluvar. This Latin work was an eye opener for European intellectuals, enabling them to discover truth and beauty in Tamil literature. He also translated into European languages several other important Tamil literary works such as Devaaram (தேவாரம்), Thiruppugazh (திருப்புகழ்), Nannool (நன்னூல்) and Aaththichoodi (ஆத்திசூடி). Besides composing literary Tamil Grammar work, he also wrote a grammar for the common use of Tamil (Urai nadai illakkiyam - உரை நடை இலக்கியம்), which at times led to him being referred to as the 'Father of Tamil Prose'. Earlier Tamil scripts were written without the tittle (புள்ளி) for consonants, and the symbol ர was used to indicate long vowels. It was Veeramamunivar who introduced the system of dotting the Tamil consonants (க், ங், ச், ... ) and writing the long vowels as ஆ instead of அர, கா instead of கர, etc. His biggest poetical work is the Thembavani (தேம்பாவணி - The Unfading Garland - an ornament of poems as sweet as honey), 3615 stanzas long on salvation history and the life of Saint Joseph. He also wrote a prabandham (a minor literature) called Kaavalur Kalambagam (காவலூர் கலம்பகம்), a grammatical treatise called Thonnool (தொன்னூல்), a guide book for catechists with the title Vedhiyar Ozukkam (வேதியர் ஒழுக்கம்), and Paramarthaguruvin Kadhai (பரமார்த்த குருவின் கதை - The Adventures of Guru Paramartha), a satirical piece on a naive religious teacher and his equally obtuse disciples. His prose works include polemical writings against the Lutheran missionaries and didactic religious books for the instruction of Catholics. Recognition In 1968, the State of Tamil Nadu erected a statue for Beschi on the Marina beach in the city of Madras as a recognition for his contribution to Tamil language and literature.

It takes place roughly 25 years after the events in Dark Prince. Plot summary The book begins with Jacques Dubrinsky, younger brother to Mikhail, being tortured and buried alive by members of the same fanatical group that attacked Raven and killed his sister some 25 years earlier in Dark Prince. As time goes on he loses much of his memory (perhaps even his sanity), the only thing he has a clear memory of is of the faces of his human tormentors, and the fact that he was betrayed by someone close to him. Shea O’Halloran is a brilliant American surgeon and researcher trying to find the cure for a rare blood disorder. Her pursuit of a cure is personal; she also suffers from the disease, and she fears that one day it will kill her. She occasionally has to have blood transfusions in order to survive. It is only after her mother Maggie commits suicide that she learns that she has inherited this disorder from her father. In her diary, her mother writes of having an affair with a man named Rand. She writes that he takes her blood when they make love. Unfortunately he's a married man whose wife recently gave birth to a son and disappears before Maggie can tell him of her pregnancy. She believes that his wife Noelle discovered his infidelity and murdered him. The loss of Shea's father devastates Maggie, and she retreats from the world, even her own child. Shea suffers a stark and painful childhood. Maggie commits suicide when Shea turns 18. This disorder is not her only difference. No human medicine works on her; she can hear and feel the thoughts of others. When she touches a patient, she instantly knows what is wrong with him/her. Because of this, she's tracked by the same vampire hunting society that has imprisoned Jacques, believing she too is a vampire. They even show her pictures of seven others that they have caught and murdered. No matter where she goes, they always track her down. One day Shea is racked by horrendous pain and visions of a man being tortured. For years she dreams of this man. After the society finds her again, she goes to the Carpathian Mountains to do further research on her disorder. She feels that since there are many legends of vampires in the region that this may be the epicenter of the disease. When she goes for a walk, she's compelled to go to a spot deep in the forest. She finds a cellar where a man has been tortured and buried alive with a stake driven through his body. Suddenly he awakens and attacks her, twice feeding on her blood. She has a compulsion to help him, despite his violent assault. She takes him to her home and treats his wounds. After he takes her blood for the third time, she becomes violently ill. He tells her that she doesn't have a disease, but that they are a different race of people who need blood to survive. Shea refuses to believe this at first. Then she realizes that she doesn't have normal human bodily functions. She soon realizes that this is the truth and that her father was a being just like Jacques. After a few days, Shea has to leave Jacques to get more blood from the blood bank. She is spotted by another Carpathian, Byron, who realizes by her smell that she's been in contact with Jacques. He immediately informs Mikhail. When they arrive, they see Shea apparently torturing Jacques; Mikhail attacks her thinking she is deranged. This triggers Jacques’ protective instincts and he tries to kill them. Mikhail calls Gregori, their race's most powerful healer, who convinces Jacques to allow them to heal him. The next evening, Shea and Jacques tell her life story. Shea was (before being converted by Jacques) half-human, half-Carpathian, something that was considered impossible. They also think that her birth confirms that a psychic human woman who is a lifemate to a Carpathian is capable of giving birth to female children. This is vitally important because their people are on the verge of extinction; no female has been born in more than 500 years. They inform her that her father is not dead, and it was Noelle who was murdered. They also tell her that her half-brother was also killed by the society. Jacques also relates what happened to him, that he was betrayed and delivered to human killers. Before they can discover who the betrayer might be, Byron is taken. Raven is able to connect with him and determine that he is in a dark and dank room. Shea realizes that he is being housed in the same place the humans buried Jacques seven years earlier. While the men go to the cellar to rescue him, the women stay behind. Shea is almost immediately uneasy, but Raven senses no threat. Suddenly, the humans attack the women, shooting the pregnant Raven. Luckily Shea and Gregori are able to save Raven and her child. The attack is puzzling because no one but Shea felt any threat. There is only one explanation for this; her father, Rand, is the one who betrayed Jacques and is a vampire. Gregori is selected to hunt Rand, but Rand attacks Jacques, who is forced to destroy him.

Biography Osiander moved to the United States with his family in 1958, settling in the San Francisco area. He attended Mission High School. After graduating from high school, he first attended the City College of San Francisco, then the University of San Francisco where he played on the men's soccer team under legendary coach Steve Negoesco. In 1966, the Dons won the NCAA Men's Soccer Championship. Osiander graduated with degrees in physical education and Spanish in 1968. By that time he had become a U.S. citizen, gaining his citizenship in 1965. Osiander was an assistant coach with the California Surf of the North American Soccer League (NASL). Osiander eventually returned to San Francisco, becoming a waiter at Graziano's, a local restaurant, while playing and coaching in the city's highly competitive soccer leagues. In 1985, he coached a semi-pro club, the San Francisco Greek-Americans, to the National Challenge Cup title. By that time, Osiander was well known on the national coaching scene. Back in 1974, the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) had hired Osiander as part of its coaching staff. At the time Walter Chyzowych was the U.S. head coach and in that capacity would travel the country putting on coaching clinics. Osiander traveled as part of Chyzowich's team and became known as an excellent teacher and coach. In 1978, the U.S. Olympic committee inaugurated a National Sports Festival, hiring Osiander as the West team soccer coach. He continued in this position for the next ten years. By 1986, Osiander's success with the Olympic Festivals and the Greek Americans led Chyzowich, now head of USSF, to hire Osiander to replace fired Alkis Panagouliasas as the head coach of the U.S. national team. The team was in the middle of rebuilding following its failure to qualify for the 1986 FIFA World Cup. As the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allowed countries outside of Europe and South America to field their full national teams in the Olympics, Osiander turned his attention to qualification for the 1988 Summer Olympics to be held in Seoul, South Korea. The qualification campaign nearly ended as soon as it began when Canada defeated the U.S. 2–0 in the first leg of their home and away first round series. At the time, series winners were decided on goal differential with away goals counting for two points and home goals only one. In other words, the U.S. needed to win the follow-up game 3–0. If it let Canada gain even one goal in the game in the U.S., then the score would need to be 5-1 for the U.S. to make the next round. On May 30, 1987, Osiander's team rose to the challenge and shutout Canada, while scoring the three needed goals. The U.S. went on a tear in the second round, going undefeated against Trinidad and El Salvador, outscoring its opponents 13 to 4, and winning a spot in Seoul. In those games, the U.S. underachieved, running to a 1-1-1 record and failing to make the second round. On January 16, 1989, USSF released Osiander when it announced the hiring of Bob Gansler as the full-time national team coach. By this time Osiander had set the U.S. national team back on track. In addition to the marvelous Olympic qualification campaign, Osiander led the team through a successful first round of World Cup qualification with a scoreless away tie with Jamaica followed by a 5-1 crushing of the Reggae Boyz. Osiander compiled a 13–7 record with the team in full internationals during his tenure as coach. While he left the senior national team in 1989, Osiander continued to coach the U.S. B Team and eventually the U.S. U-23 national team. After the 1988 Olympics, USSF began signing U.S. players to national team contracts. These players formed an A team while fringe or up and coming players spent time with the B Team. Additionally, the IOC had decided to make the Olympic soccer tournament an U-23 competition. In 1991, Osiander coached the U.S. U-23 team to a gold medal at that year's Pan American Games, held in Cuba. That year, Osiander also began preparing the team for the 1992 Summer Olympics to be held in Barcelona, Spain. The team easily ran through qualification and had high hopes for success in Spain. In one of the many inexplicable moments in U.S. soccer history, Osiander benched his leading scorer, Steve Snow, for the team's first Olympic match. Snow had led the U.S. team at the Pan American games with four goals, then bagged eleven more in nine games of Olympic qualifying. However, Osiander did not fail to mask his dislike for Snow, calling him a \\"cocky twerp\\". But without Snow, the U.S. offense stalled and the team lost 2-1 to Italy. Osiander played Snow in the next two games. While Snow scored in both, a win and a tie, it was not enough and the U.S. failed to make the second round. USSF president Alan Rothenberg fired Osiander after the Olympics, based largely on Osiander's refusal to play Snow in the game with Italy. When not coaching, Osiander had continued to work at Graziano's, rising from waiter to maître d'. However, in 1992, the restaurant was sold to new management who let Osiander go. Out of work, he turned to coaching the Palo Alto Firebirds of the USISL. While working at Graziano's, he had spent time as an assistant coach with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) before it folded in 1992. He also continued coaching the San Francisco Greek-Americans. In 1994, he took the Greek-Americans to its second U.S. Open Cup title. In all likelihood this team will remain the last amateur or semi-pro team to win the National Cup. As he no longer had a job either with Graziano's or the national team and since semi-pro or assistant coaches rarely earn much, Osiander was forced into full-time professional coaching. In 1995, the expansion Atlanta Ruckus of the A-League hired Osiander as its first coach. Despite finishing the regular season fourth out of six, the Ruckus made it to the A-League championship series, only to fall to the Seattle Sounders. For his efforts Osiander was honored as A-League coach of the year. Osiander's success with the Greek-Americans and Ruckus brought him to the attention of the newly created Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy which hired him as its first coach. The Galaxy began the first MLS season with 12 straight victories, finishing with a 19–13 record. The Galaxy went to the championship game only to fall to the Bruce Arena-coached D.C. United, 3–2 in overtime. However, in 1997, the Galaxy began 3-9 and on June 10, 1997, the team fired Osiander. In January 1998, the Tampa Bay Mutiny hired Osiander as an assistant coach. When John Kowalski, head coach of the Mutiny, was fired in 1999, some observers thought Osiander would serve as interim coach. Instead, he left the Mutiny and was hired as head coach of the MLS Project 40 team. On September 1999, the San Jose Clash hired Osiander to replace Brian Quinn near the end of the 1999 season. At the time, Osiander was leading the Project 40 team into the United Soccer League playoffs where it lost in the semifinals to the Minnesota Thunder. Once the Project 40 team was eliminated from the playoffs, Osiander joined the Clash, taking the team to a 2–1 record in his three games to close out the 1999 season. Despite the good start at the end of the 1999, Osiander could do little better than his predecessors when it came to a full season. In 2000, he took the team to a 7-17-8 record and on January 12, 2001, the Earthquakes fired Osiander. Since leaving MLS, he returned to his position as coach of the San Francisco Greek-Americans. He also coaches local Bay area youth teams, including the U-17 Ballistic Boys which won the 2003 State Cup as an U-16 team. Finally, he is the head coach of San Ramon United, an U-17 team. The NSCAA awarded Osiander the Walt Chzyowich Award in 2007. He was selected to be the coach of the U-16 Tri-Valley Boys for the 2009 season. He is currently coaching them. He also temporarily took over for the U-19 Tri-Valley Arsenal, due to the absence of former coach Terry Weekes. This was Osiander's last known coaching position.

The series is set in 18th century France, and its cast includes many characters that are based on real historical figures. Protagonists The main characters of Le Chevalier D'Eon as they appear on the cover of a DVD released by Media Factory. Clockwise from top: Durand, Teillagory, Robin, and D'Eon ; ; :D'Eon is a member of the King's Secret, working in the shadows to keep the peace within French society. When his sister suddenly turns up floating down a river in a coffin with 'Psalms' written on it, D'Eon is thrown into a deadly struggle with revolutionaries and supernatural forces in order to uncover the truth behind his sister's death. He is loosely based on the historic figure, Chevalier d'Eon. Shortly after the beginning of the series, D'Eon is possessed by his dead sister's spirit, who manifests herself during combat and constantly mentions taking her revenge. :Ubukata had difficulty using a single character to portray D'Eon's complexity, so he opted to create two characters instead - D'Eon and his sister, Lia - and linked them together using \\"an occult process\\". Director Furuhashi mentioned D'Eon's \\"transformation\\" into Lia was different in earlier concepts; \\"His hair would grow longer and he'd turn into a woman. Meanwhile, his rosary would morph into a sword.\\" Furuhashi worried that \\"D'Eon wouldn't be the historical figure anymore; there wouldn't be any point\\", so they conceptualized a less-fantastic transition between the two characters. ; ; :Lia is D'Eon's older sister, who was killed under mysterious circumstances. Despite flashbacks of her being a caring and considerate young woman, who was well loved by the nobles and the royals, the spirit that possesses D'Eon is full of great anger, sorrow, and the desire to exact revenge. :\\"Lia de Beaumont\\" is the identity that the real- life cross-dressing Chevalier d'Eon claims to have assumed during a mission to Russia in 1756.Le Chevalier d'Eon by Michel de Decker, published by France- EmpireMonsieur D'Eon Is a Woman: A Tale of Political Intrigue and Sexual Masquerade by Gary Kates, published by Basic Books ; ; :Robin is the Queen of France's young page who is assigned to assist D'Eon. Despite his age, he is earnest and resourceful, and his loyalty to the Queen and his companions is steadfast. Robin greatly looks up to D'Eon and his friends, and prefers to wield a flintlock pistol in combat. ; ; :Durand is a dashing man who is highly adept in the Florentine fencing style, wielding a rapier and main-gauche at the same time. He treasures his antique pocket watch despite the fact that it does not work properly. Durand's loyalty seems ambiguous throughout the story, but he appears to have once had affections for Lia. He eventually develops a fondness for Robin, taking the boy under his wing and even bestowing upon him his treasured pocket watch. ; ; :Teillagory was once D'Eon and Lia's fencing instructor, and is a well-respected knight from the days of Louis XIV. He carries an antique sword which was given to him by Louis XIV, and still holds onto the days of knighthood and honor. Teillagory lost his only son in a war several years prior to the start of the series. Ozaki used Anthony Hopkins in Mask of Zorro as the basis for Teillagory's character design. France ; ; :King of France, husband of Queen Marie. He is a charming man with a relaxed manner as he is rarely seen stressed despite the direst situations. He is loosely based on King Louis XV. ; ; :Queen of France, wife of King Louis XV. She carries around a talking skull named Belle. She is usually a quiet and calm woman, holding a fascination with the Psalms and later revealed to even wield power over them. Her name is listed as \\"Marie Leszczynska\\" in the series' ending video, and she is loosely based on Maria Leszczyńska. ; ; :The mysterious talking skull with NQM carved on its forehead. Belle is kept in the company of Queen Marie, and inquires endlessly about her mother, whom the Queen has promised to reunite with Belle when the time is right. She is loosely based on Alexandrine Le Normant d'Étiolles, the deceased daughter of Madame de Pompadour. ; ; :D'Eon's childhood friend and fiancée. She looks after Dauphin Auguste (Prince Louis XVI), who sees her as a cross between elder sister and mother. Anna is described as the only person to give D'Eon tremendous love and unrestrained devotion. ; ; :The young Louis XVI, the grandson of King Louis XV. He is observant to Anna's moods, and she frequently describes him as a clever boy. He does not want to sit on the throne, but at the end of the series he is seen doing so with Broglie at his side. Loosely based on Louis XVI of France. ; ; :Louis XV's famous mistress, who yearns to reform France. Unlike Marie, she aims for action and radical reforms, not the quiet acceptance of the Queen. Pompadour has her own spies separate from the king's, who report the state of international affairs to her. It is revealed by Queen Marie that Belle is the late daughter of Pompadour and that Pompadour actually murdered her. Pompadour tells Belle that she strangled her to help change the country. Soon after Maximilien uses the Psalms to break Pompadour's neck. She is based on Madame de Pompadour. ; : :King Louis XV's constant companion and head of the Le Secret du Roi, the King's secret service. He is a serious man, and one of his eyes are often closed. He worked for both King Louis XIV and XV, and is strictly loyal to them. The character is loosely based on Charles-François de Broglie, marquis de Ruffec, the second head of Le Secret du Roi. ; ; :French Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs, allied with Marquise de Pompadour. He has dark hair turned up at the ends, and was involved in helping a Russian spy, Vorontsov, escape from France. ; ; :Duke of Orleans and brother of Louis XIV, making him Louis XV's uncle. In the anime he has dark hair and wears a flashy red coat. At one time in the anime he calls Louis as inferior to his father, though the king retorts with a joke instead. Marquise de Pompadour once said that d'Orléans can make the people of France love him, but he himself does not understand them. Though he was stripped of his title early in the anime, he is far from defeated, managing to even capture D'Eon near the end of the series. This character is loosely based on Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. ; ; :A Poet working under the Duc d'Orléans. He issues orders both through mouth and a journal he writes into, the words will then appear in the other copies his followers carry. He confronts Queen Marie and tries to use the Psalms to kill her but he underestimated her power and fell to the combined power of her and the newly arrived Maximilien who betrays him. However he survives and retreats to his hideout where he contacts Lorrenza and Count Cagliostro. He is betrayed and crushed by rocks, but survives and even transforms to a gargoyle. He is defeated by both Louis and D'Eon/Lia. Loosely based on Comte de Saint-Germain. ; ; :A Poet working under Comte de Saint-Germain. When he was caught by D'Eon's group, Durand tortured him in an attempt to get information. Eventually he was released, and he returned to his 'masters' - which included Duc d'Orléans - only to be whipped and have his loyalty questioned. Afterwards, he attacked D'Eon, but is killed by Lia. His dying words curses the rich for ignoring the poor, and promises a change in France. ; ; :A Poet with personal relations to Durand and Lia de Beaumont, he is first seen leaving France with the Russian spy Vorontsov. Formerly a French secret agent, he turned against the King shortly before Lia's death. In the anime he frequently asks Durand to join his Revolutionary Order and taunts D'Eon for being the vessel of Lia. He and Lia were both lovers, until they both found out to be half-siblings both sharing the same father. He is usually calm and emotionless, wielding the Psalms almost apathetically but powerfully. While he could not convince Durand or D'Eon into turning against the King, eventually Robin follows his ideals and even takes his name. He is the true member of the royal family. ; ; :A Russian spy under the protection of the Duc d'Orléans. He is rather stout and has a long beard, but is also a talented swordsmen. To get to France he poses as a fur trader. At one time when he caught D'Eon trailing after him, he asked whether D'Eon was one of 'her' relatives, then dismisses the question as D'Eon \\"looks exactly like her\\". Despite being part of a plot to assassinate the Russian Empress, he seems to grieve her death, and genuinely wishes to do good for his country. Loosely based on Alexander Vorontsov. ; ; :Part-time peddler, part- time alchemist working under Comte de Saint-Germain, his real name is Giuseppe Balsamo and was first seen selling perfumes in Russia. A rather aloof and debaucherous man, Cagliostro has acquired a taste for fine liquor wherever he goes. He describes his life as a 'comedy on stage', and tells Lorenza that he will create 'a high class tragedy' instead. Later he switches alliances, betraying Saint-Germain and working for Maximillien. At the anime series' end, when Robin takes up Maximillien's name to lead a revolution, he is seen standing behind him supportively. Based on the historical figure Alessandro Cagliostro. ; ; :Lorenza, a Poet and Cagliostro's alluring partner, though he seems far more interested in wine than in her. Despite her demure appearance, Lorenza is not above being ruthless in using the power of the Psalms to bind or kill anyone who stands in her way. Psalms have been seen on her body, which she can use to control animals. Through the anime she is given more power, though she still remains inferior to Lia's spirit. At the end of the series she is seen standing behind Robin as he takes up Maximillien's name and leads the Revolutionary Order. She was based on the historical Lorenza Feliciani, who was Alessandro Cagliostro's wife. ; ; :A Parisian secret police inspector, and D'Eon's friend. Bernis eventually falls victim to the Poet's gargoyle transformation, and is forced to attack D'Eon early on in the story. As D'Eon struggles in their swordfight, Lia takes over for the first time and kills him. At first, D'Eon mistakenly believed he killed him and mourns greatly. England ; ; :Queen of England, wife of George III. She was friends with Lia and recognized her when D'Eon was in another disguise. She is loosely based on Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. ; ; :The King of England and husband of Queen Mary. He is as calm as King Louis, though younger, and it is revealed that he helped back the Revolutionary Order so that he could restore absolute authority back to the Kings. Based on George III of England. ; ; :The French ambassador to England, and Durand's old friend. Guercy is a bit of a drunkard, and his loyalty appears to go to whoever pays him the largest amount of gold. He does not carry much pride for his country, though he does keep a painting of Versailles. According to Ozaki, Guercy was designed based on Jack Black in School of Rock. ; ; :The British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He does not trust foreigners, though he admires Teillagory for his swordsmen skills. ; ; :A Poet and the abbot of Medmenham Abbey, founder of the Hellfire Club. His power and influence is so great that even Maximillien bows to him, and he is revealed to be the one who taught Maximillien how to use the Psalms. He is loosely based on the historical figure, Francis Dashwood. ; :Administrator of the Hellfire Club, and is a mute. Described as Dashwood's eyes, he is usually found at the man's side and is very skilled with the use of Psalms. Unfortunately he is not as strong as Maximillien, who uses the same Psalms to kill him. ; ; :Co-Founder of the Hellfire Club and English Secretary of State. He is loosely based on John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He is a close confidant of King George, though the same cannot be said for the Queen. Russia ; ; :Empress of Russia, and a close friend of Lia's. She is described to be extravagant, and is first shown refusing jewels due to their small size. In order to meet her, D'Eon and Robin entered a cross-dressing ball, and D'Eon's disguise as Lia effectively draws her attention. Inspired by Lia, whose portrait still hangs in the palace, Elizaveta has hopes of reforming Russia, especially with a women's social status. It was briefly mentioned that during her reign, she abolished the death penalty. Loosely based on Tsaritsa Elizabeth. ; ; :Wife of Pyotr III, and friend of Empress Elizaveta. She learns of an assassination plot against the Empress and does her best to warn the French spies. When the Empress is killed, she works with D'Eon to seize power from her husband. Her character is loosely based on Tsaritsa Catherine II. ; ; :Ekaterina's abusive husband and heir to the Russian throne. He is alcoholic and always seem drunk, even when in meetings discussing assassinations. He has a morbid fascination with strangling rats and playing with toy soldiers. Loosely based on Peter III of Russia. ; ; :The grand chancellor of Russia; loosely based on Bestuzhev-Ryumin. From early on the Empress suspected him of treason, and he has been proven to be protecting Vorontsov. He does however seem to dislike Cagliostro, loath and fear Lia, and is paranoid of his own partners, mainly because he does not like or trust foreigners. He has fanatical pride for Russia and has a prejudiced hatred of women.

It originally aired on ABC on 20 November 1965. The episode was directed by Sidney Hayers and written by Colin Finbow. Plot A local poacher is drowned in a field during a sudden heavy deluge of rain. Steed and Mrs Peel investigate and discover that this is a frequent occurrence in the area. Mrs Peel visits the Welsh brother of the poacher, Eli, who informs them that his brother was an alcoholic and used to steal from a local distillery which also has a massive supply of spring water in its tanks. Steed visits a prophet-like old eccentric named Jonah who has been writing to The Times, foreseeing the floods in the village and talking of a \\"great flood coming\\" and seemingly believes himself to be Noah, building his own ark. Jonah claims to see the same cloud in the sky every day. Mrs Peel visits the distillery, whimsically named Grannys Groggs, and finds the man in charge, Dr. Sturm, very unfriendly and quick to get rid of her. On leaving she sees a rack full of trench coats and umbrellas. Eli arranges with Mrs Peel to break into the distillery at night through one of the storage huts. Steed revisits Jonah who curiously asks Steed if Mrs Peel is a very sinful woman because of a comment she gave him that she was \\"going into the pit of iniquity\\". Mrs Peel arrives at the distillery to meet Eli and discovers he has been drowned. Steed arrives to meet the doctor at the distillery, looking to \\"buy some wine\\", and encounters an attractive female employee who tells him that the doctor does not like people prying. However, the doctor believes Steed to be a top wine connoisseur and allows him to look around the distillery. Steed tastes the wine with the female employee and tries to get information from her about the \\"heavy rain\\" but to no avail. Steed and Mrs Peel revisit the field near the distillery, where Jonah keeps seeing the same cloud appearing. Peel discovers the relative humidity is so unusually high, 67.8%, that it is similar to the jungles of the Amazon. They report their findings to a top meteorologist, Sir Arnold Kelly, who has arrived in the area and is quite incredulous and is convinced the equipment is faulty. They return to the site and find the equipment has been tampered with. Steed returns to the distillery and catches the doctors moving a tub of dry ice. He tastes more wine and in doing so hears the sound of rain and sees a locked room, evidently full of ice. Steed returns to the doctor and enquires about the sound of rain and discovers that they are hiding something and force him to leave. The doctors discover the meteorologist taking samples in the field and drown him in a torrent of rain. The doctor is aware of his identity and of Jonah and Mrs Peel and dispatches some men to invite Mrs Peel to revisit the distillery. Mrs Peel is held at gunpoint at Jonah's barn and taken to the factory and placed on the high tech wine press machine to force her to tell them what she knows. A foreman from the distillery stays at Jonah's barn and is \\"converted\\" by Jonah who later tells Steed and that Mrs Peel is missing. Steed discovers that Jonah's ark was tampered with by the foreman and that it was intended to kill Jonah. Steed and Jonah revisit the field and hear the sound of water. They discover a manhole hidden underneath the grass and go down and explore underground. They discover the body of Kelly and overhear Dr. Sturm talking to Mrs Peel about his plans through the vent to the distillery and that he intends to sell his rainmaking device to a military nation of the highest bidder and describes it as the greatest weapon since the atomic bomb, a \\"great flood\\". Steed and Jonah enter the distillery through the vent when the doctor departs, and free Mrs Peel from the machine. They enter the \\"rain\\" room and fight with the distillery workers in the soaking wet environment. Dr. Sturm overblows the machine and kills himself to avoid the secret being stolen.

All Préfontaines in North America are descended from Antoine Fournier \\"dit Préfontaine\\" (born in 1663 in Picardie, France; died in 1702 in Montréal, Canada). He was a French soldier and a barrel cooper by trade in the Compagnie de Troyes, French Marines in Canada. At the time it was common for French soldiers to adopt a nom de guerre often in reference to a trade, a place or a military rank. Antoine's nom de guerre was \\"dit Préfontaine\\", French for \\"field (pré) with a spring (fontaine)\\". He arrived in New France in August 1685 and took part in Chevalier Pierre de Troyes successful raid on several English trading posts in the Hudson Bay and James Bay regions from March to October 1686 (Hudson Bay expedition (1686)). He married Marie Ronceray in 1688 in Longueuil, Québec. Antoine's only son, Adrien (1693–1760), was an important businessman and a major figure in the economic development of New France. Adrien in turn had a son by the same name, who was a slave owner and was killed at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham on September 13, 1759. By the early-to-mid-19th century, the various families descended from Antoine dropped the Fournier part of the surname in favour of Préfontaine. Two brothers from Longueuil, Québec, Alexis and Toussaint Fournier dit Préfontaine, participated in the initial engagement of the Lower Canada Rebellion, the Chambly Road incident of November 17, 1837. The rebels were inspired by the ideals of the American Revolution, republicanism and the desire for responsible and representative government. Alexis, an officer in the militia, resigned his commission the day before joining the Rebellion. When the Rebellion collapsed in November 1838, and after proudly admitting their active participation, even under the possible penalty of death or exile, both brothers were to spend a year in jail along with 1,100 other Patriotes. Two of Toussaint's sons, Raymond and François- Xavier, went on to have notable careers in their respective professions (see below). During the second half of the 19th century, several Préfontaine families emigrated from Québec to New England, the Midwest and the North-West of the United States. Others emigrated to Western Canada, notably to Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Two rivers located in the Seigneurie de Beloeil, Montérégie Region of Québec, carry the family name - Ruisseau Préfontaine (33 kilometres) and Ruisseau Préfontaine-Brodeur (32 kilometres). A neighborhood in the town of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, Québec is named Quartier Préfontaine. There is a street named Préfontaine in each of the cities of Montréal, QC, Longueuil, QC, Laval, QC, Beloeil, QC, Seattle, WA and Las Vegas, NV, an avenue or drive in each of the towns of Sainte-Agathe-des-Monts, QC, Coos Bay, OR and Rifle (Garfield County), CO, a street in the village of Saint-Pierre-Jolys, MB and a long east-west road named Préfontaine that crosses a large part of south-east Manitoba.

They have yet to make their debut at the Rugby World Cup. It is governed by the Brunei Rugby Football Union History Rugby Union, which is played in 105 countries around the world, has been played in Brunei since the 1950s. The Brunei Rugby Football Union was set up in 1977, affiliated to the Rugby Football Union (RFU) of Twickenham. From then on, Brunei regularly sent teams to participate in regional 'Sevens' competitions, particularly the SCC Sevens in Singapore and the prestigious Hong Kong Sevens. Since joining the Asian Rugby Football Union, the Brunei Rugby Team has taken part in a number of international competitions. Although presently recording a rather unfavourable Win-Loss ratio in the international rugby scene, Brunei rugby is continually improving with efforts being concentrated in the development of youth players through the Under-19 Squad. The Brunei national rugby union team plays in the Asian Rugby Football Union 6th Division along with Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos. Under-19 Squad The Under-19 National Rugby Squad of Brunei is seen as a platform from which the Brunei Rugby Football Union seeks to develop young players for the Senior team. Currently, the Under-19 squad has played in two Asian Under-19 Rugby Tournaments (as of September 2007) in Lahore, Pakistan and Taipei, Taiwan respectively. The first ever Brunei Under-19 Rugby International was played against the Pakistan Under-19 Team at the Fortress Stadium in Lahore. Brunei emerged victorious with a scoreline of 14-5 in their favour - an upset considering the comparative populations and rugby history of the respective countries. Former Fiji National coach George Dreadon Simpkin commented on the impressive pace of the Bruneian backline whilst spectating the encounter. The free-running style of open, fast-paced play has become a trademark of the Bruneian team, although it has come under heavy criticism for sacrificing form and discipline in the favour of quick, energy-consuming tries.

For Ignacio Sánchez Mejías was without equal as a bullfighter and as a man\\", quoted in Rafael López-Pedraza \\"Reflections on the Duende\\"\\"Ignacio Sánchez Mejías: El torero de 27\\" (other name for bullfighter is matador). He was also a writer. He enjoyed enormous popularity -- he was attractive to women, admired by men, and a sympathetic personality to artists, especially those of the Generación del 27. When he died after a goring (cornada) in the Plaza of Manzanares, he was memorialized by Miguel Hernández, Rafael Alberti and other famous poets, but probably the best of these works is Federico García Lorca's Llanto por la muerte de Ignacio Sánchez Mejías (\\"Weeping for the Death of Ignacio Sánchez Mejías\\"),\\"The best- known poem of Federico García Lorca is 'Llanto por Ignacio Sánchez Mejías'\\", from article \\"Bullfighting\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online for many the best Spanish elegy since the Coplas por la muerte de su padre (\\"Verses for the death of his father\\") by Jorge Manrique. Seville: Childhood and youth Sánchez Mejías was born in 1891 in the Calle de la Palma, Seville. He was the son of a rich and stern doctor who insisted that he follow in his footsteps, but he never studied medicine. He received his high school diploma (bachillerato) by examination as an adult. Before, in the Escolapios (Catholic schools) he played truant in order to play at bullfighting with other children, among them José Gómez, years later called Joselito, the greatest bullfighter of all time and without a doubt the most important influence in the life of Ignacio Sánchez. To America and back to Spain; banderillero At the age of 17 he embarked with another youth as a stowaway on a ship for New York City. Detained at immigration, the police at first mistook them for anarchists, but Sánchez's brother Aurelio, who lived in Mexico, was able to secure their release. Sánchez took a job in Veracruz, but he could not forget having played at bullfighting in the sandy ground near the Torre del Oro in Seville; he made his debut in the ring as a banderillero in Morelia in 1910. Back in Spain, he appeared in Madrid in September 1913, and on 21 June 1914 in his native Seville. He received a grave goring, which broke his femur. That he did not die was attributable to his youth and his physical strength, but the injury and its consequences delayed his career for years. He continued as an outstanding banderillero, according to those who knew. These included Belmonte, Rafael Gómez \\"El Gallo\\", and the youngest of los Gallos, his childhood friend Joselito, with whom he had become related by his marriage in 1915 to Joselito's sister, Lola Gómez Ortega. In the next three years he was a member of Joselito's team, as the premier banderillero in Spain. His brother- in-law was also exceptional with the banderillas, and in this school Ignacio Sánchez Mejías was formed as a matador. Matador de toros In 1919 he made his debut in Barcelona at the hands of Joselito and with Belmonte also in the ring. His alternativa was confirmed in Madrid in April 1920, and already the characteristics he was known for throughout his career had appeared: very technical, very valiant, very popular, and with the ability to excite any crowd by his courage and his arrogance.Rafael López-Pedraza, op. cit. He contracted more than 100 corridas for 1920, and only the occurrence of two more gorings prevented him from making all the appearances. Still, Talavera was waiting. On 16 May he was alternating there with Joselito when the bull Bailaor gave his brother-in-law a tremendous, unexpected goring. While Joselito was taken to the infirmary, Sánchez killed the bull. Afterwards when he went to the infirmary to see his friend, he was already dead. He watched over the corpse that night, in tears. The photograph of Sánchez overwhelmed by grief supporting his head with an open hand and with the other caressing the face of the reclining Joselito, tranquil in his glory, is perhaps the most emotional in the history of tauromaquia. Love life and intellectual life; contact with Generación del 27 Perhaps the memory of Joselito led him to a liaison with the girlfriend of the dead matador, Encarnación López (La Argentinita). She was an intelligent, attractive woman, an exceptional performer and great dancer, as was her sister Pilar. Although Sánchez had had many tempestuous affairs, like the time in Mexico when a husband caught him in bed with his wife and he had to make a hasty getaway, it was for La Argentinita only that he would leave his wife Lola -- from the sister to the girlfriend. In 1925 they made their relationship official, but time had passed. They were both famous, rich, intelligent, attractive, and, above all, in love. There was no divorce in Spain, but Sánchez and La Argentinita had two children together, whom he adored. He established them in a separate room in his property Pino Montano. In Madrid he had a room in the Palace, although he lived in the house of La Argentinita. Through her he became a good friend of García Lorca. She had set to music \\"Los cuatro muleros\\" and other popular pieces for him. Through her he also met great musicians such as Manuel de Falla, and through García Lorca Jorge Guillén, Rafael Alberti, José Bergamín, Dámaso Alonso, Gerardo Diego and others. In 1923 he did not fight. In 1924, after recovering his reputation, the bullfighting promoters reached an agreement not to pay him more than 7,000 pesetas for a fight. Sánchez insisted on applying the law of supply and demand, and in reprisal they removed him from the Festival of Seville in 1925. But he, with the agreement of the matador, entered the ring apparently spontaneously, impeccably dressed, and placed three exceptional pairs (of banderillas) in a Santa Coloma bull. The public acclaimed him, but the promoters set the critics against him. Critic, poet, actor, sportsman Sánchez then became a critic of his own faenas in La Unión. He held his own in this war of nerves and of image, but after several serious gorings, he got tired and left the circuit in 1927. That year he returned to Seville and arranged a meeting of young poets at his estate who wanted to pay homage to Luis de Góngora in his tricentenary. Here was born the famous Generación del 27. In their best-known group photo, Sánchez appears with his ever-present tipped hat, elegant, smiling. He wrote several theater works, including Sinrazón, on a psychoanalytic theme, which María Guerrero introduced with great critical success, and which was translated into various languages. Also Zaya, an autobiographical piece on bullfighting and metaphysics. Other works included Ni más ni menos, a poetic farce; Soledad, an outline; and Las calles de Cádiz, a grand musical comedy for La Argentinita, with street urchins from La Isla, and including the popular songs of García Lorca. He also led a conference on tauromaquia at Columbia University in New York. He was a movie actor, a polo player, an auto-racer, a novelist, a \\"poet\\", a friend of General Sanjurgo, an unsuccessful promoter of an airport in Seville, president of Real Betis soccer club, of the Red Cross, etc. The end: Return to the bulls and to love affairs In 1934 he returned to bullfighting. Earlier he had had a torrid affair with the French Hispanist Marcelle Auclair, whom he had met at the home of Jorge Guillén. His lovesickness was so clear to García Lorca that he wanted him to end the affair because he was convinced that La Argentinita would kill them both. Sánchez followed Auclair to Paris, where he ran into her husband. She was afraid, and did not want to make a commitment. She returned the following year to see him fight and triumph in Santander. Thereafter their history does not continue, because it was interrupted by Sánchez's death. Domingo Ortega suffered an automobile accident, and his proxy, Dominguín, asked Sánchez to substitute for him in Manzanares, on 11 August 1934. This came at a bad time for Sánchez, but because the bulls were great he did not want to seem like he was avoiding them. He had no car, no hotel, not even a cuadrilla (bullfighting team). For the first time in his life, he turned to the lottery and drew two tickets with the numbers of the bulls of Ayala that he was scheduled to fight. The first, number 16, Granadino, docile, thin-horned and coarse-skinned, nevertheless gored him. He did not want to be operated on in the miserable infirmary and asked to be taken back to Madrid, but the ambulance took several hours and the trip went very badly. Two days later he was diagnosed with gangrene. He died, in pain and delirium, on the morning of the 13th. Trivia *There is a street that bears his name in the Feria de Abril, Sevilla. *The Valencian sculptor Mariano Benlliure included him among the figures carrying the coffin of Joselito, in the mausoleum in the cemetery of San Fernando in Seville, since 1926.

Biography Woodhead was born in Woodthorpe, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, a son of Joseph Woodhead. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. He was a right-handed batsman and right-arm medium-pace bowler, who achieved little success, although he retired with the bowling average of 4.00, as his solitary spell of twenty balls gained him the wicket with only four runs conceded. In ten innings, he made a total of 57 runs, with a best score of 18, for an average of 5.70. In his only appearance for his University, he recorded a pair in a heavy defeat against Surrey at The Oval in a two-day match on 13 and 14 June 1889. He did take his only first-class wicket in this match, bowling J.W. Sharpe for a duck. His next match was for Yorkshire against Cambridge University at Fenners in 1893, when he compiled five and eight runs when opening the innings, in a low scoring match won by Cambridge by twenty seven runs. In the same year, he turned out against the touring Australians at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, but was dismissed for three and eight runs at the top of the order. In 1892, he played for Yorkshire in a non-first-class, two-day fixture, against the then Minor Counties outfit Durham at Thrum Hall, Halifax, making eight runs in Yorkshire's first innings, and then 15 not out from number three in the order, to steer them to a seven wicket victory. His last season, in 1894, saw him feature in a two-day loss against Leicestershire in a friendly first-class match when, demoted in the order to number seven, he scored eight and a duck, and his swan song came against his old University when Yorkshire lost by 119 runs. Woodhead did post his career best score of 18 in his final first-class innings, before he was bowled by Burrough. Woodhead died, aged 75, in August 1943 in Huddersfield.

She had applied ten times to Seneca College but was never granted an interview. Bhadauria claimed that she was not interviewed because of her ethnicity.

The roots of legislations, policies and guide lines for natural resource management in India can be traced back to the days of British colonialism. The relevant constitutional framework at the backdrop of management of forest resources are briefly enumerated as follows: *Forest Policy, Govt. of India - In 1952, the erstwhile Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Government of India enunciated a Forest policy to be followed in the management of state forests in the country. The need for this Policy was to highlight the changes since the enunciation of the Forest policy of 1894. Forest, however. continued to be viewed as source of revenue. While recognizing that the proportion of land to be kept permanently under forest would naturally vary in different regions, the policy said that practical consideration suggests, \\"that India, as whole, would aim at maintaining one third of its total land area under forests.\\" Emphasis was laid on the conversion of low value mixed forests to high value plantation of commercial species. *Bamboo Policy - Bamboo and Rattan represent untapped major resource of Assam State whose full ecological and economic potential needs to be recognized, developed and promoted in a manner ensuring ecological security for all round sustainable development of the State and also the livelihood security to its people. http://asmenvis.nic.in/ViewMajorActivity.aspx?Id=1107&Year;=2013http://envfor.nic.in See also * Van Vigyan Kendra (VVK) Forest Science Centres * Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education ReferencesExternal links * Category:State agencies of Assam Category:Environmental organisations based in India Assam ","title":"Department of Environment and Forests, Government of Assam"},{"id":"10383006","text":"Frank Bissell \\"Lefty\\" Killen (November 30, 1870 – December 3, 1939) was a professional baseball player.

He used it to teach himself to fly during late 1910. After De Havilland was appointed assistant designer and test pilot at the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough (later the Royal Aircraft Factory) in December 1910 the War Office bought the aircraft for £400.Jackson 1962 p.470 the aircraft was given the designation F.E.1 (Farman Experimental) Design and development After the failure of his first aircraft design Geoffrey de Havilland began construction of his second aircraft, re-using the engine that he had designed for the earlier machine. Like the Bristol Boxkite and several other contemporary British designs, this closely followed the general lines of the Farman III, being a two-bay pusher biplane with an elevator carried on booms in front of the wing, the pilot seated on the lower wing directly in front of the engine, and a second elevator and a rudder behind the wings. Lateral control was effected by a pair of ailerons mounted on the upper wing. De Havilland and several other pilots flew it at Farnborough until it crashed in the summer of 1911 while piloted by Lt. Theodore J. Ridge, who was later killed flying the S.E.1. \\"Rebuild\\" as the F.E.2 The crashed F.E.1 was \\"rebuilt\\" in August 1911 as the F.E.2. In fact it was a \\"rebuild\\" in name only, as it was a completely new design, incorporating few if any actual components of the original (at this stage Farnborough were still not authorised to build aircraft from scratch). The Iris engine, seriously damaged in the F.E.1 crash, was replaced by a 50 hp. Gnome rotary engine, a two-seater nacelle was fitted, and the fore-elevator was replaced with one incorporated into a sesquiplane tail in the conventional manner. In this form many tests were carried out, including the fitting of a Maxim machine gun, and seaplane trials, it being fitted with a single central float. At this point the F.E.2 was powered by a 70 hp (52 kW) Gnome.Bruce (Flight 1952) says a 50 hp Gnome In 1913 the F.E.2 design was once more heavily reworked with a new and streamlined nacelle, upper wing panels which extended the span to 42 ft (12.08 m) and a revised tail with a smaller rudder and tailplane lifted to the top longerons. The nacelle was by now deeper and more spacious, while the mainplanes were identical to those of the B.E.2a. The Gnome was replaced by a 70 hp (52 kW) air cooled Renault V-8 engine. Effectively, although the factory now routinely constructed original aircraft, it was another case of a new design reusing the designation of an older one. It was lost in a crash near Wittering on 23 February 1914 when the pilot, R. Kemp lost control while in a dive, Kemp being unable to recover from the \\"steep spiral descent\\", killing his passenger. The rebuilt design had not had sufficient fin area to balance the area of the nacelle side.Flight p724, The F.E.2a/b/d types produced in numbers in World War I followed the same general layout, but were considerably larger, and again of totally new design. This double re-use of the F.E.2 designation has caused considerable confusion among aviation historians.

White Tiger received his own entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition #11. Fictional character biography Hector Ayala was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. As a college student at New York's Empire State University, he discovered the tiger amulets that were formerly worn and thrown away by the Sons of the Tiger. Donning all three amulets, he transformed into the superhuman White Tiger. He discovered that wearing all the pendants at once increased his strength and gave him nearly superhuman skill in the martial arts.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #19 In his alter-ego, Ayala went into action for the first time against a street gang.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #20 He then battled the Prowler, who believed him to be a murderer.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #21 The White Tiger battled the Jack of Hearts who also believed him to be behind his father's murder.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #22-23 The White Tiger fought off unnamed costumed assailants of the Corporation crime cartel, who were threatening his sister and Jack of Hearts.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #26 Alongside Jack of Hearts, Shang-Chi, and Iron Fist, the White Tiger fought Stryke and other agents of the Corporation, and learned his brother Filippo was attempting to find employment with Fu Manchu.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #31 Hector then encountered the Sons of the Tiger.Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu #32 Ayala was impersonated by Professor Vasquez, and battled Spider-Man in the confusion.Spectacular Spider-Man #9-10 Ayala's secret identity was later publicly exposed in a battle with the villainous Lightmaster.Spectacular Spider-Man #20 Alongside Spider-Man and Daredevil, he then battled the Masked Marauder, Darter, and Carrion.Spectacular Spider-Man #25-31 Ayala was later gunned down by Gideon Mace and nearly killed. He was operated upon to remove the bullets, and recovered. Having gained an unhealthy psychological and physical addiction to the tiger amulets, Hector abandoned his identity as the White Tiger. He gave the amulets to a private detective nicknamed Blackbyrd, who returned them to the Sons of the Tiger. Hector then moved out west with his girlfriend Holly Gillis.Spectacular Spider-Man #52 After a while, the call to don the amulets and fight evil became too strong and Hector once again became the White Tiger.Daredevil vol. 2 #38 Soon after, Hector was wrongly accused of murder and convicted despite the efforts of his lawyer, Matt Murdock (a.k.a. Daredevil). Ayala was shot dead trying to escape, shortly before evidence emerged that belatedly proved his innocence.Daredevil vol. 2 #40 =Family legacy= Angela Del Toro, Hector's niece and an FBI agent, inherited the Jade Tiger amulets.Daredevil vol. 2 #69 Angela quit the FBI to understand the amulets, and was trained in the use of their powers by Daredevil,Daredevil vol. 2 #70 becoming the latest person to assume the White Tiger identity before being killed by the Hand and resurrected as their servant.Daredevil vol. 2 #113 Having been healed by Black Tarantula, she joined Daredevil in the Hand.Daredevil #500 Hector's teenage sister Ava Ayala later appeared as the new White Tiger.Avengers Academy #21 Powers and abilities As the White Tiger, Hector wore the three mystical tiger amulets (a head and two paws), which were green in some versions and yellow in the others, from the extra-dimensional realm of K'un-L'un, which were originally worn by the Sons of the Tiger (Abe Brown, Bob Diamond, and Lin Sun). When wearing the amulets, Hector's physical strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes & reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance were all enhanced, although not to the point of being invincible.

The school aims to provide a wide selection of courses and programs to accommodate its large student body. In 2005, Maclean's Magazine chose Jasper Place High School as the top overall high school in all of Canada. In 2008, adding the methods used by the E.I.U's quality of life model, Jasper Place Ranked 1st in Canada, and 2nd in North America. In 2014, Strathcona High School was named 2nd best in Canada, but scored the same as Jasper Place, leading into a tie. However, on an international level, JP fared better than Scona and ranked as the #1 school in North America due to the I.B program. In comparison, Strathcona tailed at #4. Jasper Place athletic teams are called the \\"Rebels\\". Programs of study The Jasper Place Composite High School Logo. Jasper Place High School offers a wide variety of programs and courses. The most notable of these are the full and partial International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) programs, as well as general Alberta curriculum studies. Jasper Place is the only Edmonton Public High School to offer both IB and AP. Jasper Place is also the only Edmonton school to offer Film Studies IB in addition to its many other IB courses. The school also has the largest offering of CTS courses in Edmonton and has developed a major focus on computers, having teamed up with NAIT, the University of Alberta, and Grant MacEwan in order to allow students to complete their high school courses and receive credit for introductory courses at these institutions. Beginning in the 2008/2009 school year, students were able to take an additional daily class known as \\"Block Zero\\" beginning before school begins, from 8:05 to 8:50. This makes it a shorter block then regular classes (45 minutes compared to 1.5 hours). Courses offered include extra AP or IB science classes needed to get the full number of hours needed for the AP/IB Science courses, as well as extra physical education. Beginning in the 2013–2014 school year, the school began offering Alternative Learning Opportunity (ALO) Days. The format of the days has varied depending on the year, as well as the semester. In the first semester that it was offered in, students could pick from a variety of courses that either lasted 1, 2 or 3 days (or a combination of courses so that they had 3 days worth of activities) that were spread out over the semester. This was changed in semester two of the same year to instead have two continuous days where the blocks were each 3 hours (all morning or all afternoon), in which students would go to their first and third block classes on the first day, and their second and fourth block classes on the second. In the 2014–2015 school year, the number of ALO days was increased to 5 a semester, and the format was again changed, to having students pick either one block, two blocks or all day sessions. The ALO Days have had controversy however, including from an Edmonton Journal columnist (who later had to apologize to the school), and have been marked with low attendance throughout. Fine arts= Art= Art and Honours Art courses are also offered at Jasper Place High School. Student artwork is displayed throughout the school. =Drama= Jasper Place High School offers regular Drama courses, but also offers Advanced Acting and Technical Theatre extracurricular classes. It is recommended that these extracurricular courses are taken in conjunction with Drama. The students also participate in the One Act Play Festival, direct one act plays, and participate in Improv. School productions Jasper Place High School's Masquerade Theatre sees two mainstage productions every year. However, 2008 was the school's first year performing a collective, Shadowed, a play written and performed by the entire cast and crew in addition to one main stage production. *2005/2006 – Twelfth Night, While The Lights Were Out *2006/2007 – Antigone, The Miss Firecracker Contest *2007/2008 – Our Town, Shadowed *2008/2009 – Much Ado About Nothing, Done to Death *2009/2010 – Scapino!, Twelve Angry Men *2010/2011 – Oliver Twist *2011/2012 – The Crucible *2012/2013 – A Midsummer Night's Dream *2013/2014 – Daisy Pulls It Off *2014/2015 – Macbeth *2015/2016 – Our Town *2016/2017 – Girls Like That (play) *2017/2018 - Blue Stockings *2018/2019 - The Crucible *2019/2020 - The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime =Music= The music program at Jasper Place High School is particularly well known for its wide variety of options. Students are offered Choir, Band, and Guitar, and introduced a Music Technology course during the 2008/2009 school year in which song-writing, composition, and technical music development is taught. Optional music clubs include Jazz Band, Glee Club and Drumline. Permaculture In February 2010, Jasper Place High School introduced a permaculture initiative. Since this time, the program has focused its efforts on transforming one of the school's courtyards into a self-sufficient food forest. Using principles found in ecology, the permaculture initiative at Jasper Place High School aims to more closely tie students to the natural processes that sustain life while at the same time acting as a cross-curricular resource for teachers, providing hands on experience for students, and regenerating ecology while simultaneously providing for human needs. Food produced in the permaculture program will be used by the school's culinary program. As of June 2012, the Jasper Place permaculture program continues to grow in acceptance and scope. In the Fall of 2012, teacher and permaculture designer, Dustin Bajer, will be brought back to JP to continue his work, in addition to co-running JP's new InSight Education program. Jasper Place Courtyard Food Forest Indigenous Permaculture Class (Aboriginal Studies) As of February 2011, Jasper Place will be offering the first ever 'Indigenous Permaculture class. Equal parts Science, design, and cultural studies, this new class aims to teach the Alberta Aboriginal Studies curriculum though permaculture. Course synopsis: Over tens of thousands of years, many indigenous cultures from around the world have developed belief systems, world-views, and a cosmology that has allowed them to provide for their own needs in ways that honour the living world that sustains them. Based in Science, guided by ethics, and steeped in Indigenous knowledge, students will learn the ecological principles behind permaculture design. Through an exploration of hand-on, project based discovery, students will draw from Science and the richness of the world's Indigenous Cultures to create designs that care for people and Earth. JP Permaculture and Social Media As a means of introducing permaculture concepts to the larger community, documenting progress for program granters, and encouraging similar initiatives, program coordinator Dustin Bajer has advocated for the use of blogs and social networks. As a result, a complete record of the JP Permaculture program can be found on the program's Blog. More recently, however, the JP Program has built a followings on the Jasper Place Permaculture Facebook Page and as JP_Permaculture on Twitter. Trades Jasper Place High School offers a wide range of trades, including culinary, cosmetology, welding, automotive class, aesthetics, carpentry and more. = Culinary Arts and Baking and Pastry Arts = The Culinary Arts Program at Jasper Place High School is designed to prepare students for the challenges of a demanding industry by providing students with an accredited and the essential foundation required to pursue a cooking career through our Cook Apprenticeship Program.

Category:Calvinism ","title":"Occasional hearing"},{"id":"10383118","text":"Assaji (Pali: Assaji, Sanskrit: Aśvajit) was one of the first five arahants of Gautama Buddha. He is known for his conversion of Sariputta and Mahamoggallana, the Buddha's two chief male disciples, counterparts to the nuns Khema and Uppalavanna, the chief female disciples. He lived in what is now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in northern India, during the 6th century BCE.  Background  Assaji was born into a brahmin family. His father was one of the eight brahmin scholars who were invited by Suddhodana, the monarch of the Sakyan kingdom to Kapilavastu to read the fortune of his son Siddhartha. Assaji's father and six of the other brahmins had predicted that Siddhartha would either become a great religious leader or a great military monarch. Kaundinya, the youngest was the only one to confidently state that Siddhartha would become a Buddha. As a result, when Siddhartha renounced the world, Kaundinya and Assaji, as well as Bhaddiya, Vappa and Mahanama, three sons of three of the brahmin scholars joined Siddhartha in the ascetic life. The five joined Siddhartha in self-mortification practices at Uruvela. When Siddhartha abandoned this practice to follow the Middle Way, they left him in disappointment, believing he had become indulgent.  Arahantship  But after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited them at Sarnath, where they had journeyed after the split. The Buddha preached the Four Noble Truths and the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutra, and they became the first five bhikkhus of the sangha. Assaji was the last to understand the teachings, and the Buddha had to give further explanations to him and Mahanama while the other three bhikkhus went out on alms round. He was the last to reach sotapanna, the first stage of arahanthood. He became an arahant, together with the others, at the preaching of the Anattalakkhana Sutra.  Conversion of Sariputta and Mahamoggallana  Assaji was on alms round in Rajagaha, when Sariputta in his search for enlightenment, spotted him. Being impressed by Assaji's demeanour, Sariputta followed him until he had finished his alms round. After Assaji sat down, Sariputta asked him about his teacher and the teaching he followed. Initially, Assaji was reluctant to preach, explaining that he was inexperienced, but relented at the urging of Sariputta. Assaji spoke a short verse: Sariputta comprehended, gaining sotapanna, the first stage of arahanthood after hearing the teachings, which implied the Four Noble Truths. He went off to tell Mahamoggallana, his friend since childhood that he had been successful in his search for enlightenment. Both then became bhikkhus in the sangha and went on to become the two chief disciples of the Buddha. Assaji was highly venerated by Sariputta, and in whichever quarter Assaji was residing, Sariputta would extend his clasped hands in an attitude of reverent supplication in the direction, as well as turning his head when he lay down to sleep in the direction. One day when Assaji was going through Vesali for alms, the Nigantha Saccaka, who was looking for ascetics to debate, questioned him regarding the Buddha's Dharma because Assaji was a prominent disciple (ñātaññatara-sāvaka). Assaji delivered a summary of the doctrine contained in the Anattalakkhana Sutta. Confident of his ability to refute these views, Saccaka went with a large concourse of Licchavis to the Buddha and questioned him. This was the occasion for the preaching of the Cula-Saccaka Sutta.

In the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, they were tied just below the knee, where the leg is most slender, to keep the stocking from slipping. The advent of elastic has made them less necessary from this functional standpoint, although they are still often worn for fashion. Garters have been widely worn by men and women, depending on fashion trends. Garters in fashion Prohibition In Elizabethan fashions, men wore garters with their hose, and colourful garters were an object of display. In Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, \\"cross braced\\" garters (a long garter tied above and below the knee and crossed between), as worn by the character Malvolio, are an object of some derision. In male fashion for much of the 20th century a type of garter for holding up socks was used as a part of male dress; it is considered somewhat archaic now. =Use in wedding traditions= Bride putting on a garter There is a Western wedding tradition for a bride to wear a garter to her wedding, to be removed towards the end of the reception by the groom. This garter is not normally used to support stockings. This practice is often interpreted as symbolic of deflowering, though some sources attribute its origin to a superstition that taking an article of the bride's clothing will bring good luck. In the Middle Ages, the groomsmen would rush at the new bride to take her garters as a prize.Friedman, Albert B., and Richard H. Osberg. \\"Gawain's Girdle as Traditional Symbol.\\" The Journal of American Folklore 90.357 (1977): 301-15. Wedding Garter for the 21st Century Bride Today, the practice of removing the bride's garter is traditionally reserved for the groom, who will use either his hands or teeth, and then toss the garter to the unmarried male guests. This is performed after the tossing of the bouquet, in which the bride tosses her bouquet over her shoulder to be caught by the unwed female guests. According to superstition, the lady who catches the bouquet and the man who catches the garter will be the next man and woman among those in attendance to be married (though not necessarily to each other). The ceremony often continues with the man who catches the garter obliged to place it on the leg of the lady who caught the bouquet. Traditionally, the pair are obliged to share the next dance. =Use at high school proms in the United States= Prom garters were common in the 1960s and 1970s and often conferred on the date as a souvenir. If the date received the garter, it was typically hung from his rear-view mirror. At least since the mid-2000s, it has become common in US culture for young women attending a high school prom to wear a garter, usually designed to match the style and color of the young woman's dress. The prom garter may be worn throughout the evening and is sometimes given to the young woman's date as a souvenir. A young woman may also choose to keep the garter rather than give it away, as a token of her prom night. In some cases, young people may participate in a \\"garter and tie\\" dance (often hosted by the high school as part of the prom), during or after which either the young woman herself or the young woman's date removes the garter and exchanges it for the date's tie. When the garter is given early in the evening, the young woman's date may wear it on their arm for the remainder of the evening. In areas where prom garters are common, it has become a tradition for young women to pose for a picture with other female friends before the prom in which they pull up the skirts of their dresses to display their prom garters, which are generally worn a few inches above the right knee. The giving or taking of the prom garter may or may not have the same sexual implications that are associated with wedding garters; however, the giving of the prom garter is often interpreted as publicly designating the pair as a romantic couple. Suspenders or garter belts and stockings A woman with her suspenders showing Boston Garter sock garters for men from the beginning of the 20th century from the permanent collection of the Museo del Objeto del Objeto Suspenders or suspender belts, also known as \\"garter belts\\" in American English, are an undergarment consisting of an elasticated material strip usually at least in width; it can be wider. Two or three elastic suspender slings are attached on each side, where the material is shaped to the contours of the body. The suspenders are typically clipped to stockings with metal clips into which a rubber disc is inserted through the stocking material effectively 'locking' the stocking in place. These are normally attached to a length of elastic allowing for adjustment. These clips, also known as suspender slings, are best attached to stockings with a simple welt that do not have lace, or 'hold-ups' with a silicone rubber lining. Suspender (garter) belts are usually worn at the waist or just slightly below to prevent the belt sliding down as it is pulled downward by the stockings. Some undergarments such as corselettes or girdles may come with suspender slings attached. By the late 20th century and into the 21st, pantyhose or tights were more widely worn than stockings. And some stockings, referred to as hold-ups, have a band of latex rubber molded to the stocking top to keep them up without suspenders. But suspenders continue to be used by people who prefer stockings to tights, and doctors may advise patients with a history of thrush or cystitis to avoid tights; the trapped heat and moisture can exacerbate any infection present. People with a latex allergy must avoid hold-ups. While most commonly used for regular stockings, suspender belts can also be used for medical support hosiery worn due to varicose veins or poor circulation. Stockings are often considered to be sensual or erotic, both in person and in photographs, and some people enjoy dressing up for special occasions in attractive suspender belts or basques. =In ice hockey= Ice hockey players use suspenders for holding up hockey socks. As these socks are essentially woollen tubes, they need to be kept from rolling onto ankles. The socks can be held up by either hockey tape or hockey suspenders, which function like stocking suspenders. History=18th century= La Toilette, (detail) Francois Boucher, 1742 Garters in the 18th century could be elaborately decorated and were sometimes embroidered with names, dates, mottoes or humorous phrases. Prior to the invention of elastic, they were fastened by buckles, or threaded with spiral springs to grip the wearer's leg. =19th century= Garter, Chippewa (Native American), early 19th century, Brooklyn Museum Some women wore stockings with a plain elastic garter or narrow material tied tightly, not suspenders, or by simply rolling the top of the stocking, because it seemed more practical or they could not afford classic corsetry, thus creating a kind of predecessor of the modern hold ups. This was particularly common among servants and housemaid, particularly until the mid 1920s when the more modern suspender became readily available During the world's first long distance journey by automobile in 1888 Bertha Benz, the wife of the inventor of the automobile Dr Carl Benz, used a garter to insulate a broken wire of the Benz Patent- Motorwagen Nr. 3. In remembrance of this historic road trip today's official German scenic byway Bertha Benz Memorial Route follows the tracks of Bertha Benz from Mannheim via Heidelberg to Pforzheim (Black Forest) and back. Stockings have also been used as an emergency replacement for a car's fanbelt. =20th century= Garter belt, between 1955 and 1965, ModeMuseum Provincie AntwerpenDuring World War II, WAAFs were issued inexpensive suspenders. From the 1940s to '60s, suspenders became a common, popular alternative to the girdle, especially among teens and young women. Amid concerns girdles might cause abdominal flabbiness, suspender belts offered a simpler, more practical, and more comfortable choice when used simply to hold up their stockings. Since the early 1960s, many men's magazines featured images of women in underwear, with models in suspenders and stocking, often with slips, petticoats, corsets or a bra and knickers or panties in erotic pose. These images may have an erotic element and are sometimes presented as fetish fashion and also in pornography. =Contemporary practices= Suspender belts continue to be worn for their original purpose of holding up stockings. Suspenders today are available in a variety of styles, most commonly in white, 'fleshtone' beige- pink, or black with a satin finish. These are often now made from a mixture of nylon and spandex / lycra, being more readily available in retail stores. Variations of the suspender or garter belt include knickers with suspender attachments reminiscent of images of the 1960s and corsets or girdles with small loops inside the bottom edge for attaching suspenders. Knickers are normally worn on top of the suspender belt as this makes it easier to remove them to use the lavatory / bathroom. If worn underneath the belt, undressing may be rather complicated if using a public facility. Order of the Garter The garter of the Order of the Garter of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria The Order of the Garter traces its history to the Middle English poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. In the poem, Gawain accepts a girdle (very similar in function and connotation to a garter) from the wife of his host (while resisting her carnal temptations) to save his life and then wears it as a mark of shame for his moral failure and cowardice. King Arthur and his men proclaim it no shame and begin, themselves, to wear the girdle to indicate their shared fate. At that point, however, the garter was a larger garment that was used as a foundation. The Order, which is the oldest and highest British Order of Chivalry, was founded in 1348 by Edward III. The Order consists of Her Majesty The Queen who is Sovereign of the Order, His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales and 24 Knights Companions. The origin of the symbol of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a blue 'garter' with the motto Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense, is not known, as the earliest records of the order were destroyed by fire; however, the story is that at a ball possibly held at Calais, Joan, Countess of Salisbury dropped her garter and King Edward, seeing her embarrassment, picked it up and bound it about his own leg saying in French, \\"Evil [or shamed] be he that thinks evil of it.\\" This story is almost certainly a later fiction. This fable appears to have originated in France and may have been invented to discredit the Order. It is thought more likely that as the garter was a small strap used as a device to attach pieces of armour, it might have been thought appropriate to use the garter as a symbol of binding together in common brotherhood, whilst the motto probably refers to the leading political topic of the 1340s, Edward's claim to the throne of France. The patron saint of the Order is St George, the patron saint of soldiers and also of England, and the chapel of the order is St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.Order of the Garter information See also *Sleeve garter *Suspenders References Category:1930s fashion Category:1940s fashion Category:1950s fashion Category:1960s fashion Category:History of clothing Category:Belts (clothing) Category:Fashion accessories Category:Hosiery Category:Lingerie Category:Wedding clothing ","title":"Garter"},{"id":"10383140","text":"Double Dare is a 2004 documentary film about stuntwomen, specifically Jeannie Epper and Zoë Bell, directed by Amanda Micheli. The documentary follows Epper and Bell over several years, Epper from 1997 and Bell from the end of Xena: Warrior Princess in 2001, to 2003.PBS - Filmmaker Q&A; \\\\- Independent Lens - DOUBLE DARE Plot The film begins with Bell finishing her work on Xena and Epper searching for continuing work in Hollywood despite her age, even considering liposuction before forgoing cosmetic surgery. Xena ends its run and Bell struggles with what to do next in her career. Meanwhile, Epper negotiates to have a women's category included in the Taurus World Stunt Awards (also called the World Stunt Awards). Bell is invited to the United States for a Xena convention. There she meets Epper and, obtaining a ticket with the help of the documentary crew, attends the stunt awards. Though initially receiving an offer to work on a series starring Victoria Pratt, Bell ultimately does not get the job and returns home to New Zealand. The film resumes one year later with Bell still training, though unemployed, and planning a move to America. She stays with Epper, who is attempting to get a job working on 2 Fast 2 Furious with Terry Leonard. Epper helps Bell assemble the necessary elements for her to start her career in America, such as a CV and head shots. She also warns Bell about the deceptive nature of Hollywood, instructing her to list her weight as 130 lbs when Bell actually judges herself to weigh 145. Epper takes her to a training session, where they encounter Quentin Tarantino's stunt scout Kenny Lesco, who is looking for someone to double Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. Lesco arranges for an audition on the same day as the training session. Epper and Bell drive to Tarantino's Culver City training center for the audition, there meeting Tarantino himself as he evaluates Bell. Much to her delight, she earns the job doubling Thurman and is sent to train in Beijing with Yuen Wo Ping. Eventually Bell begins filming for Kill Bill Vol. 1; the documentary shows her working on the fight between Beatrix Kiddo (Thurman) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and her bodyguards, as well as several other fight scenes. The film ends with Epper being honored by the Stuntmen's Association and Bell speaking optimistically about her future as an adult.

Most of its eastern portion is an urban corridor in the Augusta metropolitan area. It travels within portions of Columbia and Richmond counties. It is known as Washington Road from its western terminus to the Columbia–Richmond county line. On both sides of the county line, it is known as Pleasant Home Road. It is known as Riverwatch Parkway from just west of the county line to the northern part of downtown Augusta. In downtown, it is known as part of Jones Street and Reynolds Street. Route description SR 104 begins at an intersection with U.S. Route 221 (US 221), SR 47, and SR 150 in Pollards Corner. It travels to the southeast as part of Washington Road and crosses over Kiokee Creek on the Robert W. Pollard Bridge. Just over later, it crosses over Little Kiokee Creek on the B. Edward Tankersley Memorial Bridge. Slightly more than after that, it crosses over Euchee Creek on the G.B. \\"Dip\\" Lamkin Bridge. Just before entering Evans, and just west of the intersection with William Few Parkway, the highway transitions into a retail corridor. In Evans, it travels southwest of Evans Towne Center Park and intersects the northern terminus of SR 383 (North Belair Road). SR 104 curves to the south- southeast and intersects both the eastern terminus of Towne Centre Drive and the western terminus of Riverwatch Parkway. It then curves to the east and intersects SR 232 (Columbia Road) and the southern terminus of Ruth Street on the Evans–Martinez line. SR 104 and SR 232 travel concurrently for approximately . At an intersection with the southern terminus of Old Evans Road, SR 232 splits off to the south-southeast onto Bobby Jones Expressway. After curving to the east-southeast, SR 104 enters Richmond County and the city limits of Augusta. Immediately after entering the county, SR 104 intersects the western terminus of SR 104 Connector (SR 104 Conn.), which takes the Washington Road name. The mainline route turns left onto Pleasant Home Road, briefly re-enters Columbia County, and immediately turns right onto Riverwatch Parkway. Less than after that turn, it re-enters Richmond County. Approximately later, it intersects SR 28 (Furys Ferry Road). The roadway travels to the northeast and curves back to the southeast, to an interchange with Interstate 20 (I-20; Carl Sanders Highway). SR 104 curves to a more east- southeasterly direction. After curving around the eastern side of Eisenhower Park, the highway begins paralleling the Savannah River, before it crosses over the Augusta Canal on the William \\"Billy\\" L. Powell Jr. Bridge. The highway has an interchange that leads to downtown Augusta and the Medical District. About later is another crossing of the canal, this time on an unnamed bridge. Just after this crossing, at an intersection with 15th Street, Riverwatch Parkway ends; eastbound traffic uses Jones Street, while westbound traffic uses Reynolds Street. Three blocks later, SR 104 meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 25 Business/SR 4 (13th Street). Here, Jones Street continues as a one-way street, while Reynolds Street continues as a two-way street. All of SR 104 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History The road that would eventually become SR 104 was established by the middle of 1930 as SR 52 just east of the Columbia–Richmond county line. By the third quarter of 1932, SR 52 was redesignated as SR 104 and was extended northwest to Phinizy. This extension was unimproved, but maintained. By the end of 1934, a small segment was under construction northwest of the county line. By the end of the next year, a segment of the highway, farther to the northwest had completed grading, but was not surfaced. A year later, the under construction segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. It was under construction for the rest of its length. By the end of the year, the highway had a completed hard surface from about Evans to the SR 52 intersection in Martinez. A few months later, it had a completed hard surface segment just northwest of Evans. In early 1940, it had completed grading, but was not surfaced from Phinizy to just northwest of Evans. By the end of the year, it had a sand clay or top soil surface from Phinizy to just northwest of Evans. About five years later, SR 104 had a completed hard surface from just southeast of Pollards Corner to just northwest of Evans. By the end of 1946, it was hard surfaced from Leah to just southeast of that community. By March 1948, it was hard surfaced from Pollards Corner to just southeast of that community. Before the end of the first quarter of 1949, the highway was hard surfaced from Leah to Pollards Corner. By 1988, the Leah-to- Pollards Corner segment was redesignated as SR 47, due to that highway being shifted to the east. Riverwatch Parkway was originally constructed in the late 1980s and early 1990s to relieve heavy rush-hour traffic on congested Washington Road and John C. Calhoun Expressway, which many Augusta area residents used (and continue to use) to travel to and from work. Major intersectionsAugusta connector route State Route 104 Connector (SR 104 Conn.) is a connector route that exists entirely within the northern part of Richmond County.

Jonson's masque displays the traditional folklore and iconography of Christmas at an early-modern and pre-commercial stage of its development.  The masque  The masque opens with the entrance of a personified Christmas and his attendants, one of whom leads the way in, beating a drum. Christmas is dressed in a doublet and hose (color unspecified) and a \\"high-crowned hat;\\" he has a \\"long thin beard\\" and white shoes. Christmas is soon followed by his ten children, who are led in, on a string, by Cupid (who is dressed like a London apprentice, with his wings at his shoulders). The \\"Sons and Daughters\\" of Christmas are Carol, Misrule, Gambol, Offering, Wassail, Mumming, New-Year's-Gift, Post and Pair,\\"Post and pair\\" was a card game. and even Minced-Pie and Baby-Cake. Each has his or her own fantastic get-up. Carol, for instance, wears a tawny coat and a red cap, and has a flute in his belt. Mince-Pie is attired \\"like a fine cook's wife, drest neat,\\" while Gambol is dressed \\"like a tumbler, with a hoop and bells.\\" Each of the ten is followed by a torchbearer-attendant, carrying marchpanes, cakes, bottles of wine, and other holiday gear. (The specific details of the costumes and furnishings, like \\"an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it,\\" participate in a dense web of folklore connections. Baby-Cake comes last in the procession of children, for example, because miniature \\"twelvetide\\" cakes were associated with Twelfth Night, the last day of the Christmas holiday season.) Cupid is soon joined by his mother Venus, who like her son is dressed down in contemporary London garb: the goddess appears as a \\"deaf tire- woman\\"A \\"tire-woman\\" was one who attended gentlewomen's elaborate wig-and-hair arrangements, rather comparable to a modern hairdresser. who lives in Pudding Lane. The speeches of Venus and the other characters are rich in contemporary allusions and references; Venus, for example, mentions Richard Burbage and John Heminges, prominent actors with the King's Men. The masque proceeds to singing and dancing, with the stated intent to present \\"A right Christmas, as of old it was.\\" Publication Christmas, His Masque was produced too late to be included in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616; it was the first masque in the second folio of 1641. It also exists in manuscripts.  Critical significance  Early commentators tended to dismiss Jonson's masque as a piece of holiday fluff, often noting that the work is less a true masque and more of a mummers' show. Modern critics have looked beneath its surface to detect serious political, social, and cultural implications. Jonson's text, in promoting a traditional Christmas, was taking a position favored by King James I and opposed to the contemporary culture of the merchants of the City of London and especially that of the Puritans, who were overtly hostile to the traditional holiday. The text of the masque shows an abundant and rather biting satire aimed at the anti-Christmas forces in Jacobean society.Marcus, pp. 78–85. King James had made an important speech before the Star Chamber earlier in 1616, in an attempt to promote traditional country life and pastimes, which were plainly in decline in an era of ever- greater urbanization and economic development.Marcus, p. 77. James would soon issue his proclamation known as the Book of Sports (1618), another attempt to support and reinforce the traditional country life in the face of rapid social change.Collins, p. 46. Jonson's masque is one element in this larger cultural debate.  Notes  Sources  * Collins, Tony. Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports. London, Routledge, 2005. * Evans, Robert C.

History The three-storey penthouse at 740 Park Avenue The building was constructed in 1929 by James T. Lee, the grandfather of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis – Onassis lived there as a child – and was designed by Rosario Candela and Arthur Loomis Harmon; Harmon became a partner of the newly named Shreve, Lamb and Harmon during the year of construction. The building was officially opened in October 1930, a year after the Great Depression began, and the poor timing was devastating. Even though the New York elite had moved in, the building had failed financially by 1933. It remained in the red for 50 years. It was not until the 1980s that the building's apartments sold for incredibly high prices.Goldberger, Paul \\"The King of Central Park West\\" Vanity Fair (September 2008) In 1937, one of the first well-known residents was John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who moved into 15B, a three-storey triplex that many still consider New York's crown jewel apartment. According to New York City real estate lore, \\"whoever inherits the biggest penthouse at 740 inherits the throne of New York society itself.\\" In 1971, Saul Steinberg bought that triplex for $285,000 () and after two divorces sold it to Stephen Schwarzman for \\"slightly above or below $30 million\\" in 2000. This was the highest price ever paid on Park Avenue until May 2012, when Howard Marks paid $52.5 million for two adjoining two-storey duplexes (totaling 30 rooms), which set a short-lived record as the highest price ever paid for a co-op apartment. In 1979, the French government purchased an 18-room duplex for $600,000 to be used as their United Nations ambassador's residence. The French government's duplex unit was sold in June 2014 for $70 million, reportedly $22 million over the asking price – a bidding war involving three prospective buyers escalated the eventual selling price. The buyer was hedge fund billionaire Israel Englander, who already lived in the unit directly above, and surpassed a record set just days earlier by Egypt's richest man, Nassef Sawiris, for a penthouse unit on nearby Fifth Avenue. Undergoing renovation in 2008 In 2005, author Michael Gross published a detailed book on the building and its history, 740 Park: The Story of the World's Richest Apartment Building.

It is a colourful and relatively robust lory (31 cm). There are seven subspecies, all with green wings, red heads and body around the wing, a black cap, grey-black cere, yellow underwings, and blue legs and belly. Most also have a blue nape and mantle (area between wings on the back). It remains overall widespread and common, but the subspecies cyanuchen is relatively rare, with fewer than 5000 individuals remaining. Subspecies Jurong Bird Park The subspecies vary considerably in colour: * L. l. lory: West Papuan islands and Bird's Head Peninsula. Blue of nape, mantle, and belly merge to cover most of body and are purple-blue. Red underwing coverts. Juvenile resembles erythrothorax or cyanuchen. * L. l. erythrothorax: The whole south coast of New Guinea east of Bird's Head Peninsula, and the SE north coast. Blue nape almost forms collar, blue comes halfway up belly. Yellow on wings. Blue mantle in two bands. Red underwing coverts. * L. l. somu: Southern hill districts of central New Guinea. Red mantle and nape, blue only low on belly. * L. l. salvadorii: Northwest coast of Papua New Guinea. Like erythrothorax but with blue-black underwing coverts. * L. l. viridicrissalis: Northeast coast of Western New Guinea. Like salvadorii but blue blacker everywhere. * L. l. jobiensis: Yapen and Mios Num islands. Like salvadorii but paler breast and mantle bands. * L. l. cyanuchen: Biak island. Black of cap meets blue of nape, single blue mantle stripe. Behavior Their black-capped lory inhabits the primary forest and forest edges in most lowland areas up to 1000m (sporadically to 1750m), but not monsoon forest or coconut plantations. It is usually found in pairs and occasionally in groups of 10 or more. Their diet includes pollen, nectar, flowers, fruit and insects.

Whiteway is a Mennonite Brethren, and a member of the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. Member of Parliament Whiteway first ran for the House of Commons in the 1968 election as a Social Credit candidate in Dauphin, and finished fourth against Progressive Conservative Gordon Ritchie. He joined the Progressive Conservative Party after the election, and ran under its banner in Selkirk in the 1972 election. He narrowly lost to New Democrat Doug Rowland. He was elected on his third attempt, defeating Rowland in a 1974 election rematch. The Liberal Party of Canada won a majority government in the 1974 election, and Whiteway entered parliament as a member of the official opposition. He was on the right-wing of his party, and opposed abortion, supported capital punishment, and spoke against federal funding for Planned Parenthood. On one occasion, he suggested that danger to a woman's health should be removed as permissible grounds for abortion. He also gained some notoriety for pitching a tent on Parliament Hill to protest a post office closing in his riding.David Roberts, \\"Reform's prospects brighten\\", Globe and Mail, 12 January 1993, A4.

It originates in the Chilean Altiplano of the Arica and Parinacota Region, crosses the Andes and empties into Coipasa Lake in Bolivia. The upper reach of the river lies within the boundaries of Lauca National Park in the Parinacota Province. Lauca River receives waters from a group of lakes known as Quta Qutani through the Desaguadero River. In this area there is a type of marsh known as Parinacota wetlands, in which converge several streams, being the more important the river just mentioned, which has a variable flow rate ranging from 100 to 560 l/s, and an average of 260 l/s. From its source in the Parinacota wetlands the river flows west. The spurs of the Cordillera Central (also known as Chapiquiña) form an obstacle impossible to pass through, forcing the river's course southward. In the vicinity of Wallatiri volcano, the Lauca turns again, now eastward crossing from Chile into Bolivia at the latitude of Macaya, at an elevation of 3,892 m asl and with a flow rate about 2,6 m³/s. In Chile the river drains an area of 2,350 km². Cuenca del río Lauca In the Bolivian Altiplano, the Lauca collects the waters of the rivers Sajama and Coipasa, raising its flow rate up to 8 m³/s before turning south to empty into Coipasa Lake, close to the salt flat of the same name. During the 1930s, the Chilean government begun to use the hydrical resources of Lauca river for irrigation in the Azapa Valley, generating a complaint from Bolivian government who argued that Chilean authorities were altering the course of an international river. Chile answered that the natural course of the river was not modified, but the works executed were related to the use of waters in the Parinacota wetlands, which not affect the total water flow of the Lauca in its course to Bolivia.

In 2010 there were government and corporate moves to expand Czech nuclear power generation capacity. Any expansion is likely to build on plans first developed in the 1980s. History Temelín NPP In 1956 a decision was made to build the first nuclear power station in Czechoslovakia, in Jaslovské Bohunice (western Slovakia). The KS 150 or A1 reactor (120 MWe) was selected because of its ability to use unenriched uranium mined in Czechoslovakia. The KS 150 was designed in the Soviet Union and built in Czechoslovakia. Construction was burdened by many problems and took an unexpectedly lengthy 16 years. In 1972 the plant was activated. In 1977 an accident stopped energy production and since 1979 the reactor has been partly dismantled, but not decommissioned. In 1970 an agreement with the Soviet Union was made to build two power stations of the VVER reactor design. One plant was built again in Jaslovské Bohunice, the other in Dukovany (southern Moravia), both equipped with four reactors VVER-440 v. 213 producing 440 MWe each. The first new reactor in Jaslovské Bohunice was activated in 1978, the remaining 7 during the 1980s. At the end of the 1970s a decision was made to build two more power stations: Temelín (southern Bohemia, 4 × VVER-1000, 1000 MWe) and Mochovce (southern Slovakia, 4 × VVER-440 v. 213, 440 MWe). In 1990, due to a decision by the government of Petr Pithart, the Temelín station was limited to two reactors. The construction of Temelín also experienced delays and went over budget. The fluoride volatility method of reprocessing used nuclear fuel was developed at the Řež nuclear research institute at Řež. AN EXPERIENCE ON DRY NUCLEAR FUEL REPROCESSING IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC R&D; OF PYROCHEMICAL PARTITIONING IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC DEVELOPMENT OF URANIUM OXIDE POWDER DOSING FOR FLUORIDE VOLATILITY SEPARATION PROCESS  Waste  The Czech Republic has no state policy on storage or reprocessing of nuclear waste, and the responsibility for this falls to the Czech Power Company (ČEZ). The ČEZ does not believe reprocessing is economical, and stores spent fuel until the Radioactive Waste Repository Authority (RAWRA) assumes responsibility for it. The RAWRA will select a permanent location for storage by 2015 and construction will begin on this site after 2050.  Czech—Austrian relations  The Czech Republic and Austria have had disagreements concerning the Temelín Nuclear Power Station only 50 km from the Czech–Austrian border. Austria had threatened the Czech Republic with difficulties in joining the EU if the plant was commissioned. Other opponents to this power plant claimed that it had the same design as the Chernobyl. In fact, Chernobyl had RBMKs, and Temelín would have VVERs. The Czech President at the time, Václav Havel, called the plant “megalomaniacal.” Proposed expansion The Czech Energy Policy of 2004 envisaged building two or more large reactors to replace Dukovany power plant after 2020. The plans announced in 2006 envisaged construction of one 1,500 MWe unit at Temelín after 2020, and a second to follow. *The simplest expansion of nuclear capacity would be completion of the two abandoned blocks at Temelín. In 2005 a recommendation by the Ministry of Industry suggested adding two 600 MWe reactors there before the year 2025. In August 2009, ČEZ launched a tendering process for two pressurized water reactors (PWRs) for units 3 and 4. *Several locations in the Czech lands were investigated and selected for new stations during the 1980s: the village of Blahutovice (northern Moravia, near Ostrava), the village of Tetov (eastern Bohemia, near Pardubice), the town of Mníšek pod Brdy (central Bohemia) and a nuclear heating plant in Prague-Radotín. In 2019 the Czech government gave preliminary approval for at least one new nuclear power unit at Dukovany Nuclear Power Station for about 2035 to replace four units expected to shut down between 2035 and 2037. The financial model proposed is a state guarantee so finance can be obtained at government interest rates, but no subsidy on operating costs or above market-price electricity rates. =Blahutovice= Blahutovice, a village located in an isolated, poor and thinly populated area, was selected in 1986 because of convenient geological conditions. A power station (JEBL) with two VVER-1000 reactors was proposed, together with a new dam in Hustopeče nad Bečvou. In 2000, the proposed start date for construction was not expected until 2015, if at all. =Tetov= Initially, Opatovice nad Labem (home of a large coal powered power plant) was selected, but its location between the cities of Hradec Králové and Pardubice was unfavorable and the more distant village of Tetov was chosen. One plan suggested building a nuclear heating plant in Opatovice nad Labem instead. The power station required an area of 150 hectares and was to have two or four VVER-1000 reactors, producing 1000 MWe each and also providing heating for the Hradec Králové-Pardubice agglomeration, and for Prague (using a 67 km long steam pipeline). Construction was to begin in 1996 and the reactors to be activated between 2004–2008. The cost was estimated to be 60 billion (109) Kčs. Nuclear waste storage Nuclear waste produced by the power stations and the other smaller reactors in the country is exported to Russia (or the Soviet Union before 1991), who supply the enriched uranium. A programme from 1980s recommended the building of an underground storage site to keep waste for reprocessing in the future. Geological exploration started during the second half of the 1990s. Eleven candidate locations have been selected but the process is not finished as of 2006. The possibility of storing waste on the Temelín station site is being considered. Public opinion Most Czechs support further expansion of nuclear power use, with support at 60% in 2007. Those living near nuclear waste storage facilities argue that proposals for expansion of nuclear power block development of such areas, discourage investment and make the areas unattractive for tourists. Several villages organized referendums against planned waste storage and regional governments have tried to put up legal and administrative obstacles to new stations. In 2008, a poll found that 64% of Czechs agree with the use of nuclear power, the highest level of support of the 27 EU countries surveyed, alongside Lithuania. Furthermore, the poll indicated that support was rising, from 52% in 2004 to 64% in 2008.http://www.cez.cz/cs/vyroba-elektriny/zvazovana-dostavba-elektrarny- temelin/postoj-ceske-verejnosti-k-jaderne-energetice.html See also * Energy in the Czech Republic ReferencesExternal links *Nuclear energy plans of Czechoslovakia (in Czech) *Website of the State Office for Nuclear Safety (en, cz) ","title":"Nuclear power in the Czech Republic"},{"id":"10383706","text":"William Baly William Baly by John Prescott Knight, 1863 William Baly (1814 – 28 January 1861) was an English physician.

She received awards and recognition, both nationally and internationally, for her work and contribution to the theater community. Biography Nina Vance, the only child of Calvin Perry and Minerva (DeWitt) Whittington, was born on October 22, 1914, in Yoakum, Texas. She was a direct descendant of Green DeWitt and Benjamin Beeson. She attended Texas Christian University, receiving her B.A. in 1935, and pursuing post-graduate studies at Columbia University, the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and postgraduate work in theater at the American Academy of Dramatic Art, Columbia University, and the University of Southern California before moving to Houston in 1939 to work as a high school teacher. She was married to Milton Vance, an attorney, but the childless marriage ended in divorce. Nina Vance died on February 18, 1980, in Houston at the age of 66. Early career Vance began her career by teaching drama and speech at Jefferson Davis High School and San Jacinto High School. She also taught private acting classes on the side and, by 1941, was acting herself with the Houston Little Theatre and the Houston Community Players, a group headed by Margo Jones. After Jones left Houston, Vance was asked to teach acting classes for the Jewish Community Center, but instead she offered her services as a director of plays. Although she was raised Presbyterian, she stipulated that the participants in her Players Guild could be of any religious denomination. Vance directed over a dozen productions for the Players Guild between 1945 and 1947, and following the innovative lead of Margo Jones, her troupe performed in the round in places like the Rice and Lamar hotels. When the Players Guild disbanded, she and her group of theater enthusiasts were without a home. The Alley Theatre The Alley Theatre building In the 1947, Vance and some friends decided to start a theatre group. She mailed out over 200 postcards inviting artists and potential sponsors to join a theatre company to be located off a Houston alleyway, and at the group's first meeting over 100 people interested in a new amateur theatre for Houston attended. The group voted on a name for the company, and the Alley Theatre was born. In 1968, the Alley Theatre moved to its present home, on the corner of Texas Avenue and Smith Street in downtown Houston. The Alley is now one of the nation's leading regional repertory theatres and one of the oldest resident theatres in the United States. Awards and honors In 1959, The Ford Foundation awarded Vance her first director's grant. The following year, President John F. Kennedy invited her to serve on his advisory committee to the National Cultural Center (now the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts), and Secretary of State Dean Rusk appointed her to the U.S. Commission on International Education and Cultural Affairs, the only woman to so serve. In addition, Vance was one of only seven American directors to attend contemporary Soviet theatre in Moscow, while touring the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet Ministry of Culture and the U.S. Department of State. She received numerous other awards, including the Matrix Award of Theta Phi, the Outstanding Alumni Award of Texas Southern University and the Houston Y.W.C.A. Woman of the Year Award.

Holley embarked upon his military career in the Occupation of the Araucanía in the Arauco War. At the start of the War of the Pacific, he was commissioned as second in command of the regiment Esmeralda when it was created after the division of the older Carampangue in May 1879. Serving in this position, Holley fought in the Battle of Tacna. He was promoted to commander of the regiment when its prior commander, Santiago Amengual, was named chief of the First Division in the Lima Campaign. Holley fought in the Battle of Chorrillos (Battle of San Juan) and the Battle of Miraflores, where his regiment suffered heavy losses. After the capture of Lima and the Chilean occupation of Lima, he remained in Peru with the Esmeralda regiment, taking part in the Breña Campaign (Campaign of the Sierra). On 27 May 1891, Holley was named Minister of War and Navy by the Revolutionary Junta loyal to Congress established in Iquique. He defended the post, defeating the presidential government's forces loyal to José Manuel Balmaceda. Meanwhile, Jorge Montt, a Congressional supporter, took over control of the Santiago Government Junta on September 20. Holley left the government upon Montt's assumption of the constitutional office of President and the start of the new government on 26 December 1891, ending the transitional wartime regime in which he had served. Holley served as the Senior General and Inspector General of the Army, the commander-in-chief, from 1894-1900. Adolfo Holley died in Tacna on 11 November 1914.
