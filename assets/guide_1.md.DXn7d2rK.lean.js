Plot Nick Jargin retired from auto racing undefeated. He is continually goaded by Mike Houston, a sportswriter, to come out of retirement and challenge the top racer of the day, Tony Botari, particularly after egotistically saying in an interview that Botari has no real competition now that he's out of the sport. Nick's girlfriend is Kelly James, a health club instructor. Kelly wants to be married and have sex, and when a reluctant Nick introduces her to his mother, Mrs. Jargin wants nothing to do with him, blaming Nick for a racing accident that seriously injured her other son, Johnny. Kelly is even urged by Nick's mother to leave him. She gives him an ultimatum, marry her or else. He declines, so she goes back to former boyfriend Danny Rhinegold, who now runs Botari's racing team. In the 100-lap race that takes them along rural roads, Nick takes the lead, with his brother Johnny's help on the crew. Botari is nearly in an accident in the dangerous \\"Devil's Hairpin\\" turn, so Nick slows down to help Botari steer clear of it. A self-sacrificing gesture is rare for him, so after the race, Kelly accepts when Nick finally proposes to her.

However, as with Phoebe Veitch in 1883, her sentence was commuted and she was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. Drowning (October 1872) While Carl and Caroline Whitting were born in Berlin, Prussia, there are no further details about the circumstances of her birth, emigration to New Zealand and marriage. On 25 October 1872, Mrs. Caroline Whitting (38) left her Southland farm with three of her children: Fred (an infant), John and Carl. Mrs Whitting then took her three sons to the Waikiwi river, where she drowned them and may have tried to drown herself, but was later found in adjacent bush. Another daughter escaped from her mother and told her older sister, who was sixteen, about what had happened, leading to a police search for the bodies of the children and investigation as to whether Mrs. Whitting herself was still alive. The bodies were located in the water and Mrs. Whitting was taken into police custody. A subsequent inquest turned up a judgement of 'wilful murder' on the same day. However, it seems to have been mitigated to life imprisonment Other than an acrimonious marital relationship and possible family violence between Carl and Caroline Whitting according to the testimony of their surviving children, few other records survive about the case, her conviction and her fate after her sentence to capital punishment was commuted to life imprisonment. Mrs Whitting was escorted into Dunedin Gaol on November 24, 1872 Comparing the case with those of Phoebe Veitch and Minnie Dean, Bronwyn Daley has suggested that the courts were willing to recognise that circumstances could lead to maternal 'madness' and may have prompted commuted sentences, while Dean's death sentence was related to an element of deliberation absent in the Veitch, Whitting and other cases of parental child murder See also *Infanticide in 19th-century New Zealand References Further reading *Bronwyn Daley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Gender and narratives of child murder in nineteenth century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Daley and Julie Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1999.

Earl has never gotten over losing her after introducing her to the man she left him for. Gwen's new husband Bryan Seward is a sharp attorney who works for the State Department. Using his skill and pull, he gets the custody hearing from the divorce re-opened, stating she signed the custody agreement under emotional duress. Meeting with them before the hearing, Earl intimates that he will do all he can to harm Seward's career if they try to get the child back. As Earl's personal and business lawyer Sam Dunstock prepares to handle the hearing, Earl seems unaware of the personal interest in him from Sam's new assistant, Nina Wylie. The boy tells Judge Rudolph in private that he prefers living with his dad and is suspicious of his mother's motives. Disturbed that he has not developed an appreciation for or ties with his mother, the judge awards Gwen full rather than partial custody. An alcoholic binge follows for Earl, who is shattered. Nina comes to inform him that business matters are suffering from his neglect. She takes care of Earl when he drunkenly passes out, after he claimed that he never loved Gwen and only married her so a son could take over his business someday. Ted comes over to Earl's to express his unhappiness with the situation. Earl, his business shut down, impulsively gives Sam power of attorney and decides to go to Europe \\"for some peace of mind.\\" Nina realizes that Earl is planning to take Ted with him, where they will be out of the reach of the court, and warns Sam to call Seward. Seward arrives in time to take the child off the plane, resulting in a fight between the men. Sam is disgusted with Earl's self- pitying and selfish behavior, and when Nina confesses to being in love with him, Earl cruelly says girls like her are \\"a dime a dozen\\". She hands him a dime. Gwen reveals to Nina that she wanted Ted back because she and Seward are unable to have a child of their own. Her guilt grows at discovering how unhappy she has made her son and tries to return him to Earl. Earl is forced to realize how much she loves Ted and convinces Ted that the change of custody is best for all of them. Earl starts anew with Nina, handing her back the dime.

It is that of a stubborn, self-pitying father who tries to monopolize his young son and prevent him from spending time with his mother, from whom the father is divorced...this is an honest, sensitive effort to show the grief that may come from a broken home and from the obstinacy of a divorced parent who doesn’t want to share the love of a severed child. It is a worthwhile and often sad exposure of what may happen to the emotions of parents and child when one parent acts immaturely. It hits a problem that can profitably be shown.\\" Variety commented: \\"Bing Crosby, who made an impact as the alcoholic actor in The Country Girl, again demonstrates his ability as a straight dramatic performer. As a doting father embroiled in a harsh custody battle with his ex- wife, he gives an appealing and sensitive performance. . . Since this type of fiction has a ready-made distaff audience, indications are that Man on Fire should be particularly appealing to women.\\" According to MGM records the film earned $1.1 million in the US and Canada and $315,000 elsewhere, resulting in a loss of $542,000.

Rennie played at Centre. Rugby union playing career =Amateur and provincial= Rennie played with Upper Hutt RFC in Wellington, New Zealand. He finished playing early at 27 due to a recurring shoulder injury. Rennie played with the Wellington Lions. He won the NPC title with the Lions in 1986. Later as head coach he guided the team to their next NPC title 14 years later in 2000. =International = Rennie's mother was from Rarotonga in the Cook Islands, and thus Rennie was eligible for the Cook Islands national rugby union team. He played for the Cook Islands national rugby union team for one game in 1990, but it was a non-capped match. Rugby union Coaching career =Early coaching career= After playing for the amateur side Rennie then coached Upper Hutt RFC. He became the assistant coach of the Wellington Lions in 1999 before becoming head coach in 2000. In his first year as the head coach, he led the Wellington Lions to their first NPC title since 1986. He stayed with the Lions until 2002. Rennie became first the U23 head coach and then the assistant coach of the Hurricanes. Rennie coached at the New Zealand international academy. Originally a short term contract, Rennie was the coach of the in the ITM Cup from 2005 to 2011. Under Rennie the Turbos were Championship Runner-up in the 2011 ITM Cup. =New Zealand U20= Rennie was coach of the New Zealand national under-20 rugby union team, under whom the team won three consecutive World titles from 2008 to 2010. =Chiefs= He joined the Chiefs for the 2012 season and led them to their first ever Super Rugby title. In doing so Rennie became the first first-year Super Rugby coach to win a Super Rugby title The day of the final itself proved highly eventful. As Rennie guided the Chiefs to a 37-6 win over the Sharks, his house was robbed and valuables were stolen. A similar opportunist theft had occurred to Chiefs player Sonny Bill Williams several weeks earlier. He coached the Chiefs to their second straight Super Rugby title in the 2013 season, beating the Brumbies by 27-22. Rennie's \\"rookie\\" streak was only superseded by Scott Robertson in 2019, who won three successive titles in his first three seasons as head coach of the Crusaders from 2017, winning in his rookie year, then again in 2018 & 2019\\\\. =Glasgow Warriors= On 19 August 2016 Glasgow Warriors announced that Rennie would replace Gregor Townsend as head coach for the 2017-18 season. Under Townsend, Warriors were a top Pro12 side; they reached the play-offs in every year of his charge - except his last; where he guided the Warriors to their first European Champions Cup Quarter-Final. Townsend won the Pro12 title with Glasgow Warriors in 2015. In Rennie's first season, Glasgow Warriors made the Pro14 semi-finals but the side was beaten at Scotstoun Stadium by the Scarlets. In the European Champions Cup they finished bottom of their pool. For the 2018-19 season, Glasgow Warriors reached the Pro14 final at Celtic Park in Glasgow. A large home-based Warriors support gave the Pro14 its biggest ever attendance for a final. Despite this Leinster capitalised on a Stuart Hogg error and ground out the match to win the title. In the European Champions Cup, Glasgow Warriors qualified out of the pool stages to meet Saracens in the Quarter final. Having run Saracens very close at home; and matched them until the final quarter of the away pool match - Scottish hopes were raised for the Quarter Final in London. However Saracens saved their best performance for that match and then went on to win the European title. After a coronavirus curtailed season in the 2019-20 season, Glasgow Warriors were in the 3rd place of their conference; which would have normally secured a place in the play-off finals to determine the Pro14 champion. Danny Wilson took over the Head Coach role on 1 June 2020. On leaving Rennie said: “It’s been good for me. I was keen to experience a different culture and a different type of footie. Rugby goes forever up here, the seasons roll into one, so you have to be very detailed around your planning. Around the international commitments you lose players for big chunks of time so you have to bring through young kids and manage a much bigger squad.\\" Of Glasgow Warriors and Scotland he concluded: \\"\\"But it's the people I'll miss. A lot of it comes back to laughter. The Scottish are funny people and I haven't laughed as much in any environment as much as I have in my time here. I've travelled all over Scotland and had a decent look at various things. My grandfather was born in Stranraer so we spent a bit of time down there. We went up to Skye and went to Oban and went to this seafood restaurant right on the water and it was as good as any seafood I've ever tasted. I've loved the food, I've loved the people and I've loved our time here. It's been special, we'll miss it.\\" =Wallabies= On 20 November 2019, Rugby Australia announced that Rennie would replace Michael Cheika as Head Coach of the Wallabies. =Coaching approach= Rennie has been described as \\"hard-nosed, doesn't tolerate fools, is astute and has a deep rugby intelligence.\\" Outside rugby Rennie was a school teacher in Upper Hutt. He taught to 12 and 13 year olds: 'intermediate', between primary and secondary education. In comparing his former job of teaching with coaching rugby union, Rennie said: \\"Teaching, coaching, it's the same thing. The kids are just a bit bigger.\\" While coaching Upper Hutt RFC at amateur level, Rennie owned and ran a pub called the Lonely Goat Herd in Upper Hutt, Wellington. Rennie plays guitar and also enjoys landscape gardening.

An original character from Milestone Comics, he first appeared in Hardware #11 (January 1993), and was created by Dwayne McDuffie, Robert L. Washington III, and Denys Cowan. Fictional character biography =Milestone Universe= Dharma, otherwise known as Harry Chawney, has the power to perceive the past and future of any object he touches. He has perceived countless apocalypses, and is ruthless in acting to prevent them, whatever the cost. In theory, he knows the ultimate consequences of whatever action he sends his operatives to perform; however, the impossibility of considering every factor has led to his fear that he may be causing the very disasters he is trying to prevent - in the words of one agent: \\"What about the man who died? His future could have been important too. Did you check?\\", to which he was forced to respond: \\"I can't think about that right now\\".^ Shadow Cabinet #11 (April 1995) The Cabinet makes an appearance in Blood Syndicate #20 when Dharma fires Oro, who has been a Syndicate associate, police officer, and a Shadow Cabinet operative. He is allowed to keep his costume and receives one month severance pay deposited directly into his bank account. Dharma even gives Oro advice to \\"take the left\\" as Oro teleports out.^ Blood Syndicate #20, (Nov 94) The teleportation technology is maintained by powerful telekinetic and engineer Thomas Hague, better known as \\"Mechanic\\". Another notable employee is Payback, a spy for the independent superhero Icon. Icon also has evidence that Dharma had been involved in the 'Big Bang', a riot which, due to altered tear gas, ended with dozens of fatalities and superpowers granted to the survivors. He would not treat further departures from the Cabinet as gracefully as Oro's. When Cabinet operatives Iota, Donner, and Blitzen leave to form the unofficial team Heroes, Dharma sends a Cabinet attack squad. This group is led by Iron Butterfly.^ \\"Heroes\\" #2-3 =Milestone Forever= The truth of Dharma's action are shown. It is revealed that he was responsible for the Big Bang, hoping to create powerful beings capable of preventing a fast approaching apocalypse whose cause he could not determine. When his last two prospects (Hardware and Static), fail to meet his expectations, he turns to the only course he believes is left open to him....awakening and harnessing the powers of the god-like being called Rift. However, the very act of absorbing the being's powers causes widespread destruction to the universe, destroying the Dakotaverse. Thus the cause of the apocalypse he foresaw was his own attempts to stop it, although not all is lost, as his new powers will allow him the opportunity to bring about his universe's rebirth. The effects of Darkseid's death during Final Crisis of a neighboring universe gives the chance to merge the remnants of the Dakotaverse into the DC Universe, retroactively combining their histories, and giving the Milestone characters the chance to live anew. Officially only Icon, Superman, and Dharma himself even recall Rift and know the truth of Milestone's existence. Dharma is currently concentrating on keeping the worlds merged. This, according to Dharma, could take months or even years before it is permanent. Powers and abilities Dharma possesses incredibly powerful precognitive abilities When he touches a personal object, Dharma can see all events that occur in its past and future. This ability extends as far as the entire Earth itself or something as small as a bead. Not only can he see an object's future, he can see his own and his universe's future. This power extends to the object's past as well. Hence, any place it has been or anything that has been done to it is clear to Dharma. When he focuses his psychometric on a certain person he can not only see their future and past but also understand and therefore manipulate their abilities. Dharma is completely blind, but compensates by using his powers to guide him.Shadow Cabinet #10 Dharma has been able to see the beginning of the universe and all that goes on in the present. However, at a certain point in the future (its \\"end\\"), he sees only destruction of his universe. This blind spot prevents Dharma from seeing what role he will play or what outcome happens after the destruction.Milestone Forever #1 After absorbing Rift's powers Dharma gained the ability to alter reality and bend dimensions.

The Ube3a locus is imprinted and in the central nervous system expressed only from the maternal allele. Silencing of Ube3a on the paternal allele is thought to occur through the Ube3a-ATS part of LNCAT, since non-coding antisense transcripts are often found at imprinted loci. The deletion and/or mutation of Ube3a on the maternal chromosome causes Angelman Syndrome (AS) and Ube3a-ATS may prove to be an important aspect in finding a therapy for this disease. While in patients with AS the maternal Ube3a allele is inactive, the paternal allele is intact but epigenetically silenced. If unsilenced, the paternal allele could be a source of active Ube3a protein in AS patients. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of how Ube3a-ATS might be involved in silencing the paternal Ube3a may lead to new therapies for AS. This possibility has been demonstrated by a recent study where the drug topotecan, administered to mice suffering from AS, activated expression of the paternal Ube3a gene by lowering the transcription of Ube3a-ATS. LNCAT organization LNCAT/UBE3A-ATS organization. UBE3A is fully transcribed from the maternal allele, but suppressed on the paternal allele. LNCAT and UBE3A-ATS on the other hand are fully transcribed on the paternal allele, but suppressed on the maternal allele. This differential expression is thought to be due to methylation of the PWS-IC on the maternal allele (black filled-in circle) and lack of methylation on the paternal allele (unfilled circle). The AS-IC is thought to control methylation of the PWS-IC. The red boxes represent maternally transcribed genes, while the blue represents paternally transcribed genes. The direction of transcription is indicated by the arrows. Adapted from Trends in Neurosci. The human UBE3A-ATS is expressed as a part of LNCAT mainly from the paternal allele in the central nervous system (CNS). The transcript is about 450 kbs long, starts at the U-exons and extends as far as UBE3A on the opposite strand, possibly beyond. The promoter for Snurf/Snrpn and the imprinting center are found in the U-exon region. The promoter region is imperative, as deletion of this area abolishes Ube3a-ATS transcription. Near the promoter is the PWS-IC and about 35 kbs upstream of the PWS-IC is the AS- IC. These two regions are thought to control the expression of the entire LNCAT strand. Starting at the promoter, the entire transcript can be transcribed and after transcription is further processed and spliced. Reviewed in Trends in Neurosci. Located next to the U-exon promoter region is Snrpn/Snurf which can be alternatively spliced into either Snrpn or Snurf in humans (in mice this remains as one bicistronic transcript). Snrpn codes for a protein of unknown function which localizes to the cell nucleus. Snurf codes for a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. While most of these proteins are involved in splicing, the role of this particular protein is not yet known. Downstream from Snrpn/Snurf and within its introns are sequences for several C/D box snoRNAs. Most C/D box snoRNAs function in non-mRNA methylation. However, recently, one snoRNA on Ube3a-ATS, SNORD 115, has been found to change the alternative splicing of the serotonin receptor 2C pre-mRNA. In addition, this snoRNA has the ability to change the splicing of five different mRNAs. Among the sequences for the snoRNAs is nested IPW (imprinted Prader- Willi), a non-coding region whose deletion is thought to cause Prader-Willi syndrome. Model systems The mouse and human Ube3a-ATS/Ube3a are orthologous and the general organizations of the regions are similar. For example, the mouse locus also contains Snurf/Snrpn, snoRNAs and IPW. The main differences are the locations and the lengths of the Ube3a-ATS transcripts. The human Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS is located on chromosome 15, while the mouse Ube3a is located on chromosome 7. The mouse LNCAT, including Ube3a-ATS, is about 1000 kb long, much longer than the human 450 kb LNCAT. Due to the similar organization of the mouse and human LNCAT/Ube3a-ATS and the fact that the mouse Ube3a locus is also imprinted, the mouse is an excellent model system to study imprinting and the interactions between Ube3a/Ube3a-ATs. In addition, mouse neurons continue to retain their imprinting pattern in culture. Splice variants and locations While the entire LNCAT transcript, including the Ube3a-ATS transcript may be transcribed, it is often spliced to include and exclude a variety of exons. Different splice variants are expressed in different tissue types and situations. For the most part, it is thought that at least some type of Ube3a-ATS is expressed in CNS cells that are imprinted, such as Purkinje cells and hippocampal neurons. However, there is spatiotemporal regulation of both the downstream and the upstream part of this transcript.Reviewed in Dev Bio and Journal of Neuroscience. In mouse embryos, Snurf/Snrpn exons were detected in blastocysts about 7 days post coitem and continued to be expressed throughout development. The Snurf/Snrpn exons are restricted to CNS tissue during development, and only later during adulthood are expressed in other tissue. Ube3a-ATS exons were not detected until 10 days post coitem and their expression was also limited to the CNS during development. In general, Ube3a-ATS is detected during the initial stages of neurogenesis while Snurf/Snrpn is expressed in undifferentiated precursor cells and throughout the course of differentiation. There are at least 10 different splice isoforms according to the UCSC genome browser. According to one study, the splice variant that directly overlaps the Ube3a is found in the cytoplasm. Preventing expression on both alleles A specific imprinting center cluster was thought to control the differential expression of Ube3a-ATS on the maternal and paternal alleles. There are two regions in the imprinting centers (ICs) that exist associated with AS and PWS- the AS-IC and the PWS-IC. These imprinting centers are control regions that dictate whether surrounding genes and regions can be expressed and are found on both the maternal and paternal alleles. While differential methylation patterns on the maternal and paternal genes are often associated with imprinting, the AS-IC remains unmethylated at both alleles. However, the neighboring PWS-IC is methylated on the maternal allele, but remains unmethylated on the paternal allele. The PWS- IC is suspected of controlling the expression of LNCAT and Ube3a-ATS. In mice where the PWS-IC has been deleted, expression of the Ube3a-ATS is decreased. In the central neural system, Ube3a-ATS is preferentially expressed from the paternal allele where the PWS-IC is not methylated. On the other hand, on the maternal allele, where the PWS-IC is methylated, Ube3a-ATS is not expressed, suggesting that the methylation of the PWS-IC somehow prevents Ube3a-ATS expression. This is supported by several studies where preventing methylation of the PWS-IC by knocking out methyl transferases in embryonic stem cells results in bialellic expression of Ube3a-ATS and silencing of Ube3a on the maternal allele. However, methylation is not the only process involved in preventing the expression of the maternal Ube3a-ATS. It is expected that the imprinting domains interact with other proteins, which contribute to the silencing of LNCAT and Ube3a-ATS on the maternal allele. For example, when MECP2 is knocked out, such as in Rett Syndrome patients, Ube3a-ATS is biallelically expressed, decreasing expression of Ube3a from the maternal allele. Collision model thumbThe collision model for paternal UBE3A silencing via the UBE3A-ATS. Only one RNA Polymerase (RNAP) can transcribe along a part of the template at a time. When two RNAPs are transcribing in head on directions, a collision can occur. This can result in stalling of both of the RNAPs, backtracking of one RNAP, or falling off of the template. In this case, the RNAP transcribing the paternal UBE3A-ATS competes with the RNAP transcribing UBE3A and pushes it off of the template, preventing UBE3A transcription and allowing UBE3A-ATS transcription. Arrows show the direction of transcription. Reviewed in Trends in Neurosci. There are currently three models that explain how the Ube3a-ATS of LNCAT silences the paternal Ube3a- the collision model, the RNA-DNA interaction model, and the double stranded RNA interference model. While these models have not been demonstrated directly for Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS, they are considered plausible based on evidence for the silencing of other natural antisense transcripts by these methods. However, the collision model, due to most recent supporting studies, appears most likely. The collision model can be thought of as a road wide enough for only one car. A smart car is traveling from one direction, and a plough from the other direction, eventually colliding. After the collision, the plough pushes the smart car backwards, as it continues to travel forward. In the collision model for Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS, RNA polymerases (RNAPs) travel towards each other along the sense and antisense templates during transcription. The sense and antisense templates overlap for Ube3a and Ube3a-ATS. The two transcription bubbles will collide head-on, and the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a-ATS, being the plough, will push the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a (smart car), backwards and eventually off of the template. This prevents complete transcription of Ube3a. The support for this model comes from two recent studies. The first study looked at transcription of genes on sense strands that were overlapped by genes being expressed on the antisense strand. The longer the region of overlap, the less efficient the transcription of the sense strand was, indicating that transcription on one strand interferes with the transcription on the other strand. Another study directly monitored collisions between RNAPs transcribing a template using atomic force microscopy. RNAPs were stalled on DNA fragments and collided with other elongating RNAPs. The images showed stalling of the two RNAPs immediately after the collision, in addition to backtracking of one of the RNAPs. While these studies have not been performed for Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS, the use of atomic force microscopy to monitor transcription at this locus might provide insight as to how Ube3a is actually silenced via Ube3a-ATS. Further studies are still very much necessary to confirm these models for Ube3a. Contradictory studies While several studies support the idea that Ube3a-ATS might be involved in paternal Ube3a silencing, other studies contradict this. One study in particular argues against the in cis silencing of Ube3a by Ube3a-ATS. In this study, when the maternal Ube3a allele was deleted, an increase in paternal Ube3a-ATS expression was seen. This suggests that rather than the paternal Ube3a-ATS controlling paternal Ube3a, the maternal Ube3a somehow suppresses expression of the paternal Ube3a-ATs, possibly in trans rather than in cis. An interaction between the maternal and paternal homolgous regions of these genes was in fact observed in human and mouse cells during interphase. One mechanism to explain in trans silencing includes an interaction between the paternal Ube3a-ATS RNA and the maternal Ube3a mRNA. It is possible that the maternal Ube3a mRNA interacts with the paternal Ube3a-ATS RNA and decreases the stability of both of these transcripts. When only Ube3a-ATS is made without Ube3a, the Ube3a-ATS becomes more stable. Another study has suggested that Ube3a-ATS expression does not occur in imprinted regions. In situ hybridizations did not reveal Ube3a-ATS in Purkinje cells or hippocampal neurons. However, other upstream exons that correspond to Snurf/Snrpn were expressed, indicating that the collision model could still be occurring. Thus further research is still required. The future Several studies have attempted to utilize the possibility of controlling Ube3a expression through Ube3a-ATS. In AS, the paternal PWS-IC is not methylated, supposedly allowing Ube3a-ATS expression. Therefore, if methylation of the PWS-IC were possible, Ube3a-ATS transcription could be prohibited, allowing Ube3a expression from the paternal allele to make up for the lack of expression from the maternal allele. A one year study was performed with several AS patients. These patients were put on methylation promoting diets that consisted of betaine, metafolin, creatine, and vitamin B12 supplements. However, after one year, methylation patterns in these patients did not change. Another study tested a large library of different drugs, and identified several topoisomerase I and II inhibitors which increased expression of paternal Ube3a in mouse neurons and mice. Topoisomerase inhibitors are widely used as chemotherapeutics and cause replicating cells to undergo apoptosis by inducing double strand breaks that stall the replication fork. However, their mechanism of action in activating the paternal Ube3a is not yet known, but may involve transcriptional interference with Ube3a-ATS, as Ube3a-ATS transcripts decreased after drug treatment. The group specifically chose to study topotecan, which was the most effective at a low nanomolar range and is already Food and Drug Administration approved for treating several types of cancers.

The station is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 4 station. It is served by local and S-Bahn trains. History The station was opened on the 15 April 1869 under the name Goddelau-Erfelden. Then as now, it served two districts of Riedstadt, Goddelau and Erfelden. On 29 May 1869, the prime minister of the Grand Duchy of Hesse, Carl Friedrich Freiherr von Dalwigk, opened the first section of the Hessian Ludwig Railway’s Darmstadt–Worms railway, from Darmstadt Ludwig station via Goddelau and Biblis to Rosengarten station, on the opposite side of the Rhine to Worms. From there, the Worms-Rosengarten train ferry operated over the Rhine from 1870 to 1900, when it was replaced by a bridge across the Rhine. This was the first section of the Riedbahn (Ried Railway), which runs through an area called the Hessische Ried, hence the name. The line from Biblis to the Mannheim suburb of Waldhof was opened in October 1879, so that the route to Mannheim ended not at Mannheim Central Station, but at the Riedbahnhof, north of today's Kurpfalz Bridge. In November 1879, the (then) branch line from Goddelau to Frankfurt was opened. In 1975, the railway between Darmstadt and Goddelau was closed due to lack of traffic and partly dismantled. All that remains of the line is a siding from Darmstadt to Weiterstadt-Riedbahn, where the line ends. As a result of the incorporation of the former twin town of Goddelau-Wolfskehlen in the newly founded city of Riedstadt, Goddelau-Erfelden station was renamed as Riedstadt-Godddelau on 1 January 1977. Operations Riedstadt lies on the network organised by the Rhein-Main-Verkehrsverbund (Rhine-Main Transport Association, RMV). =Rail= Goddelau-Riedstadt station is served hourly by Regional-Express line RE 70 en route from Mannheim via Biblis and Gernsheim to Frankfurt Central Station. Since 2002, the station has also been served every 30 minutes on weekdays by Rhine-Main S-Bahn line S 7, which terminates in Riedstadt-Goddelau. =Bus= Bus routes 41, 45 and K62 stop at the Goddelauer Bahnhof bus stop.

Its kitchen and lounge area are housed within a historic preserved railway carriage, and it has an alfresco deck alongside. A project of BHP Billiton Iron Ore, with support from Town of Port Hedland, Boom Logistics and Laing O'Rourke, the cafe was officially opened by the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, on 26 October 2010. History =Midwest= The railway carriage that is now the nucleus of the Silver Star Cafe was built by the Budd Company in 1939, for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, commonly known as the Burlington. A \\"diner-parlour and observation car\\", it was assigned the fleet number 301, and was named the Silver Star. Together with two passenger cars, the Silver Leaf and the Silver Eagle, and a power car, the Silver Charger, the Silver Star made up the General Pershing Zephyr, a streamliner train named after General John 'Black Jack' Pershing. On 30 April 1939, the train made its inaugural passenger trip between St Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, in the midwest of the USA. Pershing was a World War I veteran, who became the chief of staff of the United States Army. He was born and raised in a town not far from the train's route. The names Silver Leaf, Silver Eagle and Silver Star all corresponded to US Army badges of rank, while the Silver Charger was named after one of the General's horses. The Silver Charger, 2008. The General Pershing Zephyr was the ninth and last in a series of \\"shovelnose\\" Zephyr streamliners operated by the Burlington, and the only one made up of non-articulated cars. The \\"shovelnose\\" Zephyrs were lighter and faster than their contemporaries, because they were made of lightweight stainless steel, to a unique \\"streamlined\\" design. Although the earlier, articulated, versions of these trains had the further advantage of a reduced number of trucks (bogies), and no couplers, the General Pershing Zephyr's non-articulated configuration provided maximum flexibility and ease of maintenance. The Silver Star was the tail-end car in the General Pershing Zephyr. It had a rounded observation end, and was considered to be the train's \\"most distinguished car.\\" Inside, it was fitted with a dining room in length seating 24 passengers at six tables. At the rounded end was an observation parlour with 22 movable seats, and a kitchen and pantry were at the other end. The General Pershing Zephyr ran on its assigned route until the United States entered World War II, and then its individual cars continued in use on other trains. As late as 1967, Silver Star was still in the consist of the combined Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr and American Royal Zephyr. =Pilbara= Observation end, Silver Star Cafe, 2012. By 1974, the first 100 million tonnes of iron ore had been carried between Newman and Port Hedland on the Mount Newman railway in the Pilbara, Australia. To celebrate this achievement, the US based mining company AMAX, which was then a partner in Mount Newman Mining, presented the Silver Star to the latter company at an official ceremony. The carriage was renamed the Sundowner and put into service along the otherwise freight-only Mount Newman railway. For nearly 20 years, it made a weekly round trip from Newman to Port Hedland and back, carrying families and sporting teams on a Friday for shopping and sports fixtures, and returning them to Newman the following Sunday evening. The Sundowner was also used for special trips, including day excursions, VIP functions and \\"Santa Specials\\". On all of these trips, it offered views of the Pilbara landscape not otherwise visible to its appreciative occupants. During its service on the Mount Newman railway, the carriage was refurbished and modified inside and out on several occasions. The original kitchen was removed, the galley relocated, and the elegant original interior panelling replaced with Western Australian jarrah timber. The carriage was always maintained in working order, but by the early 21st century had fallen largely into disuse. In 2009, BHP Billiton Iron Ore, by then the sole owner of the railway, decided to give the carriage to the Port Hedland community as a visitor attraction and cafe. In co-operation with FORM, and with support from Town of Port Hedland, Boom Logistics and Laing O'Rourke, the carriage was relocated from the railway's Nelson Point yard to the west end of Port Hedland. In its new incarnation as a cafe, it was officially opened by the Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, on 26 October 2010. Menu The air conditioned lounge. Although the kitchen is small, the whole menu is cooked fresh on the premises. Reviews According to the Australasian Mining Review, the Silver Star Cafe is \\"arguably the best breakfast spot in Hedland\\". The Cafe has also been favourably reviewed by Lonely Planet, which praised it as \\"possibly the coolest cafe in the Pilbara\\".

He is notable for his role in the methamphetamines trade, as well as his relations with several notable members of the city's underworld. He was also a valuable asset to the Scarfo crime family, due to his connections with the K&A; Gang (through John Berkery), Chelsais Bouras, the Pagans MC, and the Junior Black Mafia. Early criminal career In his early 20s Martorano had relocated from his native Sicily to Philadelphia. Between 1950 and 1955 he was convicted five times for illegal narcotics or liquor dealing. His sentences began as probation and grew to five years in prison. In the 1960s and 1970s Martorano became associated with Angelo Bruno the boss of the Philadelphia crime family. In the late 1970s Martorano became one of the most successful methamphetamine dealers in the city. The dealing of drugs was supposed to be taboo in the organization, but it was obvious the \\"Docile Don\\" had turned a blind eye on the Martorano operation. While Bruno was receiving a cut of the drug profits he was also an employee of the Martorano brothers’ – Raymond and John – vending machine business. This was the mob boss’s legitimate job – a commissioned salesman for the company – for which he earned $50,000 a year. Angelo Bruno’s reign marked a period of underworld calm in Philadelphia. His murder in March 1980 allowed the gloves to come off and inaugurated a period of gangland bloodshed that lasted more than two decades, mostly during the reign of Nicodemo \\"Little Nicky\\" Scarfo. Involvement in Mafia hits In the wake of Angelo Bruno's death, and Nicky Scarfo ascension to boss of the Philadelphia crime family Martorano, who was not a made member under Bruno, earned his button in the Scarfo Family by planning the December 16, 1980 murder of union leader John McCullough. Martorano and his brother-in- law Albert Daidone, a union organizer, hired Willard Moran, described as a low-level South Jersey racketeer, to murder McCullough. In May 1981, at the Meletis Greek restaurant in South Philadelphia, Bouras was gunned down alongside his girlfriend Janette Curro, Ray Martorano, and Philadelphia radio personality Jerry Blavat. By April 27, 1981 Martorano was on hand for the killing of Chelsais \\"Stevie\\" Bouras. The leader of a Greek-American gang, Bouras was dining with friends, including Martorano. Suddenly a gunman appeared at the table, motioned Martorano and others to move aside then began blasting. Tragically the shooting took the life of Bouras’s young girlfriend. Janette Curro. By the following April Philip Testa was dead and Scarfo was the recognized leader of the family – recognized by everyone except former Bruno loyalist Harry \\"the Hunchback\\" Riccobene. After several failed attempts at bringing Harry under control by killing him, Scarfo sent Martorano and Frank Monte, the family consigliere, to speak to Mario \\"Sonny\\" Riccobene, the hunchback’s half-brother. Martorano and Monte asked Riccobene to set up Harry for a kill. Sonny promised to get back to them. The failed attempt to get Sonny Riccobene to \\"serve up Harry\\" marked the beginning of the Riccobene/Scarfo War. Arrest and imprisonment In 1982 Martorano was indicted for his drug operation. He was convicted and sentenced to ten years. While in prison he had other problems. In 1983 the authorities arrested Willard Moran and charged him with the McCullough murder. Anastasia wrote, \\"Poor planning and idle chatter\\" led to his capture. Moran would be the first in a \\"long line\\" of Scarfo Family members and associates to become government witnesses. Sentenced to die in the Pennsylvania electric chair, Moran flipped and ratted out Martorano and Daidone to save himself. In 1984 Moran was the key witness for the prosecution against the two men. Martorano and Daidone were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. In October 1986 Nick Caramandi was arrested by the FBI on extortion charges. He was placed in the Philadelphia Detention Center, which housed Martorano and his son, George \\"Cowboy\\" Martorano. The younger Martorano had built a drug empire believed to be worth $75 million before he was convicted in 1984. Under what was called \\"the Federal drug king pin statute\\" he was sentenced to life in prison. Caramandi, feeling like he was about to be hung out to dry by Scarfo, went and talked to \\"Long John\\" about his situation. A few days later Martorano got back to Caramandi and they talked in the prison yard. In Blood and Honor Caramandi recalls: Release from prison and death On November 12, 1999 Raymond \\"Long John\\" Martorano was released from prison after spending more than 17 years behind bars. Once he was released from prison, he began planning ways to take over lucrative gambling operations. Unfortunately for Martorano, these operations were controlled by Joseph \\"Uncle Joe\\" Ligambi. Ligambi, the acting boss of the Philadelphia crime family, had a solid support network in his soldiers. On January 17, 2002, while driving his Lincoln Town Car along the 700 block of Spruce Street in the Washington Square West section of Philadelphia, Martorano was shot and critically wounded by an unknown gunman or gunmen. He succumbed to his injuries on February 5, 2002.

He was the first Professor of Political Economy at Trinity College, Dublin. Life He was son of Mountifort Longfield, vicar of Desert Serges (Desert Magee), County Cork, and his wife Grace, daughter of William Lysaght of Fort William and Mount North, Co. Cork. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, graduated as moderator and gold medallist in science in 1823, became a fellow in 1825, and proceeded to the degrees of M.A. in 1829 and LL.D. in 1831. In 1828 Longfield was called to the Irish bar, but did not practise. When the professorship of political economy in Trinity College was founded in 1832, he was appointed the first professor; and in 1834 he resigned his fellowship and became regius professor of feudal and English law there, a post he held for the rest of his life, from 1871 having as deputy N. Ritchie, Q.C. Longfield was reputed as a real property lawyer. In 1842 he became a Queen's Counsel, and in 1859 a bencher of the King's Inns. On the passing of the Incumbered Estates Act in 1849 he was appointed one of the three commissioners for it, holding office until the landed estates court was constituted in 1858. He became a judge of the court, and continued to sit until 1867. A liberal in politics, Longfield helped draft the Irish measures of the first and second Gladstone administrations. In 1867 he was sworn a member of the Irish Privy Council. He was appointed a commissioner of Irish national education in 1853, and on several occasions was an assessor to the general synod of the Church of Ireland; with Joseph Galbraith he was one of the architects of the church's finances. Longfield was an active member of the Social Science Congress and the Dublin Statistical Society. He died at 47 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, on 21 November 1884. Economist His most important work in economics was \\"Lectures on Political Economy\\", which was published in 1834. He argued against the labor theory of value and developed a marginal revenue productivity theory of labour and capital. It was unusual for its time and was only rediscovered after 1900; some of his ideas on capital and interest foreshadowed the work of the Austrian School.'The Penguin Dictionary of Economics' Graham Bannock, RE Baxter and Evan Davis, 1992 His main approaches revolved around the labor theory of value, an analysis of capital and distribution theory (based on a concept of marginal productivity). He applies insofar as the representative of the marginal utility theory avant la lettre.

Many Kurds worked with other opponents of the Ottoman regime within the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). A growth in ethnic consciousness at the start of the 20th century was spearheaded by the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan. Some Kurdish nationalist groups agitated for secession, others for autonomy. During the First World War, while some Kurdish nationalists were working with the British and Russian enemy powers, Kurdish tribal forces were fighting alongside Ottoman troops on the Russian front. Deaths and displacements occurred on a large scale among Kurdish civilians due to wartime conditions and deliberate ethnic cleansing policies. There was a brief opportunity for Kurdish nationalism after World War I with the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Western powers (particularly the United Kingdom) promised the Kurds they would act as guarantors for Kurdish freedom, a promise they subsequently broke. Some of the autonomist Kurdish groups received British support leading up to the Treaty of Sèvres (1920), which prepared for local autonomy for the Kurdish regions and envisaged later independence. Opposition from Kemal Atatürk, leader of the new nation-state of Turkey, and changes in British policy, prevented such a result. Following the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the Kurdish territory was partitioned between Turkey, the French mandate of Syria, the British mandate of Iraq, and Persia. Prior to 1914 The nationalist movement among the Kurds first emerged in the late 19th century with an uprising led by a Kurdish landowner and head of the powerful Şemdinan family, Sheik Ubeydullah. In 1880, Ubeydullah demanded political autonomy or outright independence for Kurds and the recognition of a Kurdistan state separate from both the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Persia.Özoğlu, Hakan. Kurdish Notables and the Ottoman State: Evolving Identities, Competing Loyalties, and Shifting Boundaries. Feb 2004. . p. 75. The uprising was suppressed by the Ottomans. The first Kurds to challenge the authority of the Ottoman Empire did so primarily as Ottoman subjects, rather than Kurds. They worked with other Turks and Ottoman subjects who were in opposition to the policies of Sultan Abdul Hamid and in 1889 formed the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). Abdul Hamid responded with a policy of repression, but also of integration, co-opting prominent Kurdish opponents into the Ottoman power structure with prestigious positions in his government. This strategy appears successful given the loyalty displayed by the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments during World War I. In the first decade of the 20th century, Kurdish nationalism was still an ambiguous, controversial, or unfamiliar concept for many Kurds. Educated Kurds, primarily from Istanbul, sought a political solution largely within the confines of the Ottoman Empire and one that did not rest solely on an ethnic basis. That kind of identity was related with a more tribal consciousness; one that lacked sophistication for many. Others had much to lose if the status quo was altered. For many, this stemmed from a religious concern, where the Sultan had long brought Muslims under a secure Caliphate. Others, particularly tribal chieftains, had economic concerns. Still other Kurds, especially those outside of Anatolia, lacked understanding of nationalism or were simply unaware and unaffected. In the short time of its existence, the Kurd Society for Cooperation and Progress (Kürt Terraki ve Teavun Cemiyeti) was a leading force in supporting the Kurdish nation. It was founded in the aftermath of the Young Turk Revolution in 1908 by several members of the Kurdish political elite. Some of the co-founders were founders Sheikh Abdulkadir, (a son of Sheikh Ubeydullah); Emin Ali Bedir Khan of the Bedir Khan family and the former ottoman official Muhammad Şerif Pasha. With the establishment of.a school it has also supported the education of the Kurdish population in Istanbul, which at the time amounted to around 30'000. The institution was attended by Said Nursi, who in the future was to become the leader of the Nurculuk. The society also continued to distribute the newspaper Kurdistan, which was led my members of the Bedir Khan family. In 1909, the Society was prohibited by the Government, who didn't see a benefit in the organization of Kurdish people. An organization known as the Society for the Elevation of Kurdistan (Kürdistan Teali Cemiyeti) was central to the forging of a distinct Kurdish identity. It took advantage of the period of political liberalization during the Second Constitutional Era (1908–1920) of Turkey to transform a renewed interest in Kurdish culture and language into a political nationalist movement based on ethnicity. The emphasis on the Kurdish people as a distinct ethnic group was encouraged around the start of the 20th century by Russian anthropologists who suggested that the Kurds were a European race (compared to the Asiatic Turks), based on physical characteristics and their language which is part of the Indo-European language group. Based more on this ethno-nationalistic standpoint, two prominent Kurdish families, the Badr Khans and the Sayyids, renewed opposition to the empire. These two houses founded the first two strains of Kurdish nationalism. The Badr Khans were secessionists while the Sayyids of Nihiri were autonomists. Operating within the autonomist framework, Shaykh Abd al Qadir in 1910 appealed to the Committee on Union and Progress (which, after the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, now held the power of the government after deposing Sultan Abd al Hamid) for an autonomous Kurdish state in the east. That same year, Said Nursi traveled through the Diyarbakir region and urged Kurds to unite and forget their differences, while still carefully claiming loyalty to the CUP. Other Kurdish Shaykhs in the region began leaning towards regional autonomy. During this time, the Badr Khans had been in contact with discontented Shaykhs and chieftains in the far east of Anatolia ranging to the Iranian border, more in the framework of secession, however. Shayk Abd al Razzaq Badr Khan eventually formed an alliance with Shaykh Taha and Shaykh Abd al Salam Barzani, another powerful family in Kurdistan. Because of this possible Kurdish threat as well as the alliance's dealings with Russia, Ottoman troops moved against this alliance in 1914. Two brief and minor rebellions, the rebellions of Barzan and Bitlis, were quickly suppressed. The problem for these early Kurdish rebels was one of coordination. The British vice-consul in Bitlis reported that \\"Could the Kurds combine against the government even in one province, the Turkish troops in their eastern part of Asia Minor would find it difficult to crush the revolt.\\" (p. 101) The First World War Kurdish Cavalry in the passes of the Caucasus mountains (The New York Times, January 24, 1915). The outbreak of World War I was a powerful check to growing Kurdish nationalism. However, some Kurds continued to work behind the scenes for an independent Kurdistan. These represent some of the first attempts by Kurds to work with foreign powers against Turks for their autonomy. In 1914, General Muhammad Sharif Pasha offered his services to the British in Mesopotamia. Elsewhere, members of the Badr Khan family held close relations with Russian officials and discussed their intentions to form an independent Kurdistan. Meanwhile, the conflict between Kurds and Armenians in the east raged. Kurds were threatened with punishment by Ottoman authorities if they did not obey orders to evict or kill the Armenians. In rare instances, Kurds spared their Christian victims and protected them because they were neighbors with whom they had held cordial relations. It is difficult to accept that the struggle was a purely ethnic one. The Armenians, it was reasoned, presented a real threat for many Kurds, especially the farther one went east. Armenians, after all, had relationships with the hostile European powers and Russia. According to David McDowall, \\"most Kurds involved in the massacres probably felt it was a question of 'them or us'\\". (p. 105) Kurds contributed significantly to the Ottoman Empire's war effort. Tribal forces served against the Russian army in Persia and Turkey. Kurdish battle casualties are estimated at 300,000. However, the effect of the war on the Kurdish populated areas was more severe. Many regions throughout Kurdistan were laid waste and their populations decimated by advancing and retreating troop forces. Furthermore, as the war continued, the Young Turks implemented large scale ethnic cleansing of both Armenians and Kurds, including the deportation of Kurds from Erzurum and Bitlis in the winter of 1916.Fisk, R. The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East, p.322. Vintage. By the end of World War I, up to 700,000 Kurds had been forcibly deported and almost half of the displaced perished.Dominik J. Schaller, Jürgen Zimmerer, Late Ottoman genocides: the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and Young Turkish population and extermination policies—introduction, Journal of Genocide Research, Vol.10, No.1, p.8, March 2008. Nevertheless, at this time the Ottoman Kurds still had the legal right to conduct their affairs in Kurdish, celebrate unique traditions, and identify themselves as a distinct ethnic group. The end of the Ottoman Empire The Kurdish ethnonationalist movement that emerged following World War I and the end of the Ottoman Empire was largely in reaction to the changes taking place in mainstream Turkey, primarily radical secularization which the strongly Muslim Kurds abhorred, centralization of authority which threatened the power of local chieftains and Kurdish autonomy, and rampant Turkish nationalism in the new Turkish Republic which obviously threatened to marginalize them. In 1918, the prominent Kurdish nationalist Şerif Pasha pressed the British to adopt a policy supporting autonomous Kurdish regions throughout Kurdistan. He suggested that British officials be charged with appointing officials to administer the regions and control their finances. Strategically, he desired movement towards this plan to be made before the end of the war and the Paris Peace Conference. Şerif was not able to convince the British of this. However, his efforts to plead the cause of his people leading up to the Peace Conference impressed Western powers. Because of his friendship with Armenians, after he was chosen to represent the Kurds by various Kurdish nationalist organizations at the Peace Conference, a Kurdo-Armenian peace accord was reached between Şerif and Armenian representatives at the conference in 1919. The British persuaded the Kurdish and Armenian representatives to sign this Kurdish-Armenian declaration of solidarity against the Kemalists for strategic reasons. The British thought this would increase the likelihood of independent Kurdish and Armenian states that would create a buffer between British Mesopotamia and the Turks. The first opportunity for the Kurds to establish an independent state came with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the end of the First World War. In his Fourteen Points Programme for World Peace, US President Woodrow Wilson included the statement that non-Turkish minorities of the Ottoman Empire should be \\"assured of an absolute unmolested opportunity of autonomous development\\". Aside from the supporters of such sentiments in the US, Britain, France, and of course of Kurds, there were other aspects to consider. These included the operational breakup of the Ottoman Empire, the Kemalist movement, Russia's territorial ambitions, the status of the Christian Armenian population, and Britain's desire to preserve stability in and around its colonial possessions. =Anatolia= Turkish forces often broke the terms of the Armistice by arming Kurdish forces in eastern Anatolia. Turkish forces were able to stir up religious resentment among Kurds against Christian Armenians in a desire to create an effective Kurdish buffer between Turkey and a possible Armenian state, or obviate its creation altogether. Much of this groundwork was performed by 'Ali Ihsan Pasha. Elsewhere, anti-British sentiment was developed by 'Ali Beg and his Turco-Kurdish independence party, and the Kurdish Club, which Edward William Charles Noel claimed was plagued with corruption and self-seeking individuals who were also members of the Turkish CUP. Following the Treaty of Mudros, Istanbul's Kurds began resurrecting their nationalist groups. By the end of 1918, Shaykh Abd al Qadir of the Badr Khans and others reconstituted the Kurdish Club under the new title of Society for the Rise of Kurdistan. But to many, including the British, it was unclear exactly who and what the Kurdish Club and its affiliates in the provinces represented. Understanding the threat that these renewed Kurdish clubs represented if allied with the British (who had by now made it clear that they were leaning towards providing an autonomous Kurdish state), the CUP began advocating policies of decentralization and penetrated these Kurdish clubs in order to maintain their loyalty. Furthermore, Kurdish nationalism was then tactically supported in eastern regions. While inspiring Sunni solidarity among the Kurds, they worked to foment anti-British sentiment among the Kurds. By 1919, two developments destroyed Kurdish hopes of achieving either autonomy or independence in eastern Anatolia. The Greeks landed at Smyrna and the Italians invaded further south in Antalya. The psychological effect that these foreign, Christian invasions had on the Muslim Kurdish population was significant and inevitable. Ideas of nationalism were instantly eclipsed by the Christian threat and the Ottoman government easily mobilized Kurds under Pan-Islamic unity. The second disaster was the rise of Mustafa Kemal. He militantly voiced concern for the safety of the sultanate and called for the preservation of eastern Anatolia against the Christian threat. This likewise had a similar effect on Kurds. Kemalist power grew throughout 1919. With this growth, came persecution of the Kurds and the narrowing of Kurdish political space. A new Kurdish political party was refused registration. Newspapers related calls for Kurdish independence with that of supporting Armenian nationalism as well. Outspoken Kurds were imprisoned or executed for treasonous statements. In 1920, the National Pact was signed. =Treaty of Sèvres= The signatories of the Treaty of Sèvres, 1920 Leading up to the Treaty of Sèvres, in addition to the inability of Kurds to produce a credible leadership, a big failure in reaching a better understanding of an autonomous Kurdish state was due simply to the amount of time that passed between Mudros in 1918 and Sèvres in 1920. Kurds were provided with little alternative by the British. After the Greek attempts in Anatolia, the rise of the Kemalists, and a growing perceived Armenian threat, Anatolian Kurds lacked nationalistic, secessionist desires. Provisions of the Treaty of Sèvres for an independent Kurdistan, 1920. The Treaty was signed between the Allied powers and the government in Istanbul, despite the growing power and authority of the government and the authority of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara. The government in Istanbul was compelled to sign the Treaty even though they themselves strongly disapproved of the terms. In the eyes of the Kurds, the treaty had its flaws. The treaty excluded the Kurdish territories in Syria, the part of the Dersim region lying west of the Euphrates, and the failure to demarcate a boundary between the Kurds and the Armenians. However, these flaws were minor and dominated by \\"the fundamental fact that the treaty had been forced upon an unwilling and token government that lacked a constituency even in Istanbul.\\" (p. 137) Section III of the treaty includes all information related to the issue of an autonomous state of Kurdistan in articles 62 – 64. Under article 62, British, French, and Italian officials were assigned to draft within six months of the implementation of the treaty \\"a scheme of local autonomy for the predominantly Kurdish areas\\".The Treaty of Sèvres, 1920 Article 64 explicitly states that Kurdish regions have the right to proclaim independence from Turkey or other regions ruled over by the Principal Allied Powers in any part of Kurdistan. The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on August 10, 1920. Supporters of the Kurdish military leader Colonel Halid Beg Cibran and other Kurdish nationalists began advocating against the Kemalists and Turkish nationalist sentiments in fear that those sentiments would betray their own interests in an independent Kurdistan. Halid Beg Cibran traveled throughout parts of eastern Anatolia garnering support for his cause, at times using violent coercion against non- supportive Kurdish Alevi tribes. =Koçgiri rebellion= Elsewhere, the Koçgiri rebellion fully erupted in the Dersim region in November 1920. During this time, the Kemalist government in Ankara was attempting to influence Kurds to join the Turkish nationalistic cause by offering jobs and bribes. Throughout 1920, Kurdish organizers in the Dersim region were increasingly successful in tribal organization for an autonomous Kurdistan against the Kemalists, even though many in the region supported the Kemalists. During the summer months, Kurdish armed forces in the region began attacking Turkish ammunition sites and police stations. By November, three months after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, Kurds were demanding official recognition for their autonomy. However, winter stifled their ability to organize and armed operations ceased. During this time, Kemalists were able to surround the region and co-opt many Kurdish tribal leaders and bring them into the Kemalist camp. Clashes erupted again as early as January 1921. With their new position of advantage, Turkish Kemalists arrested and deported Kurdish nationalists and demanded the unconditional surrender of the Kurdish forces that they met, threatening the destruction of their villages if they did not cooperate. Yet, Kurdish forces won several important battles and gained important footholds in the region by March. These successes prompted an increased response from Ankara. By April, the Kurdish rebellion was decisively put down. Reasons behind the Koçgiri rebellion were both ideological and strategic. The main reason for Kurdish support for the rebellion was in order to implement articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres and increase their autonomy in Kurdish Anatolia. Strategically, Kurdish organizers and forces in the region thought they could take advantage of the fledgling Kemalist government as well as its preoccupation with the Greek conflict in the west. The Kurds severely miscalculated in this last respect. There is also evidence that they anticipated foreign support from the French, British, or Greeks. But there is no evidence that they received any. Some Kurdish forces disagreed with requesting foreign support against the Turks as well. There are four main reasons that the Koçgiri rebellion failed. Firstly, the Kurds received no outside European support. Secondly, the tribal nature of Kurdish society allowed the Kemalists to co-opt tribes and break up the unity of the movement. Thirdly, there were religious and sectarian differences among Kurds (primarily Sunni and Alevi differences) that created mistrust and a weak unity. Lastly, the Turks' military, organizational, and patronage power was overwhelmingly superior. It is unlikely that any of the tribes involved in the revolt had battle experience in World War I. Most of the Kurdish Hamidiye regiments that fought in the Balkans under the Ottoman flag lived further east and south. The Kocgiri rebellion was also located near Ankara was relatively accessible by Turkish forces. The Koçgiri rebellion had a significant impact on the government of Ankara. The government continued its policy of attempting to win over Kurdish tribal leaders but set up special commissions to investigate the rebellion. A draft law came before the Grand National Assembly in February 1922 that dealt with administering the Kurdish regions. Because of its superficial nature in dealing with Kurdish autonomy, most Kurdish deputies in the Grand National Assembly opposed it. In his analysis of the draft law, Rober Olson claims that Kurdish opposition to the law reveals that these Kurdish Kemalists were hopeful of obtaining greater autonomy for the Kurds. He also claims that the draft law and its overwhelming majority support reveals that at the time Turks in the Assembly did not favor a violent policy towards the Kurds, but that they \\"did not remotely consider independence or even autonomy in any meaningful sense of that term\\" for the Kurds (p. 41). =Iraq= Jaff tribal chief, Mesopotamia, 1914 First direct contact with Kurds in Iraq and British was in 1917 after the British occupied Khanaqin and later other regions in the north of present Iraq, including Kifri, Tuz Khurmatu, and Kirkuk. In 1918, the first Kurdish troops to fight against the Turks were employed by the British. After further British success in the region, Kurdish tribal leaders were impressed and sought to cast their support behind the British effort. Kurdish notables, including Shaykh Mahmud, agreed that they would further seek support from the British for an autonomous state under the British occupied territory. The Kurdish enthusiasm was not matched by the British. They began withdrawing from Kirkuk and the surrounding regions in May 1918. These areas were promptly reoccupied by Turkish forces. This reoccupation by Turkish forces resulted in much retribution for the Kurds in the region. The British withdrawal was a severe blow to British prestige and ridiculed Kurdish leaders who had spoken in support of the British. Kurds would remain suspicious and doubtful of British power and their intention years after World War I ended. Indeed, Turkish propaganda against the British was not limited to just Eastern Anatolia and Persia. They had a strong presence in the Mosul wilayat of south Kurdistan. In 'Amadiya, Kurds were more easily influenced against the British because the British were a new, foreign presence in their land. Many Kurdish chieftains in the region, far from Istanbul, preferred the old scheme of things under the Ottomans, where they had enjoyed semi-autonomy. New administrative measures under the British, including the collection of taxes and the repatriation of Assyrian refugees agitated the 'Amadiya Kurds. After this agitation and pressure by Turkish inciters, Kurds in the region revolted against the British. This revolt was summarily put down, however, by 1919. Minor revolts of this kind broke out sporadically over the coming years in the Mosul region. =Syria= During the conflict between Kemalists and the Kurds and the Turkish war of independence in the 1920s many Kurds fled to Syria from Turkey to escape oppression. These refugees settled mainly in the Jazira region of northern Syria where formerly nomadic Kurds had already settled decades earlier and become agriculturalists. Unified Kurdish political activity in Syria was relatively undeveloped and sparse. During the Turkish war of independence, Kurdish tribes in Jazira assisted French forces in repelling Turkish advances. The French at this time had considered the creation of a Kurdish enclave stretching from Urfa in the west to Cizre in the east. French policies of decentralization benefited many Kurds in this region at the time because of the increased local power they were given. However, Kurds in Syria were not unified in this position. Many wealthy Kurds in Damascus supported the central authority and status quo under the Ottoman Turks and were not supportive of French decentralization. Other Kurdish tribes supported Syrian independence from the French alongside Arab tribes. This diversity in opinion regarding Kurdish autonomy and relations with the French \\"hindered the development of Kurdish nationalist political activity in Syria.\\" (p. 28). British policy British policy towards the Kurds changed several times between the years of 1918 and 1923, the years between the Armistice of Mudros and the Treaty of Lausanne. The common historical argument is that the abrogation of the Treaty of Sèvres was a result of the success of Kemalist forces and militant Turkish nationalism. However, the evolution of British policy towards the Kurds eventually ran counter to the implementation of articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres. After the armistice of Mudros and until the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres in August 1920, British policy toward the Kurds was that of supporting autonomous units throughout Kurdistan. Kurdish nationalism and autonomy throughout Kurdish populated regions was supported heavily by British intelligence agent Edward William Charles Noel during this time. But the growing strength of Turkish nationalist forces by 1920 undermined Noel's policy ambitions, especially in the north. The British grew further hesitant to establish a \\"quasi-autonomous\\" independent Kurdistan in the south because of the possibility that the French would respond by establishing a similar state with French advisers in the north. =Sheikh Mahmud's rebellions= Mahmud Barzanji in 1919 After World War I and after full Turkish evacuation of southern Kurdistan, Britain reached an agreement with Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji and other Kurdish notables on what was later called 'The Tribal System' or 'The Sandeman System' named after Sir Robert Groves Sandeman. It was based on the principle of indirect rule. Tribal chieftains were entrusted with the government of their own tribes and were made responsible for British administrative duties through Sheikh Mahmud. They were recognized and paid as British government officials. This region of south Kurdistan became known as the South Kurdish Confederation. Many other Kurdish tribes soon agreed to join this system. After years of war and struggle, they were eager to join a peaceful settlement that might offer them protection and financial support. This system eventually fell apart due to disagreements between Sheikh Mahmud and the British. The British had created quite a powerful Kurdish leader through their financial support. Sheikh Mahmud developed a very opportunistic strategy towards the British. After building up so much power in the region, Sheikh Mahmud eventually started an all out rebellion against the British after they attempted to curb his unruly behavior. The Sheikh and his followers were defeated in June 1919. The Sheikh by no means commanded the support of all Kurds in the confederation. The Sheikh's call to arms against the British under nationalism and Islam proved mostly futile. Kurds in southern Kurdistan were too unfamiliar with the concept of nationalism. And their past experiences under the Sultan with jihad during World War I for four years against the British had proved a failure. =The Air Scheme= An aspect that ultimately spelled the downfall for a British policy supporting an autonomous Kurdistan was the Air Scheme policy. This policy of using primarily the Royal Air Force as the dominant military presence in Mesopotamia was experimental at the time. The Air Scheme was popular among British policymakers. The biggest proponents of the Air Scheme were also among the biggest supporters of a \\"Greater Iraq.\\" The preference in early 1920 strategy was to include southern Kurdistan under the auspices of the British Air Scheme. British policy at this point still regarded northern Kurdistan as would be described in articles 62-64 of the Treaty of Sèvres. However, in policy meetings that took place in Cairo in March 1921 British policy towards the Kurds was altered. The newly formed Middle East Department concluded that \\"purely Kurdish areas should not be included in the Arab state of Mesopotamia\\". The framers of this policy stated that Kurdish areas would be put under control of the British High Commission and not under control of any Iraqi government. Noel and others supported this position because they thought Kurds would prefer rule closer to home and rule that was not under Arabs or Turks. This position was also thought to be strategic because an autonomous Kurdistan would create a buffer between the Turks outside of Iraq as well as anti-British movements within Iraq. Winston Churchill, the Secretary of Colonies at the time, agreed with these sentiments and this position. Churchill also feared that a future ruler of Iraq would oppress the Kurdish minority. In the end, this policy was reversed largely by the work of Sir Percy Cox, the first High Commissioner of Iraq. Over time, Cox became convinced that it was best to include southern Kurdistan as an integral part of Iraq, for financial and fiscal purposes. Under the impression that such a policy would not go against the policy adopted in Cairo, Churchill agreed to this new policy. Correspondence shows that Churchill still assumed that the only link between the southern Kurdish regions and Iraq would be through the British High Commission. As Turkish forces grew in strength and militancy, Cox began dealing with King Faisal I of Iraq in determining how Kurds in southern Kurdistan should be incorporated into Iraq territorially and politically. Cox and Faisal devised a policy whereby Kurdish regions could decide whether or not to join Iraq politically instead of merely territorially under the High Commission. Cox claimed that two out of the four of these defined Kurdish districts wished to become part of Iraq. Churchill was convinced and went along with the policy and Cox's dealings with Faisal. Persia Simko Shikak, leader of the 1922 rebellion in Persia After the Armistice, Kurdish nationalistic sentiments grew in Persian Kurdistan where before it had few adherents. This was due in part to the Ottoman Sultan's support. These pan-Islamic policies were designed to win over the Kurds in the region in the possibility of using them as a barrier against the Russians or Armenians. However, Kurdish nationalism grew in other environments. In 1918, members of the Mukri tribe of the Mahabad region were in talks with British officials discussing a possible scheme for an independent Kurdish state under British protection. Like Sharif Pasha, these individuals stressed their desire for autonomy and a desire to reach a peace agreement with the Armenians. Later in 1921, the Persian Kurd, Simko Shikak pursued a different strategy. Simko dealt directly with Persian and Russian officials. He became impatient with Persia's unwillingness to act on granting Kurdish autonomy, and so rebelled in 1922. In the Persian operations against Simko's rebellion, Turkish armies provided valuable support. The rebellion was quickly put down. Following this rebellion, however, Major Noel tried, unsuccessfully, to bring together Simko and other Kurdish nationalist leaders, including Shaykh Mahmud. The object was to create a Kurdish alliance to frustrate Turkish designs. No agreement was reached between these leaders. The Treaty of Lausanne After it became apparent how vehemently the government in Ankara opposed the Treaty of Sèvres and with the rising power of the Kemalists, Major Noel and the British began seriously considering supporting a Kurdish rebellion. The fear that the rebellion might not be controllable resulted in the plan's abandonment. This plan was revived, however, in 1921 after Kemalist troops were found meddling with tribes south of the Armistice line. British policymakers again began contemplating assisting a wide-scale Kurdish rebellion against the Turks in order to counter their growing strength and influence in the region. There were many drawbacks to this plan. This would reflect negatively on King Faisal of Iraq, as weapons would come to northern Kurdistan via Iraq. If the revolt failed, it was thought that the British in Iraq would face a massive amount of Kurdish refugees. There was also the constant worry that Kurdish leaders were unreliable and the Kurdish forces were not unified. But the French had reached an agreement with the government in Ankara on the basis of the National Pact rather than the Treaty of Sèvres. This was done after the Greeks seemed likely to lose against the Turks. France ceded much of its previously occupied land in southern Anatolia, thus providing the Kemalists with the ideal assembly point for an assault on British occupied Iraq. This caused the British to re- evaluate the plausibility of their plans to foment rebellion among the Kurds against the Turks. Yet it still appeared that the British favored Kurdish autonomy in Iraq when they issued a Joint Declaration with the Iraqi government in 1922 that was communicated to the League of Nations. It recognized the right of the Kurds to form a government within the borders of Iraq. In the end, as Kemalist forces spread and grew in strength, \\"the British desire for peace with Turkey, on the best terms for itself, of course, subordinated Britain's Kurdish policy to this objective.\\" (p. 81). It became desirable for the British to negotiate peace with Turkey on much different terms than those of the Treaty of Sèvres. Signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) On 24 July 1923, the Treaty of Lausanne was signed between the British, their allies, and the Turks. The treaty failed to mention the Kurds, even though they made up around 1/3rd of the population of Turkey in the new borders and contained 48.5 percent of the total Kurdish population. Borders between Turkey and Iraq were to be decided between Great Britain and Turkey within nine months of the implementation of the treaty. Kurdish leaders did petition the League of Nations and Britain for the recognition of Kurdish autonomy during negotiations on the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. In the end, the League of Nations abandoned ethnic considerations in favor of economic and strategic ones. Kurdish territory in modern-day Iraq was granted to Iraq, under British control. The Kurdish regions were fully incorporated into the state in 1923 when Iraq held its first elections to the Constituent Assembly. The Iraqi Prime Minister, before the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne, was authorized to meet with Kurdish tribal leaders in Sulaymaniyah in 1923. By this time, he found that they were very much in support of the plan to recognize their national aspirations but within the framework of one country. They even displayed support to King Faisal in a meeting with him in May 1923. These Kurdish leaders, as well as other Kurdish business men and dignitaries were opposed to Shaykh Mahmud's style of nationalism because of his history of political manipulation and lawlessness. According to Muhsin al-Musawi, many tribal Shaykhs and many in the Kurdish elite were strongly inclined by this time to a unified Iraq. Nevertheless, Kurds in Iraq established the short- lived Kingdom of Kurdistan in the city of Sulaymaniyah. The Kingdom lasted from September 1922 until July 1924.Prince, J.

Hardwick, was an Australian architect who from 1917 until 1927 was Principal Architect of the Public Works Department in Western Australia. The Encyclopedia of Australian Architecture refers to Hardwick as being \\"well known for continuing the high standards of design in public buildings established during the gold boom, particularly in hospitals, schools and post offices throughout the state\\". Family Hardwick was born in Rylstone, New South Wales, the son of Rebecca (née White) and John William Hardwick (1826 - 1891). In 1852, at the age of 26, his father had migrated to Australia with £1,000. On arrival he travelled the south eastern states and sketched the sites as he went. He established a general store in Rylstone and married in 1856. William Burden was the third of ten children and he took his paternal grandfather's first name as his first name and his maternal grandmother's maiden name as his middle name. Education and early years Newington College, Silverwater Albany Senior High School In 1873, at 12 years of age, Hardwick commenced senior education, in Sydney, as a boarding student of Newington College. His older brothers, George and Edward, had started there as boarders two years earlier. The College was then still at Newington House on the Parramatta River and his years at Newington coincided with the Presidency of the Reverend Joseph Horner Fletcher.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Sydney, 1999) pp 24 After leaving school, Hardwick served his articles in architecture in private practice in Victoria and worked in that state until the Australian banking crisis of 1893 when he moved to Western Australia. Public Works Department Hardwick moved to Perth and early in 1894 entered the Public Works Department (Western Australia) as a draughtsman. In 1907 he was appointed architect and in 1917 was promoted to the office of Principal Architect. Whilst holding this position he was responsible for designing the Wyndham Meatworks, the General Post Office, Perth (in collaboration with the Commonwealth Architect, John Smith Murdoch), the Albany, Bunbury and Northam high schools, and a large number of post offices throughout the state. The Wooroloo Sanatorium was officially opened in 1915, designed by Hillson Beasley and Hardwick. In 1929, the Point Heathcote Reception Home, later known as Heathcote Hospital, for the treatment of patients with mental illness, was opened to Hardwick's design. He was a Fellow of the Victorian and Western Australian Institutes of Architects. Workers' Homes Board In 1912, Hardwick was appointed a member of the Workers' Homes Board on its establishment and in 1913 was made chairman. He held that position until his retirement in 1930 during which time the total capital expenditure by the board was £3,000,000 covering about 5,000 homes. Town planning Hardwick visited England in 1910, and on his return published a collection of articles on town planning. Later he was a member of the Town Planning Association and assisted in the drafting of the Town Planning Bill for Western Australia. Hardwick’s 1911 proposal to remove the Perth railways yards and to underground the Fremantle-Midland line as far west as Subiaco, and convert the land above to the west of the Perth Station into a grassy mall, graced by public buildings, terminating at its western end in a circus or a Parisian Étoile on which nine streets were to converge, is now celebrated as a lost opportunity. Death On his death in 1941, Hardwick was survived by his widow and five children. His younger brother, Harold Robert Hardwick (1866 - 1935), an architect in Mudgee, New South Wales, predeceased him.

He worked for more than 50 years at the Botanical Museum in Berlin-Dahlem. As part of his training in plant systematics he visited the herbaria at Kew, Brussels, Geneva, Paris and Utrecht. He was not only a botanist, but was well-versed in zoology, chemistry and geography. While his main interests in botany were systematics and phytogeography, he also ventured into other disciplines and in his final 30 years was working on problems in bacteriology and the growth of Ascomycetes, the source of antibiotics and yeast. His own extensive herbarium collection of some 26 000 specimens was lost when the Dahlem Botanical Museum was destroyed by bombing and fire on the nights of 1 and 2 March 1943. The catastrophe was keenly felt by Knuth who had closely identified with the Museum and had experienced his botanical grounding there. Also destroyed were all his notes and manuscripts including his monograph on the Elaeocarpaceae, ready to go to press.http://collections.si.edu/search/results.jsp?q=record_ID:siris_sil_22147 Knuth was a quiet, withdrawn and excessively modest person, impeccable character with a deep sense of duty and order, and greatly respected by his colleagues and students. Conversations with him showed a keen and critical intellect which would respond with gentle irony to any human failing. In addition to frequent collecting trips in Germany, Knuth travelled to locations such as the Carpathian Mountains and Algeria.

It is currently operated by a not-for-profit group for the purpose of providing the people of Melbourne with a means of experiencing nineteenth century sailing and the city's history. Building the replica Planning of a replica began in 1989 and construction commenced in 1991, with the keel laid at the Melbourne Maritime Museum. It was completed at the Old Ports and Harbour Yard in Williamstown, Victoria, and was officially launched by Felicity Kennett, the wife of the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, on the 162nd Melbourne Day in 1997. The replica took six years to build, as it was constructed using traditional 19th century methods. It was made using Australian-grown timber, much of which was recycled, including varieties of wood such as jarrah, Huon pine, kauri, celerytop pine and ironbark. The ship's two masts are local California redwood. Its sails are traditional hand-sewn flax, and its rigging is traditional tarred hemp. The replica was launched on 30 August 1997 at Hobson's Bay for a total cost of $2.5 million. The Enterprize was the first square-rigged commercial sailing ship to be built in Melbourne in 120 years. The original Enterprize The original schooner was built in Hobart in 1829 by William Pender. It was used as a cargo vessel till 1835, after which it was purchased by John Pascoe Fawkner to carry a settlement party to the future site of Melbourne. It was captained by Peter Hunter. After the settlement, the ship was then used as a trading vessel till 1847, when it was wrecked on the shoal of the Richmond River in northern New South Wales. Current activity The replica Enterprize operates both short and long sails for the public, and for school and private groups.

It was an adaption of the 80s and 90s Carmen Sandiego games of the same title. The game, which was released along with another \\"blast from the past\\" The Oregon Trail, was developed by Blue Fang Games and released by The Learning Company. This version, a remake of the first Carmen Sandiego game, was announced via a trailer on YouTube and was released on the social network site Facebook on February 9, 2011.http://blog.games.yahoo.com/blog/348-classic-games-coming-to-facebook The game was taken down in 2012. Development Dubbin, one of the developers, explained that he originally wrote a spec for Blue Fang, \\"with the kind of clues I might do and the sort of material you might get\\". He played the original game numerous times and put together a series of sample clues. Because of the scale involved (each of the 66 cities had many clues about them), a team was assembled to write them.http://m.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/03/how-2-colbert- staffers-and-a-game-journalist-rewrote-carmen-sandiego-for-facebook/72304/ The developers acknowledged the effects of a search engine like Google to the fact-finding nature of Carmen Sandiego, and incorporated this into their design. Gameplay Players began the game in the Chief’s office in the ACME headquarters in San Francisco, where they could check which cases were available to choose. After accepting one of the available cases, players started by the traveling to the first crime scene. Much like in the original games, players could travel through the city to search for and collect clues; the city clue hinted at the next geographic location to fly to, and the ID clue at the identity of the thief for that case. Important information was collected and listed in the clue log. The player could open up the map and fly to the next destination. If in the new location people gave you additional clues, the player was in the right place; if they didn't know anything, the player was in the wrong location and had to backtrack. The suspect list was narrowed down until only one option remained, and a warrant could be issued for the suspect's arrest. Without a correct warrant, one could not pass the case. Players had a certain number in-game days to complete the case, which were defined by the distance traveled between two geographic locations, not by real-time. Shortcuts could be bought by spending Facebook Credits. If players missed the deadline, the suspect would escape and the case would be closed without a reward being issued. Locations This version included 86 world cities that players could visit:http://carmenforfacebook.blogspot.com/p/location-clues.html Critical response The game has received generally positive reviews. Matthew Booth of Avault gave the game a rating of 3/5 stars. He notes that \\"it might not possess all of the characteristics of a AAA game, but it’s entertaining and a good option if you’re at work and need to kill a few minutes.\\" He comments that \\"if you find yourself stuck on a clue, you can cheat like I did and enlist the help of Google, or you can request help from your friends.\\" His closing comments are \\"it’s free and you’re already wasting time on FB, so what’s to lose? But don’t expect anything worth the hype...now if Carmen Sandiego had zombies, maybe then I’d stay interested\\". Out of the options \\"Skip it\\", \\"Play it\\" or \\"Buy it\\", he suggested \\"Play it\\". Dan Zuccarelli of Gamezebo gave the game rating of 4 1/2 stars out of 5. He comments that \\"the great news is that the game’s transition to Facebook doesn’t detract from it in any way. Quite the opposite actually. Jet setting, clue solving, and criminal catching is as fun as ever\\". He adds that playing on the social medium allows players to ask their friends for help or even get them to take part in your cases. However, he also says that in the pre-internet era of Carmen Sandiego games, players were equipped with a \\"big desk reference book\\" that allowed them to search for answers to clues they were given throughout the cases. However now with Google and wikipedia \\"only a browser tab away\\", it is hard to resist the temptation of getting the correct answer immediately. He said that he was addicted to the game and kept saying \\"just one more case!\\". His closing comments were that \\"Carmen Sandiego’s engaging and educational gameplay is just as good now as it was way back when\\". While the pros were its engaging and educational gameplay, and great presentation, the cons were it having not enough visual variety. On Common Sense Media, the game is rated 2/5 for positive messages, 2/5 for positive role models, 3/5 for ease of play and 2/5 for consumerism. The review notes that \\"the game does not push its premium currency on the player as aggressively as other titles, and the game is perfectly enjoyable without needing it\\". It gave the game an overall rating of 5/5 stars, arguing that the game is \\"essentially the same game as its PC counterpart\\", as opposed to its Oregon Trail counterpart which \\"resulted in a highly commercial and arguably less fun experience\\". It adds that \\"cases seem to be randomly generated and there are more than a dozen suspects, so replay value is very good\\". The site advises that the game is for ages 13 and up.

It was owned by the Solms-Baruth dynasty until 1942.  History  Kliczków Castle Kliczków was founded as a border fortress at the river Kwisa by Duke Bolko I of Jawor in 1297. In 1391, it fell into the hands of the Rechenberg family from Saxony, who held it for almost 300 years. The main building was built in 1585 in the Renaissance style. In 1611, King Matthias of Bohemia visited the castle. After several more changes of ownership, it came to John Christian, Count of Solms- Baruth in 1767. In 1810, the grand ballroom in Empire style was created. In 1881, the architects Heinrich Joseph Kayser and Karl von Großheim from Berlin began an expansion of the castle. They mixed styles: English Gothic architecture with Italian Renaissance and French mannerism. An 80-acre English country garden was designed at the same time by Eduard Petzold. In 1906, Emperor Wilhelm II stayed at the castle while he was hunting in the area. In 1920, it was inherited by Frederick of Solms-Baruth. During the Nazi period, he was engaged in resistance against National Socialism in the Kreisau Circle. He was arrested after the failed attempt on Hitler's life and his property was confiscated. The castle survived the Second World War virtually unscathed, but the interior was looted by Soviet troops. In 1949, a fire destroyed the depot and the servants' quarters. In the 1950s, the castle was in the care of the local forest authority, which neglected the interior and ruined the stucco and the stoves. The former owner's horse cemetery was retained. In 1971, the Wrocław University of Technology acquired the castle and tried in vain to save it. After the fall of Communism, a commercial company from Wrocław purchased the castle and developed it into a luxurious conference and recreation center that was opened in 1999.

Currently it holds the place of Ghana's top oil marketing company, and is the only indigenous owned petroleum marketing company in Ghana. History = Founding = Founded in 1960, GOIL began as a private enterprise named AGIP Ghana Company Limited, with major shareholders AGIP SPA of Italy and SNAM S.P.A. It was initially founded as a company that would produce fossil fuel products such as fuel, propane and butane, asphalt, and lubricants. In 1968 SNAM S.P.A. transferred its shares to Hydrocarbons International Holdings. In 1976, the name was changed from AGIP Ghana Company Limited to Ghana Oil Company. = Ownership = In 1974 Ghana bought AGIP SPA's and Hydrocarbons International Holdings’ shares. In 2007 GOIL's board approved becoming a public company, making the company a state-owned enterprise (SOE). The state currently owns 51% of GOIL's shares. These shares are held through Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT), an agency charged with Ghana's pension system. The SSNIT holds these shares because it has an interest in major aspects of Ghana's economy because it needs sectors to do well in order to insure pensions. = 2010–2012 rebranding = Due to deregulation efforts in 2005 among downstream petroleum companies, GOIL began to lose its market dominance. In order to address the revenue losses from increased competition, the company embarked on a rebranding strategy that included a new logo and a new slogan of \\"energy with a smile.\\" The new logo is meant to represent movement, energy, life, and growth. They also completed ISO certification, giving both customers and shareholders more confidence in GOIL's products. More service stations were added as part of the initiative. Efforts are still being made to further improve customer satisfaction, increased shareholder value. The rebranding has overall been considered successful, and has kept GOIL as the country's top petroleum marketer. = 2015 Explosion = On 4 June 2015, a GOIL fuel station in Accra exploded. The station had been used as a shelter for victims of the 2015 Accra floods, and the disaster was compounded by floodwaters as gas floated and spread. The death toll was at least 150 people.[5] In 2018, 69 victims filed a class action lawsuit for GH₵40 million in damages, and GH₵1 million for hospital bills and transportation against the specific GOIL station, the National Petroleum Authority, and Accra's mayor, Alfred Oko Vanderpuije. = ExxonMobil Partnership = In October 2018, Ghana began asking for bids from domestic and international oil companies to explore offshore oil reserves. In December 2018 it was announced that GOIL, in partnership with ExxonMobil and Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) would be entering into deep-water oil exploration in the Cape Three Points area. This move is supposed to strengthen Ghana's indigenous presence in the petroleum industry, and increase domestic oil production. For GOIL, engaging in deep-water oil exploration would mean shifting towards being an upstream petroleum company.  Leadership  Patrick Okorli serves as Goil's Chief Executive Officer, Managing Director, and Executive Director since 2012. Before this position, he has served as chief accountant, controller, treasurer, chief internal auditor, and finance manager. In 2017, Peter Bartels was promoted to non-executive chairman, which means he does not have a management position in the company, but instead oversees the running of the board. The Head of Finance is Erasmus Sarkwa, and the Chief Operating Officer is Alex Adzew.  Awards and recognition  Goil has won numerous awards, including first place in the Ghana Energy Awards for petroleum company of the year in 2001, 2005, 2007, and 2008. It also consistently places first in Chartered Institute of Marketing Ghana (CIMG) awards for petroleum company of the year. In 2018, Chairman Peter Bartels was awarded \\"Outstanding Board Chairman of the year 2018\\" in Accra's 9th Entrepreneur and Corporate Executive Awards.  Operations  The company's main business is marketing and distribution of petroleum products in Ghana. The biggest chunk of its sales comes from the sale of diesel and gasoline. The company is manned by a 10-member management team headed by the Managing Director.http://goil.com.gh/overview/Ghana Oil Co Ltd (GOIL.GH). reuters.com (Reuters).

Most of the artifacts, which include busts, statues, statuettes, tools, and various eating and cooking utensils, come from the Bronze Age, or from the Greek and Roman periods. History The museum was established in 1924. It was built on the site of an abandoned church, called Saint Voukolos Church. The museum opened to the public in 1927. The archaeology museum was later moved to the National Education Pavilion in the Culture Park, which in turn was converted into a museum in 1951. But archaeological work in Izmir, Smyrna, and the neighboring ancient cities necessitated a larger museum. A new museum was subsequently established in 1984. The museum has exhibits from ancient sites like Bayraklı (ancient Smyrna), Ephesus, Pergamon, Miletus, Aphrodisias, Clazomenae, Teos, and Iasos. Two gardens, one in the front and one in the back, portray the history of western Anatolia. The Izmir Archeology Museum is one of the first built in Western Anatolia and contains a collection of artifacts of the Aegean Region. The museum's collection has been categorized as a regional museum rather than a local one because of the importance of its collection. The Museum is located in Konak, in the central part of the city. It is within walking distance of Konak Square.

Plot  Linda convinces Bob to audition for \\"Hey Good Cookin'\\", a cooking segment on the local morning news show Get on Up with married news anchors Chuck and Pam. While Linda is filming Bob, Gene appears in the video wearing a Sasquatch mask and going after the burger Bob just made for attention. The audition tape is picked not because of Bob's cooking, but because of the comical duo of Bob and Gene. In their first appearance, Gene wears his Sasquatch mask and wrecks Bob's cooking segment like he did before. The act becomes an instant success, and Gene names his character Beefsquatch. Meanwhile, Nathan, a boy in the studio audience for Get on Up asks Tina if she is close with Pam, which gets him really excited. He convinces Tina to become his girlfriend. Business at Bob's Burgers goes up due to Gene's fame, but Bob is not happy. When the Belcher family get invited to Chuck and Pam's pool party, Pam secretly confides to Linda that she and Chuck are getting a divorce. Bob gets angry when Gene mocks him at the party. To get revenge, he asks for Louise's help to pull a prank on Gene during their next segment. Gene also asks for her help to do the same. During the segment, Bob finds that his cooking utensils have been glued to his hands but manages to sneak habanero peppers into the burger that Gene eats. As the weeks go by, the prank wars become more intense, popular with the audience, but Linda worries that the family is falling apart. Louise reveals that she has been helping both Bob and Gene with their pranks without the other knowing and announces that she is quitting. With no other options left, Linda tries to get Chuck and Pam to end the show, but they refuse and kick Linda out of the studio. Tina breaks up with Nathan when she realizes he is only using her to get close to Pam and taste her hair. Nathan manages to sneak into Pam's dressing room disguised as Tina and attacks Pam. Tina tries to stop Nathan and the two are thrown out of the studio, along with Louise. While filming the next episode of \\"Hey Good Cookin'\\", Gene and Bob get into a fight. Linda breaks back into the studio and tries to ruin the show by cursing in front of the camera, but no actual curse words come out, so she pulls up her shirt to reveal her breasts on live TV. Bob and Gene apologize to each other, reconcile, and decide to join Linda in flashing to the camera. Get on Up is canceled as a result of the controversy.

History Airfield construction began, after much debate, as a Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte military airfield during World War I in 1916 It consisted of 8 Hangars, a maintenance hangar, a fuel depot, and a railway connection. In 1917 it was completed and leased to the German Reich at no cost. A provision was made however that the land would be returned to its original civilian owners if the airfield did not exist anymore in 30 years time. The provision ran from 1 April 1916 until 31 March 1945. After World War I the airfield was occupied by Belgian and French military forces. in 1925 the hangars were taken apart and transported to Belgium. After the occupying forces had left the city of Krefeld took control over the airfield as a civil airport, and on 2 February 1926, the first German civil aircraft landed at the airfield. By the middle of May air service Krefeld-Essen-Berlin was started, and soon the service from Krefeld was taken over by Lufthansa. Connections to Essen and Cologne ensured connections to 93 other airports. In 1926 135 passengers and 850 kilos of freight were transported, but 4 years later this had increased to 960 passengers and 32,559 kilos of freight. During World War II Krefeld became a Luftwaffe Fliegerhorst, and was home to JG 1 and JG 52. The United States Army moved into the area in April 1945 and was converted by IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force into an Army Air Forces advanced Landing Ground, designated Y-61. Air Force units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command. After the German Capitulation on 8 May, it was re- designated as \\"Army Air Forces Station Krefeld\\". It was used during May and June 1945 as a Tactical Air Depot for the storage and destruction of former Luftwaffe Aircraft. Army Air Forces units moved out on 15 June, turning the field over to the British as part of the British Occupation zone of Germany. The British found the airfield of little use. The rise of the jet engine meant the airfield was not large enough, and it had no room for expansion. They only used parts of the terrain as a barracks, the rest was returned to agricultural use. In 1947 a request was made with the Allied military to release the terrain for civilian use, and in 1950 the former airfield was released to the city of Krefeld. Today there is little evidence of the airfield with the exception of a small memorial of the former airfield (51° 21' 46.55\\" N 6° 37' 0.48\\" E) References * Y-61 Krefeld * Johnson, David C.

The Island of the Dolls (La Isla de las Muñecas), located in the channels of Xochimilco, south of the center of Mexico City, very close to the Estadio Azteca football stadium, is a chinampa of the Laguna de Teshuilo and one of the main attractions of the channels. Dolls of various styles and colors are found throughout the island, originally placed by the former owner of the island, Don Julian Santana Barrera. Julian believed that dolls helped to chase away the spirit of a girl drowned years ago. Julian died in 2001 of a heart attack. Sources say he was close to the same spot where the girl drowned.  History  Dolls seen from the lake The Island of the Dolls, originally owned by Don Julian Santana Barrera, is full of dolls hanging from trees and buildings covered with cobwebs and insects. The place was named during the 1950s when the owner began to hang them as protection against evil spirits. Julian was a neighbor of the Barrio de la Asunción, where he used to go to drink pulque after having sold his vegetables, until, due to superstitions, he began to preach the Bible, being expelled from the sector. According to legend, a young girl drowned entangled among the lilies of the canal and her body was found on the banks of the Santampa chinampas. Don Julian began to experience inexplicable situations so, terrified, placed dolls that he found in the garbage or in the canals of Cuemanco with the idea that they would scare the soul of the young girl who would cry out \\"I want my doll\\". He also found a doll floating nearby and, assuming it belonged to the deceased girl, hung it from a tree as a sign of respect. After this, he began to hear whispers, footsteps, in the darkness even though his hut—hidden deep inside the woods of Xochimilco—was miles away from civilization. Driven by fear, he spent the next fifty years hanging more and more dolls, some missing body parts, all over the island in an attempt to appease what he believed to be the drowned girl's spirit. In 1987, an eco-tourist rescue was made and the island was found covered with water lily. Since then and after the death of Don Julian, the chinampa became a place of great tourist affluence. The place gained fame after 1943, when Mexican filmmaker Emilio Fernández filmed María Candelaria there, with Dolores del Río and Pedro Armendáriz as protagonists. A significant number of international and local channels have featured articles on the island, including The Huffington Post, Travel Channel and ABC News. After Julian’s death in 2001, his body reportedly found in the area where he found the girl’s body fifty years before—the area became a popular tourist attraction where visitors bring more dolls. The locals describe it as \\"charmed\\"—not haunted—even though travelers claim the dolls whisper to them. Professional photographer Cindy Vasko visited the island in 2015 and described it as the \\"creepiest place [she has] ever visited\\". The excursion began through maze-like canals, surrounded by lush greenery and singing birds, but soon her boat was slowed down by a swarm of lily pads and the canal fell ominously silent. She told MailOnline: \\"At the end of the journey, the trajinera turned along a bend in the waterway and I was struck by a surreal vision of hundreds, maybe thousands, of dolls hanging from trees on the tiny island.\\" The dolls are still on the island, which is accessible by boat. The island was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Adventures and the Amazon Prime show Lore. It was also featured in BuzzFeed Unsolved.  Access to the island  Oldest doll in the Isla de las Muñecas, in Xochimilco, Mexico City The island of the dolls is an hour and a half from Embarcadero Cuemanco. The only access is via trajinera. Most rowers are willing to transport people to the island, but there are those who refuse due to superstitions. The journey, approximately one hour, includes a tour of the Ecological Area, the Ajolote Museum, the Apatlaco Canal, the Teshuilo Lagoon and the Llorona Island. In addition to hundreds of dolls, the island also contains a small museum with some articles from local newspapers about the island and the previous owner. There are a store and three rooms, one of which seems to have been used as a bedroom. In this room is the first doll that Julian collected, as well as Agustinita, his favorite doll. Some of the visitors place offerings around this doll in exchange for miracles and blessings, some others change their clothes and maintain it as a form of worship.

It was built during the 13th and 14th centuries. The coat of arms of the House Medrano with the Calatrava Cross can be found of the eastern facade, sign of its Dominion and its most recent historical ownership. The monument complex is right now occupied by the Town hall, Library and other Agoncillo Town Departments and can be visited -always after booking the aforementioned dependencies- on working days during the opening hours of the administration.  History  The Codex Vigilanus mentions the conquest of a Muslim castle in this in this area by Sancho Garcés, king of Pamplona at the beginning of the 10th century. Subsequently, several documents of the 11th and 12th centuries name a fortress called Aguas Mansas (Calm Waters) or Aguas Muertas (Dead Waters) and draw the attention to the high quality of its defences. This may be the cause this site was so coveted and in 1191, Alfonso VIII reached an agreement with Pedro and Gómez García about the state surrounding lands. In 1337 Rodrigo Alfonso de Medrano, crossbowman of Alfonso XI, bought the village and the castle and started carrying out several remodelling works adapting it to the style of the 14th century. In his testament in 1345 he noted having spent big amounts of money in \\"...building the castle and the village\\" (in Old Spanish \\"...fazer el castillo e la villa\\"). During the battles between Peter the Cruel and Henry of Trastámara, the castle passed onto the hands of Charles II of Navarre, although for a short period. In 1392, it was owned was Rodrigo Alfonso de Algoncillo (sic.) who bequeathed it to his nephew Diego López de Medrano and to his heirs, the Counts of Siruela who inhabited it until the 19th century.  Architecture  The floor plant of the castle is almost rectangular with four prism-shaped towers on each corner whose machicolations are still preserved to the current day. Built with dimension stones and in two stages, the first in the middle of the 14th century over a former building and other at the end of the 15th century. The highest tower hast four floors and a door with a pointed arch. The smallest tower, called de las palomas (of the doves), has some well preserved modillions which supported the machicolation. The parade ground, restored in the 16th century, has a cloister shape, is built at two levels and the gallery of the main floor rests on semicircular arches. An integral restoration was carried out in 1990, removing some removing some utilitarian rooms created in the 18th and 19th century returning it to its former appearance.

On the far left might have been some scene, which may have been destroyed to build the Monesterio Palace. The twelfth box is empty. In tables 13-16 Bartholomew defeats the idol Baldach, who Astyages loves and making command him flogging for his anger, but orders pulling him to pieces because it seems insufficient punishment. We can see the him tied of the four limbs being skinned on a table holding by three female figures: lust, vanity and laziness. Tables 18 and 19 show San Bartolomé preaching with his own skin over his shoulder. The tympanum of Cristo Redentor of the cover is moved down because in the 16th century stonemason Pedro de Acha reformed the chorus and makes a small window in order to illuminate the place. From this reform is also created the Renaissance arch behind this choir.  Structure  The basilica has three naves separated by octagonal pillars covered with a groin vault, highlighting the Romanesque crossing and apse, because there is not any altarpiece but it had a major altarpiece in its day, 18th-century style, painted in white and gold with great resemblance with the Holy Martyrs of Calahorra. = Structure = During the fifteen day which Logroño resisted the siege of the French army in 1521, the tower was hit by enemy artillery suffering damage, because it is near the defensive walls of the city, and guarded the door Herbentia, near the old town hall . Years later it was rebuilt in brick, with Mudejar style influences from Aragón. During the First Carlist War it was located in the tower the optical telegraph.

Furthermore, disappeared all the works of art that could have except a carved stone Gothic coffins. He had other uses as military hospital, park or workshop. During mid-19th century was thought to demolish stone building in order to build a theater in the place that was the episcopal palace (currently in this place is located the food market). Next to the church and even attached to it were built several buildings, some of which have been restored or demolished so now part of the apse is seen from the outside. Among those is the Palace of the Marquises of Monesterio, dating from 1751 and it was owned by the Marquis of Monesterio and Lapilla. Over the years it housed institutions like the Catholic Circle of Workers, schools and the cinema of the Father Marin and after years without any use, has been renovated and reused as official building.

It consists of a white sandy beach, an estuary, farms and several homes. The area is popular with surfing, windsurfing and kite surfing. There is a campground located at the south-eastern end of the beach, and a boat ramp at the estuary. The beach is dangerous for inexperienced surfers and swimmers due to the strong currents that are often present and steep banks at many places along the six kilometre beach. Offshore winds blow from the south-west, which are quite common since the prevailing wind in New Zealand is westerly. The area also enjoys more sunshine hours than other places in the country. Both sharks and seals have been sighted at the beach. Several dead seals washed up on the beach in August 2019. Geography Pukehina Beach is located twenty minutes drive away from Te Puke, the Kiwifruit capital of New Zealand. On the other side of the estuary is Little Waihi and it is a short drive from there to Maketu. To the north-west, across the estuary entrance and around the point is Newdicks Beach. To the east-north-east, out to sea, lies Whakaari / White Island, an active volcano and peak of a 1,600m submarine mountain, which is visible during fine weather. To the south-east there is an extensive area of Māori land. History In 2017, Pukekina experienced exponential house price growth, due to demand for holiday homes from New Zealand, Australia, China and the United States. A suspected drink driver crashed into a beachside home in Pukekina in November 2018, but no one was killed or injured in the crash. The Pukehina Volunteer Fire Brigade was sued in early 2018 by a former volunteer fireman who claimed the brigade had a culture of bullying. In 2018, developers applied for planning approval to convert a 165-hectare dairy farm into a sustainable eco-friendly lifestyle village, and a restored wetland for birds like the critically endangered Matuku. In August 2018, State Highway 2 was blocked at Pukehina by a roaming herd of up to 80 cows.

The bridge is 164 meters long, 5 meters wide and reaches a maximum height of 30 meters. It was built with seven semicircular arches, only two of which stand relatively intact today.

Its common names include the rock grenadier, the roundnose grenadier and the roundhead rat-tail. In France it is known as grenadier de roche and in Spain as granadero de roca. It is a large, deep-water species and is fished commercially in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Description The roundnose grenadier is a deep water fish sometimes reaching over a metre (yard) in length. The rounded head is large with a broad snout, the abdomen small and the tail long and tapering to a pointed tip. At the front of the snout there is a blunt, tube-like scute or scale and there is a small barbel under the chin. There are three rows of small teeth at the front of the mouth but only one row at the back. The scales on the body are densely packed and covered with small spines. The dorsal fin has two spines and 8 to 11 soft rays and the pelvic fin has 7 to 8 soft rays, the outer one of which is greatly elongated. The general body colour is brownish-grey but the inside of the mouth, the orbits round the eyes, the gill cavities and the fins are dark brownish black.Coryphaenoides rupestris Gunnerus, 1765 FishBase. Retrieved 2012-05-04.Species fact sheet: Coryphaenoides rupestris (Gunnerus, 1765) Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Retrieved 2012-05-04 Distribution The roundnose grenadier is found in the northern Atlantic Ocean at depths between and occasionally at much greater depths. It tends to spend the summer in deep waters and the winter in shallower locations. Its range normally extends from Baffin Island, Greenland, Iceland and Norway south to the New England Seamounts and North Africa. It is found on continental shelves and in the vicinity of seamounts and knolls. Biology The roundnose grenadier sometimes forms dense shoals at depths of about . It makes a daily vertical migration, returning later to the seabed where it feeds on small invertebrates including shrimps, amphipods and cumaceans, and to a lesser extent, cephalopods and various fishes, including lanternfishes. The roundnose grenadier is a batch spawner and is believed to migrate to the vicinity of Iceland to spawn in late summer or autumn. The females reach maturity when they are nine to eleven years old and the males when they are rather younger. Up to 35,000 eggs can be produced at a time. Fishery Commercial fishing for the roundnose grenadier started in the 1960s. The former USSR, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic were the main countries involved, sending factory ships to undertake midwater trawls in the Atlantic Ocean. Catches peaked at over in 1971. More recently, French and Spanish vessels have predominated and the total annual catch has been under in most years since 1980. The flesh of the fish is white with a pleasant texture and is sold as seafood. In 2010 in the United Kingdom, the roundnose grenadier was listed as a \\"UK Priority Species\\" for conservation purposes on the grounds that it is a long-lived fish taking many years to mature and that numbers were declining. It was suggested that if no actions to conserve the fish were taken, it would become extinct within the next 10 years.UK Priority Species: Coryphaenoides rupestris Joint Nature Conservation Committee.

Prince Louis of Hohenlohe-Langenburg then changed the name of the hamlet to match the name of the lustschloss he had built there.  History  The hamlet of Lindenbronn was acquired by the Hohenlohe-Langenburg family in 1556. In the years that followed, they created a 28-acre park to hunt. In 1750, the park was surrounded by a wall. In 1736, Prince Louis began building a summer residence in the park. It was designed by Leopoldo Retti, and Retti's original design was based on early 18th century Parisian city architecture. Prince Louis only built a simplified version of the original design. On the ground floor were some utility rooms, a garden room and a dining room. The first floor contained a large hall and three residential apartments.

History Academy building named after Julius Adolph Stöckhardt, chemist and faculty member, 1847-1883 In Saxony, as in other parts of Germany, there were concerns that forests were being over- exploited, and needed to be properly managed. In 1810 Cotta was appointed to a government forestry post under Frederick Augustus I of Saxony. He also taught forestry, but the forestry school was initially run on a private basis. In 1813 the school was visited by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1816, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Cotta obtained state support for the school, which became the Königlich-Sächsische Forstakademie. It attracted a number of foreign students including a contingent from Russia. In 1841 Cotta was given an award by Tsar Nicholas I in recognition of his efforts at Tharandt. By the time of German reunification in 1990, the College of Forestry (Forstliche Hochschule) had already been integrated into the Dresden University of Technology (DUT). Arboretum Forstbotanischer Garten Among the oldest aboreta in the world, the Forstbotanischer Garten Tharandt, was established by Cotta in the same year as the Academy. Five years later, in 1816, it was integrated administratively with the College. Today it belongs to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences of the Dresden University.Technische Universität Dresden, Faculty of Environmental Sciences, retrieved 11 March 2014. It is open to the public from April to October, and the admission is free of charge.Dresden University of Technology, Aboretum, German, retrieved 11 March 2014. Legacy The school lives on today as a campus of the Dresden University of Technology, and site of its Department of Forestry, which continues to train foresters. The arboretum was expanded most recently in 1998. Today it contains some 2,000 species and varieties of woody plants. Its museum is housed in the Schweizerhaus Tharandt. In 2002, a severe flood destroyed many of the academy buildings and the library, including some of its more-than-500-year-old books. The academy was rebuilt and today has about 650 students and is famous for its long traditions of educating students from all over the world in forestry (including a programme in tropical forestry), resource management and sustainable land use.

The Monastery of Santa María de Huerta (Spanish: Monasterio de Santa María de Huerta) is a Cistercian monastery located in Santa María de Huerta, a town of the Spanish Province of Soria, within the autonomous community of Castile and León. The first stone of the building was laid by Alfonso VII of León and Castile in 1179.SANTA MARÍA DE HUERTA MONASTERY It was declared a national monument in 1882.Reference in Spanish. Guía de Soria  History  Its foundation is due to the king Alfonso VII of León and Castile, in fulfilment of a promise he made in the siege of Coria. For this project, the king brought in 1142, from the abbey of Berdoues in Gascony (France), a community of Cistercian monks, with their abbot Rodulfo, who stayed in a very poor building built in a place called Cántabos, located in the municipality of Fuentelmonge. The chosen place had shortage of water and a transfer to the lands near the Jalón river, which took place in 1162, was decided. Saint Martin of Hinojosa was the fourth abbot of the monastery. He was named bishop of Sigüenza but resigned and returned to the monastery, where he did great works and transformations until converting the primitive building into another one of greater dimensions and of true Cistercian features, which still persists. Alfonso VII of León and Castile laid the first stone of this new construction on March 20 of 1179. It is believed that the works were made under the direction of the master of the cathedral of Sigüenza. They advanced very quickly thanks to the royal protection and the abundant donations. Hall of the Converts. One of the great patrons of this monastery was the archbishop of Toledo, Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada, nephew of Martin of Hinojosa. In his testament signed in Paris in April 1201 he ordered that he be buried in said monastery. Throughout the years this center received many donations and alms, constantly enriching its heritage. Many of the concilĭums of the Cistercian Order were held in this place. Important sponsors were the lords of Molina who chose the monastery for burial, including the first owner of the lordship, the count Manrique Pérez de Lara as well as his son Pedro, both buried, along with other members of their lineage, in the pantheon of the counts of Molina located in the Gothic cloister. The kings Alfonso II of Aragon and Peter II of Aragon were also benefactors of the monastery. In 1215, Martín Muñoz, mayordomo mayor of Henry I, nephew of the abbot Martin of Hinojosa, paid for the works of the refectory. In the 16th century he obtained aid and benefits from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Philip II of Spain. Other constructions were built and the monastic complex enlarged. In 1833, according to the Ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendizábal, the monks were expelled and only the church remained as parish. Enrique de Aguilera y Gamboa, marquis of Cerralbo, made an exhaustive study of the entire monument, taking charge of making known the history and inventory of the works of art. Thanks to his work, this monastery could be saved from total ruin. In 1882 it was declared a national monument. Since 1930, the monastery has been a community of monks of the Cistercian Order of the Strict Observance (Trappists). At present the Abbot of the monastery is Dom Isidoro Anguita and the community is formed by about 24 brothers.  The enclosure  Portal of the church. All the dependencies of the monastery (church, cloister, orchard, bread factory (silo), warehouses, labor fields, etc.) are surrounded by a wall with eight crenellated cubes. In the 16th century, the entrance was refurbished by ennobling the door in whose pediment an image of the Virgin can be seen. In 1771 the door was enlarged with an upper body that presents another pediment adorned with the jug of lilies, symbol of purity always related to the Virgin Mary. The door gives access to an atrium or square where the Casa Curato is located on the left, originally an abbatial room, general goal and stewardship. Opposite is the facade of the church with a large rose window whose radii are small columns, and a pointed arch door with smooth moldings and sawtooth moldings. The buildings that were monastery proper were built in the 16th century and only from the end of 12th century with some modifications from other centuries the cella, the refectory of converts and the church are preserved. = The church = Interior of the church, with the altarpiece in the background. Pipe organ of the church. The first stone was founded and placed by Alfonso VII of León and Castile, on March 20, 1179. At the end of the 18th century, classicist works and changes were made. It began to be built by the semicircular apse. The works did not extend too much in time, with the exception of the last four bays of the naves, which were completed in the 13th century. Simple vaults and wooden roof were built in the central nave; All this was replaced in 1632 by lunettes vaults. The central nave was also changed in the 18th century with an added cornice, run on capitals and the iron gate was added (a work of art of ironwork) to isolate the closure of the sections destined for the parish. No changes were made to the exterior, where one can see one of the most austere constructions of the Cistercian architecture, with large buttresses in the double wall. It has a ground plan with three naves and a transept with five apsidal chapels with pointed arches and vaults of simple cross-section. Of the five apses, the one in the center is semicircular and the other four are rectangular, a Cistercian model that was also followed in the Monasterio de Santa María de Matallana (Province of Valladolid).  Interior  * The main chapel is covered by a Baroque altarpiece by Félix Malo (from Calatayud), made in 1766. On both sides of the altarpiece there are some marble urns from Calatorao, from the 17th century, with the remains of the bishop Ximénez de Rada and abbot Martin of Hinojosa. On the sides of the chapel are the sepulchers of the dukes of Medinaceli, from 1632. On the walls of the presbytery there are large frescoes from the 18th century depicting scenes from the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. * In the south arm of the transept you can see two large oil paintings of Alfonso VII and Alfonso VIII, also from the 18th century. There are also two Romanesque sepulchers of the Hinojosa family. The transept gives access to the octavate chapel of Nuestra Señora del Destierro, built between 1747 and 1750, destined to reliquary. There is kept a Romanesque image of the Virgin that according to tradition is the one she wore in her saddle Jiménez de Rada in the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. It is a rough and disproportionate work, from the beginning of the 13th century. The copper crosier with cabochons is also kept, which was found in the sepulcher of Abbot Martin of Hinojosa. By the north arm it is passed to the tower, built in the 12th century, which has a spire added in the 17th century. From the tower one gains access to a dependency that in the 13th century was a chapter house, with entrance from the cloister and that in the 16th century was transformed into sacristy. Further north is the Chapel of Profundis which is reached from the cloister. There the corpses of the monks were exposed and watched until they were buried. Previously it seems that it was a place of work or library. The high choir has a good walnut seating manufactured in the second half of the 16th century.  The refectory  View of the refectory On the north wall is the façade of the refectory, from the 12th century, which has a pediment with rose window and a door with archivolt very similar to the main door of the church. The refectory is the monastery's masterpiece. Construction began in 1215 at the expense of Martín Nuño de Hinojosa, nephew of Abbot Hinojosa. It is a large nave with sexpartite vaults and with beautiful pointed arched windows that provide a lot of light to the room. In one of the walls the staircase was built into the wall, covered by a vault in ramp, which gives access to the rostrum or pulpit from which a monk read his companions some pious book while they ate. The Spanish art historian Vicente Lampérez y Romea assures that it is the most beautiful and comprehensive example of all the known ones in Spain and that it can very well compete with the most beautiful of monastic Europe. The French historian Elie Lambert makes similar statements. This refectory communicates with a monumental kitchen that has in the center an immense square home, supported by four pointed arches, an interesting example of Spanish type.  The cloisters  From the left nave of the church is accessed, through a door that was opened in the 12th century, the cloister called de los Caballeros; It took this name because it was the burial place of families of the nobility and illustrious people. It is a good example of Cistercian Gothic cloister. View of the Gothic/Plateresque cloister and the tower. From the lower cloister de los Caballeros one ascends to the top by a magnificent staircase of honor built in 1600, which leads to the high cloister, Renaissance work that began to be built in 1533 and was completed in 1547. The galleries of this cloister have very low arches and balusters and an ornamentation of medallions that give name to each of them: * Gallery of Kings (from Henry I of Castile) * Gallery of Apostles * Gallery of Adalides (military caudillos) * Gallery of Prophets Inside these galleries can be seen in certain spaces the busts of some monks of the monastery who stood out for their virtue or for some other issue. The 12th century library is accessed from the upper cloister. It is a spacious room decorated to the taste of the 17th century. It is known that it kept around 4000 volumes, many of which are conserved in the public library of Soria. From the lower cloister you can reach the other cloister called de la Hospedería, a work of Herrerian style, built approximately around 1582. One of the sides had rooms for the pilgrims that they were going Way of St. James. The chapter house of this cloister is from the 12th century; it was known from old times with the name of stable of Alfonso VIII. Historians consider such a denomination to be a mistake, judging by its structure and ornamentation, but its fate is unknown. In the western wing were the lagar and the granary.

It is located northeast of Sömmerda and north of Erfurt, in the German state of Thuringia.Flugplatz Sömmerda-Dermsdorf at Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields in Europe It supports general aviation with no commercial airline service scheduled. History The airfield was built in 1934 as a military air base (Fliegerhorst) for the Luftwaffe and as a civilian \\"Air Office\\" (Luftzeugamt). The establishment of the airfield was a turning point for the town of Kölleda, which doubled in population as a result of the increase in employment after its opening in 1935. A railway connection was completed in 1936, along with the Fliegerhorts barracks. At the same time it was rebuilt into one of the largest Fliegerhorste in Germany. Over time 112 buildings were constructed. During World War II, Fliegerhorst Kölleda became an aircraft maintenance facility, servicing mainly Dornier aircraft, and was classified as \\"secret\\". It stocked many parts for several models of Dornier bombers, but it had no flying units assigned. It was a long time before the Allies recognised the airfield. The reason was astonishingly simple: the Germans had live sheep grazing its fields for camouflage, and it was usually covered in a haze because of its boggy subsoil. A fake airfield (a smaller, lit version of Kölleda) further distracted attention from the actual air field. The airfield used a large portion of forced labour from countries like Belgium, France, the Netherlands and the Soviet Union. It was finally located by Allied reconnaissance aircraft and on 4 July 1944 the airfield was finally bombed in 5 waves between 9 and 10am. Seven people died on the ground in the attack. The United States Army moved into the area in April 1945, and was converted by IX Engineering Command, Ninth Air Force into an Army Air Forces advanced Landing Ground, designated R-18. Air Force units used the airfield as a casualty evacuation and combat resupply airfield by the IX Air Service Command. After the German Capitulation on 8 May, it was abandoned. On 1 July the Americans turned over the field over to the Russians as part of the Soviet Occupation zone of Germany. The Soviets closed the airfield and it was dismantled. A smaller airfield was later established by the East German government (German Democratic Republic) at the site, and it was used as a gliderfield, until it was closed by the East German government in 1979/1980. The airfield was partially converted into a residential area, but other parts became commercial areas. The entrance to the former Luftwaffe Fliegerhorst is now a home for elderly people. A new flying club was established on the north side of the former airfield after the German reunification in 1990. It hosted the German Aerobatics championship in 1996. Today, it is mostly used for glider flying and parajumping from an Austrian Shorts Skyvan. A former East German Air Forces of the National People's Army MiG-21, along with three more East German National People's Army aircraft are on static display at the airfield. Johnson, David C.

She was in musical reality show Afghan Star, a television program similar to the Idol franchise. She is a member of the Hazara ethnic group of Afghanistan.  Personal life  Soroor was born in Iran into a religious family of refugees who left Afghanistan during the civil war, and lived there for 14 years. She and her family moved back to Afghanistan in 2005. During her high school years, Soroor worked as a news reporter for a local radio station in Kondoz, a city in the north of Afghanistan, and also for the Bakhtar news agency. At the same time, she taught literacy and maths to young girls and women from her neighborhood who were not allowed to attend school under Taliban law. As a young woman in Kondoz (at the time, the Taliban still had influence on people of the area), Soroor was not afraid to openly challenge conservative views and fight for a more equal society. She was labeled by locals as a political activist, meaning she and her family were forced to leave Kondoz after receiving death threats from fundamentalist groups.  Music career  After moving to Kabul with her family in 2007 Soroor began to develop her passion for music. She studied at music school where she specialized in traditional Afghan folk music whilst also studying western harmony, and started performing with Afghani group, Aryan. All this was done in secret without the consent or support of her family, who were against her performing as a professional musician. Upon finding out, they prevented her from singing for a year. Soroor's voice was discovered by the judges of the TV talent show Afghan Star in 2009, where she gained popularity nationally among Afghan communities around the world, being the first female Hazara singer to perform on national TV. Her first two original songs, \\"Abi Jan\\" and \\"Be Bahana\\" were released in 2009. In 2010 she recorded \\"Sangsar\\", a song which openly criticises the \\"stoning law\\" practiced by some Muslim communities. This led to fundamentalist groups attempting to assassinate her and members of her family on several occasions.

Forming part of the Kokoda Track campaign of the Second World War, the battle involved military forces from Australia, supported by the United States, fighting against Japanese troops from Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment who had landed around Buna and Gona in Papua mid-July 1942, with the intent of capturing Port Moresby to the south via the overland route. Several small engagements were fought north of Kokoda, before the village itself became the scene of heavy fighting as the Australian Maroubra Force fought to delay the Japanese advance throughout late July and into early August. After further fighting around Deniki, the Australians withdrew to Isurava, where the Militia soldiers of Maroubra Force were reinforced by two Second Australian Imperial Force battalions of the veteran 21st Infantry Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts. In what became the first major battle of the campaign, the two sides fought a heavy engagement around Isurava in late August, as four Australian infantry battalions attempted to fend off attacks by a similarly sized Japanese force. On the other side of Eora Creek, clashes were fought around Abuari, as a Japanese battalion attempted to outflank the Australians at Isurava from the west, and cut the track around Alola, while another Japanese battalion attempted to flank Isurava to the west. Subjected to a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment, and lacking their own with which to counter this indirect fire, the Australians defended for four days, before conducting a withdrawal in contact, falling back towards Templeton's Crossing, which was the scene of further fighting in early September 1942. In the years following the battle, the fighting around Isurava has come to form a key part of the Australian narrative of the campaign. The Japanese were victorious in capturing Isurava, but Australian accounts in the early years after the war characterised the battle as a successful delaying action by a heavily outnumbered force that inflicted more casualties than it sustained, highlighting the bravery of Australian troops in an epic and desperate action of national survival. In this regard, the Battle of Isurava has come to form a key part of the Anzac legend, although recent accounts have re-examined the battle. As the size of the Japanese force committed to the fighting has been re-evaluated, the magnitude of the Australian defensive feat has also been reinterpreted. Recent analysis, while acknowledging the individual bravery of both Australian and Japanese soldiers, highlights tactical deficiencies on both sides, and now characterises the battle as one in which Australian forces were able to withdraw largely due to tactical errors from the Japanese commanders. Background =Geography= alt=Map depicting the Japanese advance along the Kokoda Track The Kokoda Track stretches for a distance of north from Owers' Corner on the southern coastal plain to the east of Port Moresby to the village of Kokoda, passing through what was referred to during the early war years as \\"the Gap\\". Kokoda sits in the northern foothills of the steep and formidable Owen Stanley Range that dominates the central land mass, separating the northern coast from the southern. In 1942, the steep terrain offered considerable challenges to military operations, and both the Japanese and Allies misunderstood its nature at the time of the early fighting in New Guinea. To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts, it potentially offered a corridor from Buna through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources. The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to up and down over the full length of the track, markedly increasing the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around Myola. The vegetation is largely dense jungle and the climate mostly hot and humid, although the higher parts are cold. Around Kokoda and the northern beaches, as the terrain lowers towards sea level, it consists mainly of thick kunai grass and swamps. Warm and wet, the coastal area is highly malarial. Isurava sits in a clearing on the first main peak of the Owen Stanleys on the southern route from Kokoda as the track rises towards its highest peak at Mount Bellamy. It is positioned to the south of Deniki and the north of Alola on a north–south ridgeline. A rest house was positioned about to the south, with a view of the Eora Valley. To its east, the high ground falls steeply towards the fast-flowing Eora Creek which sits at the bottom of a deep ravine. Isurava lay on a spur that jagged west from the Isurava ridgeline towards Eora Creek, and was bounded to the north and south by two small tributaries that cut the track. To the west of Eora Creek on the other side of the steep ravine, opposite Isurava, was the village of Missima. It lay on the slope that rose towards the Abuari ridgeline, sitting astride a smaller parallel track that joined the main Kokoda Track after passing through Abuari and crossing Eora Creek via a log bridge near Alola. Overlooked by a ridge to the north, Isurava was ultimately unsuited to defensive operations. The ridge to its north offered the Japanese artillery, of which at that stage of the campaign they had a significant advantage, the ability to range their fire down on the Australian position. The track to the east of Eora Creek and the track junction around Alola offered the Japanese an easy avenue of advance around the flank towards the Australian rear. Nevertheless, it was chosen over the Isurava rest house position further south when the area was reconnoitred in mid-August by Major Allan Cameron, the brigade major of the 30th Infantry Brigade and temporary commander of the 39th Infantry Battalion. =Strategic situation= For both sides, Port Moresby was strategically important, offering a forward base from which to project further operations. Following the failure of a seaborne assault by the Japanese on Port Moresby resulting from the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942 and further losses during the Battle of Midway, it was planned to capture the town via an overland advance across the Owen Stanley Range along the Kokoda Track. On 21 July 1942, Japanese forces landed on the northern Papuan coast at Basbua, between Buna and Gona. The advanced landing forces, consisting primarily of the Colonel Yosuke Yokoyama's 15th Independent Engineer Regiment, sailed from Rabaul and came ashore unchallenged as there were only a small number of Australians stationed in the area. Shortly afterwards a small advanced element, supported by part of the 1st Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment, began moving south-west towards Oivi, mounted in motor vehicles and on bicycles. These troops were initially tasked with proving the route over the Owen Stanleys before the main body of the landing force, Major General Tomitaro Horii's South Seas Detachment, arrived. Papuan carriers evacuate Australian casualties on 30 August 1942 Following the landing, several minor skirmishes took place around Awala and Giruwa between the forward elements of the Japanese landing force – Yokoyama Force – and small groups of Australian and Papuan forces primarily from the Papuan Infantry Battalion (PIB). Brushing these aside, the Japanese began advancing steadily towards their objective on the southern coast. Meanwhile, the Australians, who had deployed only limited forces north of Port Moresby, attempted to delay the Japanese along the track long enough to bring reinforcements forward. The Australian reinforcement effort was hampered initially due to a shortage of essential combat supplies of food and ammunition in the forward areas, as well as limited port facilities, which slowed the transfer of the experienced Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) troops that had been withdrawn from the Middle East to Australia earlier in the year. As shipping and logistics resources became available in mid-August, the initial 2nd AIF troops moved to Port Moresby and Milne Bay, while US engineer and service units began arriving to conduct vital airfield and port development work, to help improve the effectiveness of Allied supply system. Nevertheless, a lack of supplies forward of Port Moresby continued to limit the ability of the Allies to concentrate troops along the Kokoda Track throughout much of the campaign, as the native carrier system was stretched and aerial resupply - a technique that was still developing - was less effective than initially envisaged. Shortly afterwards, a bridge at Wairopi was destroyed by the withdrawing PIB troops who had been reinforced by a platoon of Australians from the 39th Infantry Battalion. There was a brief fire-fight on 24 July, before the Japanese began forcing a crossing of the Kumusi River in rubber assault boats supported by mortars and machine gun fire. In the days that followed, skirmishes were fought around Gorari and at Oivi, before the Australians and Papuans were forced back to Deniki. From there, a small force was sent north to Kokoda, with the intent of holding the village and its logistically important airfield. Over the course of a fortnight, two important engagements were fought around Kokoda in late July and early August. This was followed by a short but sharp engagement around Deniki before the Australians withdrew towards Isurava on 14 August. In the short lull that followed, the Japanese began landing the main body of Horii's South Seas Detachment on the northern coast, while minor patrol actions resulted in several skirmishes north of Isurava. Elsewhere, on 7 August 1942, US forces carried out an amphibious landing on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, which caught the Japanese by surprise. To counter this, a large naval force was dispatched, as well as part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had been intended to join Horii's force but was diverted, as Japanese attention and resources turned towards the fighting against US forces in the Solomons. The engagements around Kokoda and the US landing at Guadalcanal caused General Harukichi Hyakutake, 17th Army commander in Rabaul, to re-consider the drive on Port Moresby. It was realised that more supplies would be needed and an amphibious landing around Milne Bay was planned for late August. By 16 August, the decision to capture Port Moresby was postponed until Milne Bay was captured and the situation on Guadalcanal was resolved. Consequently, on 28 August Horii's South Sea Detachment was ordered to position itself at a suitable location south of the Owen Stanleys to capture Port Moresby once the strategic situation elsewhere had been resolved in Japan's favour. =Opposing forces= alt=A map, orientated to the north-east, depicting the Kokoda Track as it stretches from the southern coast to the northern. On 17 August, at Isurava, Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner took command of the 39th Infantry Battalion, replacing its previous commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, who had been killed in the fighting around Kokoda. The Militia soldiers of Maroubra Force were later reinforced by two 2nd AIF battalions from the 21st Infantry Brigade – the 2/14th and 2/16th Infantry Battalions – under Brigadier Arnold Potts. The 21st Infantry Brigade was a veteran formation, having fought in the Middle East earlier in the war, but was yet to be tested in jungle conditions. Despite the urgency of the situation, the two 2nd AIF battalions did not deploy forward of Myola immediately due to the supply situation, and would not reach Isurava until after the battle had commenced. Upon arrival at the forward Australian positions on 20 August, Potts was ordered to retake Kokoda. However, as the size of the Japanese force - roughly equal to that of the Australians - and the extent of their own supply problems became apparent to the Australian high command, an attack was ruled out. Potts' orders were therefore changed on 29 August to mounting a stand around Isurava, in an effort to block the Japanese advance into the Owen Stanleys on their way towards Port Moresby. In total, the Australians had about 2,292 personnel including those from the 53rd Infantry Battalion, positioned further back from Isurava, as well as support units including the 14th and 2/6th Field Ambulances, the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the PIB. These troops were beginning to experience the strain of the jungle warfare: limited rations, inadequate personal equipment, harsh conditions and physical exertion were all beginning to sap their strength and instances of disease were beginning to decrease their effectiveness in the harsh terrain they were being asked to defend. At this stage the Australians' limited artillery resources were concentrated around Port Moresby, and due to difficulties in moving the guns forward along the track, the Australian defenders were without artillery support. Instead, the Australians had one 3-inch mortar, which was brought up to Isurava by the 2/14th Battalion part way through the battle after it was airdropped at Myola on 27 August. Against this, the Japanese force, commanded personally by Horii, was built around a core of four infantry battalions. Three of these were drawn from the 144th Infantry Regiment, which had been fighting since the start of the campaign, and one was part of the 41st Infantry Regiment, which had arrived to reinforce the 144th. These troops were supported by an engineer regiment and a mountain artillery battalion, with a total of six artillery pieces: two 75 mm guns, two 37 mm pieces and two mountain guns, although these were not all available at the start of the battle. According to Dudley McCarthy, author of the Australian official history, the Japanese force in the Isurava area was around 5,000 strong. More conservative estimates, however, place this figure at around 3,000, or 3,500. Of these, only 2,130 were ultimately directly engaged in the battle. The main body of this force had landed at Giruawa between 19 and 21 August, and had been forced to make a trek south on foot, carrying heavier than normal loads to alleviate the supply problems that the Japanese were beginning to experience as their line of communication was pushed further south. As a result of the heat, heavy loads and distance, a large number of troops, and several artillery pieces, failed to reach Isurava in time for the battle, reducing the size of the Japanese force available for the attack. Horii's plan involved a double envelopment. For the assault, Horii planned to use the three battalions of the 144th while the single battalion from the 41st Infantry Regiment remained in reserve. The reserve was intended to be used later to follow up the withdrawing Australians but it was ultimately committed to an unsuccessful flanking manoeuvre during the final stages of the battle. The Australians were also experiencing their own supply problems. To enable them to mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by the creation of a supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as adequate supplies could be brought forward to sustain them. Battle =Japanese assault= alt=Map of the movements during the battle as described in the text The initial Australian dispositions around Isurava saw the depleted 39th spread out in five entrenched company areas astride the track in between the northern and southern creeks that flowed into Eora Creek. Having left most of their entrenching equipment behind during the withdrawal from Deniki, the troops from the 39th had to dig-in with whatever they had at hand including steel helmets and bayonets. Their positions were constructed amidst an area of long grass, behind an abandoned garden, which offered good observation of the track heading towards Deniki. The 53rd Infantry Battalion was positioned further back at Alola, co-located with Potts' headquarters. A forward observation post had also been established on the Isurava ridgeline. The Australians maintained a patrol presence forward of their occupied areas. Throughout 24 and 25 August, as the Japanese force began pressing forward, patrols from the 53rd Infantry Battalion clashed with groups of Japanese in front of Isurava, and on the other side of Eora Creek around Missima. Potts, realising that Horii had launched a major attack, decided to deploy the 2/14th under Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key to Isurava, using the 39th to screen their movement. The 2/16th, under Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, was brought forward to Alola, where it would be held in reserve. By the time the 2/14th Battalion had deployed, the Japanese were able to field a force of between 3,000 and 5,000. On 26 August, Horii moved the first of his disembarking troops forward, a body of some 3,500 soldiers, against the 39th Infantry Battalion, some 400-strong. Around midday, the attack began in earnest, with Australian positions around Isurava being subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. The Japanese tactics were to pin the Australians in place with frontal attacks while feeling for the flanks, with a view to cutting them off with forces from the rear. Lieutenant Colonel Hatsuo Tsukamoto's 1/144th was given the task of leading the assault, even though they had been in combat almost continuously since the initial Japanese landing in mid-July. Meanwhile, Major Tadashi Horie's 2/144th was allocated to the eastern side of Eora Creek where Japanese reconnaissance had revealed the parallel track bypassing Isurava. The battalion was tasked with seizing Missima and Abuari and threatening the Australian rear around Alola. The 3/144th, under Lieutenant Colonel Genichiro Kuwada, was to conduct a flanking move to the west against the Australian left. The Japanese force made contact with the outer positions of Maroubra Force, focusing upon the observation posts that had been laid down either side of the Eora Creek gorge. Along the Isurava ridgeline, these attacks were held off by the 39th. However, around Missima along the alternate route, which had been held by the 53rd, the Australian position was destroyed and the village taken, opening the route to the Australian rear. In response, the 53rd's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Ward, dispatched a company from Alola forward to Abuari, to shore up the position there. Potts also requested reinforcements in the form of the 2/27th Infantry Battalion, which was being held in reserve around Port Moresby. The request was denied, though, due to concerns about the position around Milne Bay. Although some measure of defence was mounted by the 53rd, which dispatched another company after the first failed to report in, the situation grew worse for the Australians. Conflicting information was sent back from the 53rd's forward positions, confusing Potts' headquarters and rendering co-ordinated action impossible. To make matters worse for them, the Japanese ambushed and killed several of the 53rd's senior officers, including Ward. As the 53rd's position disintegrated the Japanese also faltered, failing to exploit the opportunity to roll up the Australian position all the way to Alola. Horie's 2/144th was stalled into inaction by fatigue, and hesitation, caused by the defence previously mounted by the 53rd. The Japanese battalion commander was convinced that the route was more heavily defended than it actually was. While the Japanese failed to exploit the situation, the 2/16th was tasked with restoring the position around Abuari, reinforcing the 53rd as the Japanese began threatening the Eora Creek crossing. Meanwhile, the outpost on the left around the Isurava ridgeline held on throughout 27 August, but as the Japanese began bypassing the position, the order was given to withdraw across the ridgeline to the west. After this, frontal attacks against the dug-in defenders in the main defensive position began, representing the start of what would be four days of violent attacks. The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions as best they could, firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical exertion sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, the assault on the 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden. The 2/14th Battalion had been dispatched from Myola on foot on 25 August, with orders to relieve the 39th. A company reached their position at Isurava in the middle of the afternoon on 26 August, while others deployed to Alola and Templeton's Crossing. However, the 39th was forced to remain in location while the 2/14th's companies moved into position one by one, as several times the Japanese threatened to break through the perimeter. It was not until last light on 27 August that the 39th moved into a reserve location to the rear of Isurava. Throughout the day, heavy close quarters fighting had taken place around Isurava, while on the right flank hand-to-hand fighting had seen both the Australians and Japanese assume cautious defensive postures. Probing attacks continued around Isurava that night as the Japanese sought to test the Australian defences for weaknesses amidst a heavy torrential downpour. On 28 August, the fighting continued along the front of the Australian position and on both flanks. Starting as a probing attack around dawn, there was a brief breakthrough in the afternoon, but the Japanese gains were negated by a swift counter-attack. The Japanese commander – realising that the Australians had brought up reinforcements – decided to commit his reserves to the battle. The slowness with which the 1/144th attacked caused Horii concern, and a company from the 3/144th was sent to re-invigorate its attack. The remainder was ordered to proceed to the west to attempt to outflank the main defensive position around Isurava. As the 1/144th enveloped the front of the Australian position, the 3/144th attempted an attack from the west, but it became lost. Frustrated by the lack of progress, Horii decided to commit the 2/41st, under Major Mitsuo Koiwai, with the aim of conducting a wide arc to the west and emerging on the track to the south of Alola. They too eventually became lost, and in fact did not regain contact with the main Japanese force until after the battle, without firing a single shot. The following day, 29 August, the Japanese renewed their attack. In possession of the ridges that dominated the Australian position from both sides of the valley in which it sat, the Japanese were able to lay down considerable volumes of mortar and machine gun fire in support of their assaults. Unable to respond with similar firepower, the Australian perimeter began to shrink. It was during this stage of the fighting that Private Bruce Kingsbury of the 2/14th made a unique individual contribution to the campaign and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result. Kingsbury's was the first Victoria Cross awarded for actions on Australian soil. =Australian withdrawal= Although the Australian positions on the eastern track held, the position around Isurava grew untenable and the 2/14th's commanding officer, Key, requested permission to withdraw to the Isurava rest house, about back along the track. This request was granted and the withdrawal was completed by early morning of 30 August. The defenders then dug in around the new location. As the Japanese brought up more artillery and began a heavy bombardment of the Isurava rest house, the 1/144th established itself around Isurava and began firing on the new Australian position. Meanwhile, the 3/144th emerged from the thick scrub and stumbled upon the Australian flank and rear. Hand-to-hand and close quarters fighting ensued. As Australian casualties mounted and ammunition ran low, the Japanese also came close to making a breakthrough on the alternative track. Horii had now deployed several companies on the flanks and near the rear of the 2/14th and 39th Battalions, threatening the Australian positions with encirclement. Consequently, late on 30 August, Potts decided that if he remained in location his command would be destroyed, and so he ordered a withdrawal south of Alola towards Eora village. The 39th and 2/14th Infantry Battalions withdrew south along the track on the western side of Eora Creek, passing through the 53rd which was holding Alola. The 2/16th withdrew south from Abuari along the eastern side of Eora Creek. Withdrawing in contact, several groups of Australians – including the 2/14th's headquarters company – found themselves isolated from the main body of Maroubra Force. In the confusion, an Australian counter-attack against the 3/144th caught a group of their own troops in a fierce crossfire. Although the counter-attack was ultimately successful in breaking through the Japanese blocking force, it also forced a large group of Australians off the track. Over several days large numbers trekked through the jungle in an effort to rejoin their units. Several were captured by the Japanese in the days that followed, including Key, who was executed by the Japanese after interrogation. Aftermath =Subsequent operations= In aftermath of the battle, as the Australians withdrew towards Eora Creek the Japanese pushed over the crest of the ridge south of the Isurava rest house and then occupied Alola. There they secured a large amount of small arms ammunition and grenades, as well as rations which were eagerly consumed by the troops who were now beginning to feel the effects of hunger as a result of an already strained supply line. On 28 August, Horii had received orders to secure an advanced position south of the Owen Stanleys, but to keep the majority of his force to the north while the situation around Guadalcanal was resolved. After the fighting around Isurava he pushed only part of his force - about 3,500 men - forward, and tasked the 41st Infantry Regiment with the pursuit of the Australians. In the days that followed the Australian withdrawal from Isurava, a \\"week-long fighting withdrawal\\" took place. Further actions were fought around Templeton's Crossing and Efogi in the early days of September, as the Australian resistance along the track began to stiffen and become more organised. In the aftermath, Potts relieved the exhausted 39th and 53rd Battalions; they were ordered to make their way back to Myola and then later to Port Moresby, while the 2/27th was deployed forward. It joined up with the rest of the 21st Infantry Brigade in time for the fighting around Efogi. The 53rd, whose performance was widely derided by Allied commanders, was amalgamated with the 55th and together with the 39th would later see heavy fighting around Gona and Sanananda. Soldiers of the Australian 39th Battalion in September 1942 Elsewhere, while the Japanese and Australians were fighting around Isurava, the Japanese launched an amphibious landing around Milne Bay as part of a further seaborne attempt to support the overland drive on Port Moresby. Over the course of a fortnight, the Japanese landing was repulsed in an action that came to be seen as first \\"full-scale defeat [of the Japanese] on land\\". The effect of the defeat around Milne Bay and fighting at Guadalcanal was felt by the Japanese on the Kokoda Track. An order to assume defensive operations and to withdraw towards Kokoda was sent to Horii on 8 September. The situation on Guadalcanal worsened for the Japanese and further resources and manpower were diverted to that effort instead. The Japanese supply line along the Kokoda Track was stretched thin by this time. Rations were running low, and the Japanese troops in the forward areas were tired and hungry. Nevertheless, in early September Horii continued his advance south with a further action being fought around Ioribaiwa, around from Port Moresby. From there the Australians withdrew to their final defensive line around Imita Ridge. But there was no climactic battle at Imita Ridge, as Horii finally cancelled his offensive on 14 September and began withdrawing north to shorten his line of communication and bring supplies forward for his troops to regain their strength. On 23 September, the Japanese 17th Army ordered the withdrawal of part of Horii's force back to the beachheads around Buna. Five days later, the Australians began tentative moves forward of Imita Ridge. Finding Ioribaiwa abandoned, they began their pursuit of the Japanese that were withdrawing north. Further actions were fought at Templeton's Crossing and around Oivi and Gorari throughout October, with the latter concluding on 11 November. The Japanese withdrew across the Kumusi River to their beachheads around Buna and Gona, which was the scene of heavy fighting in late 1942 and early 1943. In crossing the Kumusi, they were to lose most of their artillery. =Analysis= Casualties during the fighting around Isurava have been variously reported. In the immediate post war era, Australian sources tended to report a ratio of around five Japanese killed for every one Australian, with the Australians estimating that they had killed around 700 Japanese; however, in recent times this has been revised. The Japanese also initially over-estimated the casualties they inflicted on the Australians, claiming 1,000 killed, before reducing this to 300. It is now thought that the casualties were more even, although still favouring the Australians. For the Australians, casualties are now reported as 99 killed and 111 wounded while the Japanese are thought to have lost 140 killed and 231 wounded. For the Australians, the Battle of Isurava has sometimes been described as \\"Australia's Thermopylae\\". The battle has come to form a key part of the Anzac legend with Kingsbury's actions, as well as numerous other acts of bravery from both Japanese and Australian troops, being highlighted in various accounts of the fighting which have been characterised as part of an epic battle of national survival. In the early post-war years, the efforts of the Australian force in holding up the Japanese for a period of four days were seen as representing a significant feat of arms, fought against a greatly superior force on which the Australians inflicted heavy casualties in a tactically successfully action which delayed the Japanese and allowed the Australians time with which to bring up further reinforcements. While elements of this narrative continue to resonate, recently the magnitude of Japanese losses has been re-evaluated and this analysis has been called into question. As wider strategic goals of the Japanese have been re-cast, and the number of Japanese engaged in the battle has been found to be significantly less than the Australians had thought at the time, the performance of the Australian defenders, and the decisions of their commanders, have also been re-evaluated. Indeed, author Peter Williams, as part of his thesis about the myths of the Kokoda Track campaign, has described the battle as a \\"defeat with few redeeming features\\", going on to state that \\"Horii defeated Maroubra Force but failed to destroy it\\". While the Australians were able to successfully withdraw from their position in contact, the action was tarnished by a degree of disorganisation and disarray which characterised their withdrawal to Eora Creek. This ultimately led to several groups being captured and eventually executed by the Japanese. A large amount of materiel was also lost in the withdrawal, with 26,500 rounds and 500 grenades being abandoned around Alola. Despite this, Potts' handling of the withdrawal has tended to be viewed relatively uncritically in the narrative of the battle provided in most postwar accounts. Williams, however, argues that rather than skilful handling by Potts, the vital factor in allowing the Australians to live to fight another day was in fact Horii's own mistakes, as well as tactical errors by the Japanese battalion commanders on the ground. On the other hand, Japanese author Kengoro Tanaka draws the opposite conclusion, highlighting the stubborn defence put up by the Australian troops on the ground, and the heavy casualties inflicted on the attackers, as being key factors. He goes on to state that against this the Japanese force only \\"narrowly captured\\" Isurava. The Japanese commander had hoped to decisively engage the Australians in order to open the way to Port Moresby. The withdrawal of Maroubra Force thus dented Japanese hopes of a quick advance and the consequent delays caused by the stiffening Australian resistance increasingly damaged Japanese chances of securing the port before significant numbers of Australian reinforcements began arriving and events on Guadalcanal and elsewhere impacted upon the campaign. After the war, a battle honour was awarded to Australian units for their involvement in the fighting around Isurava during late August. This was awarded to the 39th, 2/14th and 2/16th Infantry Battalions. The 53rd did not receive this, or any battle honour for the fighting during the Kokoda Track campaign.

Swinging arms in an opposing direction with respect to the lower limb reduces the angular momentum of the body, balancing the rotational motion produced during walking. Although such pendulum-like motion of arms is not essential for walking, recent studies point that arm swing improves the stability and energy efficiency in human locomotion. Those positive effects of arm swing have been utilized in sports, especially in racewalking and sprinting. Kinematics Studies on the role of arm swing consist mainly of analysis of bipedal walking modelsF. C. Anderson, M. G. Pandy (2003). Dynamic Optimization of Human Walking. Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, 123, 381–390. and treadmill experiments on human subjects. Bipedal walking models of various complexity levels provided an explanation for the effects of arm swing on human locomotion. On the course of bipedal walking, the leg swing results in an angular momentum that is balanced by the ground reaction moments on the stance foot. Swinging arms create an angular momentum in the opposing direction of lower limb rotation, reducing the total angular momentum of the body. Lower angular momentum of the body results in a decline on the ground reaction moment on the stance foot.J. Park (2008). Synthesis of natural arm swing motion in human bipedal walking. Journal of Biomechanics , 41, 1417–1426. Amplitude or frequency of arm movements is determined by the gait, meaning that the swing motion is adaptive to changing conditions and perturbations.S. F. Donker, Th. Mulder, B. Nienhuis, J. Duysens (2002). Adaptations in arm movements for added mass to wrist or ankle during walking. Experimental Brain Research, 146(1), 26–31. As the walking speed increases, the amplitude of the arm swing increases accordingly. The frequency of the arm movements changes with the speed as well. Studies showed that at speeds lower than approximately 0.8 m/s, the frequency ratio between arm and leg movements is 2:1 whereas above that speed the ratio becomes 1:1.M. P. Ford, R. C. Wagenaar, K. M. Newell (2007). Arm constraint and walking in healthy adults. Gait & Posture, 26, 135–141. Theories =Stability= Both simulations on skeletal models and experiments on force plate agree that the free arm swing limits the ground reaction moments effective on the stance foot during walking, because the total angular momentum is lowered by the counterbalancing swing of arms with respect to the lower-limb.Yu Li, W. Wang, R. H. Crompton, M. M. Gunther (2001). Free vertical moments and transverse forces in human walking and their role in relation to arm-swing. The Journal of Experimental Biology, 204, 47–58. In other words, a subject exerts less reaction moment to the ground surface when there is arm swing. This implies that the friction force between the stance foot and the ground surface does not have to be as high as without the arm swing. =Energy efficiency= Whether arm swing is a passive, natural motion caused by the rotation of torso or is an active motion that requires active muscle work has been a critical discussion on arm swing that could illuminate its benefit and function. A recent study concentrated on the energy consumption during walking showed that at low speeds arm swing is a passive motion dictated by the kinematics of torso, no different from a pair of pendula hung from the shoulders. Active upper extremity muscle work, controlled by the brain, only takes part when there is a perturbation and restores that natural motion. However, at higher speeds, the passive motion is insufficient to explain the amplitude of the swing observed in the experiments. The contribution of active muscle work increases with the walking speed. Despite the fact that a certain amount of energy is consumed for the arm movements, the total energy consumption drops meaning that arm swing still reduces the cost of walking. That reduction in the energy is up to 12 percent at certain walking speeds, a significant saving.S. H. Collins, P. G. Adamczyk, A. D. Kuo (2009). Dynamic arm swinging in human walking. Proceedings of the Royal Society, Biological Sciences , 276, 3679–3688. =Evolution= The inter-limb coordination in human locomotion, questioning whether the human gait is based on quadruped locomotion, is another major topic of interest. A recent research indicates that inter-limb coordination during human locomotion is organized in a similar way to that in the cat, promoting the view that the arm swing may be a residual function from quadruped gait.V. Dietz (2002). Do human bipeds use quadrupedal coordination? Trends in Neurosciences, 25, No. 9, 462–467. Another work on the control mechanisms of arm movements during walking corroborated the former findings, showing that central pattern generator (CPG) might be involved in cyclic arm swing. However, these findings do not imply vestigiality of arm swing, which appears to be debateful after the 2003 evidences on the function of arm swing in bipedal locomotion.E. P. Zehr, C. Haridas (2003). Modulation of cutaneous reflexes in arm muscles during walking: further evidence of similar control mechanisms for rhythmic human arm and leg movements. Experimental Brain Research, 149, 260–266. Athletic performance 2007 Military World Games competition in Hyderabad, India Energy efficiency of arm swing and its potential in adjusting the momentum of the body have been utilized in sports. Sprinters make use of the contribution of arm swing on the linear momentum in order to get a higher forward acceleration. Racewalkers are also utilizing the arm swing for its energy efficiency. Rather than the rhythmic movements during walking, swinging arms in the right way helps athletic performance in different disciplines. Standing long jump performance is shown to be improved by swinging arms forward during the onset of the jump and back-and-forth during landing since the linear momentum of the body can be adjusted with the help of moving arms.B. M. Ashby, J. H. Heegard (2002). Role of arm motion in the standing long jump. Journal of Biomechanics , 35, 1631–1637. Use of arms in adjusting the rotational and linear momentum is also a common practice in somersaulting and gymnastics.K. B. Cheng, M. Hubbard (2008). Role of arms in somersaulting from compliant surfaces: A simulation study of springboard standing dives. Human Movement Science, 27, 80–95. Robotics The literature on the arm swing is partly created by robotics researchers as the stability in locomotion is a significant challenge especially in humanoid robots. So far although many humanoid robots preserve static equilibrium during walking which does not require arm swing, arm movements has been added to a recent humanoid robot walking in dynamic equilibrium.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mclbVTIYG8E The pendulum-like motion of arms is also utilized in passive dynamic walkers, a mechanism that can walk on its own.S. Collins, A. Ruina, R. Tedrake, M. Wisse (2005). Efficient Bipedal Robots Based on Passive-Dynamic Walkers. \\"Science\\", 307, 1082. Neuromechanical considerations Understanding the underlying neural mechanisms on the organization of rhythmic arm movement and its coordination with the lower limb could enable development of effective strategies for rehabilitation of spinal cord injury and stroke patients. Rhythmic arm movements for different tasks -arm swing during walking, cycling arms while standing and arm swing while standing- were investigated in this perspective and the results pointed a common central control mechanism.M. D. Klimstra, E. Thomas, R. H. Stoloff, D. P. Ferris, E. P. Zehr (2009). Neuromechanical considerations for incorporating rhythmic arm movement in the rehabilitation of walking. Chaos, 139. Performing the left-lateralised Stroop task while walking on a treadmill tends to reduce arm swing on the right, particularly in older people, suggesting a significant supraspinal contribution to its maintenance.Killeen T, Easthope CS, Filli L et al (2017). Increasing cognitive load attenuates right arm swing in healthy human walking, http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/1/160993. While men of all ages demonstrate this interference effect between cognitive load and right arm swing, women appear to be resistant until the age of 60. Medical science The role of arm movements in unhealthy subjects is another popular direction investigating the strategies adopted by patients in order to maintain stability in walking. As an example, children with hemiparetic CP showed substantial increases in angular momentum generated by the legs, which were compensated by increased angular momentum of the unaffected arm showing the way arm swing is utilized in order to balance the rotational motion of the body.S. M. Bruijn, P. Meyns, I. Jonkers, D. Kaat, J. Duysens (2011). Control of angular momentum during walking in children with cerebral palsy. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 32, 2860–2866. Reduction in bilateral arm coordination may contribute to clinically observed asymmetry in arm swing behavior which could be a sign of Parkinson's disease.X. Huang, J. M. Mahoney, M. M. Lewis, G.

The location was a used as a cemetery and several unique and rare items were found interred with the burials. Site description The Emmons cemetery site is located on the top and along the slope of a section of bluff on the western bank of the Illinois River. At the time of its discovery it was owned by Merrill Emmons of Astoria, Illinois, who undertook extensive excavations of the site. The burials were in several small burial mounds located on the lower slope. The cemetery area measures about square. Eighty three burials were found at the site, most in an extended position and oriented on a north to south axis with their heads to the south, although a few were oriented east to west. Five of the burials were flexed, one was semi-flexed and one was a bundle burial. The burials contained many grave goods, including fifty five examples of Mississippian culture pottery (including some imported exotic varieties), stone ear plugs, copper and copper covered objects, marine shell objects and pearl beads. It is considered a rather rich collection of grave goods by the standards of other local sites. The site is possibly associated with two nearby village and platform mound sites, Rose Mounds and the Fiedler Site. Artifacts A variety of grave goods were found at the site, including several rare or unique objects. One such object is a type of ear decoration carved from marine shell and known as a long-nosed god maskette. Only a few of these objects have ever been found, although Illinois has had more finds than any other area. Many archaeologists now associate these items with Mississippian culture political adoption rituals and with the mythological being Red Horn from the stories of the Ho-Chunk and other plains Siouan peoples. A large collection of Mill Creek chert stone tools were also found at the site. Several exotic pottery samples were found with the burials. These include several examples of owl effigy stirrup necked and hooded bottles and a partial set of conjoined bottles, all thought to have come from or been inspired by ceramics from the Central Mississippi Valley area. One child burial had parts of two owl wings adding up to a complete right carpometacarpus of a Snowy owl placed beside the arms of the child when the body was interred. The wings had probably been used as fans or for some type of decoration. Similar bird wing burials have been found at sites in Arkansas and other states. =Emmons mask= Emmons mask, left side reconstructed Head of Malden A, showing headdress Another rare object from the site is the Emmons mask, a fairly unusual piece of carved red cedar believed to have been deposited in the grave sometime between 1200–1400 CE. The piece measures by by and was once adorned with sheet copper and paint made from galena, a lead ore. It is shaped like a human face with a crenelated crown-like decoration on its forehead. The paint encircles the eyes and forms two points down on the cheeks, making the forked eye motif, a design imitating the markings of the peregrine falcon and associated with the Chiefly Warrior Cult of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. The piece resembles the small human face that makes up part of the headdress of Malden plate A, an anthropomorphic avian themed Mississippian copper plate found in southeastern Missouri. This copper plate has a birds body but a human head wearing an elaborate headdress which includes what may be feathers and a smaller human face with the distinctive crenelated crown-like structure and a forked eye surround. Archaeologists believe the Emmons mask may in fact be part of such a headdress, and it has holes that would have allowed it to have been attached in such a fashion. A similar piece (including the crenelations) was found at the Etowah site in Georgia, but it is described as a \\"rattle\\" and it slightly more resembles the severed heads held by figures on the Rogan plates found at the site by John P. Rogan in the 1880s. A large cache of carved cedar heads was also found in the \\"Great Mortuary\\" at Spiro in Oklahoma, although these lack the distinctive crenelations and some of these vary in size enough that some of them may actually be wooden versions of long-nosed god maskette ear decorations. At least three shell engravings from Spiro represent figures wearing similar heads as part of headdresses in the fashion of the figure on Malden plate A. None of the three uses is considered to have been the exclusive use for the objects and the objects may have been used for more than one of these three theories.

He ran for parliamentary election in all four of Bergen county's constituencies at the time—Kalfaret, Nordnes, Sandviken and Nygaard—and served two terms as an MP (1900–1903 and 1916–1918). He ran a company with his brother-in-law, was a stock exchange commissary, and from 1932 to 1938 he was the Chancellor of the Order Council. Career He was born in Bergen as a son of merchant Hans Schultz Blydt (1830–1916) and Maren Breder Hagelsteen (1834–1870). He finished Bergen Commerce School before taking education in France, England and Belgium between 1886 and 1889. He took over his father's company which traded in fishing and angling tools in 1891, and ran it together with his brother-in-law Hjalmar Grung as Blydt & Grung. He retired in 1929. From 1912 he was also a commissary for Bergen Stock Exchange. He was a member of Bergen city council, and was first elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1899 from the plural-member constituency Bergen. In the 1906 he ran in the single-member constituency Kalfaret, and was elected deputy as the running mate of Johan Ludwig Mowinckel. The race was unusually close, with Mowinckel/Blydt edging out Lothe/Hanssen of the Coalition Party with 932 against 914 votes. In 1909 Blydt ran in Nordnes, but finished third behind Konow and Hopp. In 1912 Blydt ran in Sandviken, and finished second behind Labour's Lars Sæbø. In the 1915 parliamentary election, Blydt ran in the last of Bergen's four constituencies, Nygaard, in the first round. He finished second (with 2,446 votes) behind Labour's S. K. Tjønneland (2,563 votes) but ahead of Conservative Henrik Ameln (2,056 votes). A runoff vote had to be held. However, both Blydt and Tjønneland were pulled from the race. The reason was that Blydt had run in Sandviken as well, and though finishing second behind Lars Sæbø again, he managed to reach the runoff here. In this runoff, Blydt won the seat with 3,836 votes against Sæbø's 3,429. He thus served a second term as an MP, and like fifteen years prior, he was a member of the Standing Committee on Trade. Particularly during the First World War he was a member of numerous committees that sprang up as the state needed more control over enterprise. He chaired one of these committees, the Coal Provisioning Committee of 1917. He chaired Bergen Commercial Association for five years, and Bergen Chamber of Commerce from 1915 to 1926. Nationally, he was a board member of Den Norske Handelsstands Fællesforening from 1909 to 1916, and he was also a council member of the International Chamber of Commerce. He was a board member of Bergens Kreditbank (1906–1922), Fiskeribanken (1921–1936), Norges Oplysningskontor for Næringsveiene and the Norwegian America Line. He was a council member of the Chr. Michelsen Institute and a supervisory committee member of the Bergen Line. In culture, he was a board member of Den Nationale Scene from 1913 to 1931, chairing it for the last two years. He was a member of the Order Council, which rewards the Order of St. Olav, from 1925, and served as vice chancellor in 1931 and chancellor from 1932 to his death in 1938.

Traveler curtains remain at a fixed elevation and open and close horizontally, break up and meet in the middle, and consequently require a minimum of fly space. The curtains are typically made of velvet and decorated with a series of vertical box pleats along the top edge. Traveler curtains may be rigged with or without an operating line. When rigged with an operating line, they may be motorized or operated manually. They are referred to as walk-draw or walk-along curtains when rigged without an operating line. When opened and closed manually with an operating line, they are called manual curtains. They are the least costly kind of theater curtain to construct and relatively simple to operate. Construction A diagram of the machinery that holds up a traveler front curtain. A.) Grooved metal channel; B.) Carrier; C.) Axle; D.) Wheels; E.) Eyelet; F.) Eye of Carrier G.) Trim chain. Traveler curtains are suspended on a series of short chains called trim chains. Each trim chain hangs from a wheeled assembly called a roller or carrier that is supported by and rolls along the inside of a horizontal metal channel or track.The carriers may consist of wheels secured around an I-beam rather than inside a channel. A heavy duty master carrier supports the moving edge of the curtain. The master carrier has four wheels, while all other carriers have only two wheels. A device called an end stop prevents the master carrier from being pulled out of its channel. Directly below each carrier and above the chain is an eyelet through which the curtain operating line passes, if present. The operating line runs through two pulleys that are located near the tops of the curtains, one on each side of the stage (the dead end and live end pulleys), and then down to the stage floor, where it runs through a tension pulley before returning to the other pulleys in the fly space. Operation Travelers are operated by pulling down on the rope segments that ascend from the tension pulley. One rope segment is pulled to open the curtains and the other is pulled to close the curtains. Pulling down on the opener rope segment causes the master carriers, and the moving edges of the curtains they support, to travel toward the edges of the stage. As each master carrier travels through the channel, it collides with and collects the other carriers one-by- one. This growing group of carriers is pushed toward the edges of the stage, causing the fabric to bunch near the curtain's moving edge. Pulling on the other rope segment causes each master carrier to travel toward center stage along with the curtain's moving edge. As the curtain becomes unbunched, fabric tension is created that pulls the other carriers through the channel. Variations Traveler curtains opening and closing with backpack guides Traveler curtains may optionally be rigged with devices called backpack guides, which force the carriers to bundle the curtain off-stage rather than onstage. This causes the visible part of the curtain to remain unbunched so that it appears to be flat while it is being opened or closed. The opening and closing of a guillotine curtain Traveler style curtains can also be raised and lowered by a fly system, in which case they are referred to as fly curtains or, less frequently, guillotine curtains because they rise and fall much like a guillotine. When operated in this manner, they require at least as much fly space above them as the height of the curtain itself, but they allow a production to reveal or conceal the stage extremely quickly.

It was rejected in a constitutional referendum in 1998. Background The initiative followed a successful, less controversial initiative (the Beobachter Initiative) in 1992, which placed stricter control on biotechnology in human reproductive medicine. The referendum was defeated with 1,250,000 (66.7%) against, and 625000 (33.3%) in favour; the turnout was 41%. The initiative was strongly opposed by Swiss scientists and pharmaceutical companies. In May 1998, 3,000 opponents of the initiative, including scientists and others, attended a protest march in Zurich. Four of Switzerland's five Nobel laureates held a press conference to express their opposition to the referendum. According to Heidi Diggelmann, head of the Swiss National Science Foundation's Research Council, \\"Scientists made a difference in this campaign by getting out of their labs and establishing a dialogue with the Swiss people. We now want to continue improving that relationship between Swiss science and society\\". Jakob Nuesch, former president of the Federal Institute of Technology, said that a yes vote would have put the research base of Switzerland under threat, and that: \\"research in plant genetics, including the modern seed industry, could be killed off\\". Prior to the vote, the Swiss government tried to strengthen the pre-existing rules on genetic engineering in an attempt to pre-empt the vote. The beginnings of the movement to have a referendum on the issue were in autumn 1994, when a working group was set up which started to collect signatures for an initiative. 17 months later, over 110,000 signatures were collected, exceeding the requirement that 100,000 signatures must be collected within 18 months for an initiative to be valid. The initiative was supported by a number of organizations, including Physicians Against Animal Experimentation, Greenpeace Switzerland, and the World Wildlife Fund Switzerland. The referendum was scheduled for June 6 and 7, 1998, and campaigning started in 1996. Early in 1996, an opinion poll was conducted on the public's support for gene technology, of those who expressed an opinion, over 70% rejected the technology. Campaign In April 1996, on the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, the campaign in favour of the initiative ran newspaper advertisements comparing nuclear technology with gene technology. According to Gottfried Schatz, scientists participating in television debates \\"often left a poor image because they participated without sufficient preparation\\". Pharmaceutical companies established GenSuisse, a public opinion group which ran poster advertisements against the initiative, including posters that displayed sick children. Newspapers based in Basel, which is the centre of the biomedical research community, opposed the initiative, with some other media, according to Schatz: \\"pandered openly to public fears, sometimes stooping to grotesque distortions\\". While the 1996 poll revealed strong opposition to gene technology, another poll published two years later revealed that almost half of Swiss citizens still opposed gene technology, the majority of those who expressed an opinion. The alarm caused by these figures resulted in demonstrations in several Swiss cities by scientists and physicians on 28 April 1998. The dispute between proponents and opponents of the initiative became bitter in the month leading up to the referendum. On the days leading up to voting day, there was a sudden shift in public opinion in opposition to the initiative. Result In order for the initiative to be passed into the constitution, the majority of the voters, and the majority of cantons would have to support it. In the event, 66.67% of voters opposed the initiative, and not one canton supported it. While no canton supported the initiative, there was a disparity between French-speaking cantons and German-speaking ones. There was also a disparity between male and female voters, with men being more likely to oppose the initiative.

Structurally unsound and at risk of being demolished or simply collapsing for many years, their name is now an unwitting example of irony in the English language.  History  In 1931, as part of a feature on Beatrice and Bill Bayliss opened Bill and Bess's Place, a tourist court with a dance hall and six log cabins on U.S. Route 66 in Missouri serving travellers on the main road of the day. In the depression era, cabins and campgrounds were popular low-cost alternatives to expensive hotels. They sold the property a decade later; at this point there would be \\"all kinds of cabins\\" in the region, much needed to house personnel around Fort Leonard Wood as the US mobilised to join World War II. The site changed hands multiple times, being acquired by John and Lillian Dausch in 1951 for $5,000. John Dausch would soon acquire the nickname \\"Sunday John\\" for selling beer seven days a week in open defiance of the local laws of the era. Widening of U.S. Route 66 in 1957 required the property be moved back from the original road; the dance hall was removed at this point. The nearby Vernelle's Motel also lost its restaurant and filling station when US 66 was widened. By 1965, the state was constructing Interstate 44 in the region. Some of the land from the John's Modern Cabins site was lost to freeway construction, but the new highway would not provide easy access to the cabin court and would prove fatal to the tiny business. and Archived at and . John Dausch closed the business upon his wife Lillian's death, not long after the new road had bypassed the site. His own death in 1971 would leave the property vacant and unmaintained; Loretta Ross of St. Charles, Missouri purchased the site in 1976 but that family's plans for the site were soon abandoned. The property was left untouched and decaying for the next 25 years. A proposal by the Ross family to demolish the now- unstable structures was successfully opposed by Route 66 preservationists in 2002 after the issue was publicised in \\"Route 66 Magazine\\" and on-line but no attempt has been made to prevent the further deterioration of the buildings. Mock Burma-Shave signs at the site once advised visitors to \\"photograph these / while you're here / the wrecking ball / is looming near\\". Unmaintained since 1971 and bypassed since the 1960s, the property is in dire condition and beyond repair. By 2011, the roof of John's larger living cabin had collapsed, along with 2 of the newer cabins he built. The site's outhouse, the matinence and the original cabins still stand. This segment of US 66 is usable but no longer maintained (the two-lane road is a dead end at a now-demolished bridge near the Arlington, Missouri ghost town). Interstate 44 has also been diverted away from its original 1967 path, now an abandoned pair of gravel roads, as part of a 2005 highway realignment. The site is therefore no longer visible from the freeway. It is no longer safe to enter any of the buildings, although many have photographed the exteriors of the structures in the expectation that they may be lost completely in the near future due to years of abandonment and neglect,  References  Category:Buildings and structures in Phelps County, Missouri Category:Buildings and structures on U.S. Route 66 Category:U.S. Route 66 in Missouri ","title":"John's Modern Cabins"},{"id":"35726136","text":"Slimcea was a British brand selling reduced calorie foods between 1959 and the mid-1990s.

It contains early fragmentary Christian texts: three prayers, a short creed and a portion of Anaphora (i.e. a Eucharistic Prayer). Manuscript tradition The fragments of this papyrus, composed of three leaves written on both sides and now in the Bodleian Library,Bodleian Library, MS. Gr. liturg. n. 34149–57 were found in 1907 in the ruins of the Deir Balyzeh monastery in the village of Al Balyzeh (or Balayzah, Bala'izah, ) in the Asyut Governorate: this monastery, which had an estimated population of 1000 monks, was in use from about the 500 and was abandoned after the 750. The fragments are in Greek written in uncial script, and are dated to the end of the 6th-century. These fragments were published by P. de Puniet in 1909. Other fragments were later discovered and the texts were re-edited in 1949 by C.H. Roberts and B. Capelle. Anaphora The anaphora included in the Deir Balyzeh Papyrus belongs to the Egyptian type, but it shows a different development from the Anaphora of Saint Mark, even if both are built on same ancient material. Similarities with the anaphora of Serapion suggests the second half of the 4th century as possible dating of the contents. This anaphora has a definitely consecratory epiclesis placed before the Words of Institution, as in the Roman Canon, in the anaphora of Barcelona and in the Cathecheses of Cyril of Jerusalem, while other Egyptian texts such as the Anaphora of Saint Mark have here a less developed epiclesis that simply asks the Holy Spirit to fill the bread and cup. The content of this anaphora, which initial and final fragments are lost, is: * ... (lacuna) ... Pre-Sanctus, * Sanctus, without the Benedictus as usual in early Egypt, * an Epiclesis directed to the Holy Spirit, with an explicit request to change the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ, * a text similar to that found in the Didache about the gathering of the Church as the becoming one of the scattered bread on hills, * a short Institution narrative, * the Anamnesis ... (lacuna) ... The fragments ends with a final Doxology, which could belong also to a thanksgiving prayer after the Communion. Creed The Deir Balyzeh Papyrus contains a short Christian creed which could have a baptismal use. It can be dated no later than the 4th century, even if it could be more ancient. The text is: :I believe in God the Father almighty :and in your only begotten Son our Lord, :our Lord Jesus Christ, :in the Holy Spirit, :in the resurrection of the flesh, :in the holy catholic Church. Three Prayers Apart from the anaphora and the short creed, other three prayers are included in the Deir Balyzeh Papyrus, which are not directly linked to the celebration of sacraments, but can be considered as prayers for all times. The prayers begin as follow: \\"You, our help...\\", \\"May he give us charity...\\" and \\"We pray you, o Master...\\".

In a racing career which lasted from 1872 until 1874 he won ten races. He was one of the best colts of his generation in England, winning the 2000 Guineas in 1873. He later became a successful sire of winners in Australia. Background Gang Forward, described as \\"a remarkably handsome, powerful colt\\" was bred by his owner William Stuart Stirling-Crawfurd (1819–1883), an \\"old school\\" sportsman who had married the widow of the 4th Duke of Montrose. Stirling-Crawfurd named the colt after the motto of Clan Stirling. Gang Forward was a chestnut horse standing 15.3 hands high with a white blaze and a white sock on his right hind leg. He was sired by Stockwell, winner of the 1852 St. Leger and 2,000 Guineas Stakes and a seven time leading sire. Gang Forward was trained at Manton in Wiltshire by Alec Taylor Sr., who had established his training facility there in 1870 under the patronage of Stirling-Crawfurd.Paul Mathieu, The Masters of Manton from Alec Taylor to George Todd, quoted in Racing Post, 22 Nov. 2019 \\"Manton: Continuous flow of success from lush pastures, Nick Pulford traces its beginnings in the 1870s to the present day\\" Racing career =1872: two-year-old season= Gang Forward began his racing career in September 1872, when he contested the Municipal Plate at Doncaster. He started a strong favourite at odds of 1/5 but was beaten into second place by an unnamed colt later named Fontabrian. It was subsequently revealed that he had been hampered by having twisted at least two of his racing plates during the race, although other sources attributed his defeat to his being \\"very backward\\". At the First October meeting at Newmarket he recorded his first victory when winning the Boscawen Stakes by a head from Surinam. Later at the same meeting he beat Paladin by a neck to win the Triennial Produce Stakes. At the end of October, Gang Forward ran twice at Newmarket's Houghton meeting and claimed two more prizes. He won the Glasgow Stakes from Andred and Surinam after a \\"fine race\\" and then was allowed to walk over for a first prize of £500 in a Sweepstakes when his opponents were withdrawn. Gang Forward went into the winter break as one of the leading fancies for the following year's Classics alongside Kaiser and Flageolet. =1873: three-year-old season= Gang Forward made his first appearance of 1873 in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 30 April and started at odds of 8/1 against nine opponents, with Kaiser being made 15/8 favourite. The race attracted an extremely large crowd and there was a delay to the start as spectators were cleared from the course. Ridden by Tom Challoner, Gang Forward was among the front-runners from the start and two furlongs from the finish he was moved forward to dispute the lead with Kaiser. The two colts drew away from the rest of the field and after a \\"good race\\" Gang Forward prevailed by a head from the favourite, with Suleiman three lengths back in third place. Immediately after his win, Gang Forward was made clear favourite for the Derby at odds of 9/4. At Epsom on 28 May Gang Forward started 9/4 favourite for the Derby in a field of twelve runners. He was among the early leaders but then dropped back before running on in the straight. He was never able to reach the lead however and dead-heated with Kaiser for second place, half a length behind the 40/1 winner Doncaster, who had finished unplaced in the \\"Guineas\\". Gang Forward and Kaiser met again in the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and had another close contest. On this occasion, Gang Forward looked the likely winner before swerving to the right in the closing strides and losing by a short-head to Kaiser in a race which was effectively a match between the two favourites in the straight. At the same meeting he won both the St James's Palace Stakes and the Ascot Derby. Gang Forward was strongly fancied the St Leger after performing impressively in training with Challoner claiming that the horse was better than ever. He was to be transported to Doncaster by train, but only reached Oxford, where he was removed from his carriage and found to be lame as a result of a hock injury. He was immediately withdrawn from the Doncaster Classic, in which the filly Marie Stuart defeated Doncaster and Kaiser. Gang Forward's earnings for the 1873 season totalled £5,000. =1874 & 1875: four- and five- year-old seasons= Gang Forward was less successful as a four-year-old when he was campaigned in staying races. At Royal Ascot, Gang Forward turned into the straight in second place in the Ascot Gold Cup but faded in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind the French colt Boiard. His only important success of the year came in the Jockey Club Cup. In the following year he recorded his last major victory in the Craven Stakes. Stud career In 1875 Gang Forward was sold for 4000 guineas to Sir Thomas Elder and exported to South Australia. The best of his progeny included Hortense (Ascot Vale Stakes), Chetwynd (Goodwood Handicap), Guesswork (South Australian Derby) and Remus (VRC Mares' Produce Stakes). He was euthanised due to old age in May 1899.

Description Wilkie Sugar Loaf Mountain, seen from the entrance to Dingwall Harbour in Aspy Bay Wilkie Sugar Loaf is a forested pyramid rising from the shore of Aspy Bay, north of the Cabot Trail. There are few stand-alone mountaintops in Nova Scotia, but one of these is Wilkie Sugar Loaf, climbing to more than 400 metres/yards above sea level in less than 1.5 kilometers (0.9 mi). This peak belongs to the North Mountain range of hills bordering the Aspy Fault but has been separated from the rest of the ridge by the deep ravines cut by Wilkie and Pollys brooks. The name Wilkie Sugar Loaf has been the official name for this mountain since April 21, 1936. The mountain's name is a combination of both \\"Wilkie,\\" the family name of a pioneer family in who settled in the area in 1820, James Wilkie Jr. was an original land grant recipient in the area in 1852, and \\"Sugar Loaf\\", a descriptive name for the mountain's distinct pyramidal shape, which suggests a \\"sugarloaf\\". The name Wilkie Sugar Loaf was already in common use in official publications such as Admiralty Charts and Sailing Directions by 1860. The Mi'kmaq name for the mountain was \\"Squa- dichk,\\" meaning \\"the highest point.\\" Triangulation station A Natural Resources Canada Geodetic Survey Division Station, Unique Number (Station Number): 23107, Station Name \\"SUGAR LOAF 19659\\", is located near the summit, consisting of a copper bolt sunk about 1 inch in a standard concrete monument. The remains of an astronomic pier lie about away to the east. In the late 1960s there was a tall wooden tower on the summit, located over the survey station. While the station can still be found, there are no remains of the tower. The trail Access to the summit is possible by hiking the Wilkie Sugar Loaf trail which leads from a trailhead on the west side of the Bay St Lawrence Road, 1.15 kilometres (0.71 mi) north of the entrance of Cabots Landing Provincial Park, to the peak of the mountain, offering views from two mountain top look-offs. One look-off faces toward the Aspy Fault plateau and Aspy Fault including the plateau of the national park in the distance to the south-west as well as the beach at Cabots Landing, Aspy Harbour and the villages of Cape North and Dingwall to the south and east. The second look-off presents a view of the hills to the north and to Bay St. Lawrence and the Gulf of St. Lawrence beyond. On a very clear day it is possible to see all the way to Newfoundland.

It is located in Worcester Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania near Lansdale. History The first family to till this land was Peter and Rosanna Wentz (both 1st generation) and their 6 children. Peter inherited the property from his father who may have purchased it as early as 1710. It was sold to Dewalt Bieber in 1784 and then to Melchior Schultz, a minister of the Schwenkfelder faith, in 1794. Schultz family descendants owned the home until 1969 when it was purchased by the County of Montgomery. The Georgian style mansion was built in 1758, and is a large 2 1/2-story, dwelling with attached summer kitchen and bake oven. The main house consists of two floors with four rooms and a large hallway on both, a cellar with a spring house and a full attic. The front facade is built of dressed red sandstone and the remainder of the building is built on uncut sandstone.

She was the second wife of William Penn, the first colonial proprietor of the Province of Pennsylvania. After her husband's strokes in 1712, she became acting Proprietor of Pennsylvania. While in this role, the Crown put great pressure on her to surrender the colony for a cash settlement which would relieve the Penn family of debt. Hannah Penn, through careful planning and difficult decisions, was able to prevent the surrender of the colony to the Crown.Conlon, Emily L. “Two women who led in colonial days.” Friends Journal. 15 October 1982. 28. Due to her financial management, the proprietary colony remained in the hands of Hannah's branch of the Penn family until the Revolution. Penn later became the first woman awarded the status of Honorary Citizen of United States. This honor, which was conferred to her by President Ronald Reagan through a Presidential Proclamation in 1984, cited her “devotion to the pursuit of peace and justice.\\" Major General Washburn purchased the home and property as a wedding gift for his daughter Jeannette Garr Washburn and her husband Albert Warren Kelsey.

It is sometimes titled in English as \\"The History of the Tooth Relic\\" and contains histories and popular traditions associated with the Relic of the tooth of the Buddha. This relic is currently enshrined at the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka. Contents Like the Mahabodhivamsa and Mahavamsa, the Dāṭhavaṃsa begins with the penultimate rebirth of Gautama Buddha during the lifetime of Dipankara Buddha, and then relates the life of Gautama Buddha up until his paranirvana and the distribution of his relics. It consists of six chapters composed in five different metres, with additional variations in metre employed for the concluding verses of some chapters. Within the text its author is identified as Dhammakitti, and that it was written at the suggestion of General Parakrama, responsible for enthroning Lilavati of Polonnaruwa, both of whom are praised within the text. The death of Lilavati's husband, Parakramabahu I, and her subsequent reign are described in the Culavamsa and dated to around AD 1211, suggesting that the Dāṭhavaṃsa was composed in the early 13th Century. Dhammakitti is identified as a direct pupil of Sāriputta Thera, and his writings are significant in identifying texts attributed to his teacher. Dhammakitti also identifies himself as a 'rajaguru', or royal preceptor, in a Sinhalese paraphrase of the Dāṭhavaṃsa that he authored for the benefit of those not fluent in Pali. The Dāṭhavaṃsa is praised by scholars for its literary merit- both the skill and rhythm with which its varying metres are employed, and the relative simplicity and elegance of its diction. Origins and Historical Significance According to its introduction, the Dāṭhavaṃsa is a translation of an earlier Sinhalese text that dates to when the relic first arrived in Sri Lank during the reign of Sirimeghavanna of Anuradhapura in the 3rd-4th Century CE. The Dāṭhavaṃsa provides a great deal of detail regarding conflicts between Buddhists and Brahmins in the 3rd Century which, if the putative origin of the Sinhala precursor are true, would have been derived from contemporary sources and witnesses. George Turnour claimed that this Sinhala text still existed in the 19th Century, which would have made it the earliest surviving Sinhala historical text, but it is currently considered to be lost. The first verse of the Dāṭhavaṃsa gives this original the title Dalada-vamsa, composed in Elu, and this may by synonymous with a work called the Datha-dhatu-vamsa in the Culavamsa that extended the story of the Tooth Relic into the 18th Century.

He was delisted in 2013 after receiving an 18-month suspension for testing positive to a banned substance, but was redrafted by the Saints as a rookie at the end of 2014.  Early career  Saad was born to Egyptian parents in Australia. At age 8 his family moved to Egypt where he played representative soccer as a striker or winger. He returned to Australia at age 14, attending secondary school in Roxburgh Park, Victoria. He played Australian rules football for the first time at age 16, filling in to make up the numbers for his school before joining the local Roxburgh Park Football Club. Saad joined the Northern Bullants in the Victorian Football League in 2009 in unusual circumstances. He had not received a formal invitation to join the club but turned up unannounced (inspired by his mother's words of wisedom and encouragement) to an early preseason training session and was permitted to participate. He did not play a senior game in 2009, but went on to play 35 senior games for the club over the following two years. In the 2011 season, Saad kicked 50 goals and won the Fothergill-Round Medal as the league's most promising young player. AFL career Saad caught the attention of AFL recruiters in the 2011 VFL season and then scored some impressive numbers in the AFL Draft Combine, with the fastest 20m sprint time and the second-highest agility score. He was recruited by the St Kilda Football Club by indirect means in the 2011 Trade Week: the fledgling Greater Western Sydney Giants recruited him directly, then immediately traded him to St Kilda, along with Terry Milera and draft pick 25, in exchange for pick 20. Saad was 22 years old when he was recruited. Saad made his debut in Round 6, 2012, against Hawthorn at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In round 7, 2012, his goal against Carlton and in Round 21, his goal against Geelong were both nominated for Goal of the Year. Saad received an 18-month ban after testing positive to a banned substance. Saad consumed an energy drink \\"Before Battle\\" which contained the banned stimulant methylsynephrine. Saad was delisted by St Kilda as a result of the investigation at the end of the 2013 season. He was redrafted as a rookie by St Kilda in the 2015 Rookie Draft. He played four games for St Kilda during the 2015 season and was delisted again in October 2015. Post-AFL career Saad returned to the VFL in 2016, and joined stand-alone VFL club Coburg. He kicked 49 goals in the 2016 season to lead the VFL and win the Frosty Miller Medal. He was also named Full Forward in the VFL Team of the year.  Personal life  Saad graduated from Roxburgh College in 2007. He is the first player of Egyptian background and the third practising Muslim (after Sedat Sir and Bachar Houli) to be on the AFL playing list. In 2012 he was nominated as one of the AFL's multicultural ambassadors.

Fruytier O.C., Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek p.1078-1080 (Dutch)  Life  Abraham was born as the son of merchant Gerrit de Vries and his wife Catherina de Bosch (sister of the poet Hieronymus de Bosch) as brother to Jeronimo de Vries (author). He studied at the Latin School of Amsterdam and was considered to be one of the better students and at the Mennonite Atheneum from 1788 until 1792 and then he studied for teacher at the Mennonite pedagogical academy. In 1795 he was, as a Patriot, appointed as adjunct secretary to the \\"Committé van Algemeen Welzijn\\" (Committee of General Welfare) by the Provisional Government with the promise he were to be relieved when a new government would have been elected - but then accepted a permanent position at this Secretariat. At the same time he developed an interest in literature and law (he was member of the society Concordia et Libertate) - but in 1798 he was fired after a month imprisonment (after the 1798 revolution he was accused to be an Orangist) and returned to theology but maintained his interest in literature and literary contacts.A.J. van der Aa, Biographisch Woordenboek der Nederlanden part XIX, p.426-431 (Dutch) In 1799 he graduated and accepted a post as a Mennonite minister in Wormerveer, Grouw, Franeker and Nijmegen. In 1801 he succeeded Jan Kops at the Mennonite congregation in Leiden and two years later he moved to the mennonite congregation in Haarlem where he would remain minister until his retirement. In 1811 he co-founded the \\"Algemeene Doopsgezinde Societeit\\" (General Mennonite Society) and became a board member. His interest and activities in both classical and Dutch literature resulted in his nomination for professor at Hoogeschool Leiden in Dutch and Classical literature, but he always refused - but was in 1820 awarded with a doctorate honoris causae in literature. De Vries compiled a catalogue of the collection of the Public Library in Haarlem in 1848. He did accept a position as secretary at the Latin schools in his city Haarlem, and was curator of the Haarlem city library (from 1821 until his death) which he built a collection by combining several collections in the city, with the support of King William I and Teylers Stichting. In this capacity (and as an amateur historian) he was also a strong supporter of the lobby to recognize the Haarlem printer Laurens Janszoon Coster as the original inventor of printing and he published some works to support his theories (with the full support of the Koninklijk Nederlandsch Instituut - Royal Dutch Institute). In 1856 he was appointed as Commandeur in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He was a member of the Koninklijk Nederlandsch Instituut (1818 - 1825, resigned),KNAW on De Vries (Dutch) of Teylers Eerste Genootschap (a theological society connected with Teylers Stichting and Teylers Museum, awarding annually essay prizes), of several regional societies, the Hollandsche Maatschappij and honorary member of the Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde in Leiden. He published several other works about literature. Abraham de Vries was married to Hillegonda van Geuns (daughter of a Haarlem Mennonite minister) and they had two sons and two daughters.C.Sepp, Levensschets van Abraham de Vries in Jaarboek van de Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde, 1863 p.139-209 (Dutch) He was the father of Gerrit de Vries (prime minister of the Netherlands from 1872 to 1874 and member of the Raad van State) and Prof. M. de Vries.

Sant Adrià de Besòs and Estació de Sant Adrià (Catalan for \\"Sant Adrià Station\\") are a Rodalies de Catalunya commuter rail station and a Trambesòs tram stop, respectively, together forming an interchange station complex in Sant Adrià de Besòs, to the north-east of Barcelona, in Catalonia, Spain. The Rodalies de Catalunya station is on the Barcelona to Maçanet-Massanes via Mataró railway, between Barcelona El Clot-Aragó and . It is operated by Renfe Operadora and is served by Barcelona commuter rail service line and Girona commuter rail service line . The Trambesòs stop is the northern terminus of routes and and is operated by TRAM. History Although the Barcelona–Mataró Railway, the first railway line in the Iberian Peninsula, passed through Sant Adrià de Besòs, it did not have any kind of stop in the municipality when it was opened on . However, since several local factories were connected to the railway line, its opening was a major boost for the town’s economy. In 1888, with the opening of a steam tram line that travelled from Barcelona to Badalona, communications in the area were improved when a stop serving this new tram line was built in town. In mid-1933, due to popular demand, Compañía de los Ferrocarriles de Madrid a Zaragoza y Alicante (M.Z.A.; \\"Madrid to Zaragoza and Alicante Railways Company\\") started the economic process to build a small halt on the Barcelona–Mataró Railway in Sant Adrià de Besòs. The new halt eventually started services on 10 October of that year. At that time, it was mainly served by commuter trains and did not have any ticket office so that tickets had to be bought on-train. On , the first section of the Trambesòs system, which travelled from Barcelona's Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes to this stop, was opened as part of route . Four years later, on , new route was launched and started serving this stop. Although the T6 initially ran between this stop and Gorg metro station in Badalona via the Sant Adrià de Besòs neighbourhood of La Mina, since the restructuring of the Trambesòs system applied on , the T6 terminates at Plaça de les Glòries Catalanes instead of Gorg. On , Girona commuter rail service line , which is actually an extension of Barcelona commuter rail service line towards Portbou, was launched and started serving the Rodalies de Catalunya station. Station layout The Rodalies de Catalunya station consists of two tracks served by their respective side platforms, which are partially covered by metal shelters and communicated by an underpass equipped with stairs and elevators. A small station building is located on the left side of the tracks, looking north, which consists of a single storey where there is a hall hosting the ticket gates to the platforms, ticket vending machines and a ticket office. On the opposite side of the station building, there are also some ticket gates providing direct access to the street and the Trambesòs stop. The Trambesòs stop lies parallel to the Rodalies de Catalunya station, at the same level, in order to make transfers between the two transport modes easier. Located at the southernmost side of the railway station, the tram stop has two tracks served by an island platform equipped with the usual TRAM metal shelter, which includes ticket vending machines and information screens. As it is a terminus stop, the platform is slightly longer, so that two tramcars can be parked on each track. Accessibility In recent years, lifting platforms for wheelchair people were installed at the accesses to the underpass of the Rodalies de Catalunya station. They, nevertheless, did not work very often and received several complaints from a local association of physically disabled people. Thus, in order to improve the station's accessibility, in mid-2010, a complete renovation of the station with a budget of €740,000 was announced by Adif, the owner of the station.

The church was notable mainly for the frescoes presumably made by a disciple of Theophanes the Greek, one of the foremost Russian artists. The church was destroyed to the ground during World War II and restored in the 2000s. Fragments of the frescoes were reconstructed. The Volotovo Church was designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#5310105000). History The church was built in 1352 by Moisey, the archbishop of Novgorod. The church survived the Time of Troubles, when many Novgorod churches were destroyed or damaged by the Swedes. During World War II, the church was basically at the front line between the Soviet and the German armies for three years and was destroyed. In 1955, Leonid Krasnorechyev performed conservation of the monument. The church was standing as a ruin but was not decaying further. The frescoes were destroyed as well, but the debris were still on the site, and the restorators started work on recovering fresco fragments from the debris. In 2003, the building was reconstructed, The author of the reconstruction project was Ninel Kuzmina. In 2004, Krasnorechyev and Kuzmina were awarded the State Prize of the Russian Federation. The work on frescoes continued, and these were being mounted on the walls after the completion of the church. As of 2007, over a hundred fresco fragments were on restoration. The works were funded by the German company Wintershall Holding AG. Frescoes The frescoes of the altar part The chronicles mention that in 1363 a part of the church was painted, but presumably the frescoes in rest of the interior were created later, around 1380. The whole interior of the church was covered by frescoes, which was common for that time, but almost all fully painted churches were eventually destroyed or lost the original frescoes, and so far the only intact church with the fully painted interior is preserved in the Ferapontov Monastery. The Volotovo frescoes were extensively studied, and black and white photographs of every detail, as well as coloured copies, survived and considerably simplified the restoration. In 1977, the frescoes became the subject of a book of Mikhail Alpatov. The name of the painter is not known. For a long time, the frescoes were ascribed to Theophanes the Greek, however, it was decided later that the 1380 frescoes did not belong to Theophanes and were essentially more dynamic that all the works of Theophanes. At the time of creation, this was a novel style in Russian art. References =Notes= =Sources= * * Dörthe Jakobs, Helmut F.

Every better-quasi-ordering is a well- quasi-ordering.  Motivation  Though well-quasi-ordering is an appealing notion, many important infinitary operations do not preserve well-quasi- orderedness. An example due to Richard Rado illustrates this. In a 1965 paper Crispin Nash-Williams formulated the stronger notion of better-quasi-ordering in order to prove that the class of trees of height ω is well-quasi-ordered under the topological minor relation. Since then, many quasi-orderings have been proven to be well-quasi-orderings by proving them to be better-quasi- orderings. For instance, Richard Laver established Laver's theorem (previously a conjecture of Roland Fraïssé) by proving that the class of scattered linear order types is better-quasi-ordered. More recently, Carlos Martinez-Ranero has proven that, under the proper forcing axiom, the class of Aronszajn lines is better-quasi-ordered under the embeddability relation.  Definition  It is common in better-quasi-ordering theory to write {_*}x for the sequence x with the first term omitted. Write [\\\\omega]^{<\\\\omega} for the set of finite, strictly increasing sequences with terms in \\\\omega, and define a relation \\\\triangleleft on [\\\\omega]^{<\\\\omega} as follows: s\\\\triangleleft t if there is u \\\\in [\\\\omega]^{<\\\\omega} such that s is a strict initial segment of u and t={}_*u. The relation \\\\triangleleft is not transitive. A block B is an infinite subset of [\\\\omega]^{<\\\\omega} that contains an initial segment of every infinite subset of \\\\bigcup B. For a quasi-order Q, a Q-pattern is a function from some block B into Q. A Q-pattern f\\\\colon B\\\\to Q is said to be bad if f(s) ot \\\\le_Q f(t) for every pair s,t\\\\in B such that s\\\\triangleleft t; otherwise f is good. A quasi-ordering Q is called a better-quasi-ordering if there is no bad Q-pattern. In order to make this definition easier to work with, Nash-Williams defines a barrier to be a block whose elements are pairwise incomparable under the inclusion relation \\\\subset. A Q-array is a Q-pattern whose domain is a barrier. By observing that every block contains a barrier, one sees that Q is a better-quasi-ordering if and only if there is no bad Q-array.  Simpson's alternative definition  Simpson introduced an alternative definition of better-quasi-ordering in terms of Borel functions [\\\\omega]^{\\\\omega}\\\\to Q, where [\\\\omega]^{\\\\omega}, the set of infinite subsets of \\\\omega, is given the usual product topology. Let Q be a quasi-ordering and endow Q with the discrete topology. A Q-array is a Borel function [A]^{\\\\omega}\\\\to Q for some infinite subset A of \\\\omega. A Q-array f is bad if f(X) ot\\\\le_Q f({_*}X) for every X\\\\in[A]^{\\\\omega}; f is good otherwise. The quasi-ordering Q is a better-quasi-ordering if there is no bad Q-array in this sense.  Major theorems  Many major results in better-quasi-ordering theory are consequences of the Minimal Bad Array Lemma, which appears in Simpson's paper as follows. See also Laver's paper, where the Minimal Bad Array Lemma was first stated as a result. The technique was present in Nash-Williams' original 1965 paper. Suppose (Q,\\\\le_Q) is a quasi-order. A partial ranking \\\\le' of Q is a well-founded partial ordering of Q such that q\\\\le'r \\\\to q \\\\le_Q r. For bad Q-arrays (in the sense of Simpson) f\\\\colon [A]^{\\\\omega}\\\\to Q and g\\\\colon [B]^{\\\\omega}\\\\to Q, define: : g\\\\le^* f \\\\text{ if } B\\\\subseteq A \\\\text{ and } g(X)\\\\le' f(X) \\\\text{ for every } X\\\\in[B]^{\\\\omega} : g <^* f \\\\text{ if } B\\\\subseteq A \\\\text{ and } g(X) <' f(X) \\\\text{ for every } X\\\\in[B]^{\\\\omega} We say a bad Q-array g is minimal bad (with respect to the partial ranking \\\\le') if there is no bad Q-array f such that f <^* g. The definitions of \\\\le^* and <' depend on a partial ranking \\\\le' of Q. The relation <^* is not the strict part of the relation \\\\le^*. Theorem (Minimal Bad Array Lemma). Let Q be a quasi-order equipped with a partial ranking and suppose f is a bad Q-array. Then there is a minimal bad Q-array g such that g \\\\le^* f.

Following the amalgamation of the 4th and 8th Hussars as The Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, he commanded the Regiment in Malaysia and Germany. For his leadership during the Borneo campaign he was awarded the O.B.E. Later he commanded at brigade level and was Chief of Staff, United Kingdom Land Forces. For this latter service he was awarded a C.B.E. He had previously been awarded the US Bronze Star for his leadership during the Italian campaign of 1944–45. In civilian life he became a prolific author, especially on military matters. Early life John Strawson was born in Ealing in 1921. His father was the headmaster of an East London secondary school whose health was ruined by four years of service on the Western Front during the Great War. He died prematurely in 1936, leaving Strawson, his brothers Galen and Peter and sister Margaret in impoverished circumstances. Unlike Peter, who successfully achieved a bursary to St John's College, Oxford, and went on to become one of the most famous philosophers of Britain, John was, by necessity, obliged to join the Civil Service, leaving to join the army at the outbreak of hostilities in 1939.Hussars, Horses and History, Strawson p 233 Army career Strawson was commissioned into the 4th Queen's Own Hussars as a cornet in 1942 and joined the regiment at Kokini Trimithia, near Nicosia, where it was temporarily out of the line for refit.Strawson, Hussars, Horses and History (), p. 9 He joined the 4th Hussars at a time when most of its officers had been captured by the Germans during the ill fated Greek campaign.Strawson, p. 13 The regiment had been overrun and forced to surrender with only a small number escaping. As a result, many of his brother officers were drafted in from other cavalry regiments. On returning to Egypt, the regiment was stationed at Beni Yusef camp in Cairo in the region of Mena, beside the pyramids. Despite the exigencies of war, Strawson writes fondly of being able to enjoy such pursuits as \\"polo, golf, tennis, squash, swimming and poodle faking\\".Strawson, p. 18 Command On promotion to lieutenant colonel, Strawson assumed command of the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, into which his own regiment, the 4th Queen's Own Hussars, had been amalgamated. He took the QRIH through the Malayan Campaign, peacetime in Germany and a further tour in Borneo, where he was appointed OBE in recognition of his leadership.John Strawson at davidhigham.co.uk Civilian life After retiring from the Army, Strawson wrote a number of books of military history and biography, including studies of the British Army. He collaborated with General Sir John Hackett and others in writing the two volumes of The Third World War. His later books include The Duke and the Emperor: Wellington and Napoleon (1994) and Churchill and Hitler: In Victory and Defeat (1997). To the end of his life he continued to attend a variety of events in support of the British Army and, in particular, of the Old Comrades Association of the Queen's Royal Hussars, where he was known to all as \\"General John\\". Family Strawson married Baroness Wilfred von Schellersheim in Eisbergen during 1960. They lived in Chitterne, Wiltshire.Strawson, p. 235 They had two married daughters.

Founded in March 2010 by Shinji Mikami, previously of Capcom, the company was acquired by ZeniMax Media in October that year. Tango developed The Evil Within, a survival horror game released in 2014, and its sequel, The Evil Within 2, released in 2017. Its newest game will be Ghostwire: Tokyo.  History  Shinji Mikami had been with video game developer Capcom since 1989, working on several of its franchises and creating the Resident Evil series of horror video games. Over time, Capcom grew too large to Mikami, who also wished to develop games based around concepts other than horror, as he had for Capcom. For some time, he worked on a freelance basis, directing the action game Vanquish for PlatinumGames and producing the action-horror game Shadows of the Damned for Grasshopper Manufacture. He was repeatedly inquired by Sega to develop a horror game for them, which he rejected. On 1 March 2010, Mikami (at the time aged 44) and a team of twelve developers founded a new studio, Tango, in Odaiba, Tokyo, where he moved to from his previous office in Osaka. Shigenori Nishikawa, the director of MadWorld for PlatinumGames, joined the company in May 2010. Tango immediately began work on multiple projects, with one small team working for six months on a joke game that would have starred a cockroach standing on two legs and shooting a gun. Their primary project was Noah, a sci-fi open world survival-adventure game inspired by the 1984 film Dune. In this game, Earth had become mostly uninhabitable and humankind moved to other planets, where one colony loses contact with the others and a research team is tasked with finding them. Shortly after development on this game began, Tango ran into financial issues; according to Mikami, \\"something happened\\". American video game publisher Bethesda Softworks stepped in to assist and had its parent company, ZeniMax Media, acquire the studio, which was announced on 28 October 2010. Tango was merged into ZeniMax Asia K.K., ZeniMax's Asia-Pacific branch based in Tokyo's Aomi area, and reorganised as a division under the name \\"Tango Gameworks\\". For the acquisition, ZeniMax used a part of the it had previously raised in private funding. Mikami agreed to the acquisition because he felt as though Bethesda and ZeniMax would provide the \\"most independent\\" development environment for Tango. In November 2010, composer Masafumi Takada (formerly of Grasshopper Manufacture), as well as artist Naoki Katakai and programmer Shinichiro Ishikawa (both formerly of Capcom) joined Tango. By March 2012, Tango had 65 employees, with Mikami expecting to eventually employ 100 staffers. Following the acquisition, Mikami envisioned Tango to continue developing multiple games at a time. Noah was cancelled and development on a new AAA project, Zwei, commenced. Initially, this game saw a man and woman chained together hunting down a vampire, with either two players controlling each character individually, or one player both simultaneously. Zwei was formally announced in April 2012. Over time, the game evolved into a single-player survival horror game and was rechristened The Evil Within, which was announced in April 2013. In August 2014, Tango moved from Aomi to the Shibaura district. The Evil Within was released by Bethesda in October 2014. It was the last game directed by Mikami so that future Tango games could provide opportunities for other people. A sequel to The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, was announced in June 2017, during E3 2017, and released by Bethesda in October 2017. In June 2019, during Bethesda's press conference at E3 2019, Mikami and creative director Ikumi Nakamura announced Ghostwire: Tokyo, an action-adventure game with horror elements. Nakamura later resigned from Tango in September 2019, leaving the studio after nine years.

It carries SCSI commands and responses through the ATA interface. ATAPI devices include CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives, tape drives, magneto-optical drives, and large-capacity floppy drives such as the Zip drive and SuperDisk drive.  Background  ATA was originally designed for, and worked only with hard disks and devices that could emulate them. A group called the Small Form Factor committee (SFF) introduced ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disks. For example, any removable media device needs a \\"media eject\\" command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol. The Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the \\"ATA Packet Interface,\\" as part of the fourth generation of ATA. ATAPI carries SCSI commands through ATA, so ATAPI devices are \\"speaking SCSI\\" other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in \\"packets\\" (hence \\"ATA Packet Interface\\") for transmission on the ATA cable. This interfaces ATA with any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined. ATAPI devices are also \\"speaking ATA\\" because the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid-state drives do not use ATAPI.  Definition  The SCSI commands and responses used by each class of ATAPI device (CD-ROM, tape, etc.) are described in other documents or specifications specific to those device classes and are not within ATA/ATAPI or the T13 committee's purview. One commonly used set is defined in the MMC SCSI command set. ATAPI was adopted as part of ATA in INCITS 317-1998, AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4).

A key component of angampora is the namesake angam, which incorporates hand-to-hand fighting, and illangam, involving the use of indigenous weapons such as the ethunu kaduwa, staves, knives and swords. Another component known as maya angam, which uses spells and incantations for combat, is also said to have existed. Angampora's distinct feature lies in the use of pressure point attacks to inflict pain or permanently paralyze the opponent. Fighters usually make use of both striking and grappling techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission lock that they cannot escape. Usage of weapons is discretionary. Perimeters of fighting are defined in advance, and in some of the cases is a pit. With the advent of colonialism over the entirety of the island in 1815, Angampora fell into disuse and was very nearly lost as a part of the country's heritage. The British administration prohibited its practice due to the dangers posed by a civilian populace versed in a martial art, burning down any angan madu (practice huts devoted to the martial art) found: flouting of the law was punished by a gunshot to the knee, effectively crippling practitioners; Angampora nevertheless survived within a few families, allowing it to emerge into mainstream Sri Lankan culture post-independence. A number of paintings related to angampora are found at Buddhist temples in Sri Lanka. These include Embekka Devalaya, Gadaladeniya Rajamaha Viharaya, Temple of the Tooth, Saman Devalaya (Ratnapura) and Lankathilaka Rajamaha Viharaya. Etymology The name 'Angampora' is derived from the Sinhalese word anga- a root word for 'body', denoting physical combat and pora, meaning fight. It loosely means the martial, which uses limbs without the use of weapons. (unarmed combat) History =Myth= A wood carving at Embekka Devalaya, depicting angam fighters in one of the main locks, 14th century AD According to apocryphal Sinhalese folklore, angampora's history stretches to as far back as 3,000 years, with the Yaksha tribe (one of the four \\"hela\\" - the ancient tribes that inhabited the island) being identified as originators. Two ancient scripts named the Varga Purnikawa and Pancha Rakkhawaliya go further, identifying nine hermits as founders. Folklore goes on to describe Rana Ravana, a mythical warrior said to have lived 5,000 years ago, as the most feared angam warrior of all time. Weapon demonstration =Medieval period= Practice thrived during Sri Lanka's medieval period when Bhuvanekabahu VI of Kotte's successful campaign to conquer the Jaffna Kingdom included fighters who excelled in this art. Descendants of a heroine named Menike or Disapathiniya who lived around this time is credited with the art form's survival in the ensuing centuries: dressed in male attire, she is said to have defeated the killer of her father in a fight inside a deep pit known as ura linda (pig's pit), during a historic fight. Angampora fighters also fought alongside the army of Mayadunne of Sitawaka in the 1562 Battle of Mulleriyawa. Tikiri Banda aka Rajasinha I of Sitawaka, who succeeded Mayadunne, became a faithful sponsor of this art. There were two major schools of angampora, Maruwalliya and Sudhaliya, which routinely fought each other (in fights known as angam-kotāgæma), in the presence of the king. The leaders of the schools were known as Maruwalliya Muhandiram Nilame and Sudhalaye Muhandiram Nilame, respectively. The huts used by angampora fighters for training were known as angam madu, and were built according to the concepts of Gebim Shasthraya, the traditional philosophical system of architecture. =Modern period= Angam techniques were used by the locals in their resistance against the early colonial occupants of the island's coastal areas. The British, who occupied the whole island by 1815 (and who had full control of it by 1818G. C. Mendis, Ceylon under the British (2005), p. 6) issued a gazette banning the practice in 1817 with harsh punishments for flouters, paving the way to its decline. .This was because the British forces found it difficult to face the Sri lankan revolutionaries who were practitioners of this art. The martial art re- surfaced from an area known as Beligal Korale, around Kegalle, subsequent to the end of British rule in 1948 . The Jathika Hela Angam Shilpa Kala Sangamaya, the highest governing body of the art today, was established in 2001. Sri Lanka's Ministry of Culture and the Arts has also taken action to support the survival and preservation of angampora: several public exhibitions have been mounted with the aim of increasing public awareness of-, and fueling interest in it. A collection of weaponry used in angampora is also kept on display at the National Museum of Colombo. Angampora has been the subject of a number of films and television dramas in Sri Lanka. One such film, Angam, directed by Anjula Rasanga Weerasinghe, explored the origins of the art through traditional folk-stories and scientific examination. Jayantha Chandrasiri's tele-dramas Dandubasnāmānaya and Akāla Sandhya also featured angampora. These depictions have boosted the art's recent revival. Training Staff against sword and shield The angam component is divided into three main disciplines, gataputtu (locks and grips), pora haramba (strikes and blocks) and maru kala (nerve point attacks). Gataputtu are placed on an opponent using the fighter's hands, legs or head. Pora Haramba include approximately eighteen forms of offensive strikes and seven of defensive blocks. Maru kala is the component that incorporates nerve-point attacks capable of inflicting pain on the opponent, causing serious injury or timed death.(This means that according to the strike and pressure applied, the death of the person can be decided, sometimes the time can range from few minutes to many months of suffering) Several locks: * Diyaballu gataya * Kathira gataya * Pimburu gataya * Wanda gataya * Hasthi gataya * Lin gataya * Konda gataya Several offensive strikes: * Dik gutiya * Cholle * Tokke * Len pahara * Miti pahara/Miti gutiya * Miti guliya * Veesi pahara * Athul pahara * Pita pahara * Thallu pahara * Vakka pahara Sword demonstration atop Korathota hill top Before a practice session starts, the student is expected to meditate and offer merit to the master. The student lights three lamps as he enters to the angam maduwa. Students also make a pledge to use the technique solely for purposes of self-defense and the defense of his family or country. Practice begins with basic warm-up exercises, gradually moving on to special exercises. Foot movement techniques are the cornerstone of this art of fighting, and a foot exercise called mulla panina is the first skill taught, with minor mistakes being stiffly disciplined. This exercise is followed next by more advanced techniques like Gaman Thalawa. The hand fighting technique known as amaraya is a step into the next level of training. A student learns to observe the weaknesses of the opponent, and to attack weak points with experience. Weapons such as the suruttuwaluwa/velayudaya (an apparatus made of four long flexible pieces of metal, with sharp edges on both sides), the combat sword, keti kaduwa (a short sword), and cane sticks are used for fighting, together with the paliha (shield). In total, there are sixty-four types of weapon, including thirty-two sword variants. Some deadly, higher-level Angam attacks involve the nervous system; others if executed properly, can halt the bloodflow to vital organs, leading to paralysis or even death. Alongside such techniques students learn an ayurvedic practice known as beheth pārawal, or medical shots, for reversing the effects of such strikes. A graduation ceremony known as the Helankada Mangalya is the apex of the life of an angampora fighter, held within a Buddhist temple. Panikkirala, or fencing master, is the highest position in angampora, denoting the head of a particular school. A distinctive feature is the lack of the use of rank insignia like belts to denote degree of competence: male fighters usually fight bare-chested. Although angampora is designed to kill, it requires the practitioner to adhere at all times to stringent discipline. In extreme cases, fights are held inside deep holes.

Nellum's time broke a twenty-year-old state record established by Quincy Watts in 1987. Nellum had to redshirt the 2009 season at USC, after being shot in the leg by two gang members. Nellum was told by doctors that he would probably never again reach world-class speeds as a runner. On June 24, 2012, in Eugene, Oregon, Bryshon Nellum ran a personal record 44.80—his first sub-45-second time—in the 400 meters at the U.S. Olympic track trials, placing third in the competition and earning a spot on the 2012 Olympic team. At the 2012 Olympics Nellum reached the semi-finals of the individual 400 meters and won a silver medal as part of the 4×400 meters relay team. He carried the US flag at the closing ceremony after being chosen by the US athletes.

History  The rock castle was probably built in the 11th or 12th century by the Counts of Nahegau of the Emichones family. It was definitely the ancestral castle of the Lords of Stein, the later Wild- and Rhinegraves, and it remained in their possession until the French Revolution. The Lords of Stein were first mentioned in the 12th century. Their relationship to the Counts of Nahegau is unclear. Rheingrafenstein Castle itself is first unambiguously mentioned in the 13th century. The Lords of Stein acquired the Rheingau in the second half of the 12th century through marriage. In 1196, Lord Wolfram of Stein began styling himself Rhinegrave. This title was later attached to his castle. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle was captured by French and Spanish troops. In 1688, it was destroyed by general Mélac. In 1721, a salt works was built on top of the castle's ruins. The castle's last owner, the Prince of Grumbach, moved his residence to nearby Gaugrehweiler. The information sign at the castle reads:  Ruins  Parts of the enceinte, a vaulted cellar, a few steps of the former tower house, and the foundations of the former tower staircase are still standing. Another staircase leads through the rocks to a viewing platform. On the southern slope of the rock, the ruins of the bailey Affenstein can be seen.

This type of jackup vessel operates with a rack and pinion drive system, as opposed to the pin-hole system found on jackups rigs with tubular legs. The legs are mostly triangular though some with rectangular designs can be found. The chords are connected via a network of bracings to reinforce the leg structure. When a jackup positions its spudcan - i.e. the shoe mounted at the bottom of the leg - onto the seabed the mass of the vessel pressing down onto the seabed will cause a reaction force. If the seabed is inclined, or the spudcan does not travel straight through the soil due to the consistency of the soil layers encountered during leg penetration, the forces acting on the chords will be unequal which causes a chord - and the rack attached to it - to move ever so slightly up- or downwards. This up- or downwards displacement is the Rack Phase Value (RPV), and can be positive or negative. The sum of the absolute values of the RPV is the Rack Phase Difference. This relative displacement between the racks causes additional loading on the leg members, which induces additional stresses between * the rack and pinion teeth that are meshing during the jacking operation, which increases rack and pinion wear * the rack teeth and the upper and lower leg guides, which increases rack wear on the tips * the welded connections between bracings and chords The RPD limit should be clearly defined by the designer of the jack-up rig, and is subject to narrow design and as-built tolerances. The better the design tolerances are followed during construction, the lower the RPD will likely be during jacking operation1s, and the less wear the system will encounter. Excessive loading may result in failure of structural members in case the RPD reaches more than the allowable value. * cracks in welds between structural members * buckling of bracings * shearing off of rack and pinion teeth * deformation of the leg guide plate supporting structure * damage on the drives (e.g. internal planetary gear damage, damage on bull gears, shearing off of shaft keys, ...)

The church building is located in Church Road, Pitlochry, in Perthshire, Scotland. The church today serves the tourist town of Pitlochry in the Tummel valley. The church is a category A listed building. History The congregation which today worships in Pitlochry can trace its history back to at least the 7th century when it seems that a church dedicated to St Colm or St Colman was founded. Further evidence of early Christian activity in the area is the Dunfallandy Stone, an 8th-century Pictish stone depicting a Celtic Christian Cross, which was found near Killiecrankie, to the north. but was moved to Dunfallandy farm close to Pitlochry. The original parish church was at Moulin, just north of Pitlochry, from the Middle Ages. A charter for the church at Moulin together with \\"three carucates of land\\" was granted to the monks of Dunfermline Abbey by William the Lion, King of the Scots(1165 to 1214). In 1231, Pope Gregory IX granted the monks of Dunfermline Abbey patronage of Moulin, thus augmenting their income. A disastrous fire gutted Moulin Kirk in 1873 and, in addition to restoring this building, a new church was erected on a site in Pitlochry offered by Mr Archibald Butter of Faskally. The new church, designed by Dundee Architects Charles & Leslie Ower was complete by 1884, comprising a mixture of Romanesque Architecture and Victorian Gothic and Byzantine features, inspired by the work of F T Pilkington. A monument commemorating Alexander Duff (1806–1878), the first Church of Scotland missionary to India, is situated in the church grounds. A church hall was constructed in 1910. In 1929, when the majority of United Free Church of Scotland congregations rejoined the Church of Scotland, the Pitlochry United Free Church (which had been consecrated in 1863 as a Free Church and was from 1900 a United Free Church) became known as the East Church and the building currently in use became the West Church. The West Church, because of its prominent position overlooking the village, became affectionately known as \\"Mount Zion\\". It was designated as the second parish church of the Parish of Moulin in 1934. In 1989, Moulin Kirk was closed for worship and in 1992 the congregations of the East and West Churches united to form \\"Pitlochry Church of Scotland\\".

Early life Born Eleonore Mayr in Bad Aibling, Bavaria, Baur's mother died when Baur was an infant, and when she was five Baur moved to Munich with her father and stepmother.Hastings, p. 85. In Munich, Baur left school aged 14 to work as a midwife's assistant. At 15 she gave birth to an illegitimate child whose fate is currently unknown. At 19 she gave birth to a second illegitimate son named Willhelm, whom she gave up for adoption, then soon after she moved to Egypt to work as a nurse's assistant at a Cairo hospital. Baur returned to Munich in 1907, calling herself \\"Sister Pia\\", and worked for the Roman Catholic charitable order Gelbes Kreuz (Yellow Cross). In 1908 or 1909 she married Ludwig Baur, a mechanical engineer. The marriage ended in divorce after five or six years. Baur served as a nurse during World War I and then assisted the Freikorps Oberland troops during their battle against the Bavarian Soviet Republic and in the Baltic campaign in 1919. In 1923 she married for the second time, a hotel manager named Sponseil ten years her junior. This marriage also ended in divorce. Nazi Party In 1920, Baur met Adolf Hitler on a tram in Munich and helped found the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), and was Member No. 11. Singleton Argus, \\"Sentenced to 10 Years\\", 29 April 1949, p. 1. Baur became one of the most visible Nazi figures in Munich in the spring of 1920,Hastings, pp. 84-5. and was arrested on 11 March 1920 for disturbing the peace following an anti-Semitic speech at a women's rally in Munich. Her subsequent acquittal made her a hero of the Nazi movement. Baur continued to be active in German politics, giving speeches and organising Nazi-based charitable events, and on 9 November 1923 was the only woman to participate in the Beer Hall Putsch, during which she received minor injuries and for which she later received the Blood Order, being one of only two German and 14 Austrian women to be awarded the party's highest decoration. Throughout the rise of the Nazis and following their assumption of power in 1933, Baur remained close to the Nazi leadership, accompanying Hitler on picnic trips, and Heinrich Himmler appointed her welfare sister for the Waffen-SS, reaching the rank of General. In 1934, Baur founded the National Socialist Order of Sisters (Schwesternschaft), becoming its honorary chairwoman in 1937. She was promoted under the Nazi regime as the ideal Nazi woman (Der Spiegel called her \\"the nurse of the Nazi nation\\") and her role in the nascent Nazi party was well known.The Lewiston Daily Sun, \\"Hitler Escapes Assassins' Plot\\", 9 November 1939, p.10. Known as a fanatical Nazi who hated Jews and Poles, Baur received a number of medals, including the Silesian Eagle Order, the Silver Medal for Bravery, the above mentioned Blood Order, and the Baltikum Cross. Dachau Baur played a major role in the construction and administration of Dachau and, while there is no evidence Baur physically harmed prisoners, she was accused of bullying prisoners, staff and neighbours, and forcing prisoners to work on the renovations of the villa Hitler had given her in Oberhaching. The only woman allowed in Dachau,The Herald (Melbourne), \\"Woman Nazi faces court\\", 31 August 1949, p. 9. Baur gained a reputation in the camp as someone who \\"requisitioned anything that was not nailed down\\". From a small nearby camp, München-Schwabing, groups of prisoners were \\"reportedly whipped and ordered to do manual labor\\" at Baur's home, including \\"cleaning her house, tending her garden and even building children’s toys.\\" Post-war Baur was first arrested on war crimes charges in May 1945 but shortly thereafter released due to insufficient evidence. She then appeared before a denazification court in Munich in September 1949, where she was categorised as a major criminal, sentenced to ten years at Rebdorf labour camp and her personal property confiscated. Released from prison in 1950 for health reasons, Baur successfully applied for a pension and compensation in 1955 and returned to Oberhaching, where she died aged 95 in 1981. Baur never renounced National Socialism, once stating, \\"There is only one Frederick the Great, there is only one Adolf Hitler, and there is only one Sister Pia.\\"Holzhaider, H. \\"Schwester Pia\\", Dachau Booklets 10, 1994.

Her family moved to Engelsfors, her father's hometown, when she was young, and Minoo has consistently struggled to fit in. Her family is well-off and lives in a large house in the wealthy section of Engelsfors. A studious girl and a teacher's pet, she is shy and a bit of a loner and is very self-conscious about her body. She develops a close friendship with Rebecka; following Rebecka's death, she becomes the de facto leader of the Chosen Ones. She is friends with all of the Chosen Ones, but later becomes closest to Linnéa and Anna-Karin. In The Circle she has a crush on one of her teachers, Max, but in later on in the trilogy she falls in love with Gustaf and loses her virginity to him. Unlike the other Chosen Ones, Minoo has no direct association with any of the elements and instead serving as a direct link to the Guardians. After the final confrontation with the Demons and the Protectors, Minoo loses all her magic abilities since they stemmed from them. Element: None Powers and Abilities: Memory manipulation and alteration, ability to \\"see\\" the magical aurora of all humans and judge their magical potential/strength, ability to remove demon blessings =Rebecka Mohlin= Rebecka is a popular girl who secretly suffers from anorexia; despite there being several rumors in school about her eating disorder, Rebecka never received help for it. She is in love with her boyfriend, Gustaf, another popular student. Rebecka has a good home life and has four younger siblings. After her status of being a Chosen One is revealed, she is secretly tasked by Matilda to be the one to help keep the Chosen Ones together and soon becomes good friends with Minoo. Rebecka is killed in The Circle by Max. After her soul is freed from Max's body by Minoo, Rebecka lingers in the Borderlands until the end of The Key, when she helps the other Chosen Ones to close the final portal. She accepts that Minoo and Gustaf are together now and then passes on for good. Element: Fire Powers and Abilities: Telekinesis =Anna-Karin Nieminen= Anna-Karin lives at a farm with her mother and grandfather, who has Finnish ancestry. She has been bullied throughout her whole school life for being overweight and sweating a lot. Her element is earth and her power is that she can control other people into doing what she wants. This power gets overwhelming for her and she use it to make herself the new popular girl in school, along with trying to tear her mother out of the depressed, almost apathetic state she has long since been in. She also use the power to get close to her crush, Jari. All this gets her in trouble with the magic community, something which becomes important in Fire. Element: Earth Powers and abilities: Mind control/manipulation, super strength =Vanessa Dahl= Vanessa is described as conventionally attractive with bleached blonde hair and skin that tans well. A popular girl who loves to party, Vanessa has a wide group of friends, though her best friends outside of the Chosen Ones are Michelle and Evelina. Vanessa has a bit of tumultuous home life and often clashes with her mother's boyfriend, Nicke, a police officer. She has a much younger brother who she loves very much. Vanessa's boyfriend throughout most of the trilogy is an older boy named Wille, who is friends with Jonte, a local drug dealer. Throughout the trilogy, Vanessa becomes close friends with Linnéa, and eventually falls in love with her. The trilogy ends with them in a relationship; Vanessa frequently describes Linnéa as \\"the love of her life\\". Element: Air Powers and abilities: Invisibility, flight =Linnéa Wallin= Linnéa has an implied interest in manga, j-pop and goth fashion. Her mother is dead and her father Björn is an alcoholic, leading to her spending years at foster homes and with substitute parents. She has had problems with substance abuse and panic attacks. She now lives in an apartment provided to her by the Swedish social services. She sews a lot of her own clothes and also draw pictures which have at multiple instances been praised by other characters. She and Elias are the only two of the chosen ones who had any kind of relationship before their powers were revealed and their friendship has been described as a \\"siblings in everything but blood\\". Thanks to her element of water she can read peoples minds and later also communicate by telepathy. Element: Water Powers and abilities: Mind-reading/telepathy, ability to control the temperature of water =Ida Holmström= Ida is considerably popular, she belongs to one of Engelfors' more successful families and is described as a thin, natural blonde. She is disliked by the other chosen ones, being one of those who bullied Elias and Anna-Karin. She is described as false by Gustaf, and this is reinforced by her keeping secrets to the other witches. She is the first to communicate with the protectors through the book and also makes a deal with it to play along with the group in exchange for her powers to be taken away and a relationship with the love of her life, Gustaf. Her biggest interest outside of popularity is the horse Troja, which she is a caretaker of. Her element is metal, and she serves as the body which Mathilda possess when she communicate with the chosen ones. She is killed trying to protect Gustaf and is trapped in the Borderland.

The two grew so close that they regarded each other as siblings and only truly trusted one another. They also had a mutual friendship with Olivia, a girl with turquoise hair from an upper-middle-class background. Elias parents ignored his problems for very long, not wanting to risk their position as a leading family in the city. This topic is dealt more thoroughly with in Fire. Elias spent time at a mental hospital as he had been dealing with self-harm and substance abuse, presumably to ease his anxiety. It is hinted at that Elias was bisexual as Linnéa remembers that he admitted being attracted to fictional people like Misa Amane and Edward Scissorhands. Elias dies in the first chapter of The Circle and his death and memory deeply affects the characters and events in both The Circle and Fire. He had the element of wood and could presumably have developed the ability to change his appearance at will if given the chance, the film version makes this quite clear. His soul resides in the Borderlands and is summoned during the final battle. Afterwards he says goodbye to Linnéa and passes on together with Rebecka and Ida. Element: Wood Powers and abilities: Shapeshifting =Matilda= The previous Chosen One who was burned to death 400 years ago during the time of the Swedish Witch Trials.

However, he suffers from amnesia and only over time does he realize his true purpose in Engelsfors. He has a one-eyed cat familiar named simply Cat. In The Key, his past is revealed: he is a natural wood witch from the 17th century and Matilda's father. Through a large human sacrifice he was able to preserve his life and seal away his memories. It is also eventually revealed that Nicolaus is one third of the \\"key\\" needed to close the last portal, which means he must die. Nicolaus does not appear in the film version. =Gustaf Åhlander= Rebecka's boyfriend in The Circle. Following Rebecka's death, he befriends Minoo and eventually falls in love with her. A star soccer player, he is very popular, with many girls at school having a crush on him; this includes Ida, who has been in love with him for many years. After learning of the existence of magic and The Chosen Ones, he becomes an ally to them, despite having little to no natural magical ability himself. =Erik Forslund= A popular student from a wealthy family, he is a ruthless and psychopathic school bully. Erik was Ida's boyfriend until their break-up in Fire. Aggressively violent, he attacks Linnéa in Fire in an attempt to kill her; he is later arrested and put on trial in The Key. During the trial, Anna- Karin forces him to confess to his crimes and he ends up getting sent to prison. =Mona Månstråle= The chain-smoking, moody owner of a magic shop in Engelsfors called \\"The Crystal Cave\\", which sells mostly useless artifacts. A natural metal witch herself, Mona has the ability of precognition; she often dispenses vague and sometimes unhelpful advice to the Chosen Ones via her glimpses into the future. She refuses to acknowledge the law of The Council and sees herself as a true neutral player and everything. According to the authors, she is a spoof of Lyria in The Craft. Mona does not appear in the film version. =Max Rosenqvist= Minoo and Anna-Karin's homeroom teacher. He is obsessed with Minoo (who has a crush on him), as she reminds him of his first murder victim, his ex-girlfriend Alice. In The Circle he is revealed to be the demons' Blessed One and the murderer of both Elias and Rebecka. During a battle with the Chosen Ones, Minoo removes the demons' blessing from Max, which causes him to fall into a coma. He later awakens in The Key, re-blessed by the demons, and tries to kill Minoo. However, in his weakened state, he is not able to withstand the power of the demons and ends up dying. =Nicke= The boyfriend of Jannike, Vanessa's mother, and the father of Melvin. He has a strong dislike for Wille and Linnéa. He is dumped by Jannike after Vanessa sees him with another woman. =Wille= Vanessa's boyfriend and Linnéa's ex- boyfriend. A slacker who lives at home with his mother, he is good friends with Jonte, a local drug dealer. He is strongly disliked by Vanessa's mother and Nicke, who view him as an irresponsible trouble-maker. For a short while, he and Vanessa are engaged. In Fire he reveals that he cheated on her with another girl, Elin, and the two break-up because of it. He later gets Elin pregnant. =Olivia Henriksson= Olivia was good friends with Linnéa and Elias, the latter of whom she was in love with. She dyes her hair blue in order to try and fit in more with Elias and Linnéa. She becomes depressed after Elias' death. In Fire, she is revealed to be the demons' new Blessed One. She is eventually stopped by the Chosen Ones, but Olivia manages to kill Ida in the resulting battle. She is held by The Council for a period of time until she later escapes and attempts to kill the Chosen Ones once more in The Key. She is finally killed by Vanessa during a confrontation at Vanessa's home, after killing Vanessa's beloved dog. She had a relationship with Richard, a friend of Gustaf, but she only did it because she liked the attention and was solely interested in Elias. =Helena Malmgren= Elias' mother, who is a priest. In Fire she joins Olivia in a crusade to avenge Elias and bring him back. When Helena realises that Elias would not have wanted her to kill people and refuses to harm any more people, Olivia kills her. =Jari= Anna-Karin's crush. For a time she manipulates him into dating her. In the film, Jari is combined with the character of Kevin. =Jonte= Wille's friend, Jonte is drug dealer who grows marijuana in his basement. In The Circle he has a brief affair with Linnéa. He also owns an unregistered handgun, which Linnéa steals and attempts to use to kill Max. He later is killed in Fire, having had sold drugs to Elias the night before Elias died. =Björn Wallin= Linnéa's alcoholic, estranged father. In Fire he joins \\"Positive Engelsfors\\" and approaches Linnéa and says he doesn't really deserve her forgiveness but that he wants to change. =Rickard= Gustaf's friend and Olivia's lover. Unlike Olivia, his feeling in the relationship where honest and he truly loved her. He became the first to fall under her control and figured out the truth about the Chosen Ones on his own and questions Minoo about it during his and Gustaf's graduation party. Minoo finds out he has magic abillites of his own and becomes a confidant with the Chosen Ones. The Council The Council is an ancient organization which keeps a watchful eye over magic activity across the world and does its best to control it. The Council was originally created to serve the Chosen One, but has since forgotten its original purpose in favor of controlling magical laws and keeping tabs on all prophecies. In recent times, The Council has dismissed the Chosen One(s) to be nothing but myth. =Adriana Lopez= A member of The council and the Chosen Ones' mentor. When she was younger, she once attempted to break her vow of loyalty to The Council; her punishment was to have the fire elemental symbol burned into her chest, which prevents her from lying to The Council until oath by causing her severe physical pain. She is trained, rather than natural, fire witch. Being a non-natural witch, she has very weak powers. At the start of The Circle she is the principle of the school attended by the Chosen Ones, however, she is later forced out of the position. For a while, to prevent her execution, she had all of her memories of the Chosen Ones removed by Minoo; Minoo later restored those memories and broke The Council's bond on Adriana. =Alexander Ehrenskiöld = Adriana's brother. A devoted member of The Council, he is ruthless and power-hungry and is willing to go to extreme lengths to prove his loyalty. He has great disdain for his sister, Adriana, yet he cares for her well being. He has two adopted children, Viktor and Clare, who he saved from an abusive household. Following Walter's treachery and death he becomes the new leader of the council's Swedish division. Having lost his son, Minoo saving his daughter and realised that Walter manipulated him and the Chosen Ones where correct all along he is softer towards the Chosen Ones at the end of The Key. =Viktor Ehrenskiöld = Introduced in Fire. Alexander's adopted son. A natural water witch, he has the ability to detect when someone is lying. Although loyal to The Council, he did not swear a vow to them; he explains to Minoo that he wishes to change The Council for the better from the inside. He is very devoted to his twin sister, Clare and is secretly in love with Vanessa. Through the books, he forms a friendship with Minoo and saves Linnéa's life when Erik tries to murder her. At the end of The Key he his neck is snapped by Walter and he dies immediately. Walter takes his soul to gain his powers, like Max did with Elias and Rebecka. When Walter's soul has been annihilated by Minoo, his soul is set free and passes on. =Clara Ehrenskiöld = Alexander's adopted daughter. A natural air witch, she has the ability to turn invisible; as a child, after turning herself invisible, she found herself unable to become visible again. She has spent most of her life being invisible and is thus very loyal to Viktor and Alexander, two of the few people who know she exists. Unknown to the Chosen Ones, she had sometimes followed them and reported their activities to Viktor. She is able to turn visible again with the help of Minoo. =Walter Hjorth= Walter is the leader of the Swedish division of the Counsel. He sets up an alternative circle to the Chosen Ones. He tries to pass himself off as a reasonable man, but is in secret corrupt and lacks empathy. At the end of The Key, it is revealed that the Demons has tried to corrupt him for a year but he resisted as he thought the Protectors would award him with world domination if he helped stop the Demons. When he realises it was a lie he is blessed by the Demons and kills several members of his circle, including Viktor. However, he is no match for Minoo who annihilates his soul and existence completely.

Miller, first published in 1951. Plot The story is set about two years after the collapse of civilization due to a mysterious disease called neuroderm. The \\"disease\\" is actually caused by a symbiotic micro-organism sent to Earth from another inhabited planet, and is actually beneficial, though seen as disfiguring because of the graying of skin which eventually spreads over the entire body. The story's protagonist, Paul Harris Oberlin, begins the story outside Houston. He has managed to avoid infection so far, but is tiring of a diet of small game and ditch water. Paul has decided to risk exploring a city, figuring that the large, crowded cities are now deserted and, perhaps, offer better opportunities for scavenging. Paul discovers that Houston is now controlled by a strongman named Georgelle, whose followers exterminate any \\"dermies\\" they come across. Unable to stomach the murder of a dermie girl, Paul rescues her and flees Houston. The girl, Willow or \\"Willie\\", was heading for Galveston, familiar to her from visits before the collapse. She has heard that nuns have set themselves up there. Paul takes her to Galveston, hoping to find medical help for her crippling gunshot wound. Paul finds that Galveston Island is an all-dermie colony which had deliberately destroyed all bridges leading from the mainland. There are nuns, and monks, and they provide the leadership for the colony. There is also a scientist who has survived the chaos, and who confirms for Paul the rumors that neuroderm has an extraterrestrial origin. Eventually, Paul overcomes his fears about neuroderm for the sake of Willie, and plans to go with her to some small island until sanity returns to the world. However, the implied threat of Georgelle's people remains, the dermies of Galveston providing a doubly attractive target for their planned expansion: extermination of the dermies, plus a treasure trove of loot, including gasoline and working cars and trucks.

AP&S;) are a British rock band formed in Derby in 1993. History The band initially comprised Paul Miro (vocals), Kettle (guitar) aka Martin Chaisson, real name Martin Smith formerly of Waysted, UFO, If Only and now a music producer/composer, Bart (bass guitar), and Sam Carr (drums).Strong, Martin C. (2001) The Great Metal Discography, MOJO Books, , p. 34 The band was originally called Sacred Cow but changed there name to AP & S around 1993 - 1994. The band explained their new name: \\"An advanced life form came to Earth and mated with what we consider a lower life-form, an ape. The offspring became what we now call humanity...we're now growing organs in pigs for the purpose of being transplanted into humans and eat pigs, one of our closest genetic relatives,\\" although this was not a theory that band believed.Larkin, Colin (1999) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock, Virgin Books, , p. 31 The band signed to the Music for Nations label and released their debut EP, Antiseptic, in November 1994. After a second EP the band released their debut album, Transfusion, in October 1995. All of their recordings for Music For Nations were produced by Simon Efemey. During 1994-96, Apes, Pigs & Spacemen (AP&S;) toured extensively across the UK and Europe, playing with numerous bands, including Warrior Soul, Skid Row, The Wildhearts, Monster Magnet and Freak of Nature. Kettle left the band before work started on the second album, and Miro took over guitar duties. Due to family commitments, drummer, Sam Carr also quit the band during pre-production work on the second album, and was replaced by Laurie Jenkins, with whom Miro had worked on other musical projects. The second album, Snapshot, was released, with a negligible amount of publicity, in June 1997. With no label support, the band financed an independent UK tour before entering into a protracted period of contractual and legal problems. In 2005, founder members Paul Miro & Bart released a self-financed AP&S; album, Free Pawn. They played a handful of UK dates to coincide with the album's release, with Milly Evans on guitar and Tom Meadows on drums. Between 2005-2007, four limited edition EPs Monkey Mettle, Simple Simian, Dirty Monkey, and Fives, were also released via the band's website. Without finance, the band have continually sought to find ways to release AP&S; material. Miro has released four solo albums, Earthly Powers (2007), B.O.A.T.S. (Based on a True Story) (2009), All Stripped Down (a six-album acoustic collection, released 2009), and the pledge-funded Sometimes You Get, Sometimes You Get Got (2012) and produces music for film, radio and TV. AP&S; are currently working on a fourth studio album, Human Zoo, and are planning some live 'Apes acoustic' dates with a revitalised line up, featuring Cain Paisley on guitar and Adam 'Goldie' Goldsmith on drums, in 2014.

He was responsible for the arrest of Toussaint Louverture. He was promoted to command a light infantry demi- brigade at the Fleurus in 1794. He led the unit in François Joseph Lefebvre's division in the 1795, 1796 and 1799 campaigns. He was the son of French general Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet who was guillotined in 1793. Career Brunet became Chef de brigade (colonel) of the 13th Light Infantry Demi- brigade on 26 June 1794. This was the same day as the Battle of Fleurus where the 13th Light fought in François Joseph Lefebvre's division. He was still the commanding officer when this unit became the 25th Light Infantry Demi-brigade on 1 July 1796.Broughton gave a date of 1 July 1795. This is probably a typo because he also stated the 25th Light was not renumbered until 1796. The 13th Light was in Lefebvre's Advance Guard on 1 October during the Rhine Campaign of 1795. The 25th Light fought under Lefebvre at the time of the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September in the Rhine Campaign of 1796. Still in Lefebvre's division, the 25th Light fought at the Battle of Ostrach on 21 March 1799 and the Battle of Stockach on 25 March. The 25th Light was in the 3rd Division at the First Battle of Zurich on 4 June 1799. Brunet was promoted general of brigade on 10 June 1799. He led a brigade in Édouard Mortier's 4th Division at the Second Battle of Zurich on 25–26 September 1799. The division consisted of the 50th, 53rd, 100th and 108th Line Infantry Demi-brigades, the 1st Dragoons and the 8th Chasseurs à Cheval. He assumed the rank of general of division on 7 June 1802. Arrest of Toussaint Loverture Charles Leclerc originally asked Jean-Jacques Dessalines to arrest Louverture, but he declined. the task then fell to Brunet. However accounts differ as to how he accomplished this. One account has it that Brunet pretended that he planned to settle in Saint- Domingue and asked for Toussaint's advice about plantation management. Louverture's memoirs however suggest that Brunet's troops had been provocative, leading Louverture to seek a discussion with him. Embarrassed about his trickery, Brunet absented himself during the arrest. He was captured by the British and not released until 1814.

A tablet stone was dedicated to her memory at the Salem Street Burying Ground in Medford, Massachusetts in 1900.Daughters of the American Revolution magazine: American Monthly Magazine, Volume 17 (1900) p.165. She was born in 1740 as Sarah Bradlee in Dorchester, married John Fulton in 1762 and moved to Medford. She was an active member of Daughters of Liberty and is sometimes referred to as the \\"Mother of the Boston Tea Party\\". Her brother, Nathaniel Bradlee, a carpenter, lived in Boston on the corner of Tremont and Hollis streets. Friends and neighbors, who were Boston's most devoted patriots, regularly gathered to enjoy his codfish suppers on Saturday nights. It was in Bradlee's carpenter shop, that a detachment of \\"Mohawks\\" who \\"turned Boston Harbor into a teapot\\" gathered on the night of the Boston Tea Party. Sarah Fulton and her sister-in-law, Mrs. Bradlee, are credited with disguising Nathanial Bradlee and his compatriots as Mohawks and, later, as transforming them back into \\"respectable Bostonians.\\" A spy, hoping to catch Nathaniel Bradlee \\"in the act,\\" peered into the window, saw the women going about their business, and thought nothing of it. She was involved with the Revolutionary War on several occasions. In June 1775, after the Battle of Bunker Hill, the wounded were brought into town, and the large open space by Wade's Tavern was turned into a field hospital. Because few surgeons were available, the women did their best as nurses. Among them, Sarah Fulton became a leader. She tended to one poor fellow who had a bullet in his cheek. With steady nerves, she removed the bullet and almost forgot about it until years afterwards, when the patriot came to thank her for her service. In March 1776, Major John Brooks came to the house of John Fulton, knowing his patriotism and his intimate knowledge of Boston, and asked him to deliver dispatches by General Washington which must be delivered inside the enemy's lines. When her husband was unable to do the job, she accepted. She dispatched an important message from John Brooks, the mayor of Medford, to George Washington to the Charleston war front. She managed to cross the enemy lines and return home safe. Still later, during the Siege of Boston, she and her husband used their own ship to provide the American troops in Medford with wood and fuel.

The BN-1200 is based on the earlier BN-600 and especially BN-800, with which it shares a number of features. The reactor's name comes from its electrical output, nominally 1220 MWe. Originally part of an aggressive expansion plan including as many as eight BN-Reactors starting construction in 2012, plans for the BN-1200 were repeatedly scaled back until only two were ordered. The first was to begin construction at the Beloyarsk nuclear power plant in 2015, with initial commissioning in 2017, followed by a second unit at the same location. A possible new station known as South Ural would host another two BN-1200s at some future point. In 2015, after several minor delays, problems at the recently completed BN-800 indicated a redesign was needed. Construction of the BN-1200 was put on \\"indefinite hold\\", and Rosenergoatom has stated that no decision to continue will be made before 2019. Background Fast reactors of the BN series use a core running on enriched fuels like highly (80%) or, at least, medium (20%) enriched uranium or plutonium. This design produces many neutrons that are able to escape the core area due to its basic geometry and details of operating cycle. These neutrons are then used to create additional reactions in a \\"blanket\\" of material, normally natural or even depleted uranium or thorium, where respectively new plutonium- or uranium 233 atoms are formed. These atoms have different chemical behavior and can be extracted from the blanket material through basic reprocessing. The resulting plutonium metal can then be mixed with other fuels and used in conventional reactor designs. For the breeding reaction to be positive, producing more fuel than it uses, the neutrons released from the core should retain as much energy as they can. Additionally, as the core is very compact, the heating loads are very high. These requirements both lead to the use of liquid sodium as a coolant, as this is both an excellent conductor of heat, as well as being largely transparent to neutrons. Sodium is also highly flammable, and careful design is needed to build a primary cooling loop that can be safely operated, although sodium fires in air are not very energetic in nature. Alternate designs use lead. Although the plutonium produced by breeders is useful for weapons, there are more traditional designs, notably the graphite-moderated reactor, that generate plutonium more easily. However, these designs deliberately operate at low energy levels for safety reasons, and are not useful for economic electrical generation. It is the breeder's ability to produce more new fuel than was spent while also producing electricity that makes it economically interesting. However, to date the low cost of uranium fuel has made this unattractive. History =Previous designs= The successive Soviet and Russian governments have been experimenting with breeders since the 1960s. In 1973, the first prototype of a power-producing reactor was constructed, the BN-350 reactor, which operated successfully until 1999. This reactor suffered an almost continual series of fires in its sodium coolant, but due to its safety features these were contained. Experience gained in the BN-350 led to a somewhat larger design, the BN-600 reactor, which went into operation in 1980 and continues to run to this day (). Design of a larger plant with the explicit goal of economic fuel production began in 1983 as the BN-800 reactor, and construction began in 1984. By this time the French Superphénix had recently begun operation and was proving to be completely unreliable. A slump in uranium prices added to the concerns, making the breeder concept economically infeasible. The Chernobyl disaster in 1986 led to construction being stopped until new safety systems could be added. BN-800 underwent a major redesign in 1987, and a more minor one in 1993, but construction did not restart until 2006. The reactor did not reach criticality until 2014, and further progress stopped due to problems with the fuel design. It restarted in 2015, and reached full power in August 2016, entering commercial operation. =Design concept= The BN-1200 concept is essentially a further developed BN-800 design with the twin goals of being more economically attractive while also meeting Generation IV reactor safety limits. To improve economics, it uses a new fueling procedure that is simpler than the one on the BN-600 and BN-800 designs, and has an extended design lifetime of 60 years. Safety enhancements are the elimination of outer primary circuit sodium pipelines and a passive emergency heat removal. The design has a breeding ratio of 1.2 to 1.3–1.35 for mixed uranium-plutonium oxide fuel and 1.45 for nitride fuel. Boron carbide would be used for in-reactor shielding. Thermal power should be nominal 2900 MW with an electric output of 1220 MW. Primary coolant temperature at the intermediate heat exchanger is 550 °C and at the steam generator 527 °C. Gross efficiency is expected to be 42%, net 39%. It is intended to be a Generation IV design and produce electricity at RUR 0.65/kWh (US 2.23 cents/kWh). The World Nuclear Association lists the BN-1200 as a commercial reactor, in contrast to its predecessors.http://www.world- nuclear.org/info/Current-and-Future-Generation/Fast-Neutron- Reactors/#tablestyle An even larger design, the BN-1600, was also considered, which was very similar to the BN-1200 in most ways. =Planned construction= OKBM initially expected to commission the first unit with MOX fuel in 2020, bringing on additional units until eight were constructed (11 GWe total output) by 2030. SPb AEP also claims design involvement. Rosenergoatom also considered foreign specialists in its design, with India and China particularly mentioned. In early 2012, Rosatom's Science and Technology Council approved the construction of a BN-1200 reactor at the Beloyarsk Nuclear Power Station. Technical design was scheduled for completion by 2013, and manufacture of equipment would start in 2014. Construction would begin in 2015 with first fuel loads in 2017 and full commercial operation as early as 2020. A second unit, either a BN-1200 or BN-1600, would follow, along with the possibility of a BREST-300 lead-cooled breeder. These plans were approved by Sverdlovsk regional government in June 2012.Large fast reactor approved for Beloyarsk =Current status: on hold, design improvements ongoing= The construction of the BN-1200 till design will be improved to reach economics \\"comparable to VVER-1200\\". As far as design improvements will get certified, no decision to start construction will be made. A total of two BN-1200's remains in Russia's master plan for nuclear buildout, which includes another nine reactors of other types. This reports suggests one BN-1200 in two locations, Beloyarsk and South Urals. The rest are a mix of VVER-600 and VVER- TOI.

The wood forms part of the South Yorkshire Forest and is within an Area of Great Landscape Value. It is owned and managed by the Woodland Trust. History Bagger Wood is an ancient woodland site, dating back to at least 1600. Traditionally a wood of broadleaved trees, a large number of conifers were planted at the site in the 1960s. In 2008, the Woodland Trust began a two-year programme of restoration work to encourage the native broadleaves, using a £10,000 grant from the Waste Recycling Group. Access and management The wood is currently owned by the Woodland Trust, which manages the wood in partnership with a local community group. As with all other Woodland Trust woodlands, Bagger Wood is open to the public, and the Trust estimates that it receives around 3000 visitors per year. There is a circular path through the wood for walkers, and also a forest track through the centre suitable for horse riders. The wood has its own car park. Flora and fauna The wood is a mixture of conifers and broadleaves, such as oak, beech and sycamore. The latter mostly date from the 1930s, while the conifers have been planted more recently.

Andrew Warren (born 27 October 1937 in Kalimpong, North Bengal, India) is a British physical geographer. He is Emeritus Professor of Geography at University College London, UK. Career Warren was born in India to Scottish parents, grew up in India and Scotland, and attended the University of Aberdeen (1st, Geography, 1959) and the University of Cambridge (PhD, Geography, 1967). His doctoral research was on the Qoz region of Kordofan, Sudan, funded by the consultancy Huntings, with whom he had worked as a soil surveyor in Sind, West Pakistan after his undergraduate degree. He became a lecturer in Geography at University College London in 1964, and became Professor in 1995, retiring in 2003. He worked for short periods at Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Israel, the Sultan Qaboos University, Oman, Lund University, and the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA. He lives in central London and is married with two children. Scholarship Warren's contributions are to the understanding of desert sand dunes, desertification in arid lands, and soil erosion by wind. In addition he has contributed to conservation science, editing several books on conservation issues and supervising several PhD students. His contribution to the desertification debate has been to assert the 'social' and 'contextual' nature of desertification processes, as well as the inadequacies of monitoring techniques and broad statements about desertification in drylands up until the 1990s.http://www.simonbatterbury.net/pubs/desertificationarticle.htm Batterbury, S.P.J. & A.Warren. 2001. Desertification. in N. Smelser & P. Baltes (eds.) International Encyclopædia of the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Elsevier Press. Pp. 3526–3529. This has proven controversial, but has helped shift the debate on desertification to one that recognizes dryland peoples as positive agents of change rather than destroyers of fragile ecosystems.Warren A, Agnew C. 1988 An assessment of desertification and land degradation in arid and semi-arid areas. London: IIED 72p. He studied soil erosion in several parts of Africa and the Middle East, but particularly as part of a larger project on livelihoods and environmental change in South West Niger with Adrian Chappell (CSIRO) and Simon Batterbury (Lancaster University/University of Melbourne).http://www.eldis.org/id21ext/1asb1.html Caesium-137 techniques were used to link patterns of soil flux to changes in the livelihoods of Sahelian farming households over 30 years, showing how households with labour shortages had greater net erosion on their fields but sometimes more diversified sources of income. In Europe the EU-funded WHEELS project helped to understand the causation of wind erosion on light agricultural soils. In the mid 2000s Warren participated in an expedition to the Bodélé Depression, northern Chad, dubbed the \\"dustiest place on Earth\\". The team established that the region contributes substantially to global atmospheric dust due to its diatomite and mega-barchan dunes.http://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/research/climate/projects/bodex/bodelereport.pdf The team also argued that dust, displaced into the upper atmosphere and widely dispersed, is a major contributor to terrestrial and oceanic nutrient budgets.Warren A, Chappell A, Todd MC, Bristow C, Drake N, Engelstaedter S, Martins V, M'bainayel S, Washington R. 2007.

His campaigns originated from the overthrow of the Iranian Safavid dynasty by the Hotaki Afghans. In the ensuing collapse and fragmentation of the empire after the capture of the Iranian capital of Isfahan by the Afghans, a claimant to the Safavid throne, Tahmasp II, accepted Nader (who was no more than a petty warlord in Khorasan) into his service. After having subdued north-west Iran as well as neutralising the Abdali Afghans to the east as well as turning Tahmasp II into a vassal, Nader marched against the Hotaki Afghans in occupation of the rest of the country. In a series of incredible victories the Afghans were decimated and Tahmasp II returned to the throne as a restored Safavid monarch. In the aftermath of the Safavid restoration Nader campaigned in the western and northern reaches of the empire to regain territory lost to the Ottomans and Russians. After a bitter war lasting five years Nader had managed to restore the western frontier of Iran as well as reimposed Iranian suzerainty over most of the Caucasus. The legitimacy which his astonishing military achievements brought him allowed a bloodless coup against the Safavid monarchy in which he had the unanimous support of the Iranian ruling elite. Nader Shah's first campaign as the monarch of the newly established Afsharid dynasty was the subjugation of Afghanistan in its entirety. The result of the annexation of Afghanistan by Nader's empire was that he now had a direct path to the invasion of Mughal India. In one of his most extraordinary campaigns he crossed the Khyber pass with only 10,000 men and subsequently descended down into the Mughal heartland where he engaged the Mughal army and despite being outnumbered six to one, crushed his foes in little over three hours. After he had made the Mughal emperor his vassal and marched to Delhi he looted the city and massacred its population after they revolted against his occupation. Nader's return to the empire signaled new wars in the central Asian regions. Nader expanded Iranian hegemony in central Asia to such extents that they surpassed even the old Iranian empires of the Sassanids. At this juncture however Nader was beset by ever worsening mental health as he slowly deteriorated into insanity and paranoia. His subsequent campaigns against the Lezgis in the northernmost reaches of the Caucasus proved to be less successful and his siege of Baghdad was lifted prematurely due to an uncharacteristic lethargy in Nader's generalship. As Nader continued ruinous policies against the inhabitants of the empire and brutal suppression of dissent he alienated many of his subordinates and close associates. He had his heir's eyes gouged out in a fit of delusional paranoia and declared many of his loyal subjects as traitors and rebels, forcing them to erupt in rebellion against him. Nader's last years are characterised by wandering his own empire in a series of barbaric campaigns in which rebellions were put down in the most brutal and cruel manner. One of his very last major battles was a battle near Kars against the Ottomans where he annihilated the Ottoman army sent against him prompting Istanbul to seek terms of peace. He was finally assassinated by a faction of his officers in his own tent. The death of Nader spelt the beginning of an extremely troubled and bloody chapter in Iranian history were continuous civil war engulfed the nation for over half a century before the establishment of the Qajar dynasty under Agha-Mohammad Khan Qajar. Conquest of Khorasan An artist's impression of a gunpowder depot in northern Persia (eighteenth century). = Rebellion & Separation = Revolts swept through the province during the 1720s as a direct consequence of the Afghan revolt in the eastern provinces of the empire which eventually led to an invasion led by the Hotaki leader Mahmud Hotaki. In a pitched battle Mahmud inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Imperial forces sent from Isfehan in the battle of Gulnabad, after which he marched on the capital itself where he captured Isfehan after a terrible siege. A courtier in Isfahan by the name of Malek Mahmoud Sistani reached an accord with the Hotaki Afghan conquerors in which he would set up an independent kingdom in khorasan in exchange for his recognition of Mahmud as Shah of Iran. Sistani entered Khorasan and managed to regain most of Khorasan from the rebels and local warlords in a relatively short period of time with the capital Mashad falling into his hands. At this juncture Nader had established himself in the fortress of kalat north of Mashad and with a mere force of 1,200 men raided Sistani's territory, although they did not come into direct confrontation Nader had established himself as the only real challenge to Sistani's influence in Khorasan. = Tahmasp II and the siege of Mashhad = After the conclusion of the siege of Isfahan Mahmud sent a contingent of his Afghans to subdue Qazvin where a new Safavid pretender Tahmasp had risen and proclaimed himself Shah. He was forced to flee Qazvin but could not stay in the region permanently as those areas not under Afghan control were unremittingly coming under the marching boots of Ottoman soldiers invading from the west. Tahmasp was chased from the west of the country and in Astarabad found a loyal if difficult subject warlord by the name of Fathali Khan of the Qajar clan. Deciding that it was too soon to march on Isfahan to liberate the heartland of Iran they would begin in Khorasan where they could forge alliances and rally more troops under their banner. Marching toward Khorasan they came into contact with Nader whose loyalty they acquired along with his now much enlarged fighting force (Nader had campaigned against the Kurds and successfully incorporated many of them into his small army). A combined force of 30,000 men lay siege to Mashad with Sistani and his commander-in-chief Pir Mohammad trapped within the city's walls. Tahmasp had developed a tense relationship with Fathali Khan and matters came to ahead on October 10, 1726 when Nader brought Tahmasp an intercepted letter, the damning contents of which provided abundant evidence of a clandestine line of communication between Fathali and Sistani. Nader, fearful that the Qajar contingent may leave if any harm befell their leader, advised Tahmasp to spare his life for the time being. Tahmasp, though agreeing with Nader's judgement, nevertheless had Fathali executed the subsequent day. The Qajar contingent however remained with the Loyalist army despite Fathali's beheading and ironically it was a betrayal on the other side of the conflict that brought the siege to an end where Pir Mohammad allowed Nader to infiltrate the city walls forcing Sistani to take refuge in the citadel, surrendering shortly after. = Aftermath of the Siege = The defeated Malek Mahmoud Sistani was surprisingly treated with courtesy and in a show of reconciliatory mercy allowed to spend the rest of his life as a sage (Though he was executed the following year when he became suspect in Nader's eyes). The results of the siege had gifted the capital of Khorasan to Tahmasp as well as gifting Fathali's position to the sole person of Nader as he now took to subdue the remaining Khans and tribes of the province hence further augmenting his forces. His conquest of Khorasan allowed the Safavid loyalist movement to next focus on an expedition further east towards Herat. Conquest of Western Afghanistan A military diagram demonstrating the key manoeuvres in the campaign of Afghanistan The Conquest of Afghanistan by Nader Shah consisted of a series of intermittent and fluid engagements culminating in the finale of Nader's military operations against the Abdali Afghans. Nader having recently concluded a successful campaign against his own monarch and prince, the badly humiliated Tahmasp II, set out from Mashad on May 4, 1729 making sure the Shah also accompanied him on this journey where he could be kept under close supervision. The conflict also bears significance in terms of the effects of Nader's army perfecting its tactical system through experience gained from going up against deadly light cavalry armies, something that would prove of incalculable importance in the battle of Mihmandoost (where the Afghans were given a rude introduction to modern warfare by Nader's well-drilled army). The Abdali forces consisted of 15,000 riders under Allahyar Khan, the governor of Herat, concentrated around Kafer Qal'eh and another detachment of 12,000 men led by an impetuous commander by the name of Zulfaqar Khan which was approaching kafer Qal'eh from the south. In the ensuing ebb and flow of marches and counter marches where dozens of skirmishes, charges, feints, ruses and retreats Nader would find himself hard-pressed to keep the upper hand in a constantly changing battlefield environment where even the weather would prove unpredictable. = The Road to Herat = The battle of Kafer Qal'eh resulted in a tactical victory for Nader after which Allahyar Khan was pursued and re- engaged. At the height of the battle Nader's scouts brought word of Zulfaqar Khans approach prompting Nader to carry out an ingenious ruse. A column of Iranian troops was sent on a march round Allahyar Khan's army with their victory drums & horns sounding loudly which led him to believe that Zulfaqar Khan's men had already been defeated forcing him to beat another hasty retreat.Ghafouri, Ali(2008). History of Iran's wars: from the Medes to now,p. 371. Etela'at Publishing As Allahyar broke away towards Herat Nader dispatched a portion of his army to pursue him but kept the bulk of his men to turn and face the fresh troops under Zulfaqar khan's command, however before Nader engaged Zulfaqar's contingent a sandstorm swept into the area rendering any further fighting all but impossible, thereby providing a cover under which the Abdali forces managed to withdraw towards Herat unmolested. The entire campaign thus far had been a chain of skirmishes, marches and counter marches where Nader excelled as a quick thinking commander who outwitted his foes at every corner despite at times seemingly caught in near impossible situations such as when news of Zulfaqar's imminent arrival reached him when he was already heavily engaged with Allahyar Khan's men. The impressive campaign however did not result in the Abdali's destruction and Nader followed their retreat eastward until he came in view of Herat where the combined forces of Allahyar & Zulfaqar rode out to meet him in a finale to the campaign. = Subjugation of Herat = When battle was joined for the final time in view of Herat itself the action was uncannily similar to the previous engagements between the Iranians and the Abdalis except that on this particular occasion the frontal charge of the Abdalis was firmly halted by muskets of the Iranian line infantry crashing out simultaneously breaking the impetus of the Afghans charge and providing adequate persuasion to the Abdalis to fall behind the city walls. Herat now came under an intense bombardment from the Iranian guns and mortars, convincing the governor of Herat, Allahyar Khan, to sue for peace in exchange for recognition of Iran as suzerain of Herat. = Strategic & Tactical Ramifications = With the Abdalis in Herat brought into orbit the road now lay open to the heartland of the Iranian empire and the liberation of Isfahan seemed feasible given the successes of the previous campaigns. Nader had also demonstrated the effectiveness of his military system and through numerous engagements had perfected the art and technique of overcoming fierce cavalry charges by steady infantry formations supported by cannon and guarded by cavalry on the flanks where the combined fire of musketry & cannon-fire would break the charge of the mounted assailants. This tactical system would be put to the ultimate test in the battles of Mihmandust & Murche-Khort by Nader's veteran troops going up against the very best of the cavalry the oriental world had to offer. Safavid Restoration The Safavid restoration to the throne of Iran took place in the latter part of 1729 by a series of battles fought between Nader, Tahmasp's commander-in-chief and Ashraf Hotaki. Despite nominally bringing Tahmasp to the seat of power, true authority still rested with Nader who had, ever since the debacle in northern Khorasan, managed to seize Tahmasp II as his vassal. As for Afghan rule, the Ghilzai Afghans were ejected from the Iranian Plateau permanently and in the following years were re-annexed by Nader whence they were once again absorbed into the Iranian empire. = Battle of Mihmandoost = Having delayed a confrontation with Tahmasp long enough, Ashraf found himself threatened by the pretender to the Safavid throne and his young general Nader. Hearing of their expedition against the Abdali of Herat Ashraf decided to march on the capital of Khorasan and capture Mashad before Nader could return from the east. However Nader was back in Mashad well before Ashraf had a chance of invading Khorasan. Marching towards Damghan Nader and Ashraf clashed near the village of Mihmandoost where despite being heavily outnumbered the Iranians gave the Afghans a terribly bloody lesson in modern warfare and crushed Ashraf's army forcing him to retire towards Semnan. = Ambush at Khwar pass = Ashraf retreated west where he set up a well thought out ambush in the Khwar pass where he hoped the Iranians, flushed with their recent triumph, would be surprised and dealt a heavy blow. Nader upon discovering the ambush encircled and then completely destroyed it with whatever remnants fleeing towards Isfahan. = Battle of Murche-Khort = Requesting urgent support from the Ottoman Empire Ashraf sought to counter the Iranian army's thrust towards Isfahan. The Ottomans keen to hold Ashraf in power instead of seeing a resurgent Iran on their eastern frontier were all too eager to help with both guns and artillerymen. At the battle of Murche-Khort the Afghans were yet again decisively defeated forcing Ashraf to flee south. = Liberation of Isfahan = Isfahan (here depicted from the north-to-south direction), as the capital of Iran, was the ultimate objective of Nader's campaign for the liberation of Iran from Hotaki rule Nader liberated Isfahan and soon after received Tahmasp II outside the main city gates where the Shah expressed his gratitude to Nader. The city had been devastated by the Afghans leaving very little in terms of riches for when Nader arrived. Tahmasp famously weeped when he saw what had befallen the capital. The city was greatly reduced both in terms of population and in terms of wealth. The people took vengeance on those Afghans who were found hiding throughout the city. = End of Afghan rule in Iran = Nader set out from Isfahan heading towards Shiraz where Ashraf was busy raking together what he could with the support of some of the local Arab tribes. At this juncture there was no realistic hope for a revival of Afghan fortunes and near Zarghan the Iranian engaged and decimated the last army Ashraf commanded, with historical sources disagreeing on his exact fate in the aftermath of the battle. Campaign of Western Iran Western Iran, Kermanshah Province Nader's first Ottoman Campaign was his first against perhaps his most formidable of adversaries, namely the Ottomans, where he proved triumphant in conquest. The great successes of his expedition, however, were rendered null when Shah Tahmasp II decided to take personal command of the theatre in Nader's absence, forcing a furious Nader to return and rectify the situation after forcing Tahmasp's abdication in favour of his infant son Abbas III. = The Ottoman occupation = The Ottomans had entered the western regions of the country in the early 1720s when the Hotaki invasion of Mahmud I was launched against the Safavid state. In a decisive engagement near Gulnabad, Mahmud Hotaki managed a surprising victory against a far greater (though severely divided) Iranian army. The route of the imperial army allowed him to march on the capital Isfahan which he captured after a 6-month siege that caused unheard misery and loss of life in the city. During the chaos of the Safavid overthrow, the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire seized on this opportunity to annex as much land as they could with Ottoman Turkey taking western Iran and dividing the Caucasus up with the Russians. Soon the Hotaki conquerors installed a new leader as king through a coup de'tat in which Mahmud I was replaced with a capable cousin of his; Ashraf. Ashraf marched west to put a halt to any further expansion by the Ottomans and to the surprise of many defeated them. The diplomatic outcome however was very much reconciliatory as the Ottomans promised recognition of Ashraf as the legitimate Shah of Iran in exchange for Ashraf's acknowledgement of Ottoman rule in their new territories in the Caucasus and western Iran. As Nader and Ashraf came head-to-head in a conflict that would decide the fate of the country, the Ottomans wisely supported Ashraf against the Safavid loyalists as a resurgent Iran under an ambitious and talented general who would be flushed with the success of conquest would not bode well for the Ottomans hold on their newly acquired provinces. Despite support from the Turks, Nader still managed to completely destroy Ashraf's forces in numerous engagements which led to re-establishing the Safavid state under the nominal rule of Tahmasp II. Istanbul's fears had been realised as Nader would certainly turn to liberating the lost territories of the empire. The Ottomans however had been present in the west of the country for close to a decade and would prove a very formidable challenge to any efforts at their expulsion from what now formed the eastern boundaries of their empire. = Nader marches on Nahavand = On March 9, 1730, the Iranian army exited Shiraz and in a leisurely manner celebrated the new year (Nowruz), after which Nader commenced a rapid forced march westward in the hope of catching the Ottomans off balance. Reaching Ottoman-occupied town of Nahavand via Luristan, Nader put the Turks here to flight towards Hamadan, where, recovering from their initial shock and panic, they regrouped and presented themselves in the valley of Malayer to give battle in the hope of ending the Iranian advance on Hamadan. = The Battle of Malayer Valley = a military diagram of the battle of Malayer valley The Ottoman force arrayed in front of the Iranian army was of a different nature altogether from all the previous foes the Iranian army had faced up to this point. The Afghan and tribal opponents of Nader had been almost completely devoid of any infantry or artillery units (excluding Murche-Khort), comprised almost exclusively of excellent mounted warriors instead. Now Nader faced an adversary who in many respects mirrored the Iranian army's own composition in structure as well as constituent unit types. The Turks had drawn themselves up parallel to a stream flowing through the valley, on the other side of which Nader deployed his men into three separate divisions, placing himself in the centre. As the two armies came within musket range of each other, a general fire broke out along the entire length of the line, with the smoke created from the muskets & cannon dancing over shallow body of water separating the two armies, obscuring the Iranians and Ottomans from each other's view. Nader, under the veil of smoke, started strengthening and preparing his right wing for a bold gamble. The battle of Malayer Valley opened the road to Hamadan Nader gave the order for a sudden thrust by his right flank across the stream. The Iranians appeared from the billowing cloud of smoke that had concealed their advance and threw the Ottomans, who were dazzled by the unexpected appearance of the enemy seemingly out of thin air, into disarray. An intense few hours of fighting followed, with the Ottomans attempting to salvage their left to no avail. The onslaught of the Iranian right cut further into the flesh of the Turk's left wing and the killing of the chief Ottoman Bannerman caused a much demoralised army to turn tail and flee, with Iranian cavalry in pursuit cutting down and imprisoning a large number of men. A clear victory was won, opening the road to Hamadan for Nader's troops. = Nader pivots north = After liberating Hamadan along with its 10,000 imprisoned Iranian soldiers, Nader gained Kermanshah, thus liberating large swathes of western Iran from Ottoman rule. Leaving behind a fortified position, he now moved his army to Azerbaijan, where he took Tabriz on August 12, crushing an army sent (too late) to reinforce Tabriz. The Turkish prisoners were treated kindly, with Nader freeing many of the Pashas, dispatching them with messages of peace to Constantinople (Istanbul). In a lightning campaign Nader had reincorporated all the main provinces of the Iranian heartland. Tahmasp's Campaign The Campaign of Tahmasp was a failed attempt to launch an offensive into Ottoman held Caucasus which ended in a disastrous defeat with all of Nader's gains during the previous year being lost. The result of this particular military catastrophe was still overturned with Nader's return from the east but would have much more significant impact on the Safavid dynasty itself as Tahmasp II sealed his own fate by initiating this ill-fated expedition. Nader had to cancel his planned invasion of Ottoman held Caucasus territory in light of the fact that the Abdali Afghans had rebelled and invaded Khorasan, besieging its provincial capital Mashhad. Gathering and training new recruits during the winter of 1731 in northern Iran he set out eastwards to secure the right flank of the empire. Tahmasp II who sat observantly on the newly regained throne (which he owed to Nader) was cajoled by his courtiers into taking to the field himself. Although Michael Axworthy and many other historians accuse Tahmasp of being motivated primarily by jealousies caused by his illustrious commander- in-chief's incessant victories there is reason to suspect his decision was in fact induced by court intrigue amongst the imperial entourage eager to have their Shah outshine Nader and thereby lessen his influence. = The Campaign and Siege of Yerevan= At this time in Constantinople, Patrona Halil, a mob rebellion had produced a change in leadership bringing Mahmud I to power. Sultan Mahmud I appointed a half-Venetian statesman to command in the east at the head of an army which would prove Tahmasp's undoing. Aiming to cloak the Caucasus under Iranian hegemony as in the time of his forefathers Tahmasp aimed to conquer Chokhur-e Sa'd, Georgia and Daghestan from the Turks. An army of 18,000 was led into Chokhur-e Sa'd were Tahmasp found himself scoring a victory over an Ottoman army near Yerevan. Hakimoghlu Khan reacted immediately by setting out to break the siege of Yerevan. Realizing Tahmasp had not taken any precaution to guard his line of communication southwards Hakimoghlu cut Tahmasp's logistical line to Tabriz forcing him to withdraw break of the siege and take the road back to Tabriz. Hearing of Ahmad Pasha entering west Iran with the intention of taking Kermanshah and Hamadan, Tahmasp was now caught in a dire situation. As the Iranian and Ottoman armies came into view of each other numerous letters were being exchanged between Ahmad Pasha and Tahmasp. The Iranian army was largely composed of raw recruits (the veterans campaigning far in the east under Nader) and was formed up in the traditional manner of three divisions making up the centre and the flanks. There seems to have been an unintentional initiation of musketry by the inexperienced Iranian infantry leading to a pitched battle where the Iranian cavalry on either flank overcame their counterparts but were let down by the nervous infantry in the centre who were easily put to flight by the advance of the Janissaries which now turned to aid their mounted comrades in a counter-attack on the Iranian horsemen routing them in turn also. Tabriz also fell to Hakimoghlu Khan with Ahmad Pasha complementing his gains by capturing Hamadan. Tahmasp was obliged to sign a treaty by which he accepted Ottoman suzerainty over the Caucasus and in exchange he would be given back Tabriz, Hamadan and kermanshah. The conclusion of his incompetence in this foreign venture had resulted in signing one of the most humiliating treaties of his dynasty although this seemed to weigh little on his mind as he soon returned to Isfahan to resume a magnificently opulent lifestyle. On discovering the cataclysmic events that had unfolded in the west Nader abandoned any further conquest in the east to return to Isfahan with much justified anger at the Shah's inept statesmanship which must have been all the more infuriating as Nader's impressive achievements against the Ottomans during the previous year had become utterly irrelevant. This gave Nader the political ammunition to force Tahmasp II to abdicate in favour of his infant son Abbas III in effect making Nader the supreme and unchallenged authority in the realm paving the way for his eventual overthrow of the Safavid dynasty altogether. Mesopotamian Campaign Ottoman Near East before the war As a direct result of Tahmasp II's blunders in his ill-fated invasion of the Ottoman Caucasus all of Nader's previous gains in the theatre were lost and a humiliating treaty had been signed giving away hegemony over the Caucasus to Istanbul. This settlement gave Nader the authority to force Tahmasp's abdication and resume the war against the Turks by launching an invasion of Ottoman Iraq and Mesopotamia. = The Strike into Kurdistan = Ottoman held Iraq seemed a peculiar choice for Nader's invasion as all the western territories of Iran were restored under the ignominious treaty signed by Tahmasp with the Caucasus under Turkish control. Axworthy speculates that Nader intended to seize Baghdad as a bargaining chip in exchange for the Caucasus but with Baghdad being such a strategic prize in itself it is rather doubtful any civil exchange of territory was held in mind at the time at all. Despite the unexpected choice of theatre the Ottomans in the region were well prepared to receive the Iranians. To achieve a modicum of surprise Nader decided upon a march through the mountains as opposed to a direct advance against the fortified border town of Zohab near Qasr-e Shirin. The mountain path was a difficult and snowy route to negotiate and some amongst the soldiers perished but Nader managed to get his 600 men to descend down into the valley behind the Ottoman battlements and without hesitation struck in the dead of night. Completely out-witted by Nader the garrison of Zohab woke up and fled their posts in terror. Nader ordered a new fort to be built and moved south to join the main Iranian army that had left Hamadan and was heading to Baghdad. = Crossing the Tigris = Besieging Kirkuk with a residue force of 7,000 the main Iranian army marched on until they defeated an Ottoman army near Baghdad and then proceeded to encircle the city itself in preparation for a siege after a hard fought campaign of manoeuvre were Nader managed to cross the Tigris. Ahmad Pasha would prove a stubborn defender of the city and held out until the approach of a relief effort in the form of an army of 80,000 under Topal Pasha. = The Battle of Samara = In a cunning ruse Topal drew Nader into a disadvantageous battle where despite losing a quarter of his own men Topal inflicted a crushing defeat on the Iranian army, half of which was destroyed and all its guns lost. This monumental victory allowed the lifting of the siege further to the south where Ahmad Pasha- having heard of Topal Osman's victory -came out with an enthusiastic garrison to chase away the 12,000 Iranians left to maintain the blockade of Baghdad. = The Battle of Kirkuk = Making an almost fantastical recovery from his seemingly irreplaceable losses Nader rebuilt his army in an incredibly short amount of time and invaded Ottoman Iraq once more. After some minor frontier skirmishing he sent Haji Beg Khan to lure out Topal Pasha which he succeeded in doing. The Ottoman advance guard was set upon drowned under the waves of a ferocious ambush after which Nader gathered his men and marched directly against the main Ottoman army nearby. An intense musketry duel was kept up along the entire breadth of the line until Nader ordered his infantry unsheathe their sabres and charge the Ottomans, supporting them with a pincer movement by his cavalry reserve which put Topal Osman's army in a cauldron of Iranian troops. The Turks crumbling in the face of this manoeuvre found that not even the presence of the old fox in the person of Topal Pasha could rally them and fled leaving all their guns. Nader however could not pursue his impressive conquest due to a growing uprising in southern Iran which required his immediate attention. Therefore, Baghdad was yet again saved from falling into Iranian hands. The campaign itself did not decide the fate of the war but set the stage for Nader's Caucasus campaign in 1735 where through a shattering defeat of the Ottomans at Baghavard, Istanbul was brought to its knees. Afghan Revolt = Zulfaqar Khan's Revolt = As the Iranian empire set about re-incorporating the lost territories to the west, Hussein sultan of Qandahar intrigued the Abdalis of Herat to raise against their masters while the main Iranian forces were arrayed against the Ottomans thousands of kilometres to the west. The governor of Herat, Allahyar Khan, who was confirmed in his position by Nader after his the war of in 1729 remained loyal but his chief lieutenant Zulfaqar Khan was very much taken by Qandahar's assurances and support. = The siege of Mashad = Allahyar Khan was obliged to flee Herat and was given refuge by Nader's brother Ibrahim Khan. The Abdalis soon invaded Khorasan itself and marched on its capital, Mashad, defeating the Iranian under Ibrahim Khan and forcing it to withdraw into the city walls which now came under siege. Although the Abdalis had little chance of actually taking the city as what little artillery they possessed would make hardly any impression on the battlements of Mashad, these events shook Nader who received word that his power base back in Khorasan was under threat. On August 16 Nader left Tabriz behind and marched his force across 2,250 kilometres over the Iranian plateau with lightning speed, bringing him Mashad where he found the Abdalis in headlong retreat. = Siege of Herat = Hussein Hotaki was growing increasingly anxious about his position in Qandahar with Nader approaching Herat, prompting him to enter into negotiations with Nader in which he sent back a few captive Safavid princesses. Hussein sultan's support for his proxy, Zulfaqar Khan, however did not cease or even lessen – in fact a Ghilzai force of at least a few thousand strong commanded by Mohammad Seidal Khan was sent from Qandahar to support him. The Iranian army arrived during April 1731 in the town of Noghreh just a few short kilometres from Herat itself, whence they fanned out and to take hold of the towers and strongholds in Herat's environs. During one of these nights Nader's small entourage of a mere eight musketeers were trapped in an isolated tower when Seidal Khan carried out a surprise raid. Fortunately for Nader a unit of musketeers happened upon the Afghan cavalry encircling his tower and put the enemy to flight. At a later date after crossing over a bridge over Harrirud, the Iranians beat back a large counterattack by the Afghans forcing them to retire behind the walls of Herat's citadel. On a particular night when Nader was resting in his tent, an Afghan cannon from the citadel walls fired a random shot, lobbing a round ball through the roof of the tent with it landing right next to Nader's bed as he was resting causing his followers to claim he had divine protection. The final decisive engagement took place outside the city when Zulfaqar Khan and Seidal Khan agreed to a joint coordinated attack against the Iranians. The attack was decimated when Nader sent a flanking force round the Afghans and himself rode directly against their front with a large body of cavalry. The defeat caused Seidal Khan's departure which in turn led to the remaining defenders of Herat asking for terms of submission. = Allahyar Khan's Betrayal = Under the treaty signed by both sides Allahyar Khan was returned his governorship of Herat with Zulfaqar Khan being exiled to Farah. Nader did not however militarily occupy the citadel – an action which would prove a terrible mistake when 4,000 fighters came down from Farah an stoked the fires of rebellion once more. Allahyar Khan was pressured despite his reluctance to join the revolt. Allahyar Khan was also exiled. The siege of the citadel was hence resumed with the Afghan's sending peace emissaries once they realised their predicament. The negotiations lasted a long while but were eventually concluded, giving Zulfaqar Khan and his brother a chance to escape to Qandahar whilst Herat came under occupation but was surprisingly not looted or sacked by Nader's troops. Ibrahim Khan managed to conquer Farah, helping to pacify the region as a whole in addition to Nader's policies of forced migration for many of the tribes involved in the rebellion as well as incorporating many of their fighters into his own armed forces. Conquest of the Caucasus An artist's illustration of an Armenian-Iranian border town in the Caucasus After Nader put down the revolt in Afghanistan, he was able to continue his invasion of the Ottoman Empire and the Caucasus which ended in an Iranian victory allowing Nader to recast Iranian hegemony over almost the entire Caucasus, region, reconconquering it for the Safavid state. = Strategic Context = Nader's decisive victory at Baghavard destroyed any hope of the Crimean Tatars joining the main Ottoman army on the field. The Caucasus had fallen under Ottoman control since 1722 with the collapse of the Safavid state. The first target of the campaign was the reconquering of the Shirvan Khanate, with its capital Shamakhi falling in August 1734 freeing up the Iranian forces to march west and lay siege to Ganja. The battlements of Ganja as well as its garrison of 14,000 soldiers provided a formidable defence. After Tahmasp Khan Jalayer engaged and routed a joint Ottoman and Crimean Tatar force in the south east Caucasus Nader cut their line of retreat further west dealing them another crippling blow, scattering them into the mountains north. The mountains to the north in Avarestan made any pursuit of the defeated foe a daunting prospect especially considering the approach of winter, so Nader chose to turn west and besiege Ganja where he was drawn into an intense effort to capture the surprisingly formidable fortress. The Iranian artillery was still severely lacking in strong siege guns and consisted mostly of field batteries which were effective in battles but unable to make significant impact against city walls and battlements. Failing in their siege artillery capacity the Iranians sent sappers to dig underground to reach the citadels walls from beneath but the Turks received timely intelligence reports revealing the intention of the besiegers. Tunnelling underground the Iranians and Ottomans burrowed into each other's way whence they came to grips in hand- to-hand combat. The Iranians were able to detonate six charges killing 700 Ottoman defenders but still failed in their main object of destroying the citadels walls. The Iranians also lost some 30 to 40 men themselves. Nader also blockaded Yerevan and Tiflis forcing a response from the Ottoman 'Saraskar' Koprulu Pasha. Istanbul had found the preliminary negotiations by Ahmad Pasha, governor of Ottoman Baghdad unsatisfactory and sent an enormous army consisting of 50,000 cavalry, 30,000 janissaries and 40 cannon to be commanded by Koprulu Pasha foe the defence of Ottoman possessions in the region. = The Battle of Yeghevārd = Nader having besieged many of the key cities and fortresses in the area awaited the arrival of Koprulu Pasha's main army of some 130,000 men according to Nader's court historian Mirza Mehdi Astarabadi, prompting Nader to gather his advance guard of around 15,000 men and march them westwards to engage the relief army under Koprulu Pasha. By the time the main Iranian army of 40,000 reached the scene of the battle Nader, despite the enormous disparity in numbers, routed the Ottomans, forcing Istanbul to finally sign a peace recognizing Iranian control of the Caucasus and the border in Mesopotamia already agreed to in the treaty of Zuhab. The crushing defeat at Baghavard also provided sufficient persuasion to retreat for the 50,000 Crimean Tatars who were commanded by the Turkish Sultan to march south along the coast of the Black Sea descending down into the Caucasus in order to aid Koprulu Pasha's forces. Conquest of India Emperor Nader Shah, the Shah of Iran (1736–47) and founder of the Afsharid dynasty, invaded the Mughal Empire with a fifty-five thousand strong army, eventually attacking Delhi in March 1739. His army had easily defeated the Mughals at the battle at Karnal and would eventually capture the Mughal capital in the aftermath of the battle. Nader Shah's victory against the weak and crumbling Mughal Empire in the far East meant that he could afford to turn back and resume war against Iran's archrival, the neighbouring Ottoman Empire, but also the further campaigns in the North Caucasus and Central Asia. = Invasion = A map of the Kheibar campaign, illustrating Nader's incredible 80 kilometre flank-march Nader Shah at the Sack of Delhi – Battle scene with Nader Shah on horseback Nader Shah became the Iranian ruler in 1736, his troops captured Esfahan from the Safavid dynasty and founded the Afsharid dynasty in that year. In 1738, Nader Shah conquered Kandahar, the last outpost of the Hotaki dynasty, he, then, began to launch raids across the Hindu Kush mountains into Northern India, which, at that time, was under the rule of the Mughal Empire. The Mughal empire had been weakened by ruinous wars of succession in the three decades following the death of Aurangzeb. The Muslim nobles had asserted their independence whilst the Hindu Marathas of the Maratha Empire had captured vast swathes of territory in Central and Northern India. Its ruler, Muhammad Shah, proved unable to stop the disintegration of the empire. The imperial court administration was corrupt and weak whereas the country was extremely rich whilst Delhi’s prosperity and prestige was still at a high. Nader Shah, attracted by the country's wealth, sought plunder like so many other foreign invaders before him. Nader had asked Muhammad Shah to close the Mughal frontiers around Kabul so that the Afghan rebels he was fighting against, may not seek refuge in Kabul. Even though the Emperor agreed, he practically took no action. Nader seized upon this as a pretext for war. Together with his Georgian subject Erekle II (Heraclius II), who took part in the expedition as a commander leading a contingent of Georgian troops,David Marshall Lang. Russia and the Armenians of Transcaucasia, 1797–1889: a documentary record Columbia University Press, 1957 (digitalised March 2009, originally from the University of Michigan) p 142 the long march had begun. He defeated his Afghan enemies fleeing into the Hindu Kush and also seized major cities in the region such as Ghazni on May 31st, Kabul on June 19, and Peshawar (November 18), before advancing onto the Punjab and capturing Lahore. Nader advanced to the river Indus before the end of year as the Mughals mustered their army against him. At the Battle of Karnal on 13 February 1739, Nader led his army to victory over the Mughals, Muhammad Shah surrendered and both entered Delhi together. The keys to the capital of Delhi were surrendered to Nader. He entered the city on 20 March 1739 and occupied Shah Jehan’s imperial suite in the Red Fort. Coins were struck, and prayers said, in his name in the Jama Masjid and other Delhi mosques. The next day, the Shah held a great durbar in the capital. =Massacre= Nader shah watching the dead bodies of his soldiers murdered by Delhi people The Iranian occupation led to price rises in the city. The city administrator attempted to fix prices at a lower level and Iranian troops were sent to the market at Paharganj, Delhi to enforce them. However, the local merchants refused to accept the lower prices and this resulted in violence during which some Iranians were assaulted and killed. When a rumour spread that Nader had been assassinated by a female guard at the Red Fort, some Indians attacked and killed Iranian troops during the riots that broke out on the night of 21 March. Nader, furious at the killings, retaliated by ordering his soldiers to carry out the notorious qatl-e-aam (qatl = killing, aam = publicly, in open) of Delhi. On the morning of 22 March, the Shah rode out in full armour and took a seat at the Sunehri Masjid of Roshan-ud-dowla near the Kotwali Chabutra in the middle of Chandni Chowk. He then, to the accompaniment of the rolling of drums and the blaring of trumpets, unsheathed his great battle sword in a grand flourish to the great and loud acclaim and wild cheers of the Iranian troops present. This was the signal to start the onslaught and carnage. Almost immediately, the fully armed Iranian army of occupation turned their swords and guns on to the unarmed and defenceless civilians in the city. The Iranian soldiers were given full licence to do as they pleased and promised a share of the booty as the city was plundered. Areas of Delhi such as Chandni Chowk and Dariba Kalan, Fatehpuri, Faiz Bazar, Hauz Kazi, Johri Bazar and the Lahori, Ajmeri and Kabuli gates, all of which were densely populated by both Hindus and Muslims, were soon covered with corpses. Muslims, like Hindus and Sikhs, resorted to killing their women, children and themselves rather than submit to the Iranians. In the words of the Tazkira: Muhammad Shah was forced to beg for mercy.Axworthy p.8 These horrific events were recorded in contemporary chronicles such as the Tarikh-e-Hindi of Rustam Ali, the Bayan-e-Waqai of Abdul Karim and the Tazkira of Anand Ram Mukhlis. Finally, after many hours of desperate pleading by the Mughals for mercy, Nader Shah relented and signalled a halt to the bloodshed by sheathing his battle sword once again. =Casualties= It has been estimated that during the course of six hours in one day, 22 March 1739, something like 20,000 to 30,000 Indian men, women and children were slaughtered by the Iranian troops during the massacre in the city.Marshman, P. 200 Exact casualty figures are uncertain, as after the massacre, the bodies of the victims were simply buried in mass burial pits or cremated in grand funeral pyres without any proper record being made of the numbers cremated or buried. =Plunder= A replica of the Koh-i Noor Diamond taken by Nader Shah, along with many other gems, as a trophy of war The city was sacked for several days. An enormous fine of 20 million rupees was levied on the people of Delhi. Muhammad Shah handed over the keys to the royal treasury, and lost the Peacock Throne, to Nader Shah, which thereafter served as a symbol of Iranian imperial might. Amongst a treasure trove of other fabulous jewels, Nader also gained the Koh-i-Noor and Darya-ye Noor (\\"Mountain of Light\\" and \\"Sea of Light,\\" respectively) diamonds; they are now part of the British and Iranian Crown Jewels, respectively. Iranian troops left Delhi at the beginning of May 1739. = Aftermath = Nader Shah sitting upon the Peacock Throne after his victory at the Battle of Karnal. One occasion during Nadir Shah's invasion of India. The Shah of Persia had overrun the Punjab and plundered Delhi in the early months of 1739. On the way back, he decided to avoid the heat of the plains. So he took a northerly route at the bottom of the Shivalik hills. It happened that a number of Sikhs were passing their days hiding out in those very hills. They decided to plunder the plunderer and relieve the foreign invader of his ill gotten treasures. They fell on the rear of the trailing units of his army. They took away so much of his booty that the astonished Nadir Shah stopped at Lahore where he asked the man he had assigned to govern Lahore, \\"Who are these people who have dared to interfere with my onward march? Who are these bold mischief-makers\\"? Zakriya Khan replied, \\"They are a group of fakirs who visit their Guru's tank at Amritsar twice a year. After bathing they disappear.\\" \\"Where do they live ?\\" asked Nadir Shah. \\"Their saddles are their homes,\\" replied the governor. \\"Take care\\", said Nadir Shah, \\"the day is not far off when they will take possession of your country.\\"Nadir Shah's remark had cut Zakriya Khan and later this affected a larger campaign against the Sikhs. The plunder seized from Delhi was so rich that Nader stopped taxation in Iran for a period of three years following his return.This section: Axworthy pp.1–16, 175–210 Nader Shah's victory against the crumbling Mughal Empire in the East meant that he could afford to turn to the West and face the Ottomans. The Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I initiated the Ottoman-Iranian War (1743–1746), in which Muhammad Shah closely cooperated with the Ottomans until his death in 1748. Nader's Indian campaign alerted, as a far off foreign invader, also the British East India Company to the extreme weakness of the Mughal Empire and the possibility of expanding to fill the power vacuum.Axworthy p.xvi Conquest of Central Asia An Iranian slave in captivity in central Asia. The Khanates beyond the Iranian Empires border carried out regular raids into the border towns and villages which they would sack and loot. During the mid-eighteenth century the Iranian empire of Nader Shah embarked upon the conquest and annexation of the Khanates of Bukhara and Khiva . The initial engagements were fought in the late 1730s by Nader Shah's son and viceroy Reza Qoli Mirza who gained a few notable victories in this theatre while Nader was still invading India to the south. Reza Qoli's invasions of Khiva angered Ilbares khan, the leader of Khiva. When Ilbares threatened to make a counterattack Nader ordered hostilities to cease despite his son's successes and later returned victoriously from Delhi to embark on a decisive campaign himself. After annexing Khiva he executed Ilbares and replaced him with Abu ol-Fayz Khan, who Nader considered to be more accepting of Nader's overlordship. The conflict resulted in the most overwhelming Iranian triumph against the khanates of Central Asia in modern history and with the admixture of his previous annexation in northern India, Nader's empire in the east surpassed all other Iranian empires before it, all the way back to the Sassanians and Achaemenids of antiquity.svat soucek, a history of inner asia page 195: in 1740 Nader Shah, the new ruler of Iran, crossed the Amu Darya and, accepting the submission of Muhammad Hakim Bi which was then formalized by the acquiescence of Abulfayz Khan himself, proceeded to attack Khiva. When rebellions broke out in 1743 upon the death of Muhammad Hakim, the shah dis- patched the ataliq’s son Muhammad Rahim Bi, who had accompanied him to Iran, to quell them. Mohammad hakim bi was ruler of the khanate of bukhara at that time. link: http://librarun.org/book/63545/195 Conquest of Daghestan The conflict between the Iranian Empire & the Dagestan people was intermittently fought through the mid-1730s during Nader's first campaign in the Caucasus until the very last years of his reign and assassination in 1747. The incredibly difficult terrain of the northern Caucasus region made the task of subduing the Dagestan people an extremely challenging one. Despite this Nader Shah gained numerous strongholds and fortresses from the Dagestan people and pushed them to the very verge of defeat. The Dagestan people however held on in the northernmost reaches of Daghestan and continued to defy Iranian domination. The conflict was fought over many years and only included a few years of actual hard fighting, usually when Nader himself was present, but otherwise consisted of skirmishes and raids throughout. The majority of the Iranian casualties were from the extremity of the weather as well as the outbreak of disease, all of which combined with the indomitable will of the Dagestan people to wage an insurgency and retreat to their distant strongholds when threatened with a pitched battle made the entire war a quagmire for Nader's forces. Ultimately the Dagestan people who had held on in the northern fortresses marched south upon hearing of Nader's assassination and reclaimed most of their lost territories as the Iranian empire crumbled. Invasion of the Persian Gulf Bandar-e-Bushehr, historically one of Persia's most important port cities around the Persian gulf The Afsharid Conquest of the Persian Gulf was an imperial venture by the Iranian Empire, ruled by Nader Shah, to establish Iran as the hegemon of the Persian gulf and its surroundings. The numerous campaigns that were undertaken were initially very successful and achieved a great many objectives however the rebellion of Nader's appointed Darya Salar (Admiral), Mohammad Taqi Khan, wreaked havoc amongst the plethora of polities across the Persian gulf that had been brought under Iranian control and even after the defeat and capture of Mohammad Taqi Khan the Iranian empire was going through a tumultuous period of unrelenting civil strife and internal war due to Nader's increasingly brutal rule which made the empire collapse in the immediate aftermath of his assassination, leading to many of the conquests in the region to be lost. Second Ottoman War Tabriz' city gates; Tabriz was the centre of political and military might of the Iranian empire in the southern Caucasus Nader attempted to ratify the Treaty of Constantinople (1736), by demanding that the Ja'fari, a small Shi'ite sect was to be accepted as a fifth legal sect of Islam.Nicolae Jorga: Geschiste des Osmanichen vol IV, (trans: Nilüfer Epçeli) Yeditepe Yayınları, 2009, , p. 371 In 1743, Nader Shah declared war on the Ottoman Empire. He demanded the surrender of Baghdad. The Iranians had captured Baghdad in 1623 and Mosul in 1624, but the Ottomans had recaptured Mosul in 1625 and Bagdad in 1638. The Treaty of Zuhab in 1639 between the Ottoman Empire and the Safavid Empire had resulted in peace for 85 years. After the fall of the Safavid Dynasty, Russia and the Ottoman Empire agreed to divide the northwest and the Caspian region of Iran, but with the advent of Nader Shah, the Russians and the Turks withdrew from the region. Nader Shah waged war against the Ottomans from 1730 to 1736 but it ended with a stalemate. Nader Shah afterwards turned east and declared war on the Moghul Empire and invaded India, in order to refund his wars against the Ottomans.. =The war= The Battle of Kars (1745) was the last major field battle Nader fought in his spectacular military career Nader Shah dreamed of an empire which would stretch from the Indus to the Bosphorus. Therefore, he raised an army of 200,000, which consisted largely of rebellious Central Asian tribesmen, and he planned to march towards Constantinople, but after he learned that the Ottoman ulema was preparing for a holy war against Iran, he turned eastward. He captured Kirkuk, Arbil and besieged Mosul on 14 September 1743. The siege lasted for 40 days. The Pasha of Mosul, Hajji Hossein Al Jalili, successfully defended Mosul and Nader Shah was forced to retreat. The offensive was halted due to revolts in Iran (1743–44) over high taxes. Hostilities also spilled into Georgia, where Prince Givi Amilakhvari employed an Ottoman force in a futile attempt to undermine the Iranian influence and dislodge Nader's Georgian allies, Princes Teimuraz and Erekle.Allen, William Edward David (1932), A History of the Georgian People: From the Beginning Down to the Russian Conquest in the Nineteenth Century, p. 193. Taylor & Francis, In early 1744 Nader Shah resumed his offensive and besieged Kars, but returned to Daghestan to suppress a revolt. He returned afterwards and routed an Ottoman army at the battle of Kars in August 1745. The war disintegrated. Nader Shah grew insane and started to punish his own subjects, which led to a revolt from early 1745 to June 1746. In 1746 peace was made. The boundaries were unchanged and Baghdad remained in Ottoman hands. Nader Shah dropped his demand for Ja'fari recognition. The Porte was pleased and dispatched an ambassador but before he could arrive, Nader Shah was assassinated by his own officers.

A number of the Animal Research Institute Buildings are heritage-listed, added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 2008. History The site was proposed and established by Sydney Dodd in 1909 as the Stock Experiment Station for the then Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock. The land had been occupied in the 19th century by the King family, Parr Smith – headmaster of the Yeronga State School, and A. A. McDiarmid. With Dodd began the site's long-standing contribution to the cattle industry in the protection against tick fever (babesiosis, anaplasmosis). In 1910 the Government Bacteriologist Charles Joseph Pound, inaugural director of the Queensland Stock Institute, took charge of the station for the next 22 years. From 1932 to 1953 the complex was known as the Animal Health Station. In this period the site's various scientific disciplines became specialised roles, and the Department's biochemical and toxicological laboratory sections were also transferred there. The CSIRO, known then as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and the University of Queensland's Veterinary School first occupied parts of the site during this era. In World War II the United States Army utilised the Veterinary School building, with a laboratory and malaria school formed as part of the 3rd Medical Laboratory in 1942. Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly c. 1983In 1953, the complex became the Animal Research Institute. Immunologist and Nobel Laureate Peter C. Doherty worked at Yeerongpilly in the 1960s, involved in diagnostic veterinary pathology and a project on the epidemiology of bovine leptospirosis. A national campaign to eradicate bovine brucellosis and tuberculosis (BTEC) was supported by a set of laboratories built on the site in the 1970s. The investigation of Hendra virus, first described after an outbreak at a Brisbane suburb in 1994, included researchers at Yeerongpilly. In 2009, the site celebrated a centenary of contribution to veterinary pathology, microbiology, biometry, biochemistry, animal husbandry, information and extension. The Institute had vacated the site in 2011, relocating activities to other facilities. Redevelopment Building undergoing redevelopment in 2015 In January 2014 a draft plan for redevelopment of the 14-hectare site of the former Institute was released by the Queensland Government. It proposed the Yeerongpilly transit-oriented development to establish urban communities around transit stations.

Beginning with a mere economic dispute between the Ahanta and the Dutch, who were based at the Dutch Gold Coast, the conflict ended with the hanging of Ahanta king Badu Bonsu II and the reorganization of the Ahanta state, establishing a Dutch protectorate over the Ahanta.  Background  District of Dixcove. From the time the European powers settled trading posts on the Gold Coast until the second half of the nineteenth century, they displayed little interest in establishing territorial control beyond the forts they built in agreement with the local population. The Dutch were no exception in this regard. After they dislodged the Swedish Africa Company from the Ahanta area in what is now Western Ghana, they signed the Treaty of Butre with the Ahanta in 1656, which nominally subjected the Ahanta to Dutch rule and allowed the Dutch to trade with the Ahanta from their basis at Fort Batenstein. While initially the European powers came to the Gold Coast primarily to trade in gold the trade in slaves began to gain prominence by the second half of the seventeenth century. This trade came to a rather sudden halt through the passing of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act 1807 by the United Kingdom, which was subsequently taken over by the Dutch by a royal decree of June 1814 and an Anglo-Dutch Slave Trade Treaty signed in May 1818. These changing economic conditions caused tensions between the coastal peoples on the Gold Coast and the European powers with whom they were trading. Seeking a way to return their colony to a profit, the Dutch sent out a great mission to the Ashanti Empire in the Gold Coast interior in early 1837, under the leadership of General Jan Verveer. The primary purpose of this mission was to tempt the Ashanti, with whom the Dutch had been allied since the mission of David van Nyendael of 1702, into signing a treaty allowing the Dutch to recruit soldiers for the Dutch colonial army. The eventual success of the mission was met with suspicion by the other peoples of the Gold Coast.  The course of the war  = The original conflict = Badu Bonsu II as he is portrayed in . From the early 1830s, the Dutch had a difficult relationship with the King of Ahanta Badu Bonsu II. who had his palace at Busua. According to Tengbergen and Douchez, the direct cause of what would become an armed conflict between the Dutch and the Ahanta, was a dispute Badu Bonsu II had with chief Etteroe of Sekondi. Etteroe had panyarred a woman and a child of King Badu Bonsu's for a debt of 14 ounces of gold Badu Bonsu II had with him. King Badu Bonsu II, however, learnt that Etteroe was trading gunpowder with Wassa, a neighbouring state with whom the Ahanta had a conflict, while this trade had been forbidden by Badu Bonsu II. After Badu Bonsu II settled his debt with Etteroe and the woman and child were released, Badu Bonsu II requested a palaver with Etteroe in the presence of the Dutch commandant Gerard Smulders of Fort San Sebastian at Shama. Badu Bonsu II accused Etteroe of circumventing the ban on gunpowder trade with Wassa, and eventually Etteroe was condemned to pay a fine of 6 ounces of gold and to pay the process costs deemed 8 ounces of gold, equalling the 14 ounces Badu Bonsu II had earlier paid to Etteroe. Shortly afterwards, Etteroe accused Badu Bonsu II of extortion, which led commandant Smulders to summon Badu Bonsu II to Fort San Sebastian once more. Commandant Smulders was not present at Badu Bonsu's arrival, however, possibly because Badu Bonsu II also had a debt with him and wanted to annoy him. A humiliated Badu Bonsu II returned home, leading commandant Smulders to refer the case to the governor in Elmina, Hendrik Tonneboeijer, who on three separate occasions summoned Badu Bonsu II to Elmina, all to no avail. Tonneboeijer then sent the military commander of Elmina, George Maassen, to commander Adriaan Cremer of Fort Batenstein at Butre, to summon Badu Bonsu II by force. Eventually, on 23 October 1837, Badu Bonsu II arrived at Butre in the company of armed men, but refused to climb the hill leading to Fort Batenstein, arguing that he wished to discuss the matter in the house of trader Anthonie Ruhle. Maassen and Cremer went down to Ruhle's house, where an altercation followed, which left both Dutchmen dead after they had fired warning shots. = Tonneboeijer assembles an expeditionary force = When the young and inexperienced interim governor Tonneboeijer heard of the news, he immediately assembled a force of 130 men to attack Badu Bonsu II, and left Elmina only two hours later, without as much as a plan of attack. Both the British governor at Cape Coast and the King of Elmina pleaded with him to postpone his attack, while the commandants of both Fort San Sebastian at Shama and Fort Orange at Sekondi warned him that his force was too small and that a large army had gathered to oppose him. Tonneboeijer, who already had the reputation of being a hothead, would not listen, however, and on the morning of 28 October 1837, he and his army were ambushed on the beach near Takoradi. Within minutes, 30 men were killed, including Tonneboeijer himself and four other colonial officials. News of the onslaught reached The Hague by the end of February 1838, where it was met with shock and disbelief. General Jan Verveer, who had just returned to the Netherlands from his mission to Ashanti, was sent out again to restore order in the colony. Together with lieutenant H.F. Tengbergen, who was second in command, he had an expeditionary force of 11 officers and 200 troops at his disposal to \\"quell the insurrection.\\" Also on the ships that departed for Elmina were a new governor, Hendrik Bosch, and new administrative officers for the colony. In May 1838, the expedition landed in Elmina, where they were received by interim governor Anthony van der Eb. = Verveer's attack on Ahanta = A portrait of Badu Bonsu II drawn by lieutenant commander W. Storb during the king's captivity. The portrait was published in . After his arrival, Verveer took some time to form a coalition with other coastal peoples to attack Ahanta. An offer by the Asantehene to send 30,000 troops was rejected as it was seen as a cover by the Ashanti to gain a firm grip on the coastal peoples, but smaller offers of help by Enimir, Axim and Sekondi were accepted. On 30 June 1838, Verveer's force, which had been supplemented by 2,000 Elmina troops, set out to Ahanta. Badu Bonsu's messengers had in the meanwhile plead for a peaceful solution, and offered up to 200 ounces of gold for Badu Bonsu's pardon. Most Ahanta, at least those not too implicated in the earlier altercations, had already submitted themselves, and the campaign, which lasted for a month, mainly involved chasing rebels and destroying Ahanta towns such as Busua and Takoradi. Badu Bonsu II was relinquished even before the expedition reached Ahanta proper, extradited by one of his people for 10 ounces of gold. He was then trialed at an ad-hoc open-field court-martial and given the death sentence on 25 July 1838. He was publicly hanged on the spot where Maassen and Cremer had been shot. According to Douchez, Badu Bonsu's head was then severed from his body by a medical officer of Elmina by the name of Schillet, to be preserved as a curiosity. Five other leaders of the rebellion were subsequently hanged at Elmina on 20 August 1838. Thirteen others were condemned to a forced exile to the Dutch East Indies, where they were to work government coffee plantations on Nusa Kambangan, a prison island. A final thirty-six rebels were forced to work at the coffee and cotton plantations in Elmina. Governor Hendrik Bosch then granted amnesty to the rest of the Ahanta people during his installation on 8 August 1838. = The role of Pieter Bartels = Both Tengbergen and Douchez report that many saw a Euro- African by the name of Pieter Bartels as the main instigator of the conflict. According to witnesses, it was Bartels who, after Maassen fired a warning shot at Butre, shouted \\"Cowards! You are twenty times stronger than the whitemen! Shoot them!\\" Bartels was indeed exiled to the Dutch East Indies for his involvement in the war. According to Douchez, it was personal revenge that drove Bartels to his actions. Pieter Bartels, son of governor Cornelius Ludewich Bartels and a local woman, and half-brother of the wealthy and influential mulatto trader Carel Hendrik Bartels, had initially made a promising career in the administration of the Dutch Gold Coast. As a native speaker of Fante, Dutch and English, his position as a mediator had been a great asset to the administration, and in reward he was installed as commandant of Fort Batenstein at Butre in 1834. His career came to a sudden end when on 3 March 1836, George Maassen—the same person that was later shot at Butre—and Hendrik Tonneboeijer—who later would become interim governor—complained to then-governor Christiaan Lans about Bartels' behaviour towards them. According to Douchez, the conflict between the three originated with a spirits-induced boxing match between Tonneboeijer and Bartels at Shama, which had been won by Bartels. According to Douchez, Tonneboeijer was greatly upset to have lost a match against a mulatto. Not able to cool Tonneboeijer down, Bartels put Tonneboeijer in Fort San Sebastian's prison, of which Bartels was the commandant at the time. Governor Lans took sides with Tonneboeijer in the conflict and saw Bartels as unfit for government service. Bartels was given an honourable discharge from government service on 11 June 1836 and settled as a trader in Ahanta. Douchez' account might seem far- fetched at first, but according to historian Albert van Dantzig, his version of the story is backed up by archival documents. Not only was Bartels' forced resignation chronicled, Tonneboeijer's erratic behaviour and hot temper were also documented: in 1835, Tonneboeijer had to be relieved of his command of Fort Saint Anthony at Axim because he had set parts of the town on fire, only to be accused of extortion later that year and serving eight days in confinement on Fort Coenraadsburg for absence without leave. During his tenure as interim governor, Tonneboeijer set fire to the canoe men quarter of Elmina as he judged they had been to slow in meeting his requests for assistance, and forcefully cleared another part of the overcrowded town for a new street plan. Tonneboeijer was hated by the local population and the news of his death was met with a sigh of relief. It is therefore highly likely that Lans' siding with Tonneboeijer in his dispute with Bartels had more to do with Tonneboeijer's colour of skin rather than with reason. Racism is also evidenced in Verveer's letter to the governor-general of the Dutch East Indies in which he explained Bartels' exile. Verveer recommended Bartels for a lower administrative position in the Dutch East Indies, as his career in the administration of the Dutch Gold Coast had shown his capabilities. Verveer argued, however, that after his dismissal, Bartels' \\"inborn character, always prone to violence and drunkenness, had worsened\\" and how he \\"finally became morally a negro.\\"  Aftermath  Citing provisions in the Treaty of Butre, the 1656 treaty which governed the relations between the Dutch and Ahanta, the Dutch reorganised the Ahanta state after the war, appointing Anthony van der Eb, the new Dutch commandant at Fort Batenstein, as Vice-Governor of the Ahanta Protectorate (Dutch: vice-gouverneur voor het Ahantasche Landschap), and keeping the country under close control with an enlarged military and civilian presence. Pieter Bartels was to remain in exile in the Dutch East Indies, where he died in Semarang in 1847. Despite the warning of Verveer that Bartels should not come in contact with the African recruits for the Dutch East Indian Army, Bartels knowledge of Fante proved too worthwhile: Bartels translation of army regulations into Fante and Twi was widely used in the army. The head of king Badu Bonsu II was rediscovered in the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands by Dutch author Arthur Japin, who had read the account of the head during research for his 1997 novel De zwarte met het witte hart. Japin found the head in 2005, stored in formaldehyde at the LUMC. In March 2009, government officials announced that the head would be returned to its homeland for proper burial, a promise fulfilled on July 23, 2009, after a ceremony was held in The Hague.

The company sells coffee through grocery, retail stores, food co-ops, and via the Internet. The organization operates throughout the United States, but has a strong presence in the Upper Midwest. Peace coffee is one of 24 fair trade coffee roasters part of Cooperative Coffees. History Peace Coffee was formed by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (IATP) in 1996 The company also partnered with Rigoberta Menchú. The idea for Peace Coffee came from Mexican coffee producers who had the goal of selling 100% certified organic and fair trade coffee. In 1999, Peace Coffee joined the group Cooperative Coffees. Currently, Cooperative Coffees has partnered with 20 different coffee-growing cooperatives in the countries of Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia, and Rwanda.. In early 2018 the company was purchased from IATP by long time CEO Lee Wallace and her business partner, Kent Pilakowski. Coffee sourcing Peace Coffee sources coffee in two distinct ways. The organization partners with larger coffee-growing co-operatives that are fair-trade certified rather than individual farmers. Groups such as Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, which have over 10,000 members, allow for economies of scale to exist while maintaining a farmer friendly attitude. Co-operatives are necessary due to the high scale of demand from a large company like Peace Coffee. The disadvantages of not working directly with these farmers include less direct control over farming practices such as harvesting and processing improvements. Although Peace Coffee does consistently travel the countries of origin, visiting their co-ops at least once every two years, they do not have the same influence on cup quality because of the larger number of growers.http://heavytable.com/peace-coffee-in-minneapolis-mn/ Peace Coffee also founded its own coffee importing cooperative with other roasters in 1999. Since then, Peace Coffee has imported coffee from cooperative farming groups that support small-scale farmers around the world. Being an owner and importer gives the organization increased access and transparency in the supply chain. Peace Coffee publishes contracts with its coffee farmers on its website Fair Trade Proof. Reception Peace Coffee received publicity after rapper/actor Ice Cube mentioned that he often made Peace Coffee in the morning in an interview with Bon Appétit magazine. Energy efficiency Peace Coffee has a mantra \\"pedal not petrol\\", which refers to the company's policy of using bicycle couriers to deliver their product to stores, coffee shops, and food co-ops. While the company uses the bicycle couriers within the cities, it purchased a biodiesel van for deliveries to the suburbs and out of state.

It is defined as the center of mass of the perimeter of the triangle. The Spieker center of a triangle ABC is the center of gravity of a homogeneous wire frame in the shape of triangle ABC. The point is named in honor of the 19th-century German geometer Theodor Spieker. The Spieker center is a triangle center and it is listed as the point X(10) in Clark Kimberling's Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers. Location Spieker center of triangle ABC is the incenter of the medial triangle of triangle ABC. The following result can be used to locate the Spieker center of any triangle. :The Spieker center of triangle ABC is the incenter of the medial triangle of triangle ABC. That is, the Spieker center of triangle ABC is the center of the circle inscribed in the medial triangle of triangle ABC. This circle is known as the Spieker circle. The Spieker center is also located at the intersection of the three cleavers of triangle ABC. A cleaver of a triangle is a line segment that bisects the perimeter of the triangle and has one endpoint at the midpoint of one of the three sides. Each cleaver contains the center of mass of the boundary of triangle ABC, so the three cleavers meet at the Spieker center. To see that the incenter of the medial triangle coincides with the intersection point of the cleavers, consider a homogeneous wireframe in the shape of triangle ABC consisting of three wires in the form of line segments having lengths a, b, c. The wire frame has the same center of mass as a system of three particles of masses a, b, c placed at the midpoints D, E, F of the sides BC, CA, AB. The centre of mass of the particles at E and F is the point P which divides the segment EF in the ratio c : b. The line DP is the internal bisector of ∠D. The centre of mass of the three particle system thus lies on the internal bisector of ∠D. Similar arguments show that the center mass of the three particle system lies on the internal bisectors of ∠E and ∠F also. It follows that the center of mass of the wire frame is the point of concurrence of the internal bisectors of the angles of the triangle DEF, which is the incenter of the medial triangle DEF. Properties The Spieker center of a triangle is the cleavance center of the triangle. Let S be the Spieker center of triangle ABC. *The trilinear coordinates of S are :: bc (b + c) : ca (c + a) : ab (a + b). *The barycentric coordinates of S are :: b + c : c + a : a + b . *S is the radical center of the three excircles. *S is the cleavance center of triangle ABC *S is collinear with the incenter (I ), the centroid (G), and the Nagel point (M) of triangle ABC. Moreover, ::IS= SM, \\\\quad IG= 2 \\\\cdot GS, \\\\quad MG= 2\\\\cdot IG. :Thus on a suitably scaled and positioned number line, I=0, G=2, S=3, and M=6. *S lies on the Kiepert hyperbola. S is the point of concurrence of the lines AX, BY and CZ where XBC, YCA and ZAB are similar, isosceles and similarly situated triangles constructed on the sides of triangle ABC as bases, having the common base angle tan−1 [ tan(A/2) tan(B/2) tan(C/2) ].

To reflect the couture concept of the album, Last Train to Paris also features vocal segues from designers and editors of the fashion world including Vogue editor-in- chief Anna Wintour and Tommy Hilfiger. With executive producers Rodney Jerkins, Diddy, Mario Winans and Herve Pierre, Last Train to Paris is predominately hip hop, but incorporates elements of Eurodance, Italo disco and tech house. It marks Diddy's debut with Interscope Records after he moved his label Bad Boy from Atlantic Records in 2009. The album cover is a photograph at Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris, France) taken by Australian photographer Jarrod \\"Jrod\\" Kimber. Last Train to Paris was generally well received by critics who praised the addition of Richard and Harper to help Diddy innovate a new sound and produce some unique records. The release was preceded by four singles \\"Angels\\", \\"Hello Good Morning\\", \\"Loving You No More\\" and \\"Coming Home\\", which received mixed success on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter has become the most successful, peaking at number twelve on the U.S. Hot 100 and top-five or top-ten in much of Europe. During its opening week Last Train to Paris outperformed expectations and debuted eight places higher than predicted at number seven on the Billboard 200. It sold 101,000 copies, compared to the 60,000-70,000 copies that Billboard had predicted it would sell. Diddy described Last Train to Paris as an \\"electro-hip-hop-soul funk\\" album which has been three years in the making. Diddy says the sound of this album was influenced \\"by being in the dance music world and doing stuff with Felix da Housecat, Erick Morillo, Deep Dish, DJ Hell and being in Ibiza and DC10.\\" The arc will follow Diddy's character as he tours from London to Paris and finds the woman of his dreams - only to lose her, find her, lose her again and find her a final time. The records were conceptualised from Diddy's comments to his producers. He told Alex da Kid (who produced \\"Coming Home\\") \\"I want a beat that makes me feel like a white man in a basement in Atlanta.\\" Diddy said that \\"most of the producers he worked with, he's been friends with for a long time. The records came together by hanging out with them, taking them to parties and showing them movies\\". In an interview with MTV News Diddy said \\"One of the things [Dirty Money] trying to represent is emotion... Not being afraid to show emotion on record. A lot of records out right now — no disrespect to them, but they're all surface. It's about what people have or a dance. All our records are gonna be about love, feelings and emotion. Last Train to Paris is a love story and the most vulnerable album I've ever been involved in. It's raw emotion — you get a feeling, a vibe.\\" Diddy also released an application for the iPhone that integrates his social networking site and Twitter feed. A short film will also accompany the album. Rap producer Bangladesh, also confirmed that he would be producing for the album. According to New York magazine, the album was \\"assembled from 60 or so songs. The genesis of Last Train to Paris is full of odd stories involving our hero, ensconced in a darkened studio, barking batty ideas to his production team.\\" Release and reception Chamber of Diaries was released on February 13, 2012. The mixtapes's lead single, \\"Go to Work\\", was released on November 14, 2011. One website commented on the mixtape: \\"Former Dirty Money member Kalenna released a new mixtape titled Chamber of Diaries. Hosted by DJ Cash and executive produced by Kalenna, Tony Vick, Trick Bizness and Shakesphere, this sound is different from what I’ve normally heard from female artists today. Whether it’s showing out in the club (\\"6000 Sistas\\"), being down for the man that she loves (\\"S on My Chest\\"), flipping one of Drake’s tracks (\\"The Motto\\"), or the day after a wild night (\\"The Morning After\\"), Kalenna separates herself from the pack. With production from Darkchild, Black Da Beast, D. Miles and others, this mixtape is worth the listen.\\"http://threefoureighty.clipz- status.com/?p=2489 Track listing 1\\\\.

Featuring strong southern harmonies, heavy electric guitar riffs, and slide guitar, they are often touted as \\"the little sisters of the Allman Brothers\\". The band performed at the 2014 and 2016 Glastonbury Festival, and were voted \\"Best Discovery of Glastonbury 2014\\" by the UK's The Observer. Both sisters have also toured as backing musicians for a variety of other bands, most notably Elvis Costello, Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes, Kristian Bush of Sugarland, and Keith Urban. Band history Rebecca and Megan Lovell began their musical careers in 2005 as teenagers with the formation of a bluegrass/Americana group, the Lovell Sisters, with their older sister, Jessica Lovell. After self-releasing two independent albums and touring successfully for four years – appearing on Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion, the Grand Ole Opry, and performing at Bonnaroo Music Festival – the Lovell Sisters announced the group's disbandment in December 2009. In January 2010, Rebecca and Megan regrouped as Larkin Poe.. \\"Larkin Poe\\" was the name of the sisters' great- great-great-grandfather.. Over the course of 3 years (2010–2013), Larkin Poe self-released 5 independent EPs, 2 collaboration albums, and a live performance DVD. Spring EP (2010), Summer EP (2010), Fall EP (2010), Winter EP (2010), Thick as Thieves EP (2011), The Sound of the Ocean Sound a collaboration with Thom Hell (2013), Killing Time EP a collaboration with Blair Dunlop (2013). In late 2013, Larkin Poe signed a record deal with RH Music, the music division of San Francisco-based company Restoration Hardware. Following this signing, the band began work on their first full-length album, KIN. In March 2014, producer T Bone Burnett tapped the sisters to record harmonies and instrumentation on The New Basement Tapes' album Lost on the River: The New Basement Tapes alongside Marcus Mumford of Mumford & Sons, Elvis Costello, Jim James of My Morning Jacket, Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, and Rhiannon Giddens. Rebecca and Megan also appear in the 2014 Showtime documentary Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued. In June 2014, Larkin Poe performed at the Glastonbury Festival, which resulted in them being named \\"best discovery of Glastonbury\\" by The Observer. In April 2016, the sisters released their second album Reskinned and performed their song \\"Trouble in Mind\\" on Conan. They also appeared on Steven Tyler's album We're All Somebody from Somewhere, which was released in July of the same year. In February 2017, Larkin Poe performed as part of the backing band at the MusiCares tribute to Tom Petty in Los Angeles, accompanying such artists as Jackson Browne and Don Henley. Larkin Poe's cover of the traditional song \\"John the Revelator\\" was used as the Series 3 episode 13 ending music for the Fox TV show Lucifer. In 2018, Larkin Poe's self-produced third album Peach was nominated for a Blues Foundation Best Emerging Artist Album award. Larkin Poe released Venom & Faith, their fourth studio album, on November 9, 2018. The album was recorded in Nashville, produced by Rebecca and Megan, and engineered and mixed by Roger Alan Nichols. Venom & Faith reached #1 on the Billboard blues album chart for the week of November 24, 2018. The album was nominated for the 2020 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album. Larkin Poe were one of the headliners at the 2020 Mahindra Blues Festival in Mumbai, India. Although relatively unknown in that part of the world, the duo left a mark with their performance of \\"When God Closes A Door\\". They then surprised their fans with the first live performance of the title track from their next album. Shortly after that, the duo announced the dates of their USA tour via their social media pages. Larkin Poe's fifth studio album Self Made Man released on June 12, 2020, on Tricki-Woo Records. The first single is \\"She's a Self Made Man\\", released in March.

Murphy was born in Windsor, Maine and was a lumberman there, beginning as a logger on the Penobscot River and working his way up. In 1866, he moved to Michigan and worked in lumber there as well. Operating out of Detroit, his company logged thousands of acres of Michigan pine forests. Murphy was one of the first millionaires in Detroit. In 1887, Murphy began wintering in Whittier, California after purchasing the Ramirez Rancho. While there, he was an irrigator, citrus farmer, oilman, and real estate developer. He was founder of both the East Whittier Land and Water Company and the Murphy Oil Company, which drilled for oil in the Puente Hills. Murphy was an early benefactor of Whittier College. A hospital in Whittier bore his name, as does the neighborhood of Murphy Ranch, which was built on Murphy's citrus orchard. In 1905, Murphy completed the process of gaining control of the Pacific Lumber Company, which, under Murphy's control and stewardship, would become a storied and one of the largest Coast Redwood lumber and milling operations to ever exist. At least five generations of Murphys, including Simon's son Simon Murphy Jr, Grandson Albert Stanwood Murphy, Great Grandson Stanwood Albert Murphy, and then Great great Grandson Warren Murphy managed and controlled with main offices and the bulk of its massive log decks and milling operations in the historic company town of Scotia, California through 1985. Murphy and his company built several buildings in the Detroit Financial District.

Based on a story by Bradford Ropes, the film is about a singing cowboy whose investigation of a bank robbery takes him to a showboat, where he finds that a teenage singer's father has been working with the robbers to provide for her future. The film received an Academy Award nomination for best original song for \\"Be Honest with Me\\" (Gene Autry, Fred Rose). Plot Singing cowboy and rancher Gene Autry (Gene Autry) arrives in the town of Riverton and helps his fellow cattlemen sell their herds for the first profit they've seen in four years. Gene convinces the cattlemen to deposit their money into Eben Carter's bank for safekeeping before going out to watch the parade. Captain 'Lijah Bartlett (Ferris Taylor) has just arrived on the riverboat Jolly Betsy with its troupe of entertainers who are now parading through town. While the townspeople are distracted, Matt Evans (Byron Foulger), a washed-up dancer looking to provide for his young daughter Patsy (Mary Lee), reluctantly assists Blake and Morrison rob the bank. Evans is shocked when they gun down Carter, but still agrees when the men order him to bring the money to them in nearby Colesburg. Feeling responsible for the loss of his friends' money, Gene sets out to find the bank robbers and recover the stolen money, with the help of his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) and Sheriff Jim Mason (Guy Usher). They track Evans to the showboat, but Evans is able to elude them after telling Patsy to meet him later in Colesburg. With Patsy as their only lead, Gene persuades the sheriff to go easy on her. As part of their investigation, Gene and Frog are hired as performers by Captain Bartlett, who does not know they are working with the sheriff. Genuinely concerned with Patsy's welfare, Gene tries to befriend the youngster, who is torn between telling the truth and her loyalty to her father. Patsy is able to convince Gene to let her go ashore alone at Colesburg, but when she sees the sheriff, who has arrived without Gene's knowledge, she assumes that Gene is going to double-cross her and informs the captain of Gene's identity. Patsy gathers the stolen money her father had hidden on the boat and sneaks ashore to the inn where he is hiding. There she pleads with her father to turn himself in and return the money. Before they can leave, however, Blake and Morrison arrive at the inn. Patsy locks herself in the next room and listens in horror as the bank robbers shoot her father after he tells them where the money is stashed. Patsy gives her dog Spotlight her room key, helps him through a window, and tells him to go to the showboat, where the dog gives the key to Gene. Knowing what has happened, Gene, Frog, and the others rush to the inn and rescue Patsy just as the bank robbers are about to kidnap her. After giving his farewell performance on the showboat, Gene takes Patsy to live with him on his ranch.

The proposal arose after the 2008 Mumbai attacks 26/11 attacks where several intelligence and operational failures revealed the need for a federal agency with real time intelligence inputs of actionable value specifically to counter terrorist acts against India. The proposal has however met with much criticism from the Chief Ministers of various states who see this as a means of weakening India's federalism.  Genesis of the idea  The terrorist attacks on Mumbai in 2008 was unprecedented in its scale and intensity and betrayed gaping holes in India's intelligence network with respect to the collection and coordination of intelligence and action between various agencies of the state and Union governments. While the Maharashtra Government was accused of having failed to act on intelligence inputs provided prior to the Mumbai attacks, it countered that the inputs were vague and no pre-emptive action could have been taken based on these inputs. The attacks and the government's response to them led to the resignation of the Union Home Minister Shivraj Patil and he was replaced by the Finance Minister P. Chidambaram who stated that one of his first tasks was to establish a strong federal counter terror agency that could co-ordinate with the states effectively by integrating intelligence inputs from the states. It was in this context that the NCTC was mooted as an apex body, a single and effective point of control for all counter terrorism measures. The NCTC is modelled on the American NCTC and the British Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. The model for India was mooted by the then Home Minister, P. Chidambaram, who along with the then National Security Adviser, M.K. Narayanan, had visited the US in 2009 to study the functioning of the US' NCTC.  Structure and Functions The NCTC will derive its powers from the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967. It is to be a part of the Intelligence Bureau and will be headed by a Director who will report to the Director IB and the Home Secretary. But the modified original draft of NCTC says that this system does not come under purview of Intelligence Beaureu and states are taken into confidence before the centre carries on any operation in their territories. The NCTC will execute counter- terror operations and collect, collate and disseminate data on terrorism besides maintaining a data base on terrorists and their associates including their families. The NCTC has been empowered to analyse intelligence shared by agencies like the Intelligence Bureau and select what it deems suitable. It has also been granted powers to conduct searches and arrests in any part of India and will formulate responses to terror threats.  Opposition to the NCTC  Unlike the American NCTC which deals only with strategic planning and integration of intelligence without any operational involvement or the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which too plays a purely coordinating role, the Indian agency will have not only intelligence functions but also powers to conduct operations. It is this concentration of powers that has had the states objecting to the NCTC, arguing that such sweeping powers vested in a Central agency will violate the autonomy of state governments, given that law and order is a state subject according to the Constitution. It has also been argued that given the establishment of the National Investigating Agency in the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks, the establishment of an NCTC would only add to the bureaucratic tangle in intelligence sharing and counter terrorist action. It is also argued that the nature of US and Indian federal structures differ vastly and hence suitable amendments are needed for the agency to be effective while guaranteeing the constitutional rights of the states. Some strategic experts like B.Raman of the R&AW; have pointed out that there are significant loopholes which may still be used in selectively targeting states for political ends. The UPA govt has stuck to its decision to set up NCTC and has promised to resolve all concerns amicably. The Union Home Ministry is believed to be making extensive changes on the NCTC proposal to the Cabinet Committee on Security, including one to make it as a separate organisation outside the IB. The initial opposition to the NCTC also focused on how the agency had been empowered to search and arrest people without keeping the state government, police or anti-terror squad in the loop. The Centre has since mooted that the Directors General of Police and the chiefs of anti- terror squads of all states be made members of the Standing Council of the NCTC. These senior police officers are to be informed before the NCTC conducts an operation in their state.

The waterworks was finished in 1886 using William Lindley's design. Since 1973, Warsaw Filters has been on the antiquities list. Construction Warsaw Filters was founded by the Mayor of Warsaw, Russian general Sokrates Starynkiewicz (Russian – Сократ Старинкевич). After his approval in 1881, construction started. The design by William Lindley consisted of the River Pump Station and a Filter Station on the left bank of the Vistula. During the construction, all available technologies were used, with even minor details made of high-quality resources. Basic materials used while building Filters were waterproof bricks, granite and sandstone. The first processed water was distributed to Warsaw citizens on July 3, 1886, from filters consisting of a group of slow sand filters, clean water tank, pump depot and a water tower. The design was by William Lindley, but was supervised and modernised by his son, William Heerlein Lindley. Waterworks system In the beginning, the system was divided into: Upper Town – supplied by water from a water tower situated in the Filters' area Lower Town – supplied by water straight from slow sand filters (in the Powiśle and Praga districts) The Warsaw waterworks system consisted of Filters Station (Filtry Lindleya) and River Pump Station of Central Waterworks Institute, from which water was extracted and transported to Filters Station. Modernisation Water Filters Museum in Warsaw Water was carried from a pumping station to slow filters, some chambers were (Imhoff tanks) processing the sewerage. Filtered water was transported to clean water tanks and then to pumping depots, where it was pushed up into a water tower, from which the Upper Town waterworks started. A few years after deploying the filters it was necessary to add Imhoff tanks before the slow filters, as research showed contamination in the water. To implement this, Warsaw Filters was enlarged after 1890 and more tanks were built. Growing demand for water in the early 1930s in Warsaw prompted the building of a Rapid Sand Filter Station, which treat the water from four intakes. After implementing the station, water from a pumping station was pressed into expansion vessels, then to rapid filters and slow filters. In 1931 the chlorination of water was implemented. The main buildings were massively damaged during the Second World War and much of the filtering equipment was stolen by German soldiers. Reconstruction after the war took several years of work.http://www.warsawtour.pl/en/tourist-attractions/lindley-water-filters- filtry-1962.html From 2008 to 2010 indirect ozoning and carbon active filters station were built. This consists of 3 ozone generators and 18 carbon filter chambers. Modern buildings have been designed to look similar to the historic buildings. The new station is named \\"Socrates\\", after the founder of Warsaw Filters. As a monument Warsaw Filters' protection has been upgraded three times in 1973, 2008 and, finally, in 2012, when the whole Filters complex became one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (Pomnik historii), as designated on January 18, 2012.

Early life Dean Paul was the daughter of Sir Aubrey Edward Henry Dean Paul, 5th Bt and the Belgian-born pianist and composer known as Poldowski, the daughter of the Polish violin virtuoso Henryk Wieniawski. Her elder brothers were Aubrey Donald Fitzwarren Severin Dean Paul (1902–1904) and Sir Brian Kenneth Dean Paul, 6th Baronet (18 May 1904 – 5 August 1972).Dylan Thomas: A New Life, Andrew Lycett, 2014, p. 1809Dave Haslam, Life After Dark: A History of British Nightclubs and Music Venues (2015) Raised Catholic and educated in convent schools, she went on to play minor roles in touring theatre companies and ventured to Berlin to build her film career, but she was quickly drawn into Berlin's hectic nightlife and failed her screen test in 1927. Bright Young Thing On her return to England she became a fixture of London's bohemian youth culture, \\"the Bright Young Things\\", and socialised with such celebrities as Evelyn Waugh and Cecil Beaton at the group's fancy dress parties. Following a reported miscarriage she became chemically dependent on morphine, which led to her lifelong battle with drug addiction and made her one of the most talked-about young women in London. Later years In February 1931, Brenda Dean Paul made her first court appearance, having been charged with bouncing a cheque. The following decades saw her in and out of various courts, receiving sentences of up to six months in prison for possession of dangerous drugs, obtaining goods on false pretences, and theft of services (refusing to pay taxi drivers). With each court appearance her name appeared in the papers, which added to her notoriety. In 1932, she was sent to Holloway Prison, where she developed bulimia, dropping to five stone (70 lbs). Over the next few years she was in and out of nursing and care homes. In 1935, she quit drugs and her ghost- written memoir, My First Life, was published. Her acting ambitions never came to anything and she again fell victim to drug addiction.

His reputation was badly damaged by the notorious Lake-Cecil feud which lasted from 1617 to 1621, and both scandalised and fascinated the Jacobean Court. Early life  Lake was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Lake, who was Secretary of State to King James I, and his wife Mary Ryder, daughter of Sir William Ryder, Lord Mayor of London. He was a young man of some intellectual promise: he was a student of Middle Temple in 1609 and matriculated at New College, Oxford, aged 12 ; his entry to the college is dated 12 October 1610. He was awarded BA from Hart Hall, Oxford on 8 February 1613 and was incorporated as MA of Cambridge on 14 July 1617.

Date accessed: 5 May 2012 He accompanied the King on his royal progress in 1617, and was knighted by him at Hoghton Tower on 18 August 1617.Knights of England The Cecil -Lake feud He played a major part in the bitter feud which erupted in 1617 between his family and the family of his brother-in-law, William Cecil, 16th Baron de Ros, grandson of Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter, who had married Arthur's sister Anne. Arthur, Anne and their mother made lurid allegations of incest and adultery against Lord de Ros and other members of the Cecil family, all of which were found to be wholly untrue. Anne and her mother were severely punished by Star Chamber as a result. Arthur himself was briefly imprisoned in the Tower of London on a charge of perjury, but he escaped any more serious punishment due to lack of evidence. However his reputation was badly damaged, especially by the claim that the charge of incest against de Ros was a diversion to distract attention from Arthur's own incestuous relations with his sister Anne. De Ros challenged Arthur to a duel but Arthur refused. De Ros died in 1618, but his father and grandparents continued to press for justice, and the matter dragged on until 1621. A play at Theobalds In January 1618 he acted with other courtiers at Theobalds led by Sir John Finet in an interlude featuring \\"Tom of Bedlam the Tinker\\" intended to amuse King James who was suffering from gout. The cast included: Thomas Dutton, Thomas Badger, George Goring, Thomas Tyringham, Edward Zouch, Robert Yaxley, William Uvedale, and George Garret. The King was displeased by the play, especially the lyrics sung by Finet, and John Chamberlain was surprised that \\"none had the judgement to see how unfit it was to bring such beastly gear in public before a prince.\\"John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), p. 465. Politician  In 1624, Lake was elected Member of Parliament for Minehead in the Happy Parliament. He was elected MP for Bridgwater in 1625 and 1626. Lake died at the age of 35 and was buried at Whitchurch, Middlesex, on 19 December 1633. He married twice but had no surviving son; his estate passed to his brother Thomas, who died in 1653,, and then to the youngest brother Sir Lancelot Lake, who died in 1680.
