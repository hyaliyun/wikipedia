They might be abandoned and left to decay. The term can also be used to include trams. Such vehicle graveyards are distinguished from an abandoned railway, which is a railway line that is no longer used for that purpose, and abandoned railway stations which are similarly disused. Some train graveyards attract visitors and can be a source of tourism, while others have had a role in preserving the history of the railways.  Locations  Former New York City transit locomotive, abandoned in Alaska Some sites contain numerous trains that have been abandoned. In the United States, just outside Watervliet, New York, there is the main line for the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Alongside this railway line is a disused stretch of track which is home to rusted locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. In North Carolina, a graveyard features trains and trams from across the United States, including a passenger train from Philadelphia and abandoned subway cars. Istvántelki Főműhely, formerly one of the most important railway repair workshops in Hungary, now lays disused with old rolling stock on site. Many of them were taken there to be repaired before being exhibited in the Hungarian Railway History Park in Budapest but never made it. One particularly sizable site is the Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Wales, from which 213 of 297 locomotives were rescued by the nascent railway preservation movement.. In Russia, there is one in ShumkovoShumkovo's Soviet railway cemetery. In Tangshan in north China there are rusting loocmotives on the sidings of now shut-down coal mines. A few have also been moved and exhibited in a Coal Mining Park and Railway museum. See Youtube slideshow by Chinarail1 in external links below Trains can be abandoned in a location because it is deemed too difficult to move them. Two large steam locomotives of the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad, for example, were left in a woodland area in the U.S. state of Maine after the end of a local logging operation because it was not practical to move them from such a remote location. Train graveyards can be of interest to railfans, urban explorers, and other tourists. The \\"Cementerio de Trenes\\" (\\"train cemetery\\") near Uyuni, Bolivia, serves as a tourist attraction with trains dating back to the 19th century left to rust in the extensive salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni.

The series began life as a humorous take on the world of football, including discussions such as whether being gentle in the Premier League makes one a better manager. As the podcast evolved however, the focus of the segments has switched more towards the bizarre, and often true, experiences and encounters of the hosts. Despite the move away from football, there are still a number of features that include personalities within the world of sport such as Steve McClaren, Mark Lawrenson and Peter Beardsley. Other features include Bob’s trips to South Africa, Dom Littlewood and Andy's interactions with Jeremy Corbyn. The podcast was first released on 8 March 2016. In late 2016 a live version of the show was created and has since been toured around the UK, with a video available online. As of March 2018, the podcast had over 30 million listeners, with over 200,000 per episode. Since April 2019, the podcast has used Patreon as a platform to introduce the 'Club Parsnips' membership. This allows the audience to pay for the content, if they wish. The benefits include bonus episodes, access to episodes earlier and no advertisements during episodes.  Sections and characters  The podcasts include a number of real and fictional characters, voiced by both hosts, in semi-regular sections. * Barry Homeowner (A character on which Mortimer based his incredibly popular 'Train Guy' Twitter sketches). * Adrian Lewis * Dom Littlewood presents Fake or Legit/Who's the Prick? * The Adventures of Mark Lawrenson and Robson Green * Peter Beardsley and Mrs Beardsley * An increasingly effeminate Steve McClaren and his best friend Casper the Snake * Bob's South African Tales * Gangs of the EPL * Andy's run ins with Jeremy Corbyn * British Managers Lunch Club featuring Sam Allardyce, Tony Pulis, David Moyes, Alan Pardew and more.. * Bob's Wife's Questions/Questions from Andy's kids * Memory Man * Sights, Sounds or Songs of Sunderland * Secret Soccer Superstar * Kiss the Alderman * Observational Comedy * Vince Parsnips * Scottish Tale * The Guru * Bananarama * Yes/No Behind the Door * Lenny Biscuits * The Landlord * Mick McCarthy * Roy Hodgson and his Warhammer obsession * Martin Roberts visits footballers homes * Crime Files (featuring Neil Hunt: Nonsense Potter) *Boing, Quack Quack, Oops, Peanuts, Thwack, Crunch, Give Me Just a Little More Time, Boing Boing, Oops, Wooah Yeah, etc. Quiz *Marlene/Free Sweeties Quiz *Sean Dyche’s motivational WAVs Other, less frequent, characters include Dara Ó Briain, Piers Morgan, Gregg Wallace, Alan Brazil, Ian Holloway, Chris Evans, Billy Bragg, Jim White, Joe Swash and Jordan Henderson. In most cases, each section is self contained. However, on some occasions there have been crossovers within the stories, for example, The Alderman appearing at a Jeremy Corbyn rally and Peter Beardsley featuring in episodes of Gangs of the EPL.  Themes  As the show has progressed the focus and themes within the podcasts have evolved. While football began as the sole focus of the show, numerous other areas have become important areas of discussion. Prior to the start of Athletico Mince, Bob underwent heart surgery that saved his life. A running joke in many of the episodes involves Bob questioning Andy as to why he hasn't bothered to ask about his health. With Andy living in Sunderland, and Bob having moved to the more affluent south of England from Middlesbrough, a lot of the humour is based on the social standing of the hosts with Dawson portrayed as a lower class, run-down character and Mortimer as a pompous millionaire who has servants and/or slaves.  Other media  In April 2017 Dawson released The World of Football According to Athletico Mince. Animated versions of the songs, themes and stories have been made available online and used during the live shows. Fan- made instrumental versions of the songs have been used in later episodes. Certain performances of the 2020 live tour were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The episode artwork for the first 50 episodes was illustrated by artist and designer Ben Brignell. The Chief animator for the podcast is graphic designer @benpics. His cartoon work and animation blends caricature and observation to add another dimension to the podcast.  Reception  The podcast has received a largely positive response from both critics and fans with many enjoying its use of football as a theme, without listeners having to be avid followers of the sport. There has also been praise for Mortimer due to his performances without his comedy partner Vic Reeves, yet still in keeping with his surreal style. In an interview with Mortimer, Joe Zadeh from Vice quipped that the podcast \\"from episode one...derailed immediately from its intended topic of football, and has since become a bizarre and engrossing world of idle chat, improvised tales and sketches that often prolapse mid- joke\\" Bruce Dessau from The London Evening Standard stated \\"This is distinctly daft comedy, full of in-jokes, catchphrases and occasional songs. It evokes Viz comic as much as comic Vic Reeves, yet Athletico Mince is very much a winner in its own right.\\" In The Guardian’s countdown of the 50 best podcasts of 2016, Gwilym Mumford named his favourite episode as \\"Steve’s Restaurant Showdown, which features a surreal Scottish folk tale from Mortimer that rivals anything he’s managed as part of Reeves and Mortimer.\\"  References  Category:Sports podcasts Category:2016 podcast debuts Category:Football mass media in the United Kingdom ","title":"Athletico Mince"},{"id":"57002281","text":"The Theban Tomb TT95 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, part of the Theban Necropolis, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite to Luxor.

An additional shaft with a burial chamber was added to the tomb during a later period (21st and 22nd Dynasty). Human remains Grave robberies have damaged the burials to an extent that it is not clear exactly how many individuals were laid to rest in the tomb. Chamber 1 contained the burial of four individuals: two males and two females. The four connected chambers and associated passageway contained 29 individuals. Of these burials eight were male, nine were female and for the rest the gender could not be determined. Further burials were found in the hall and the total number of individuals is said to be 73.

He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1874. He graduated B.A. in 1878, and M.A. in 1881. A Fellow at Christ's from 1880 to 1886, Vince became an assistant master at Repton School in 1878. He was appointed Head Master of Mill Hill School in 1886.. When the Liberal Unionists split from Gladstone's Liberal party, Vince was in charge of Joseph Chamberlain's constituency organisation. He followed Chamberlain into the Liberal Unionist camp, becoming Secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Unionist Association, and leaving Mill Hill, in 1892.. He later, in 1903, chaired the Birmingham Tariff Reform Committee, a significant power base for Chamberlain. As an aide to Chamberlain, he has been described as \\"chief political organiser\\". Another view, from Byng Kenrick, was of \\"a literary looking gent\\", who was \\"good at slogans and pamphlets but not a great organiser\\". Around 1903 Vince was a leader writer for the Birmingham Post. At this period, leading up to Chamberlain's resignation from the Cabinet, Vince was a close confidant.

Chronologically, Rezakhani's research is most concerned with the first millennium, particularly the period of transition from late antiquity to Early Islam. . Rezakhani's interest in Central Asian history has also resulted in works concerned with the historiography of the Silk Road and its creation in 19th century Europe as part of colonial historiography. His denial of the concept of the Silk Road, reflected in his article on the subject, the Road that Never Was and is the basis of a forthcoming volume, Creating the Silk Road: Travel, Trade and Myth- Making (I.B. Tauris, forthcoming);. His monograph on the history of Central Asia, called ReOrienting the Sasanians, provided a political history of Central Asia (including Afghanistan and Transoxiana) from the Indo-Parthian period to the coming of Islam, and included the history of the Kushans, Iranian Huns, the Kidarites, Hephthalites, Nezak Shah, and the Western Turk Empire.

It spans between Lesnaya Street and Samara river port.  History  = The first stage = Design work was begun in the 1930s. Wooden houses, storage facilities and stables occupied the Volga bank. In order to begin the construction it was necessary to demolish all buildings, strengthen the bank, extend the riverside, plant trees and shrubs and shape a beach. The Samara embankment was designed by architect Mikhail Trufanov. The project included four stages: the first between Vilonovskaya and Nekrasovskaya Streets, the second between Studenchesky lane and Volzhsky avenue, the third between Nekrasovskaya Street and Samara river terminal and the fourth between Volzhsky avenue and a ravine at the north-west of Samara. The bank was cleared between Vilonovsky and Nekrasocsky ramp. A beach appeared here in 1939. The building of the 1350-metre-long first stage of the embankment was begun in 1940. In 1941 construction was suspended before 1954 following the outbreak of the Second World war. Retaining wall was erected along the bank. Ural Granite was used for lining of the embankment. New promenade was decorated with the concrete sculptures and young trees.

In 1833 the British Government abolished slavery and compensated owners, such as McGarel, who became a major beneficiaries of this scheme. With his wealth he conducted business in the City of London, funded civic works in his home town of Larne, County Antrim and bought land and property in Ireland. Having no children, he left his estate to his brother-in-law, James Hogg, on condition that he integrate McGarel into his family name, becoming James McGarel-Hogg, later Lord Magheramorne. Early years McGarel (or M'Garel) came from Larne, County Antrim. His parents, innkeepers Hannah and Charles McGarel, had six children, four boys and two girls. As young men the brothers travelled to Demerara in South America, where the economy of the area was based on the use of slave labour to produce coffee, cotton and sugar. In 1808, aged about twenty, McGarel was working as a partner in a mercantile business importing goods from Britain and later property dealing involving sale of slaves. DEMERARY AND ESSEQUEBO.

His elder brother, John, had been in Demerara since 1799 and another brother, William, died there in 1810. Return to Britain The McGarel brothers were back in Britain in about 1817. John, perhaps singled out as someone unused to city life, was subjected to a blackmail attempt by a trickster in London. The perpetrator was arrested, tried and sentenced to death for attempting to obtain £20. Charles went into partnership in the City of London with Alexander and David Hall in a business called Hall, McGarel at 7 Austin Friars. They acted as agents/attorneys for plantation owners and provided loans and mortgages. In addition to the sale of plantations, buildings and crops, the partners were involved with the sale of slaves. Alexander Hall left the business and was replaced by David's son Alexander Hall Hall (the double name was a result of a clerical error at his baptism). McGarel invested in various commercial and business activities including railroads and iron/coal workings in Wales. Not all of his investment went well: he was a Mexican Bond holder during a period when the government of that country defaulted on payments, and some of his railway shares gave poor returns. Slavery abolition - compensation to the slave-owners In 1826 Lord Bathurst, Britain’s Colonial Secretary of State, attempted to force compulsory manumission on Demerara. The administrative body in Demerara - the Court of Policy - refused to comply and they were supported by the plantation owners who submitted a petition to the Crown. McGarel was one of the five signatories of this document that helped to thwart Bathurst's plan. However, in 1833 the Slavery Abolition Act was passed that stated: A compensation fund of £20 million was set aside for slave-owners by the British Government, estimated to be the equivalent of 40% of the national budget.Freedom of Information Act 2000: Slavery Abolition Act 1833. HM Treasury. Retrieved 1 April 2018 £15 million of this was raised in the form of a loan. Slave owners, who believed they were entitled to compensation, made claims that were then checked by a Slave Compensation Commission. The value depended on factors such as gender, age and skill levels of individual slaves. These claims were then validated in the colonies. Some claims were duplicated, making the process even more protracted and could lead to litigation. It took many years for all of the claims to be processed.Abolition of Slavery records retained at the UK National Archive The three McGarel brothers, Charles, John and Peter, all received compensation with Charles being the largest recipient. Some of these payments were shared with his partners or other claimants.Charles McGarel, Legacies of British Slave-ownership database.

McGarel chose to leave his estate to another of his wife's brothers, James Hogg, with the proviso that he include McGarel in his family name. Larne, Co. Antrim McGarel paid for the construction of several buildings and other works in his home town of Larne, Ireland. These included the town hall, built at a cost of about £5500. It was opened in 1870 for use by all denominations as a news-room, library and town hall.Larne, Town Hall, Cross Street 1900. Francis Frith Collection. Retrieved 31 March 2018 He also funded ten almshouses for the needy (removed 1971), and donated land for a new cemetery in 1862. McGarel became a land owner and landlord in Antrim when in 1842 he purchased the Magheramorne estate from John Irving, M.P. for Antrim. He was initially an \\"absentee landlord\\" but took residence in 1844 at the beginning of a period that came to be known in Ireland as the Great Famine. Blight in the subsistence potato crop throughout the land led to mass starvation, followed by fever and disease. The death toll in Ireland during this period has been estimated at 1 million people. Tenant farmers, who were unable to pay their rents, were often evicted and many emigrated with their families. The Ulster area of Ireland was not so badly affected, but McGarel's tenants still struggled to meet their commitments and in 1849 petitioned him for a 50% rent reduction, which McGarel granted.Magheramorne rent reduction The Freeman's Journal, 10 Oct 1849, Wed, Page 2 It was also reported at this time that McGarel had been providing barrels of lime for his tenants to use on their land from his Magheramorne lime quarry.Banner of Ulster - Tuesday 9 October 1849 It is not clear if he reduced the rent on a regular basis, but in 1875 he announced another 50% half-year rent reduction for \\"his loyal and contented tenancy\\".Dinner to Charles McGarel. Belfast News-Letter - Thursday 1 July 1875 McGarel took an interest in the work of his tenant farmers and encouraged improvements via innovation and training. He also supported the Larne Agricultural School and the work of Dr Thomas Kirkpatrick, agricultural inspector. This scheme was not without critics because only a small number of the students who graduated went on to take up farming.

This bay extends into the townships of Crémazie (northern part), Évanturel (southern part) and Poisson (a bay on the west side). Following the completion of the Gouin Dam in 1948, the navigability area of Gouin Reservoir and Saraana Bay increased significantly. The water level can vary significantly depending on the management of the Gouin Dam; the level usually falls in late winter in anticipation of the spring freshet. Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second. The Forest Road R1009 passes from the west side of Mattawa Bay serving the lower Flapjack River into the northern part of Tessier Lake (Gouin Reservoir) (located south of Saraana Bay). and the southern part of Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir). This R1009 road joins the Southeast route 404 which serves the northern part of the Canadian National Railway. The surface of Saraana Bay is usually frozen from mid- November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is usually from early December to the end of March.  Geography  The main hydrographic slopes near Saraana Bay are: *North side: Gouin Reservoir, Du Mâle Lake, Hanotaux Bay, Plamondon Bay, Kaopatinak Pass; *East side: Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir), Nemio River, Nemio Lake, Lepage Lake; *South side: Tessier Lake outlet, Tessier Lake (Gouin Reservoir), Flapjack River, Clova River; *West side: Mattawa Bay, Adolphe-Poisson Bay, Saveney Lake, Bignell Creek, Tamarac River.

On the west side, Saraana Bay is separated from Mattawa Bay by a peninsula on the north-east of . This peninsula includes the \\"Pike Head Mountain\\" (elevation: ) on the east side of a strait connecting the northern part of Mattawa Bay with its South. Saraana Bay is long and includes many islands, including “Aux Mouettes Island” and “Police Island”. Saraana Bay is fed by: *South side: the discharge of a group of lakes including Tessier, Arcand, Dareche, Achintre, Kaotoskonakamak and Gasparo; *East side: the discharge of a set of unidentified lakes that empties into the southern part of a bay southeast of Saraana Bay; *Northeast side: an unidentified bay. The mouth of Saraana Bay is located at: * south-west of the village center of Obedjiwan, Quebec which is located on a peninsula on the north shore of Gouin Reservoir; * west of Gouin Dam; * northwest of the village center of Wemotaci, Quebec (north shore of the Saint-Maurice River); * west of downtown La Tuque; * northwest of the mouth of the Saint-Maurice River (confluence with the St. Lawrence River at Trois-Rivières).Distances measured from the Atlas of Canada (published on the Internet) of the Department of Natural Resources Canada.

Biography Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al- Jabbar ibn al-Hasan al-Niffarī died in the second half of the 10th-century somewhere in Egypt.Sells, Michael. Early Islamic Mysticism: Sufi, Qur’an, Mi’raj, Poetic and Theological Writings. Paulist Press, 1995. Print. There is confusion as to the exact year of his death, but a commonly accepted date is 965. Nothing is known of the place or date of his birth, but it is assumed that he is from or associated with the town of Niffar in present day Iraq, or the city of Nippur.Niffarī, Muhammad, A. J. Arberry. The Mawáqif and Mukhátabát of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdi ‘l-Jabbár al-Niffarí: with other fragments. Cambridge, UK: Gibb Memorial Trust, 1935. Print. Most of what is known about al-Niffarī is taken from the commentary by the 10th-century Sufi scholar Muhammad al-Hashimi al-Tilimsani. While he is relatively unknown and obscure, he is briefly mentioned by the scholars Ibn Arabi, Al-Sha\`rani, and Haji Khalifa. Works According to al-Tilimsani, the written works attributed to al-Niffarī were not actually written by him. Rather, al-Niffarī wrote down his revelations on scraps of paper and these were compiled by one of his followers, either his son or his grandson; as such, it is unclear whether his revelations were meant to collected and published. Two large collections of al-Niffarī's works exist today, both written in Arabic. =Al-Mawāqif= The more prominent and seminal of these collected works is al-Kitāb al-Mawāqif (The Book of Standings). Al-Niffarī used the basical radical w/q/f (to stand) but uses a causative form to indicate an act of being stood up by the divine presence. As such, much of his work depicts an intimate relationship and unity with the divine presence, reflecting the author's attainment of fanā' (dissolution of the ego). These spiritual standings/stayings begin with versions of the phrase \\"He stayed me\\", referring to the same causative act. Furthermore, the standings reflect the eminence of the apocalyptic vision and the eschatological revelation, and the polarity of the experience of divine unity that switches between peace and terror. Finally, al-Niffarī purposefully uses unclear pronouns when referring to himself and the divine presence to highlight the confusion and the dissolution of the barrier between the two entities as they merge into one being. =Al-Mukhātabāt= The other collection of writings by al-Niffarī is al-Mukhātabāt, which refer to a series of spiritual addresses from the divine presence addressed to His servant, i.e. the author.

Okheena in 1977, at Holman (Ulukhaktok) Mary Kapbak Okheena (also goes by Memorana, Krappak, Kappak) is an Inuvialuit graphic artist known for her stencil prints including \\"Musk-ox Waiting for the Tide to Cross Water\\" (1986) and \\"Shaman Dances to Northern Lights\\" (1991), drawings and embroidery. She is part of the third generation of organized graphic artists in the Canadian Arctic. Okheena has five children with her husband Eddie and she currently lives in Inuvik where she practices embroidery and makes wall hangings.  Biography  = Early life = Okheena was born in 1957 in Holman (Uluqsaqtuuq), King’s Bay, Victoria Island, Northwest Territories. Her father Jimmy Memorana was a sculptor and printmaker and helped found the Holman Island Eskimo Co-operative. Her mother, Nora Memorana, was an expert sewer. Both Jimmy and Nora were respected drum dancers in their communities. Okheena grew up watching her father and her aunt Agnes Nanogak Goose make prints for the Holman Print Shop (part of the Holman Island Eskimo Co-operative) inspiring her career in printing. = Career = Mary K. Okheena started drawing in her teens and at the age of nineteen. In 1977 she sold her first drawing. She was invited by Father Henri Tardy to help with stencil printing after she made a large embroidery design for his church. Father Tardy, who introduced printmaking to Holman, taught Okheena how to make waxed-paper stencils. She started printing in 1977 when John Rose, the Holman Print Shop manager, asked her to come and learn printmaking. Okheena began her professional printing career by printing other artists’ images, which are included in annual Holman print collections from 1979 and 1980-1981. In 1986, Okheena began printing her own works at the Holman Print Shop after her prints were rejected by the Canadian Eskimo Council in 1984. Between 1977 and 1982, Okheena intermittently worked at the Holman Print Shop during the birth and infancy of her eldest children. Okheena worked for the Holman Print Shop longer than any artist currently working there. She eventually left the print shop partly because of health problems caused by printmaking chemicals and set up a home studio. Okheena also spends her time crocheting, quilting, carving, making wall hangings, and sewing clothing for her family. Okheena has also illustrated John Bierhorst’s 1997 children’s book called The Dancing Fox: Arctic Folktales.The Dancing Fox: Arctic Folktales  Artwork  = Print = Mary K. Okheena uses a specific stencil technique in her prints to achieve subtle and luminous gradations of colour. Okheena abstracts formal qualities of animal and human forms. She is often inspired by children’s facial expressions, and often uses culturally symbolic images in her work such as the inukshuk. She has created her own form of storytelling, by reflecting the dual traditions of Holman Inuvialuit families and those of the resident Copper Inuit (as seen in Shaman Dances to Northern Lights). She combines an Inuit aesthetic with influence from Southern culture and uses Western artistic devices. Over her career, she has had 74 of her drawings made into prints, and 36 she printed herself. She has also printed 31 works from other artists’ designs. In 1988, Mary K. Okheena was commissioned to create a print for the cover of the Northwest Territories Telephones’ telephone directory.

The hallmark of his work was meticulous craftsmanship and emotional content. His most recognized public works are the Bahamian National Monument, \\"Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden\\" in Green Turtle Cay, The Bahamas, the \\"Key West Historical Memorial Sculpture Garden\\" in Key West, Florida, and \\"Les Chasseurs Volontaires\\" (commemorating The Siege of Savannah) in Savannah, Georgia. The Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden was declared a national monument of The Bahamas. It consists of a central monument depicting two Loyalist women arriving in The Bahamas surrounded by 24 busts of descendants of Loyalist families. The Loyalists were those individuals who remained loyal to the British Crown after the American war of independence in 1776. Many Loyalists in the northern American colonies fled to Canada, while Loyalists in the more southern American colonies fled to the islands of the Bahamas with their slaves. The Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden was commissioned by the Historical Society of Green Turtle Cay. The Key West Historical Memorial Sculpture Garden was commissioned by the Friends of Mallory Square, Key West. Its central monument, \\"The Wreckers\\" pays tribute to the brave men engaged in salvage operations that made Key West the richest city on the east coast of the United States south of New York in the nineteenth century. Les Chasseurs Volontaires (\\"Siege of Savannah\\") was commissioned by the Haitian American Historical Society and the City of Savannah, and commemorates the free Haitian soldiers who successfully fought in the American Revolution in 1776 alongside the American colonial army in Savannah, Georgia to assist in the American efforts towards independence from Great Britain. The drummer boy depicted in the monument was a young Henri Christophe, who became one of the original leaders of the Haitian government, after Haiti obtained its independence from France. Mastin also created a maquette, or model, for a larger than life-sized sculpture he contemplated called \\"Circle of Love\\" to celebrate the native American Lucayan people who lived in South Florida and in the Caribbean basin at the time of the arrival of European immigrants from Spain.  Early life and education  James Mastin was born in South Dakota, but grew up in Los Angeles, California. He was a classically trained artist, with degrees from Pasadena City College, the Art Center of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Art Institute, the Chouinard Art Institute, and studied under Sergei Bongart, as well as the Massachusetts Conservatory of Art and Music.  Career  Mastin originally pursued an acting career and sold artwork to support his studies. After military service, he opened a commercial art studio in California. A large number of his paintings were put into print by Windsor Art. In the 1960s Mastin traveled the American Southwest, painting portraits of Native Americans. He began sculpting in the 1970s, primarily working in clay and wax, as well as plaster and resins. He moved to Miami, Florida in the 1970s and opened his permanent art studio, James Mastin Galleries. He remained in Miami until his death. Over the course of his career, Mastin created many allegorical, figurative, and abstract works exploring the human condition, and explored a variety of media and styles. Although his monumental, public works were heroic figurative pieces full of emotion, his personal work included oil, acrylic, and watercolor landscapes, abstracts, and portraits. He also experimented with mixed media, incorporating lights and sound generated by video images, LED light arrays, mirrors, and water elements. For his monumental work, Mastin sculpted in clay, casting his pieces in bronze using the ancient lost wax method of casting, finishing them with a chemical patina to add color and protect the pieces from the elements.

He spots a pie placed on a window sill of another house but the owner removes it before Krazy could get near. He tries to take sausages from a basket carried by a hound but the long meats are too tricky to handle. He then attempts to take a sandwich from a steamer owned by a mime but the mime notices this immediately before taking back the cookware and fleeing. While still looking for ways to obtain food, Krazy sees a chef carrying a platter with a roasted turkey on top, heading towards a prison. As he follows the chef, the cat sips the sauce that drips from the plate. Looking through a prison window, Krazy sees the turkey being served to a prisoner, giving him the notion that he too should be a prisoner. Krazy goes on to annoy the prison guard, even breaking the officer's billy club, until he is finally thrown into a cell. Inside his cell, Krazy is excited that he prepares some utensils. To his dismay, the guard only offers him tea. Krazy complains to the guard, who discloses that the other prisoner will be executed tomorrow, and therefore deserves some special treatment.

It was the first cable car employing a moving rope that could be picked up or released by a grip on the cars. History Fawdon Colliery was set-up around 1810,Eight interesting facts about Fawdon & Kingston Park. Evening Chronicle, 1 January 2012. Updated 22. February 2013. and its coal was originally transported via the Kenton and Coxlodge Waggonway to Wallsend. In 1818, the Fawdon Wagonway was built by Benjamin Thompson, one of the partners owning Fawdon Colliery on a new route to transport the coal south to Scotswood. The line used inclined planes and stationary steam engines. The re-routing was the cause of controversial discussions between Thompson and the owners of the properties, over which the track ran.Jennifer Morrison: Tyne and Wear HER(15348): Fawdon Waggonway to Scotswood - Details. Benjamin Thompson installed a series of stationary steam engines along the rail track between the Kenton Bank and Hotchpudding Planes. Stationary steam engines transported the coal wagons through the hilly landscape at a speed of .Jennifer Morrison: Tyne and Wear HER(1078): Fawdon Wagonway - Details. Each rope ran between two steam engines and could be alternately wound onto drums at the ends by the engines. Its length corresponded to twice the distance between the steam engines. The rope could be clamped by a grip that looked like a vice attached to the carriage. At the point where the railway crossed a public road, the rope was guided by friction rollers down a cable duct and under a plank bridge to the other side of the road, where it again rose above the ground. Before the car came to the public road, the boy who rode on it released the rope from the vice. The momentum of the car carried it across the road, and the boy hung the rope back into the vice as the car continued its movement.Erskine Hazard, Observations upon Rail-roads, The Franklin Journal and American Mechanics' Magazine, Vol III, No 4 (April 1827); S. 275. The inclined plane was used until 1826, when the Brunton and Shields Wagonway (later Seaton Burn Wagonway) was built to the River Tyne at Whitehill Point. The routes of the Fawdon and Seaton Burn Wagonways were used in the 1890s together with the route of the Coxlodge Wagonway for building the Fawdon Railway. The 1920s Ordnance Survey map showed a new Fawdon wagonway leading to the Coxlodge Colliery Jubilee Pit.History of Railways in Northumberland.Weetslade Colliery. The wagonway is still preserved as a low earthwork on which an asphalt road runs. Archeological excavations were conducted in Newcastle Great Park in 2003.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Cicero, and from that time they attained particular distinction as statesmen and writers. The most illustrious of the family was the historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus, who wrote valuable works on the Jugurthine War and the Conspiracy of Catiline, which still exist.Dictionary of Greek and Latin Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 695–698 (\\"Sallustius or Salustius\\"). Praenomina The main praenomina of the Sallustii of the Republic and early Empire were Gaius, Gnaeus, and Publius. Other names appear in imperial times, including Marcus and Quintus. All of these were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Branches and cognomina The only cognomen borne by the Sallustii of the Republic was Crispus, belonging to an abundant class of surnames derived from the physical features of an individual, and originally belonging to someone with curly hair.Chase, p. 110. Passienus, borne by some of the Sallustii during the early decades of the Empire, was a gentile name inherited from the paternal line when one of the Passieni was adopted by his granduncle, the historian Sallust, becoming part of his gens. Lucullus, borne by an ill-fated member of this family in the time of Domitian, may have been derived from lucus, a grove, although it might also have been a diminutive of the praenomen Lucius.Chase, p. 113. Members * Gnaeus Sallustius, a talented writer whom Cicero numbered among his clients.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 3. 11, xi. 11, 17, Epistulae ad Familiares, xiv. 4. § 6, xiv. 11, Epistulae ad Quintum Fratrem, iii. 4. § 2, iii. 5. § 1. * Gnaeus Sallustius, a proquaestor serving under Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus, proconsul of Syria, in 51 BC. He wrote to Cicero to inquire about certain matters as he was arriving in the province, and Cicero departing, and he requested a letter of recommendation to Bibulus, which Cicero supplied.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, ii. 17.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 242, 247 (note 2), supplement 55. * Publius Sallustius, the intended recipient of thirty sestertii which Cicero received from his client, Gnaeus Sallustius. As Cicero was at Brundisium, he asked his good friend Atticus to pay the sum to Publius as soon as possible.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, xi. 11. * Gaius Sallustius Crispus, the historian, was quaestor about 55 BC, tribune of the plebs in 52, and praetor in 46. During the Civil War he espoused the side of Caesar, who appointed him governor of Numidia, from which Sallust retired a wealthy man, and devoted himself to writing history.Cassius Dio, xl. 63, xlii. 52, xliii. 9.Varro, apud Gellius, xvii. 18.Appian, Bellum Civile, viii. 34.Suetonius, De Illustribus Grammaticis, 15.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. vi, p. 693.Dictionary of Greek and Latin Biography and Mythology, vol.

It is housed in a building formerly part of a girls' school run by an English sister. The exhibition is elaborated in German and Czech. The building also serves as the cultural centre for the town of Zwiesel.  General  In the late 19th century a wave of museums were founded in Bavaria, which also affected Zwiesel. From 1904, documents and artefacts from the history of Zwiesel were collected and, one year later, a municipal museum was established, which was housed on the upper floor of the local mortuary. The collection grew steadily and the existing premises became too small. In 1924, the museum found a new home in the former community brewery and later in the fire brigade equipment house on the town square. In the 1960s, its thematic focus changed. Oberforstrat Konrad Klotz (1905-1994), head of the Zwiesel forestry office, and Georg Priehäußer (1894-1974) worked towards a new concept for the museum. In 1966 they succeeded in establishing the first German forest museum in Zwiesel. The flora and fauna of the forest, as well as the subject of \\"wood\\", became the central features. These areas were supplemented by municipal and regional history as well as by the theme of \\"glass\\" for Zwiesel, which was indispensable given the centrality of glassmaking in the town. Unusual exhibits such as the trunk details of a 400-year-old fir tree or a jungle diorama were integrated into the concept. In 2014, the contents and design of the Forest Museum were revised once again and moved to the former girls' school on Kirchplatz, which is located right next to the neo-Gothic church of St. Nicholas.

Vasily Tatishchev, known as the founder of the city of Yekaterinburg, the author of the book \\"The History of Russia\\" was the head of the \\"mountain power\\". At that time, the active development of new deposits began, new plants and mines were built in the province. The local population the Bashkirs feared losing their patrimonial rights to lands obtained under the conditions of accession to Russia, and sought to protect their cultural, religious and domestic traditions.

Life Greenwood was born in Chorlton, in Lancashire on 18 November 1862. Her father was Joseph Gouge Greenwood and her mother was Elizabeth (Eliza) Taylor. Her maternal grandfather was Unitarian minister John Taylor. Alice had a younger sister and her mother died in 1871. The sisters were brought up in Fallowfield after her father remarried. Her father's career in teaching went well and he rose to be a Professor of History and Classics. In 1857 he was made principal of Owen's College. In 1880 he became the vice- chancellor of Victoria University whilst Alice was at Cheltenham Ladies' College. In 1882 she left the college and she was able to side step the discrimination to women at Victoria University. Her father was generally supportive of her education and she was able to avoid the rule that prevented women from entering the university by attending lectures held by the university in Brunswick Street. She was mentored by the Latin professor Augustus Samuel Wilkins and by Herman Hager who taught German literature, but importantly, she was spotted by Adolphus William Ward who was professor of English language and history. After two years at Somerville Hall Greenwood and Gertrude Bell won the only first class honours degrees awarded to women that year. Oxford University recorded nine men at the time and ignored the two women. Some sources say that Bell was the only and first woman that year. In 1888 Greenwood started teaching at Clifton High School for Girls where she found that she liked teaching but did not want to become an administrator. She moved on to North Manchester High School for Girls four years later. In 1892 she completed her first book Europe and Papacy in the Middle Ages. Greenwood was in contact with her former mentor, Adolphus Ward, who succeeded her father at Owen's College. He was starting a school for girls in Manchester and in 1896 she became the second headteacher of Withington Girls' School. She decided, in 1900, to devote her time to writing and she resigned her headship of Withington Girls School. She continued to work with Adolphus Ward, as he was the editor of The Cambridge Modern History, from 1901 and he was the co- editor of the Cambridge History of English Literature from 1907. Greenwood completed numerous tasks for both of these works and was credited with chapters in the Cambridge History of English Literature. In 1907 and 1911 she published two volumes of the Lives of the Hanoverian Queens of England. Her thorough research was noted for its lack of speculation; she stated the known facts about the women and did not pad out the work with facts about Hanoverian men. She did, however, take a subjective view of history from her Queen's point of view. The second volume of Lives of the Hanoverian Queens of England was published while she was at Oxford as she moved to St Hugh's College in 1910 where she became involved in the running of the college. Greenwood continued to write and in 1921 she published History of the People of England - Vol. I - 55 B.C. to A.D. 1485. She and a teaching friend named Helen Turing retired together to London and then on to Somerset where Greenwood died at Williton in 1935.

The 1100-ton Requin-class submarines, designed in 1922, was the initial attempt to meet these requirements; however, the speed of the submarines was notably insufficient and the design overall was considered inferior to the last German submarines launched in 1918. The design for the Requin class's successor was commissioned from general engineer of maritime engineering Léon Roquebert. Roquebert was tasked with creating a \\"grand cruiser\\" type of submarine, with the role of carrying out surveillance of an adversary's bases, destroying their communications by attacking their ships, while protecting French colonies. They were operate with a surface squadron and provide clearance of enemy vessels for it. Construction of the Type I project submarines, starting with , was approved by the superior council of the navy on 1 July 1924. The building programme was expanded the following year with the Type II submarines. =Characteristics= long, with a beam of and a draught of , Redoutable could dive up to . The submarine had a surfaced displacement of and a submerged displacement of . Propulsion while surfaced was provided by two diesel motors built by the Swiss manufacturer Sulzer. The submarines' electrical propulsion allowed it to attain speeds of while submerged. Designated as \\"grand cruise submarines\\" (), their surfaced range was at , and at , with a submerged range of at . Radio communication was through wireless antenna. Development plan of Redoutable Redoutable had significant firepower. She was equipped with eleven torpedo tubes: four tubes in fixed positions in the bow, a orientable platform for three 550 mm tubes behind the conning tower, and another orientable platform on the stern composed of two 550 mm and two tubes. The 550 mm torpedoes were intended for use against large ships, with the 400 mm torpedoes for smaller boats. Torpedoes were propelled by compressed air at a speed of , exploding on impact. Torpedoes left a trail on the surface, which allowed the target to see and avoid the torpedo, as well as trace the torpedo back to its origin. The submarines were also fitted with a deck gun, mounted in front of the conning tower and from 1929, dual anti- aerial machine guns. Another view of Redoutable's profile Redoutable had a quick diving speed, submerging in between 30 and 40 seconds. She had a reputation of handling well while at sea, both at the surface and while diving. Her motors were relatively noisy, as was auxiliary propulsion while submerged, and this constituted the principal criticism of that submarine, despite their reliability. Their speed and powerful armament was balanced against their ability to detect targets, which was essentially by visual sight. She was equipped with three periscopes – an attack periscope, a surveillance periscope, and an auxiliary periscope – and a hydrophone for passive sonar. History =Construction= French President Gaston Doumergue lays the first rivet of Redoutable on 17 July 1925 at Cherbourg, in the presence of military and civilian personnel. Redoutable was the first of 31 Redoutable-class submarines, also designated as the 1500 ton boats because of their displacement. The class entered service between 1931 and 1939. Ordered in 1924, Redoutable was laid down on 1 July 1925 at the Arsenal de Cherbourg. She was launched on 24 February 1928 and was commissioned 10 July 1931. In 1932, she encountered problems with her diving systems and returned to Cherbourg for repairs. =Second World War= The scuttling of the French fleet at Toulon. Redoutable is on the right. At the start of World War II, she was assigned to the seventh submarine division, based at Cherbourg, along with Vengeur. From 12 October to 2 November 1939, Redoutable carried out a surveillance mission to the Azores, where a part of the German commercial fleet, suspected of supplying German U-boats in fuel, was located. On the night of November 1 she encountered a cargo ship that was sailing all lights off. As the cargo refused to stop in accordance with the submarine's summons, the submarine fired warning shots with its 100 mm cannon, to which the cargo responded by further firing at the submarine. At that moment, Redoutable captured a message from the British freighter Egba who reported being attacked by a U-boat; The French submarine, understanding that she was attacking an ally, ceased fire and withdrew. In December 1939, he was sent to search for the German supply ship Altmark (10 000 barrels) in the centre of the Atlantic with Fresnel, Heron and Héros. In June 1940, she was patrolling along the Tunisian coast to prevent a possible Italian landing. She was located in Bizerte when the armistice was signed on 25 June and was placed on guard in Toulon. On 9 November 1942, the day after the Allied landing in North Africa, Redoutable was allowed to rearm. It was not completed when the Germans entered Toulon on 27 November and the submarine scuttled with the French fleet. The ship was refloated on 16 May 1943 to be repaired by the Italians. It was finally sunk by a bombardment on 11 March 1944 with the Pascal and Fresnel.https://web.archive.org/web/20160306025222/http://sous- marin.france.pagesperso-orange.fr/Q136.htm References =Citations=  Sources   Category:Redoutable-class submarines (1928) Category:1928 ships Category:World War II submarines of France ","title":"French submarine Redoutable (1928)"},{"id":"57003505","text":"The 1993 World Table Tennis Championships – Mixed Doubles was the 42nd edition of the mixed doubles championship.

Completed in 1927, Albatros often served as a flagship of torpedo boat units. The ship made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. After an attack by aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force killed German sailors in 1937, she participated in the retaliatory bombardment of Almería. At the beginning of World War II in 1939, Albatros helped to lay minefields and made anti-shipping patrols before participating in Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. The ship fired the first shots of the campaign when she encountered and crippled a Norwegian patrol boat. She was lightly damaged during the Battle of Horten Harbor. Albatros then ran aground and was wrecked while maneuvering in an attempt to avoid Norwegian coastal artillery. Design and armament Derived from the World War I-era torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed.Gröner, p. 191 The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load.Whitley 1991, p. 202 The pair of Schichau geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, were designed to produce using steam from three water- tube boilers, which propelled the ship at .Whitley 2000, p. 57 Albatros carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of at . The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crews consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors. As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure; the aft superfiring gun was on an open mount while the others were protected by gun shields.Whitley 1991, p. 45 They carried six rotating torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry up to 30 mines.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 237 After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 antiaircraft guns were added. At least some of the ships were fitted with depth charges, but details are lacking.Haarr 2009, p. 377 Construction and career Albatros was laid down at the (Wilhelmshaven Navy Yard) on 5 October 1925 as yard number 105, launched on 15 July 1926 and commissioned on 15 May 1927.Gröner, p. 192 After working up, Albatros became the flagship of the 4th Torpedo Boat Half- Flotilla, which also consisted of her sister ships , and . The half-flotilla was under the command of Korvettenkapitän Karl Dönitz, who later became grand admiral of the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany. In the spring of 1929, Albatros was departing Wilhelmshaven to take part in a fleet cruise in Spanish waters, and collided with Möwe at the exit from the harbor. Both ships followed the fleet four days later after repairs. In 1931, the 4th Torpedo Boat Half- Flotilla and the light cruiser were present during the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Latvian Navy in Libau. The following year, Albatros, again with her sisters and Königsberg, represented Germany at the celebration of the betrothal of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten of Sweden, the oldest son of the then crown prince of Sweden, to the German princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. On 7 December 1932, Albatros was decommissioned and replaced by Greif as flagship of the 4th Half-Flotilla.Hildebrand, Röhr & Steinmetz, p. 86 On 5 October 1933, Albatros, commanded by Kapitänleutnant (Lieutenant) Werner Hartmann, was put back into service, replacing the pre-war boat T151 in the 2nd Torpedo Boat Half-Flotilla based at Swinemünde (now Świnoujście, Poland). Albatros became the flagship of the 2nd Half-Flotilla, which consisted of Möwe and the two Type 24 torpedo boats and , on 1 October 1934. =Spanish Civil War= From July 1936 to October 1937, Albatros carried out three non-intervention patrols in Spanish waters which were intended to prevent men and material from reaching the participants of the Spanish Civil War. On the first mission from 28 July to 27 August 1936, the four ships of the 2nd Half-Flotilla escorted the light cruiser and the heavy cruisers and to the north Spanish coast where they evacuated Germans and other refugees to France. The warships not only transported refugees, but also escorted the many merchant ships that were chartered by Germany for the repatriation of their citizens. The half-flotilla returned to Spain with Albatros from 28 September to 29 November. Her sister ran aground while leaving Cadiz harbor that same month and had to return to Germany on one turbine, escorted by Albatros. The 2nd Half-Flotilla returned to Spain for the third time from May to June 1937. On 24 May, Republican aircraft attacked the town and harbor of Palma de Mallorca causing Deutschland to depart for Ibiza, although Albatross captain chose to remain in port. During subsequent attacks later that day, several bombs fell near the ship and she steamed to join the cruiser in Ibiza. Five days later, another attack was carried out on Deutschland which killed several dozen crewmen. As retaliation, Adolf Hitler ordered Admiral Scheer to bombard the Republican-held city of Almería. The four boats of the 2nd Half- FlotillaWhitley 1991, p. 79 escorted the ship as she did so on 31 May, targeting Republican coastal artillery, naval buildings and ships in the harbor, which killed 19 people.Haarr 2013, pp. 32–33 On 24 June Albatros was replaced by Möwe, and returned to Germany escorting the light cruisers Köln and . =Interwar= In fall 1937, the 2nd Half-Flotilla was disbanded, and Albatros served as a training ship until she was decommissioned on 16 February 1938. The boat was placed back into service on 1 July 1938 and was assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. She was transferred four months later to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, which included her sisters Greif, Möwe, , and Falke. =Second World War= Map of operations in the alt=Map of operations in the Oslofjord on the night of 8/9 April, showing how far the Germans had progressed at various times as well as their movements At the start of World War II, Albatros was used in the defensive mining operations in the North Sea that began on 3 September 1939 that were intended to prevent the British Royal Navy from entering the German Bight. From 3 to 5 October Albatros, together with three destroyers and her sisters Greif and Falke, was tasked with anti- shipping patrols in the Kattegat and Skaggerak that captured four ships.Rohwer, pp. 2, 6; Whitley 1991, p. 84 During Operation Weserübung, Albatros was assigned to Group 5 under Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz on the heavy cruiser , tasked to capture Oslo. Albatros transported about 100 men of the invasion force and was one of the cruiser's escorts through the Baltic and Kattegat. While passing Skagen, Denmark, on 8 April 1940, the British submarine unsuccessfully attacked the cruisers of the group with torpedoes. Albatros spotted their tracks and unsuccessfully depth charged the submarine. Later that night the group encountered the Norwegian patrol boat in heavy fog at 23:00. After firing a warning shot and realizing that Albatros would not turn away, and was going to violate Norwegian neutrality, Pol III fired flares to alert Norwegian coastal batteries and rammed Albatros in the side. From Albatros it was clear that the guns on Pol III were manned, and that the Norwegians intended to fight. Despite clear orders from Kummetz to fire only if fired upon, the torpedo boat's captain, Kapitänleutnant Siegfried Strelow, opened fire, hitting Pol III with at least two 10.5 cm shells and raking her with machine guns, thus firing the opening shots of the campaign. The Norwegian ship's crew attempted to abandon ship in the only intact boat remaining, but it capsized and they were taken aboard Albatros. Albatross crew set the patrol boat on fire and abandoned it, proceeding up the foggy Oslofjord independently. The torpedo boat was finally able to get a bearing from her sister Kondor and followed her towards the naval base at Karljohansvern, in the town of Horten. En route, she was spotted by the lightly armed Norwegian minesweeper which sheered off after radioing a report at 04:03 on 9 April.Haarr 2009, pp. 83–84, 119–123, 129 The German force tasked to occupy Karljohansvern was scheduled to do so at dawn on 9 April, but Kondors captain, the commander of the force, decided to assault the harbor directly since the Norwegians had already been alerted. About 140 soldiers were transferred to the small motor minesweepers R17 and R21 and the former was in the lead as they steamed through the harbor entrance at 04:35 at high speed, slowly followed by Albatros, while Kondor was transferring her embarked troops to another ship. The minelayer engaged R17 ten minutes later and set her on fire, but not before she unloaded her troops. The minelayer was only able to get a few shots off at R21 before she steamed behind an island in the harbor. About this time, Albatros was approaching the harbor mouth and exchanged fire with Olav Tryggvason without effect. Strelow, with only a single gun able to bear on the minelayer, withdrew behind one of the outer islands and started blindly bombarding the harbor. The minelayer was occasionally struck by shrapnel, but she hit the torpedo boat with one shell at 06:30, killing two and wounding another pair of sailors. Albatros withdrew not long afterward and the German troops that had made it ashore bluffed the Norwegians into surrendering at 07:35.Haarr 2009, pp. 147–151 Later that morning, Kondor and Albatros were ordered to land their troops at Son and then, reinforced by R21, she was ordered to secure the submarine base at Teie. On the morning of 10 April, Kondor and Albatros were engaged by coastal batteries on the island of Bolærne and forced to turn away. Later that day, Albatros was escorting the merchant ship while also landing men on the island of Rauøy; Strelow decided to steam east of the island to avoid any further attention from the guns on Bolærne. Unbeknownst to him, sea ice had removed the marker for the Gyren shoal a few weeks earlier and Albatros struck it at a speed of . The impact ripped open at least one fuel tank and holed the turbine and boiler rooms. The ship settled with a pronounced list to port and her stern in the air. She quickly lost all electrical power and several fires were ignited that caused several small explosions; Albatros was declared a total loss. The crew were rescued by the Vorpostenboot and was later assigned to after the Norwegian surrender. The minelayer was initially renamed Albatros II and then became Brummer.Haarr 2009, pp. 153, 155, 163, 380, fn. 11, p. 458 Notes Citations Bibliography    * * Category:Type 23 torpedo boats Category:1926 ships Category:Ships built in Wilhelmshaven Category:Military units and formations of Nazi Germany in the Spanish Civil War Category:Maritime incidents in April 1940 ","title":"German torpedo boat Albatros"},{"id":"57003533","text":"Tala'i ibn Ruzzik (, with his full titles and surnames Abū'l-Gharāt Fāris al- Muslimīn al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ṭalāʾīʿ ibn Ruzzīk al-Ghassānī al-Armanī) was a military commander and official of the Fatimid Caliphate, serving as its vizier from 1154 until his assassination in 1161, when he was succeeded by his son, Ruzzik ibn Tala'i. He is generally acknowledged as the last of the powerful and capable viziers of the Fatimid state. During his tenure the Fatimid Caliphate regained a measure of stability, and was once again able to project its power abroad and pursue its political interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. Early life and career Although his nisbah of al-Ghassānī implies an origin form the Arab tribe of the Ghassanids, and one source claims that he was a Berber, most authors consider Tala'i ibn Ruzzik an Armenian (whence the surname al-Armanī), and indicate that his father was among those Armenians who came to Egypt under the rule of the powerful Armenian vizier Badr al-Jamali and his son al-Afdal Shahanshah. Indeed, some writers thought that he was born in Armenia. Born at the beginning of the 12th century, at first Ibn Ruzzik appears to have pursued a career in Iraq, where he also converted to Twelver Shi'ism, as evidenced by the correspondence he maintained thereafter with Mosul, Kufa, and Hillah. At an unknown point, he joined the Fatimid army. His career there is unknown, but by 1143/4 he was governor of al-Buhayra, when he subdued a rebellion of the Lawata Berbers. Later he participated in the revolt of al-Adil ibn al-Sallar and his stepson Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh against the vizier Ibn Masal (winter 1149/50), winning an important victory for the rebels. He then held the governorships of Aswan and of Qus (the capital of Upper Egypt). By 1154, he was governor of either Asyut in Upper Egypt, Ashmunayn and al-Bahnasa, or of Munyat Bani al-Khasib. In April of that year, Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh and his son Nasr, who had already assassinated Ibn al-Sallar, murdered Caliph al-Zafir. Abbas placed the five- year-old al-Fa'iz on the throne and executed two of al-Zafir's brothers, whom he accused of responsibility for al-Zafir's assassination. Thereupon the women of the palace, led by al-Zafir's sister Sitt al-Qusur, reportedly cut off their hair and sent it to Ibn Ruzzik, requesting of him to save the dynasty. Ibn Ruzzik mobilized his forces—the holders of the iqṭāʿ fiefs and allied Arab and Berber tribes—and marched on Cairo, where Abbas' attempts to organize resistance foundered on popular opposition to his regime. As Ibn Ruzzik appeared before the city, Abbas, his son, and their chief supporters escaped the city towards Syria. Sitt al-Qusur sent word of their escape to the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, however, and Abbas was killed, while Nasr was taken captive and sent back to Egypt, where he was executed by the women of the palace. The treasure of the palace, however, which Abbas had loaded on a train of 600 mules and camels and taken with him, was kept by the Crusaders. Vizierate =Domestic policies= Thus, in July 1154, Ibn Ruzzik entered Cairo in triumph. The symbols he chose during his entry carried ominous overtones for the future of the Fatimid dynasty: eschewing Fatimid white, both the standards of his army, and Ibn Ruzzik's own clothes, were black, the colour of the Fatimids' arch-rivals, the Abbasids. He then installed himself in the Dar al-Ma'mun palace, and began a purge of the officials and their families who had collaborated with Abbas. Those found guilty were executed or sent to exile, while a few managed to escape to Yemen. This left Ibn Ruzzik, now vizier, as the undisputed ruler of the country; the underage Caliph al-Fa'iz was reduced to a mere figurehead and lived under virtual house arrest. He was the first Fatimid vizier to assume the honorific laqab of al-Malik (\\"king\\"); according to Thierry Bianquis, this was probably in imitation of the earlier Buyid dynasty, who were likewise Imamis and who exercised a similar role as the guardians of, and de facto rulers instead of, the Abbasid caliphs. However, it was also a title used by the other great contemporary Muslim ruler, Nur al-Din Zengi of Syria. Himself well educated in high Arabic culture and a capable poet, Ibn Ruzzik liked to surround himself with scholars, among whom the most notable were the qāḍī al-Muhadhdhab al- Hasan ibn Ali ibn al-Zubayr (from Aswan), and the kātib al-Jalis al-Makin ibn al-Hubab, who directed the chancery (dīwān al-inshāʾ). Abbas' flight with the state treasure left a problematic financial situation, but Ibn Ruzzik proved an energetic and capable administrator, who paid close attention to financial matters: he not only balanced the economy, but also amassed a huge personal property through confiscations and speculation in cereals. Much of his personal wealth was used to endow pious establishments, including the large Husayn Mosque outside the Bab Zuwayla gate, intended to house a precious relic, the head of Husayn ibn Ali. This was the last major monument built under the Fatimids in Cairo, and was fortified according to the style of Upper Egypt. Having served long in Upper Egypt, Ibn Ruzzik maintained close ties to it; upon becoming vizier, he financed the reconstruction of the main mosque at Qus. The area now became his main powerbase: a wealthy region which controlled access to the interior of the African continent, as well as the commerce routes linking Egypt with Arabia—including the symbolically important hajj routes and the wheat supply for Mecca and Medina— and the Indian Ocean. The support of the governor of Qus, Nasir al-Dawla Yaqut, was important in suppressing the rebellion of the governor of Damietta, al-Ahwad ibn Tamim in 1156, but Yaqut himself plotted an uprising in 1157, in consultation with one of the Caliphs aunts, who resented Ibn Ruzzik's interference in palace affairs. Yaqut was arrested in Cairo and replaced with Izz al-Din Tarkhan, followed by Shawar, one of Ibn Ruzzik's pages (and future vizier). =Conflict with the Crusaders= Political map of the Levant in In spring 1154, a Crusader fleet from the Kingdom of Sicily raided the port city of Tinnis with devastating effect. Newly come to power in Cairo, Ibn Ruzzik initially sought to placate the Crusaders by paying them tribute in exchange for a truce. To this end, he planned to raise new taxes on the iqṭāʿ fiefs of his officers. The latter were opposed to the idea, and instead launched a raid of their own against the Crusader port of Tyre. The operation, bold and unorthodox, was successful, and scuppered Ibn Ruzzik's plans. In April 1154, Nur al-Din Zengi, the Muslim ruler of northern Syria, succeeded in capturing Damascus. Encouraged by this event, Ibn Ruzzik abandoned his negotiations with the Crusaders and renewed efforts to form a league between Egypt and Nur al-Din, which had already been attempted by Ibn al-Sallar in 1150. In 1158, Ibn Ruzzik sent the ḥādjib Mahmud al-Muwallad to Nur al-Din, proposing an alliance and joint operations against the Crusader principalities, while an army under Dirgham, the deputy chamberlain of the palace (nāʾib al-Bāb), was dispatched to raid into Palestine. The army scored some successes at Gaza and raided in Palestine up to beyond the Jordan River, while the Fatimid fleet raided against Beirut. These victories emboldened Ibn Ruzzik, who wrote of them to Nur al-Din, exhorting him to join with Egypt in holy war against the Crusaders. He also tried to enlist Usama ibn Munqidh, a former Fatimid official who had gained Nur al-Din's favour, in support of this cause, but in vain: Usama refused to take sides, and al-Muwallad's embassy failed. These operations were judged as ineffective both by Arab chroniclers and modern historians, while the reasons behind Nur al-Din's passivity have been debated. Nevertheless, these operations forced the other powers of the eastern Mediterranean to once again take account of Fatimid power. In the aftermath of the raid, a mission from the Byzantine Empire arrived at Cairo, asking for assistance against the Kingdom of Sicily. In reply, the brother of the ruler of Cyprus, who had been taken prisoner, was sent to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Soon after, envoys from the Crusader realms arrived to arrange a truce, while the Byzantines restored their relations with Nur al- Din. At the same time, Ibn Ruzzik tok care to fortify the city of Bilbays, north of Cairo, to block any army invading the country from the north. Death and succession On 23 July 1160, Caliph al-Fa'iz died of illness. Ibn Ruzzik at first considered raising an adult member of the Fatimid clan to the caliphate, but in the end settled on the nine-year-old al-Adid, whose father was one of the brothers of al-Zafir executed by Abbas on the very day al-Fa'iz had been raised to the throne. With a minor once again on the throne, Ibn Ruzzik's position was secure, and was strengthened further when he forced the young caliph to marry his daughter. However, these moves, coupled with Ibn Ruzzik's patronage of Twelver Shi'ism, alarmed the royal family. Sitt al-Qusur paid black soldiers, who attacked Ibn Ruzzik on 10 September 1161 in the hallway of his palace. Mortally wounded, Ibn Ruzzik nevertheless survived long enough to secure from the Caliph the recognition of his son, Ruzzik ibn Tala'i, as his successor, as well as the death of Sitt al-Qusur and the three men who had attacked him. On his deathbed, he reportedly confided to his son his three regrets: the construction of the Husayn Mosque outside the walls, which could be used to attack Cairo; that he did not have the opportunity to use Bilbays as a base against the Crusaders, despite the expenses lavished on it; and having put Shawar ibn Mujir al-Sa'di in the powerful position of governor of Upper Egypt, from where he now posed a threat to his own power. His premonition proved true: in 1162, Shawar chased Ibn Tala'i from Cairo, and became the de facto ruler of Egypt. In 1174, one of his descendants took part in an abortive large-scale conspiracy to overthrow Saladin and restore the Fatimids, who had been deposed three years previously, to power. Assessment Muslim chroniclers were divided in their assessment of Ibn Ruzzik: the Egyptian historian Ibn Zafir focused on his violent behaviour and greed, but the 13th-century polymath Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi considered him among the most successful Fatimid viziers, along the likes of Ibn Killis or al-Afdal Shahanshah. This assessment is largely shared by modern historians; Thierry Bianquis describes him as \\"the last great man of the Fāṭimid state, who wanted to reconstruct a strong Egypt, which could carry out its own foreign policies\\".

Summary  Kropotkin, c. 1900 Kropotkin's Memoirs address the arc of his life, the development of his anarchist philosophy, and his activism for socialist causes. It covers his childhood, cadet corps schooling, geographical work, political awakening, international travel, and Chaykovsky Circle work. He discusses his exile and activism in Western Europe after escaping from a Russian jail.  Publication history  Elements of what would become Kropotkin's Memoirs of a Revolutionist were first published in The Atlantic Monthly between 1898 and 1899 in English, the same year it received its first publication from Houghton Mifflin with an introduction by Georg Brandes. Later editions of this original 1899 release include those edited and introduced by James Allen Rodgers (Doubleday, 1962) and Nicolas Walter (Dover Publications, 1971). Both use endnotes to address Kropotkin's subsequent Russian-language additions in the translation of his Memoirs. After its initial release, Kropotkin continued to revise his Memoirs with Russian- language additions in a translation of the 1902 English release. These were published in multiple editions between 1906 and 1929. The canonical 1933 Soviet Academia edition derived from Kropotkin's Russian manuscript and became the basis for Soviet reprints. A reviewer of the English editions in The Slavonic and East European Review remarked that the memoirs remained readable and interesting in the present day. While he praised the editors' extensive notes and sufficient indices, he felt that ready footnotes would have been more appropriate than endnotes for putting Kropotkin's additions in context, and that the 1933 Russian edition's illustrations would have been worthwhile imports.

Died in 1897 Calgary, Alberta, Canada). He was a famous Siksika runner from Western Canada whose most noted achievement was winning the 1886 Calgary Star-Rink Endurance Race. Deerfoot - Bad Meat (Appi-Ka-ees) c.1880 courtesy Glenbow Archives  Biography  Deerfoot-Bad Meat was born c.1864 on the Blackfoot Indian Reserve on the Western Canadian plains. The son of Nato-West-Sitsi (Medicine Fire) and nephew of Big Chief Crowfoot. Deerfoot-Bad Meat followed the Blackfoot tradition at the time of having several wives and several children; he died on Feb 24, 1897 in Calgary.  Career as a runner  By 1880, Deerfoot-Bad Meat had become an exceptional long-distance runner working as a messenger for the Blackfoot Confederacy running between camps in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Montana. Deerfoot-Bad Meat first began running in minor local races when he was discovered by a Calgary gambling group called The Syndicate. The group was interested in finding local runners who could compete with continental champions for gambling money. Around the same time the indoor track \\"Star- Rink\\" was being built in Calgary which would serve as a venue for these championship foot-races. In 1883, in one of his first professional races, Deerfoot-Bad Meat defeated professional runner James Green and Blackfoot runner Little Plume in a four-day endurance race. In 16 hours, he completed 84 miles and 6 laps. Following this, Api-kai-ees was officially given the professional name Deerfoot, after the original Seneca runner Deerfoot-Red Jacket. Deerfoot-Bad Meat continued to run successfully in many more local races in the Calgary area and beyond, defeating challengers from as far away as Europe. In 1886 he won the prestigious Dominion Day one-mile race, coming within a second of breaking the world record for that distance. Later that autumn, in order to showcase Canadian talent to the world, multiple gambling groups decided to organize a major ten-mile race in Calgary. Deerfoot-Bad Meat was entered to run against the favourite J.W. Strokes of Birmingham, England and George Irvine of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In what was considered the race of the decade, Deerfoot-Bad Meat overwhelmingly defeated Stokes and Irvine, beating the Englishman by a full lap. Not happy with what the Europeans considered a \\"humilliating\\" defeat, the handlers of the British runner claimed a miscount of laps and the race was invalidated. The organizers rescheduled a new race for several days later. Nevertheless, being already suspicious of the British team, Deerfoot-Bad Meat stepped onto the race track only after giving Stokes a six lap head-start in order to dispel any possibility of another miscount. Deerfoot nevertheless passed the Birmingham racer and finished the ten miles in 54 minutes 30 seconds.  Later career and death  Disillusioned and disappointed with the corruption involving the gambling group The Syndicate, Deerfoot parted ways with his team in 1886 and began running as an independent with mixed success. Deerfoot died in 1897 of tuberculosis and is buried in an unmarked grave in Calgary. In 1974 the City of Calgary renamed a major freeway, Deerfoot Trail, as well as an industrial centre and shopping venue (Deerfoot City) in his honour.

Together with the existing four s, the four new surface combatants will form the backbone of the Finnish Navy from the mid-2020s onwards. They will replace seven older vessels that have been or are due to be decommissioned: the minelayer , two s and four s. Design =General characteristics= The overall length of the Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be about and the beam about . The maximum draught of the vessels will be about which corresponds to a displacement of about . With these main dimensions, the new multi-role corvettes will be the largest Finnish surface combatants since the 1930s coastal defence ships Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen. Each ship will have a complement of about 70 officers and crew. Designed for year-round service in the seasonally freezing Baltic Sea, Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will feature an ice-strengthened hull and ability to operate independently in ice. Although no Finnish-Swedish ice class exists for military vessels, the ice capacity of the corvettes will be equivalent to that ice class 1A for merchant ships. Pohjanmaa class will feature a combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion system with a total output of about . During normal patrol operations, the ship's twin ice-strengthened controllable pitch propellers are driven by electric propulsion motors. However, two of the four 12-cylinder MAN 12V175D type diesel generating sets are installed on double resilient mountings within soundproof enclosures to reduce noise and vibration during anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. When higher speeds are required, a single General Electric LM2500 gas turbine driving both propeller shafts via a common gearbox can be used to achieve speeds in excess of . For low-speed maneuvering, the ships are fitted with two bow thrusters. = Combat management system and sensors = The combat management system (CMS) of the Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be provided by the Swedish defence company Saab. Built around the 9LV CMS, the system will include Sea Giraffe 4A FF fixed-face AESA and Sea Giraffe 1X short-range 3D radars installed on a Saab Lightweight Integrated Mast (SLIM), two CEROS 200 fire control directors, TactiCall integrated communications system, and a laser warning system. Before final selection, Finnish Navy shortlisted Saab together with Lockheed Martin Canada and Atlas Elektronik as the potential combat management system provider and integrator. The underwater sensor suite will consist of Kongsberg's SS2030 active hull-mounted sonar and SD9500 lightweight over-the-side dipping sonar. In addition, Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be equipped with Patria's lightweight dual-tow Sonac DTS that includes both an active variable-depth sonar as well as a passive towed receiving array. = Armament = Pohjanmaa- class corvettes will be armed with a single dual-purpose naval gun, surface- to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, anti-submarine torpedos, naval mines, close-in weapon systems, and a decoy system. The forward-mounted Bofors 57 mm Mk3 dual-purpose main gun will be recycled from the Hamina-class missile boats. In addition, each Pohjanmaa-class corvette will be fitted with two Saab Trackfire remote controlled weapon stations for close-in self-defence and four Rheinmetall Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS) decoy launchers. The primary surface-to-surface armament of the Pohjanmaa class is the Gabriel 5 subsonic anti-ship missile. The latest version of Israel Aerospace Industries's anti-ship missile family was selected over Kongsberg's Naval Strike Missile, MBDA's Exocet, Boeing's Harpoon and Saab's RBS15. In Finnish Navy service, the missile system will be referred to as PTO2020 (Pintatorjuntaohjus 2020). Against aerial targets, Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be armed with Raytheon RIM-162 Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) surface- to-air missiles. Each vessel will be capable of carrying a total of 32 missiles quad-packed to eight Mark 41 Vertical Launching System silos. In Finnish Navy service, the system will be referred to as ITO20 (Ilmatorjuntaohjus 20). For underwater warfare, the vessels will be fitted with Saab Torped 47 lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. In addition, Pohjanmaa-class corvettes will be able to lay naval mines. Development and construction The initial development of the new surface combatants for the Finnish Navy began with a research and planning phase in 2008 and the Squadron 2020 project was officially launched in 2015. The 647.6 million euro shipbuilding contract was awarded to the Finnish shipbuilder Rauma Marine Constructions in September 2019. The construction of the four-strong class will be staggered over 2022–2025 and full operational status is achieved in 2028. Naming One of the Finnish navy's traditions has been to name its major combat ships after regions in Finland. The name Pohjanmaa, which is the Finnish name for the region Ostrobothnia, has been used both by the Finnish and Swedish navies for previous ships and classes of ships, dating back to the 18th century with the first recorded vessel being Gamla Pojama (\\"Old Pohjanmaa\\"), that was launched in 1760, and the last one, being the minelayer/training vessel , which was sold in 2016. The aforementioned 18th century Pohjanmaa, alongside the Hämeenmaa, Uusimaa and Turunmaa classes were also the four main \\"archipelago frigate\\" classes used in the 1790 Battle of Svensksund, which is one of the largest Finnish (Finland was a part of Sweden at the time) naval victories and the largest naval battle in the Baltic Sea to date.  Criticism  = Corvette or frigate? = While the Finnish Navy and the Ministry of Defence refer to the new surface combatants as multi-role corvettes, several commentators have pointed out that by displacement the vessels should be classified as frigates.corvettes are traditionally considered as the smallest class of warships with displacement up to 3,000tons; frigate is the next size category In late September 2019, shortly after the construction contract was awarded, MP Johannes Yrttiaho (Left Alliance) submitted a written question to the Parliament of Finland about, among other related topics, the classification of the new ships. In the official blog of the Finnish Defence Forces, Flotilla admiral (Commander of the Finnish Navy) noted that one of the reasons leading to the increased displacement is the additional strengthening of the hull, propulsion shaft lines and propellers required for year-round operation in the seasonally freezing Finnish territorial waters. He also pointed out that the Pohjanmaa class is intended to operate primarily in coastal waters whereas frigates are traditionally considered as the smallest class of warships operating in the high seas as part of a so-called blue-water navy. = Too large for Finland? = Since the early 2000s, Finnish Navy's surface combatant fleet has consisted mainly of fast attack craft with displacements of . Until the planned commission of the new Pohjanmaa-class, the largest surface combatants of the Finnish Navy remain the two Hämeenmaa-class minelayers. Several commentators have criticized the Squadron 2020 program due to the size of the new corvettes: according to critics, the ships are too large for the often shallow Finnish territorial waters riddled with skerries as well as too attractive and large targets for Russian anti-ship missiles. Furthermore, it has been speculated that the ship size has been driven by their suitability for international missions rather than domestic defence needs and that the whole concept has been derived from the Freedom-class littoral combat ships operated by the United States Navy. The Finnish Navy has argued that the size of the new ships is a result of combining multiple missions within a single hull. In particular, the ability to lay naval mines has been raised as one of the key features necessitating a larger vessel. Despite some similarities in external appearance to other naval ships, the new multi-role corvettes have been tailored for the Finnish Navy's missions in the Baltic Sea and thus represent a completely new vessel concept with no reference design in service anywhere in the world.

It was founded by German industrialist Franz Krull in 1865 in Narva and in 1875 it was moved to Tallinn. The company manufactured different products, including steam locomotives, equipment for power plants and oil shale industry, and agricultural machinery. During the Soviet occupation the company was nationalized and it became one of the largest contractors for the Soviet gas industry. History The company was founded on 25 April 1865 when German brazier Franz Joachim Heinrich Krull rented from the city of Narva a coppersmith workshop, which was belonged to deceased Friedrich Ludwig Büll. The main product of the newly established company became distillation apparatuses. In 1870 it introduced the new type of distillation apparatus which had higher efficiency and quality than other models of that time. That business created enough revenue to bought out the workshop. Entrance to the Franz Krull plant The iron-cast fence of the Franz Krull plantd (1931) In 1875, Franz Krull sold the workshop in Narva and moved the industry to Tallinn. In 1895, Franz Krull sons Franz Krull II and Gerhard Krull took over the management of the company. In 1899, the industry moved to the Kalamaja district in Tallinn. The company also produced boilers, e.g. for the Tallinn Power Plant and locomotives, cisterns and tanks, filters and pumps, transmissions and gears, equipment for lumber mills and copper smithies, and various cast iron products. Production of the distillery equipment decreased but continued to be a part of the production portfolio. Before World War I AS Franz Krull received a number of contracts from the Russian military sector, particularly from three shipyards in Tallinn which were established in 1912–1913. As a result, the company had 400 employees in 1913. The company started to manufacture also high-capacity refrigeration and ice-making equipment. When World War I started, Gerhard Krull was in Germany and cannot return to Estonia. As German national he was afraid of confiscation of the company. To avoid this, the ownership was transferred to his brother-in-law, who immediately sold the company to the Azov–Don Commercial Bank and fled with money. Franz Krull II continued as a director of the company until his death in 1917. During the war the company manufactured water desalination systems for cruisers, cooling systems and boilers for cargo ships, and various machines and equipment for fortresses. In the beginning of the independence of Estonia, AS Franz Krull was taken over by German financiers. Later it was listed at the Tallinn stock exchange. The company manufactured mainly cast iron consumer goods. In 1927, it started to manufacture equipment for the oil shale industry. Between 1927 and 1938, it manufactured four tunnel oven for the oil shale company Eesti Kiviõli.Holmberg (2008), p. 104 In 1938, the Glen Davis Shale Oil Works in Australia planned to order two tunnel ovens from AS Franz Krull; however, due to time and budget constraints the deal was not finalized.Holmberg (2008), p. 76 In 1931, AS Franz Krull manufactured its first steam locomotive. The company continued to manufacture refrigeration equipment, which in addition to the Estonian market was exported to Lithuania, but occasionally also to India, Iran, the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. The company produced also road construction machinery, peat industry machinery, agricultural machinery, and boilers. After start of the Soviet occupation the company was nationalized and renamed Punane Krull (meaning Red Krull). After start of the World War II, the equipment of the metal works and employees were transferred to Russia to avoid capture by German forces. During the German occupation the metal works continued to work in Tallinn under German administration. After restoration of the Soviet rule in Estonia, the company was renamed Plant No. 9 of the Main Department of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas () in 1945. The plant specialized in the production of equipment for the oil shale and natural gas industry, as well as lifting equipment. In 1949, it was renamed Tallinn Machinery Plant (). The plant production included large-scale ventilators, centrifugal pumps, high- power steam boilers, conveyors, and elevators. Its drilling rigs were used in addition to the Soviet Union also in Albania, Romania, China and several Arab countries. In 1955, the plant was placed under the USSR Oil and Gas Industry Construction Ministry, which focused on the construction of construction machinery. In 1963, the plant started manufacturing air-cooled heat exchangers. In 1971, the plant was named after the communist politician Johannes Lauristin. After Estonia regained independence, the plant was privatized in 1993. As of 2018, it is named OÜ Tallinna Masinatehas and it concentrated on production of heat exchangers.

Alessandra Grillo, Le Grand Tour de Léonie d'Aunet - Voyage d’une Parisienne aux pays boréaux, Revue Astrolabe, n° 21, septembre-octobre 2008. __TOC__  Biography  D'Aunet was born to Auguste-François-Michel Thévenot d’Aunet an officer of a military squadron from Québec, and d’Henriette- Joséphine d’Orémieulx. She was educated at the Institute Fauvel. She married the painter François-Auguste Biard (1798-1882) on 23 July 1840 in Paris. In 1838 the corvette La Recherche (1838-1839), under the command of Joseph Paul Gaimard, undertook a scientific expedition to Spitzbergen, to explore the Arctic. D'Aunet was by this time living with Biard, and agreed to persuade her future husband to accept the position of official painter for the expedition, on condition that she be allowed to accompany him. She traveled with Biard across Belgium, Holland and Norway, before leaving Hammerfest, the northernmost city in Scandinavia, and returned after spending several weeks at Spitzbergen. She was the first woman to participate in a scientific expedition to the northern regions, On return, her letters were published, in serial form, in La Revue de Paris* In autumn 1843 she became acquainted with Victor Hugo, whom she most likely met at the salon of Fortunée Hamelin.* Their relationship eased Hugo's life, inspiring him to the numerous poems of which one finds trace in Contemplations. Her seven year liaison was interrupted by Victor Hugo's exile after the coup d'état by Louis Napoleon on December 2, 1851. On Monday April 1844, their relations became public knowledge, when on July 5, 1845, she was surprised with the writer in the act of adultery in a hotel on the :fr:Passage Saint-Roch. The commissioner let Hugo leave after hesitating, when Hugo invoked his inviolability as a peer of France, but Leonie was arrested and taken to the prison at Saint-Lazare. After two months, she was transferred to the Convent of the Ladies of Saint Michael, where Adèle Foucher (wife of Victor Hugo), who was glad to see a competitor to Juliette Drouet, decided to visit Leonie. In the meanwhile Louis-Philippe I awarded a commission to her husband to appease him.  Literary career  Painting by Biard painted after the Spitzbergen expedition. On September 10, 1845, she entered the convent of the Augustines, where she remained for about six months. Once released, she made frequent visits to Hugo's home. Adele Foucher helped her, in exchange for clothing advice and interior decoration, to launch her literary career. Some even affirmed that most of her books were due to Victor HugoEdmond-Denis Manne, New Dictionary of anonymous and pseudonymous works: with the names of the authors or editors: accompanied by historical notes And critics, Lyon, N. Scheuring, 1868, When Hugo left for exile, Adele dissuaded her from joining him, but their correspondence did not cease. He, feeling responsible for the children of Leonie, upon his return from exile, regularly sent her money until his death. She entered into the literary career under her maiden name, after her legal separation from her husband in 1855. She began by publishing, as a book with Hachette, the account of her journey to Spitzbergen under the title of \\"Voyage d'une femme au Spitzberg.\\" This work was followed by the \\"Un Mariage en province.\\" (1856), published in La Presse; The Vengeance (1857), Étiennette, Silvère , The Secret (1859), The Heritage of the Marquis d'Elsigny for the Library of the Railways from Hachette Publishers, and which earned her a distinguished place in the letters.  Playwright  D'Aunet also devoted herself to the theater by writing the drama \\"Jane Osborn\\", performed by Lucie Mabire, on 30 January 1856 at the Porte de Saint-Martin theater. She also published serials in The Century, the Courrier de Paris, Journal pour tous, and The Event, and held the fashion column at the magazine Les Modes parisiennes under the pseudonym \\"Thérèse de Blaru\\".  Family  She left a son, known as Biard d'Aunet, who married Miss de Lestang- Parade. She also had a daughter, who died in 1897, who bore in literature the pseudonym \\"Sparkle\\" and who successively married Peyronny and Baron Double.

It can be a manual or automated process. The process uses a welding head that has a nozzle for hot air and an extruder that pushes filler material out. The process entails heating of the joining (faying) surfaces by means of heat of and addition of molten or plasticized filler material (extrudate) being extruded through a die (shoe). The extrudate is applied with pressure to ensure good bonding, and then the part is allowed to cool.  Welding steps  The steps of this welding process are similar to other plastic welding processes and involve: * Surface preparation of base material - machining the required groove as per joint design and cleaning the faying surfaces by scraping. This removes dirt and oxides from the joining surfaces, which would potentially contaminate the finished weld. * Fit-up of weld joint - tack welding the base material components (using hot gas welding) or using a clamping system * Welding - adding the extrudate while applying pressure * Finishing of the final weld appearance - Removing flash with a scraper in order to avoid stress notches. This step may or may not be necessary. * Cooling - Allowing the part to cool down so it is ready for use Preheat is required at the initial start of the weld. This is typically achieved by using the hot air nozzle on the welding gun and fanning the starting area. Once welding has commenced, proper travel speed and gun angle will ensure that the upcoming faying surface has been sufficiently preheated. The filler material is a polymer that comes in the form of spooled strands or in pellets.  Joint configuration Most weld joints are designed to be a single pass, but plates over 30 mm thickness will require multiple passes. Because most passes are designed to be done in a single pass, extrusion welding typically takes less overall time to perform as compared to other plastic welding processes, particularly its predecessor, hot gas welding. Joint design include: * Butt joints ** Single-V ** Double-V * T-Joints * Overlap joints Butt joints will be single-V or double-V groove with 45-90° and 0-2 mm root gap. If welding a double-V groove, welding will need to be performed in a minimum of two passes. T-joints will normally have a single bevel of 45-60° and 0-2 mm root gap. Both TYK connections for piping and fillet welds are achievable as well.  Applications Extrusion welding is an attractive process for applications that take advantage of its ability to weld thick sections quickly. For some applications, especially where there are large geometry parts where more traditional plastic welding methods (such as hot plate welding) is not possible, extrusion welding is the only feasible and cost effect option. In particular, tanks for liquid waste, corrosive materials, water supply are common applications. As long as a sealing bond is achieved, extrusion welding can be used for waterproofing applications as well.  Materials Extrusion welding has seen the most success in welding different types of polyolefins. Common materials welded with this process are: * Polyethylene (PE), in particular high-density polyethylene * Polypropylene (PP) * Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) * Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)  Equipment While there are various forms of extrusion welding equipment, there are three main components that every extrusion welding setup contains:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-u8dvlNptM = Extruder = The extruder is the part of the setup that actually feeds extrudate through the system. The setup of the extruder depends on if the extrudate is in pellet or in spooled strand form. When spooled strands are used, the spool is fed through a tube into the welding head and then exits through the shoe. When pellets are used for extrudate, the pellets are fed into a hopper, then a heated spiral extruder forces them through the welding head and out through the shoe as molten filler material. Pellets can only be used when welding is being performed in the flat or horizontal position. = Radiant heat source = For most applications, the radiant heat source will be hot air. The air is heated and blown through a nozzle that is part of the weld head setup. Different nozzle geometries are available, and the welder may select a certain nozzle depending on the joint configuration. Although there is a general purpose nozzle, certain nozzles ensure more thorough or more focused heating of a given joint type. Although hot air is usually used as the means for preheat, halogen lamps are sometimes used as the means for preheating the faying surface. = Welding shoe = The welding shoe is the die at the end of the feed through which the filler material is being extruded. Typically, the shoe is made out of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) because of PTFE's non-stick properties. Welding shoes come in various shapes and sizes depending on the joint design that is being welded. The welding shoe will also have guide nipples that prevent the molten extrudate from flowing in an undesired direction.  Welding parameters There are several main welding parameters, and each of them have a different bearing on the welding process. Some are dependent on the welder, whereas others can be set on the machine before welding commences. Getting a good balance of each parameter is the key to achieving strong and aesthetic welds. Automation or skill by an experienced welder, coupled with properly set parameters will result in consistent and reproducible welds. = Welding speed= Welding speed or travel speed, is the rate at which the weld is traversing down the weld joint. For an automated system, the welding speed can be set before the machine starts to go. With a manual setup, the travel speed will depend on the welder. If the travel speed is too fast, there won't be enough filler material deposited, resulting in a small weld bead. Traveling too quickly may also not provide enough time to get sufficient heat to the faying surfaces. This will result in poor adhesion of the extrudate to the faying surface. This poor adhesion leads to poor strength of the welded part. Conversely, if the travel speed is too low, then too much filler material will be deposited, resulting in an unaesthetic weld and potentially flash formation which will then need to be removed. = Position of the welding head = Position of the welding gun is essential to ensure that the extrudate is being deposited in the right area. When a manual system is being used, the welder will need to ensure that the welding head is aimed correctly. If there is misalignment between the gun and the joint, the material will not be deposited to the correct area. To help guide the welder, the weld shoe will be specifically shaped for a given joint geometry so that the position is maintained throughout welding. = Temperature of the extrudate = The temperature of the extrudate will be set on the extruder before welding begins. The temperature must be high enough such that the extrudate will be sufficiently fluid to flow, but not so high that the polymer filler material will begin to chemically breakdown. The ideal temperature for the extrudate will be dependent on what polymer being used. = Airflow rate and air temperature= Studies by have found that airflow rate and temperature are the two biggest factors in the development of creep strength of the welded parts. This is because airflow rate and air temperature are the two biggest factors in development of a melt layer prior to welding. The melt layer is the layer of molten polymer on top of the faying surface. When the melt layer reaches an ideal thickness for welding, the creep strength of the welds increase dramatically. Like with the temperature of the extrudate however, the ideal temperature and airflow rate for base material will depend on what polymer is being welded. Additionally, airflow may be altered depending on the shape of the nozzle. = Extrusion rate= Extrusion rate is how much extrudate is actually being transferred into the joint at any given time. Along with extrudate temperature and airflow rate/temperature, extrusion rate must be balanced in order to achieve ideal weld properties. If not enough material is added, then there won't be complete fusion of the joint. Conversely, if too much filler is added, then there is potential to create flash or sharp point at the toes of the weld cap. These would act as stress risers and dramatically decrease the strength of the weld both in dynamic and fatigue loading.  Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages = The main advantage of extrusion welding is that it can achieve very high deposition rates of filler material into a joint, thus cutting down on cycle time. As compared to hot gas welding, which is a polymer welding process that could have many of the same applications, the time to completion for a weld is as much as 5-6x faster. With proper parameters, the fusion areas of the weld will actually not be the weakest part of a given fabricated polymeric part. Because many of the main welding parameters are preset on the machine, getting consistent high quality welds is possible. = Disadvantages = If using manual extrusion welding, the welder must have a certain amount of skill in order to produce sound welds. This is especially true when welding in vertical or overhead positions. Furthermore, a manual machine could be as heavy as 12kg, which would prove to be cumbersome.

Chinn George Morgan Chinn (January 15, 1902September 4, 1987) was an American weapons expert and soldier. He attended Centre College, and played on the 1921 Centre Praying Colonels football team, which won the national championship. Chinn then opened a diner in a cave, known as 'The Cave House', which also functioned as an underground gambling center. He served as the bodyguard of Happy Chandler while he was governor of Kentucky. Chinn was also Sergeant of Arms for the Kentucky Legislature. Later he was the production line inspector for several weapons' manufacturers, and eventually, a Marine. He designed the Mk 19 grenade launcher. Eventually one of the United States's premier arms experts, Bill Bright said of him \\"He did for military weapons what Wozniak and Gates did for computers. He added the right pieces to make them reliable and usable. He was what was then called a garage (in his case, cave) inventor.\\" Chin retired to become director of the Kentucky Historical Society from 1960 to 1973, and later Kentucky Military History Museum.  Early life  Chinn was born on January 15, 1902, to George P. Chinn (the warden of a state penitentiary) and Anna (Carlisle) Chinn (who would die eight years later). His grandfather John Pendleton Chinn, was a member of the Kentucky State Legislature. He grew up in Mundy's Landing, Kentucky. Chinn attended Braxton Hall and Millersburg Military Institute, both of which he disliked. At the Military Institute, he set a state record in the javelin throw. Though he would not graduate until 1920, in December 1918, Chinn was to have been commissioned as an officer in France, but World War I ended before he could.pp. 1-16 While at Centre College, Chinn played football and wrote, among other places, in the local newspaper, The Advocate. Playing as a lineman, Chinn started games in 1920 and 1921, though, as a result of constant injuries he often served as an assistant coach. pp. 14–28 He worked as a golf salesman for Lowe and Campbell Athletic Goods before leaving Centre to be assistant coach with Charley Moran at Bucknell University. Chinn left to coach at Wesleyan University, and later Catawba University (at the latter of which he was often in practice the head coach). By 1930, Chinn was recognized as one of the best college football coaches in the country. pp. 32–36 Chinn hired a man known as Tunnel Smith to help him build a diner in a cave, which he called 'The Cave House'. The restaurant soon proved immensely popular, attracting thousands of people. On the side, he ran an illegal slot machine operation and liquor business. When arrested, Chinn was acquitted as he argued it was not an illegal game of chance, because it was impossible to win. He was also involved in restoring a ferry known as the Iron Duke. pp. 37-46  Military  Unemployed, Chinn turned to his old friend, at the time governor of Kentucky, Happy Chandler. He served as a tour guide, and Sergeant at Arms for the Kentucky State Legislature. He got to know the capitol and its workings well enough that some thought he should run for governor. pp. 49, 56 Chinn later served as the bodyguard for Chandler and Jack Dempsey when he spent time in Kentucky. In 1939, he took a job as a weapons consultant to the army. Eager to serve in the war, Chinn demanded to Chandler that he be allowed to join the Marines. He objected, saying \\"You're over forty years old, and you weigh 330 pounds! You'll get in the way and you’ll get killed, and you’ll get other people killed, too. Go home!\\" Eventually, Chandler relented. He was 118 pounds over the weight limit, and ten years over the age limit.Bright, Sallie. \\"Mercer County’s Modest Marine.\\" Kentucky Advocate, January 15, 1984. Chinn received basic training at Quantico, Virginia, and was then stationed at Fort Knox and Cherry Point. He made a series of improvements to the Browning .50 caliber machine gun, impressing his superiors. Chinn was then assigned to respond to questions regarding various guns. He worked on weaponry at the Naval Air Test Center, the Navy Proving Grounds, the Naval Aviation Ordnance Testing Station and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. In 1945 Chinn travelled to the Pacific Theatre, inspecting capabilities of the Marines. At the end of the war, Chinn, by then a colonel was one of the most prominent weapons experts in the army. pp. 61, 63-67 From 1946 to 1956, Chinn worked on a four volume, 500,000 word history of the machine gun.

He was the recipient of the Davy Medal in 1960 and president of the Chemical Society from 1962 to 1964. Life He was born on 24 July 1900 at Nether Fordun farm near Auchterarder the son of William Robertson, farmer, and his wife, Jeannie Monteath. He was educated at Auchterarder Primary School then Perth Academy. He then studied chemistry at Glasgow University graduating BSc in 1923, MA in 1925. He then continued as a postgraduate gaining his first doctorate (PhD) in 1926. Under the advisement of G. G. Henderson, he produced a doctoral thesis entitled \\"The structural relationships of certain members of the bicyclic sesquiterpene series\\". In his graduate work, he crystallized sesquiterpene derivatives and gave them to William Henry Bragg for X-ray diffraction. He sent a caryophyllene alcohol. The structure was not solved until approximately 30 years later. In 1926, he began work as a researcher at the Royal Institution in London, under the tutelage of Bragg. He continued to work on sesquiterpene derivatives, but also shifted his attention to physics. In 1928 he obtained a post in physics at the University of Michigan in the United States, but returned to the Royal Institution at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in 1930. During that time, he solved many small, organic molecule structures by X-ray crystallography. In particular, he reported the structures of several novel phthalocyanines. Robertson used heavy-metal derivatives to solve the phase problem by Isomorphous replacement, which paved the way to determine novel structures. In 1939 he moved to Sheffield University as senior lecturer in physical chemistry. This was interrupted by the Second World War (from 1942) he served as chemical advisor to Bomber Command and scientific advisor to the RAF. From 1942 he was professor and department head of chemistry at Glasgow University. At University of Glasgow, he trained a number of students: > \\"Among those who began X-ray work with me in Glasgow after the war are A. > McL. Mathieson and J. D. Morrison (now mass spectrometry) in Melbourne, > Maria Przybylska in Ottawa, J. G.

C. > Speakman, George Sim, Tom Hamor and Andrew Porte (now nuclear magnetic > resonance) are all back in Glasgow again, after adventures in other places, > and are actively participating in our latest and most exciting work.\\" In 1960, Robertson's group reported the structure of limonin, a complex organic molecule whose structure had eluded chemists since its discovery in 1841. With the structure, Robertson's group also demonstrated a clear path to apply novel computational techniques to solve the phase problem for complex organic molecules by using heavy-metal derivatives. This was a continuation of his previous work phasing organic molecules. In 1943 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Wilfred Cook, Thomas Alty, Edward Hindle, John Walton and James Pickering Kendall. In 1945 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In the 1962 Birthday Honours he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1963 he received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from Aberdeen University. He retired in 1970 and died in Inverness on 27 December 1989. Family In 1930 he married Stella Kennard (née Nairn) in Toronto.

History  Saint Hermann (of Niederaltaich) lived from 1324 until his death in 1326 as a hermit in a monastic cell in the ancient forest. His successor, Hartwig of Degenberg, built a chapel for a miraculous figure, \\"Our Dear Lady\\" (Unserer lieben Frau), the Blessed Virgin Mary. The region of \\"Our Dear Lady of Au\\" (Unsere liebe Frau Au) belonged to Niederaltaich Abbey on the River Danube. From the 14th century to the late 18th century, the miraculous image of the \\"Dolorous Mother of God\\" (schmerzhafte Muttergottes) was the destination of a pilgrimage. As early as 1352, Frauenau was therefore elevated to a parish and, in 1396, a Gothic church was built. Its architect was Hans Krumenauer (father of Stephan Krumenauer), who was also involved in the cathedral in Passau. From 1759 to 1767 a new church was built in the rococo style. The church was consecrated on 15 August 1767 and placed under the protection of Mary, the Mother of God. Until secularisation in 1803, the parish of Frauenau was managed by Niederaltaich Abbey and Priory of Rinchnach. In 1927 the church was extended to the west.

It is a compilation of early recordings of Garcia playing folk and bluegrass music with various other musicians. The recordings were made from 1961 to 1964, before Garcia co- founded the rock band the Grateful Dead. Produced as a four-CD box set, and also as a five-LP limited edition box set, it was released on May 11, 2018.  Recording  In the early 1960s, the American folk music revival was in full swing, and the San Francisco Bay Area had its own folk scene. In 1961, after getting out of the Army, Jerry Garcia started playing folk music and other old-time songs. Garcia would sing and play acoustic guitar as a member of various ensembles and bands. Over the next few years, Garcia also become interested in bluegrass music, and learned to play the banjo. As his music skills evolved, he continued to play in different bands with similarly inclined musicians. A number of these performances were captured on reel-to- reel tape. In 1965, after a dalliance with jug band music, Garcia co-founded the rock band the Grateful Dead. Before the Dead includes performances by several musicians who also collaborated with Garcia in later years. Robert Hunter wrote the lyrics for many Grateful Dead songs; David Nelson was a member of the New Riders of the Purple Sage; and Nelson and Sandy Rothman were members of the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band.  Production  Before the Dead was produced by Dennis McNally, an author and former publicist for the Grateful Dead, and Brian Miksis, a documentarian and audio engineer. The two worked together to track down some of the original recordings from Jerry Garcia's formative years as a musician. They also assembled many new short essays about the songs and the early '60s folk scene in the Bay Area, along with photographs from that time. The 1962 performance by the Hart Valley Drifters, at the studio of Stanford University radio station KZSU, was previously released as the album Folk Time.  Critical reception  In Rolling Stone, David Browne wrote, \\"... Garcia spent several years immersed in bluegrass and folk, playing in a succession of Palo Alto-area bands with oddball names like the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers. To date, only a small portion of the recordings he made with those combos has been released, making the multi-disc Before the Dead the deepest – and most educational – dive yet into Garcia's pre-Dead musical life. Right up to his death, Garcia would periodically revisit his bluegrass roots, from the wonderful but short-lived Old & In the Way to albums he made with mandolinist David Grisman. But Before the Dead reveals, in more detail than ever before, when and how that appetite began and why numbers like \\"Deep Elem Blues\\" and \\"Rosa Lee McFall\\", both heard here, made their way into the Dead's repertoire.\\" In DownBeat, Jesse Jarnow said, \\"An illuminating new box set, Before the Dead... shines light on Garcia's earliest music – recordings between 1961 and 1964 – most often remembered as his \\"bluegrass period\\" for his virtuosic banjo playing. But the four-CD/five-LP collection reveals a far richer picture.... No casual player, the nearly four hours of music uncover a musician filled with ambition and energy. By a year after the earliest recording, Garcia had turned to banjo. That, too, became a progression, from the ghostly frailings of the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, recorded in June 1962 (\\"Little Birdie\\"), to the shredding Bill Keith style he'd accentuated by his time with the Black Mountain Boys in 1964 (\\"Salt Creek\\"). The sequence resulted in Garcia's instantly recognizable electric guitar playing with the Dead, each crystalline, articulated note picked with a banjoist’s precision.\\" In Glide Magazine, Doug Collette wrote, \\"In roughly three and half hours of live and studio recordings, captured in various ways at a variety of locales between 1961 and 1964, Before the Dead documents the late Jerry Garcia's formative years as a musician. Overflowing with meticulous attention to detail in sound, text and graphics, this 4-CD/5-LP box set reveals how this iconic musician nurtured those attributes that eventually stood him in such good stead as titular leader of the Grateful Dead... If Before the Dead proves anything, it is that this man's passion for playing, as well as his insatiable curiosity about a diversity of styles, traditional and otherwise, was well-established long before the coalescence of the Grateful Dead.\\"  Track listing  Disc 1 :Bob and Jerry – May 26, 1961: #\\"Santy Anno\\" (traditional) – 2:15 #\\"I Got a Home in That Rock\\" (traditional) – 1:46 #\\"Oh, Mary Don't You Weep\\" (traditional) – 3:31 #\\"All My Trials\\" (traditional) – 4:01 #\\"I Was Born Ten Thousand Years Ago\\" (H.

Described as having a pared down aesthetic, his functional designs are characterized by geometric shapes and unexpected angles. Background As a child Grcic loved to build things and during high-school he restored furniture. Grcic studied cabinetry making at the John Makepeace School in London, starting in 1985. Three years later, he took a class in furniture- design at London's Royal College of Art. Grcic worked with British designer Jasper Morrison in the late 1980s until 1990, when he began designing furniture for SCP, one of London's largest design stores. He credits his time in London for helping develop his individual style, describing \\"... his experiences in England as stirring his creative potential.\\" Career =Portfolio= Grcic founded his studio, \\"Konstantin Grcic Industrial Design\\" (KGID), in 1991 in Munich, Germany. Working with a staff of five, he creates \\"... pieces that have been described as both revolutionary and intelligent.\\" According to the New York Times, he has a \\"... rigorous focus on logic, utility and simplicity\\". With an emphasis on usability, Grcic is known for having a spartan approach to design, relying on geometric forms, unusual angles and hard edges. He has created installations and developed products such as furniture, lighting, watches, tableware, espresso makers, and even umbrellas. Grcic became recognized for his 1995 Refolo trolley, 1997 Wanda dish rack, 1998 award-winning Mayday lamp, 1999 ES shelf and 2001 Chaos chair. His iconic 2004 Chair_One and 2006 Miura stool are both described as being comfortable to sit on, despite their oddly shaped compositions. Grcic has a philosophical approach to design, especially when it comes to seating products, his favourite objects to tackle, \\"Designing chairs touches issues of society, how we live...How life changes - that’s most interesting.\\". He has used cutting edge technology, such as high-tech ceramics and 3D modeling software, to create his mass-produced items. Advanced engineering plastics were the basis of his award-winning Myto Chair, launched at the Milan Furniture Fair in 2008. Grcic also relies on low-tech solutions to advance the design process, manually creating and deconstructing rough paper models. An engineering-oriented approach and extensive research make up his methodology, something attributed to his upbringing, \\"...his penchant for amassing large amounts of data before he starts to work is nothing if not German.\\" Chair_One, 2004 His furniture and lighting designs, including the likes of OK pendant light and Noctambule lighting pay testimony to his signature ability to thread the needle between restraint and playfulness. =Exhibits and media= In 2009, the Chicago Art Institute held a retrospective of Grcic's work. Zoë Ryan, who curated the exhibit, states that the designer \\"is very mindful of how we interact with and use objects\\". In 2014, a Grcic exhibition of fictional products was showcased at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany. His design pieces are also found in the permanent collections of the MoMA in New York City and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris. In 2005, London's Phaidon Press published the first book examining Grcic's body of work. Other publications include monographs accompanying his museum exhibitions. He is also the subject of various design books like \\"How to Design a Chair\\", as well as \\"Chroma: Design, Architecture and Art in Color\\" where he mentions how the Lego color palette has inspired him. A film about Grcic's developmental process was screened at \\"A Design Film Festival 2017\\" held in Singapore. =Related activities= In 2009, Grcic curated an exhibition called \\"Design Real\\" at the Serpentine Gallery in London, England. He selected products with a practical function, from well known and lesser known designers, which reflected the first ten years of the millennium. In 2010, he curated two shows, one for France's \\"St. Etienne Design Biennale\\" and the other for the Istituto Svizzero (Swiss Institute) in Rome. Grcic has also participated in design initiatives happening in Belgrade, Serbia, such as speaking at \\"Belgrade Design Week\\" or sitting on the juries of the \\"Mikser Festival\\" and the \\"University of Arts in Belgrade\\" final year competition. Concerning the burgeoning design scene in Serbia's capital city, Grcic has said,\\"I was not sure what to expect but I encountered a fantastic atmosphere and amazing people.\\" The 2014 retrospective exhibition on Grcic's work, Panorama, held at the Vitra Design Museum, featured the installation Life Stage. Life Stage was a fictitious product meant as a mobile power source made of the eco-friendly resin Acrodur. Awards and honours In 2001, Grcic received a \\"Compasso d’Oro\\" award for his Mayday lamp. He won another \\"Compasso d’Oro\\" in 2011 for his Myto chair. He won two \\"Designpreis Deutschland\\" prizes, from the Government of Germany, for his Chair_ONE and Miura stool in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2006, his Miura stool also received a \\"Best of the Best\\" Red Dot award and an IF Design Award. In 2010, Grcic was named \\"Designer of the Year\\" at Design Miami, where he also created an installation consisting of seating made with polypropylene netting. In 2016, Dezeen magazine listed him as number 14 on their list of top 100 designers, based on the 48 articles written about him.

Born in Peckham, South London, he became interested in theatre while attending Alleyn's School on a scholarship. Having also received a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford, he took a first in history and, after graduating, became a lecturer in modern history at the University of Edinburgh. Whilst in Edinburgh, he took part in shows during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, but found that \\"learning huge dollops of script wasn’t all that appealing\\". In 1961, he became a Lecturer in History at Queen's University Belfast, but continued to have an interest in the arts. The arts festival which would later become the Queen's University Festival was founded by a student, Michael Emmerson, in 1962, and Barnes quickly became involved. When Emmerson started a Belfast branch of the National Film Theatre as the Queen's Film Theatre in 1968, Barnes was the chairman of the film sub- committee.  Belfast Festival  In 1973, Barnes was a senior lecturer in modern history at Queen's, when the role of Director of the Queen's University Festival became vacant. The Festival was in financial and creative difficulties and its future was uncertain. Queen's agreed to allow him to work on the Festival while remaining in his academic post, and Barnes became the Director, a post he would hold until 1994. Under Barnes' leadership, the Festival became the second largest in the British Isles after the Edinburgh Festival, and was able to attract internationally known performers, even during The Troubles, when many artists and audiences were reluctant to visit Northern Ireland. Performers included the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Moscow State Ballet, Yehudi Menuhin and local talents like Seamus Heaney and James Galway. Barnes also promoted newer artists like Nikolai Demidenko, Trestle Theatre, Philip Hammond, Rowan Atkinson and Billy Connolly. In the 1970s, Belfast's Grand Opera House was going to be sold and demolished. It was instead purchased by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, who successfully applied to make it the first listed building in Northern Ireland. Barnes supervised an extensive renovation, and when the Opera House re-opened in 1980, he was the artistic director. He left his academic post in 1976, to concentrate full-time on his roles in the arts; his dual role helped the Opera House become a significant venue for the Festival. He continued in this position until 1994, and undertook two further refurbishments in 1991 and 1993, when the building, which was situated adjacent to the Europa Hotel - the \\"most bombed hotel in Europe\\" - was damaged by explosions. After his retirement in 1994, his health began to suffer, and he lived in a nursing home in Belfast until his death in 2008. In 1981, Barnes had convinced Michael Palin to perform his first solo show at the Belfast Festival; he returned every other year after. Belfast was the only place where Palin performed his one-man shows, saying that nowhere could be \\"better than the Belfast Festival\\". The two men became friends, and after Barnes' death, Palin set up a drama scholarship programme at Queen's University in his memory.

For example, Jill O'Neill, Director of Content for NISO (National Information Standards Organization) And, Keynote Conference (\\"The Joy of Search: Augmenting intelligence by teaching people how to Search\\"), in the International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)  Research  Russell's research focus has been human experience with search engines and in large, complex collections of information. He aims to design comprehensible and intuitive ways for users to engage with information effectively. Particular topics include the design of information experience; sensemaking; intelligent agents; knowledge-based assistance; information visualization; multimedia documents; advanced design and development environments; design rationale; planning; intelligent tutoring; hypermedia; and human–computer interfaces. While developing AI technology at Xerox PARC, Russell realized that sophisticated technology was useless if people did not intuitively know how to use it. This motivated him to shift his focus to the sciences of user experience. In 2011, Russell taught effective searching skills and enhancing learning efficacy. Russell also investigated new approaches to dealing with the growing amount of available information.  Authored publications and cited works  Russell's authored publications in topics including education innovation, human–computer interaction and visualization, information retrieval and the web, and mobile systems can be found on the Google AI website. His works are widely cited by other authors.  Personal life  Russell blogs on effective searching skills as well as his own investigations in sensemaking and information foraging. Russell started writing his blog, SearchResearch, in 2010. On October 23, 2013, Russell appeared on Lifehacker's \\"The How I Work series\\", interviewed by Tessa Miller. On it, Russell describes a day in his life, how he works and some personal topics On August 9, 2017, his blog arrived to the first 1,000 posts.  Awards  Russell was inducted into the CHI Academy (ACM) in 2016. He was added to the UC Irvine Information & Computer Science Department Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2013, Russell received the UC Irvine Bren School's 2013 Lauds & Laurels Distinguished Alumnus award.

The ranch was founded in 1912 by Buffalo Bill Cody, who ran a gold mine at the site. After Cody's death, the ranch was seized for unpaid taxes and subsequently sold to Lewis Claude Way. Way built the Pueblo style ranch house on the property, which he completed in 1928. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. High Jinks Ranch is surrounded by the Coronado National Forest and is a gateway to the Arizona Trail, an 800-mile (1,300 km) long trail that traverses the north-south length of Arizona. The ranch has vast views of the Galiuro Mountains and Bassett Peak (elev. 7,663 feet (2,336 m)). The closest town to the ranch is Oracle, a 20 minute drive away. Situated in the foothills of north slope of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Oracle is well- known for Biosphere 2, a large-scale experimental apparatus housing seven model ecosystems. Its mission was a two-year closure experiment with a crew of eight humans (\\"biospherians\\"). Long-term it was seen as a precursor to gain knowledge about the use of closed biospheres in space colonization. In addition to housing Biosphere 2, Oracle is remote enough to have received an International Dark Sky Park designation in 2014 from the International Dark- Sky Association. Oracle is far enough away from light pollution for numerous celestial bodies to become visible. The town has some of the darkest nights in the continental United States. The ranch is a one-hour drive from Tucson and Saguaro National Park, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, a 2.5-hour drive from Tombstone, and 3 hours from Bisbee. History =Settlement and construction= The Ranch's area was called Campo Bonito and mostly populated by mine (gold, silver, other ores) diggers. The property still contains deposits of black diorite.Robert E. Zucker, Treasures of the Santa Catalina Mountains: Unraveling the Legends and the History, BZB Publishing, 2014 () On April 14, 1912, Buffalo Bill Cody and his foster son Lewis Henry \\"Johnny\\" Baker established High Jinks as a gold mine and ranch; it is unknown which of the two came up with the name. Cody visited a cabin at the ranch until his death in 1917; however, the mine produced little gold, and Cody never saw a return on his investment. The High Jinks Gold Mining Company failed to pay property taxes on the mine for several years, resulting in its seizure by Pinal County in 1921; the county then sold the property to the State of Arizona. Accompanied by photos. Lewis Claude Way purchased the property from the state for $56.14 in March 1922. Way was a Spanish–American War veteran and a U.S. forest ranger who served as superintendent of both Rocky Mountain National Park and Grand Canyon National Park; he was also a friend of Cody and Baker. With the help of his wife, Marie Burgess Way, and Mexican laborers, Way built the two-story ranch house over the next few years, completing it circa 1928. The Ways moved into their new house upon its completion; Baker and his wife, Olive, lived with them until Baker's death in 1931, after which Olive only lived at the house part-time. Lewis died in 1944, and Marie sold the property the following year, after which it passed through several different owners. The first remodeing at High Jinks was done in 1964 by then-owner Lester Nauman, a gold prospector and electronics repairman. Nauman did work on two bathrooms and covered the original fir sheathing on the ceiling and walls of the family room and master bedroom with pine paneling. According to Harold Bell Wright in his book The Mine with the Iron Door (1923), Johnny Baker used stulls found in surrounding mines to build the Ranch's juniper wood carvings. =Protection and development= The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1996. For three decades and until 2007, the estate was owned by journalist E. Dean Prichard who preserved it and contributed to the launch of the Arizona Trail.Historic High Jinks Gold Mine Ranch, Emol.org E. Dean Prichard built the archway (porte-cochere) leading to the Ranch during the 1980s. He also added a carport, a tackroom/entry/storage building, stables, a ramada, and the four casitas, three of which are small, frame houses and the other a mobile home. Inside the house, E. Dean Prichard added stairs to the third floor. The house was abandoned up until 2010 when Dan Blanco and his wife, Laurel Wilson, purchased it and continued its renovation until Blanco's death in 2016.Ken Lamberton, Chasing Arizona: One Man’s Yearlong Obsession with the Grand Canyon State, University of Arizona Press, 19 February 2015 () Description =Features= La Casa del High Jinks is approximately 51 feet by 31 feet, 30 feet high. The foundation consists of granite and concrete walls. =Style= La Casa del High Jinks is an example of the Pueblo Revival style, a reinterpretation of traditional Pueblo architecture which was popular among white settlers in the Southwest in the early 20th century. The Pueblo Revival style, along with Mexican-inspired styles such as Spanish Colonial Revival, came to define regional architecture of the era. The two-story cube-shaped home was built with granite and wood, both of which were collected from the ranch site. The house features massive stone exterior walls with projecting wooden vigas, a characteristic element of the Pueblo style; other Pueblo elements of the house include its flat roof and wooden lintels. Later owners built several modern structures on the home site, including a carport, stables, pool, and four casitas. In popular culture La Casa del High Jinks was the filming location for the 1924 motion picture The Mine with the Iron Door. The film is based on the novel of the same name by American Author Harold Bell Wright published in 1923. The story of a lost mine with an iron door located deep within the Santa Catalina mountains has persisted for several hundred years. The mine has been one of the most extensively hunted lost mines in North America. The 1895 Bain 9-A buckboard (a four-wheeled wagon), which was used by Elizabeth Taylor and Tom Skerritt in the 1987 American made-for-television western romance film Poker Alice, is exhibited at the ranch. The movie is based on the real-life story of Alice Moffat (1851-1930), an English poker player in the American West. During E. Dean Prichard's time at High Jinks he wrote \\"A Metaphysical Autobiography: Revelations of a Galaxy Goddess\\" cataloging his heteronormative sexual encounter at the ranch with the alien goddess Tinr and her prophesies. Residents have recorded periodic sightings of two feral donkeys, Pancho and Crackers, who have made their home in the forest surrounding High Jinks Ranch since 2014.

The complex consists of three temples housing Shiva-lingas named: Shri Viswesara (made of black stone), Shri Bholanath (made of white marble), and Shri Chandreswar (made of black stone). The oldest of the temples, dedicated to Shri Chandreswar, was built in 1802 by Smt. Bhabanicharan Chandra. It was built in the rekh-deul style of Eastern India with a single spire and a square base, and decorated with terracotta reliefs from Hindu Puranic mythology including the Dashavataras, Dasha-mahavidyas and Ramlila. The middle temple and the third temple, dedicated to Shri Bholanath and Shri Viswesara, were built in 1836, by members of the local zamindari Chandra family, Shri Ramkanai Chandra and his wife, Annapurna Devi. The middle temple was built in the pancharatna style with five spires and decorated with terracotta interweaving Shaivite, Vaishnavite and Tantric motifs.

For over a decade she was married to Thomas James Wilkin, an Assistant Superintendent in the Criminal Investigation Department of the Palestine Police, who was assassinated by the Lehi on September 29, 1944.  Childhood  On the occasion of his Zionist activity, Shoshana's father Ber Borochov wandered among the capitals of Europe, and participated in the Seventh World Zionist Congress held in 1905 in Basel. Before leaving for the Congress, he married Lyuba, a member of a rabbinic family who studied languages at Moscow State University. At the end of the Congress, he continued his wanderings among various European capitals, avoiding being arrested in Russia. In 1909 Borochov arrived in Vienna and stayed there with his wife Lyuba until 1914. In 1912 Shoshana was born in Vienna. In 1914, by the outbreak of the First World War, Borochov moved with his wife and daughter to Italy, and from there they sailed to the United States, where they lived in New York. With the outbreak of the revolution in Russia in 1917, Borochov returned to Russia. After the October Revolution, in December 1917, Borochov died in Kiev from pneumonia, when he was thirty six years old.  In the land of Israel  Shoshana, with her mother Lyuba and her brother David, before 1930 In 1925, Lyuba with her two children, Shoshana aged thirteen and David, immigrated to Mandatory Palestine by the Fourth Aliyah and lived with them in an apartment in workers' dormitories on Dov Hoz street in Tel Aviv. For her livelihood, the mother worked first in the Zionist Executive and later in the Executive Committee of the Histadrut. Shoshana studied at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium and graduated in the summer of 1930. Shoshana wanted to aid her family and looked for a job. With the help of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who was the chairman of the Jewish National Council, Shoshana got an office job at HaMerkaz HaHakla'i. Her additional jobs were teaching English lessons for the children of neighbors, and writing articles of women's affairs in the newspaper \\"Davar\\". At that time, the poet Alexander Penn courted her, but she rejected his courtship after she had mastered his drinking habits and heard about his disloyalty to women.  Wilkin  = The person = Thomas James Wilkin was born in England in 1909. He joined the Palestine Police Force in Mandatory Palestine in 1930. At first he took a police course and then served for several months at the Bethlehem police station. For the next eight years he served in the Jaffa police. = Their familiarity – Ram Oren version = In his historical novel \\"Red Days\\", which was published in 2006, the writer Ram Oren described the story of the love of Wilkin and Shoshana. Ram Oren's version of the circumstances of the acquaintance was that Wilkin met Shoshana Borochov at the first time when, at the end of his first week of serving in Jaffa, he and his friends toured the streets of Tel Aviv. They entered the \\"Tarshish\\" cafe, and Shoshana sat by a table on which she wrote an article for \\"Davar\\". Shoshana drew Wilkin's attention and he went to get to know her, but she turned him away. Two years later he met her again in March 1933 at the Purim party which was made by Baruch Agadati and was held at Eden Cinema, but got cold shoulders from her. After the artistic program had ended, the orchestra started playing and the participants began dancing. Wilkin returned to Shoshana and invited her to dance with him. After a hesitation, she agreed. While talking, he found that her English was excellent, and asked her if she could teach him the Hebrew language for a fee. Shoshana replied that she would think about it and would inform him of her decision in a letter to his address. A few days later she sent him a letter, informing him of her agreement to teach him Hebrew and inviting him to her home. Thus began the relationship between them, which lasted eleven years until his assassination by Lehi on September 29, 1944. = An investigation officer = After a few months of studies by Shoshana, Wilkin reached a good level in Hebrew. He used to sit at cafes with Jews and collect a lot of information. Wilkin was considered as an outstanding officer in the British police and got three decorations for excellence. In 1938 Wilkin moved to serve in the British Intelligence headquarters in Tel Aviv. As an officer who mastered Hebrew, Wilkin was considered as a dangerous enemy, especially for the underground organizations, who valued his abilities and were afraid of him. Wilkin was involved in investigations with tortures of the Irgun and Lehi members, and in arresting the Irgun headquarters in 1939, and was the right hand of the Police officer Geoffrey J. Morton, who on February 12, 1942 shot and killed Lehi commander Avraham Stern (Yair) by a pistol. All the while his ties with Shoshana grew stronger. The connection between them was widely known, and Shoshana received verbal and written threats. Her brother David was almost lost his mind, because he had broadcast in the Haganah's wireless communications, and feared that Wilkin would turn him in. The director of the Agricultural Center demanded that she would cut off her ties with Wilkin, and when she refused, he fired her from her job. Her only source of income remained the English lessons which she gave to the neighbors' children. = The killing of Wilkin = In 1943 Wilkin moved to serve in the police headquarters in Jerusalem as the head of the Jewish department. He lived on the compound of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Shivtei Israel (Twelve Tribes of Israel) street in Jerusalem, and the couple failed to meet as often as before, but their love was put to the test and they decided to get married. Lehi continued to track Wilkin in Jerusalem in order to kill him in revenge for the murder of Yair Stern. On September 29, 1944 they assassinated Wilkin on the sidewalk in the heart of Jerusalem, near the Romanian Church,. His murder was told to Shoshana by a doctor and an officer who came in her home. Hearing the news, Shoshana fainted and the doctor gave her a tranquilizer. Mandate authorities made a funeral to Wilkin in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, which was attended by hundreds of police and government leaders, including Chief Secretary to the British High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan of the British Mandate, which was second to the High Commissioner, and Mandate Police Chief John Rymer-Jones. Among the people following his coffin was Shoshana. She watched the coffin with tears in her eyes. Arthur Frederick Giles, the Intelligence chief, approached her, expressed his sympathy and gave her a silver chain that was found among Wilkin things, and she wore it around her neck.  Life after Wilkin's death  After Wilkin's death, Shoshana, who was mourning, got an invitation from Giles to come his bureau for meeting him. At the meeting, Giles suggested Shoshana to go to England to meet Wilkin's parents. She acquiesced to the application and the commander organized her trip. She arrived at his parents' town of Aldeburgh, where she met the parents and sister of Wilkin, and told them about her relationship with him.

It is noted that he did not look to colonial artists or art history for artistic inspiration.Campbell, Nancy (November 2, 2012). \\"Inuit Artist Ohotaq Mikkigak Draws on Landscapes of Ice and Memory\\". Canadian Art. Accessed March 16, 2018. It has been observed that Inuit artists of Mikkigak’s period drew significant inspiration from the apprenticeship structure of Arctic co-ops (such as the Cape Dorset printmaking studio). While Mikkigak was a practicing artist, he worked with James Houston and others based out of the Cape Dorsert (Kinngait) printmaking studio's first location, a government-issued building known as the sanaguavik. Houston was known for encouraging Inuit artists to draw based on their isumanniivit (their own thoughts), which is likely to have influenced Mikkigak’s work.  Style  Mikkigak’s work covered a board spectrum of subjects and themes, and was often done in pencil crayon (a medium that was particularly prevalent among Inuit graphic artists). Mikkigak’s work also consistently emphasized the sky and weather patterns, often using an aerial view for the composition. It was common for artists, including Mikkigak, to use Inuktitut syllabics at the bottom of a piece in order to explain the scene in detail, as well as to use larger formats and manipulate scale in order to convey the Arctic landscape’s expansiveness. A theme in Mikkigak and other Inuit artists’ work is the use of landscapes to represent memories connected to the represented land, rather than purely the reality of the scene depicted. Mikkigak’s drawings did not seek to abstract the landscape, despite his later images taking on a more contemporary style and tone. Instead, he took inspiration from both imagined and real spaces in order to represent their expansive and all-encompassing nature, while focalizing Northern Canada as a fertile rather than barren landscape of colour and open space. He is noted for his autobiographical illustrations, and has said that he enjoyed making drawings filled with colour; especially landscapes, and scenes using animals (particularly birds) and people.  Personal life  Mikkigak was married to Qaunak Mikkigak (sometimes spelled Haunak or Qaunak), an Inuk throat singer and carver. They lived the traditional Inuit lifestyle together before settling in Cape Dorset.  Bibliography  * \\"Available Prints by Ohotaq Mikkigak.\\" Dorset Fine Arts.

Olson, Ph.D. (born 24 December 1944) is a professor and researcher, specializing in the fields of human-computer interaction and computer supported cooperative work. He has published over 120 research articles and book chapters, and is one of the authors of Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet (Morgan & Claypool, 2014).  Education  Olson received his B.A. in psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1967. He received his M.A. in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1970, both in psychology from Stanford University.  Career and research  Olson became an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Michigan in 1975, was promoted to associate professor in 1977, and professor in 1984. He first became interested in human-computer interaction in the early 1980s, and played a large part in developing the human-computer interaction program at the University of Michigan. He joined the School of Information as a professor and associate dean for research in 1995, and was named the Paul M. Fitts Collegiate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in 2001, which was his position until 2008, when he became the Donald Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. Olson has placed a focus on collaborative technologies and long-distance work throughout his career. In 2000, Olson and his wife Judith S. Olson published the notable and highly cited paper \\"Distance Matters\\", that reviews over a decade of research on collaborative technologies for remote work, details some of the challenges of long-distance collaborative work through the technologies found in these studies, and provides potential ways to maximize the chance of succeeding at remote work. Olson has also published several edited books, most notably Scientific collaboration on the Internet (MIT Press, 2008) which includes chapters from several experts in the field of internet collaboration, as well as several case studies of large-scale collaborative projects. In 2014, Olson and his wife Judith S. Olson published their coauthored book Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet (Morgan & Claypool, 2014), which is a review of their research on technology used for long distance collaboration. In 2015, Olson was a member of a team that published a research paper on a tool called DocuViz, which visualizes the revision history of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides documents. The team analyzed over 100 documents using the tool, finding patterns in collaborative writing and potential use cases for the tool. In several recent articles that Olson has had a part in writing, such as \\"How People Write Together Now: Beginning the Investigation with Advanced Undergraduates in a Project Course\\" in March 2017 and \\"Now that we can write simultaneously, how do we use that to our advantage?\\" in July 2017, Olson has continued to investigate and discuss collaborative word processors and the ways that they can potentially be used most effectively. Olson retired in December 2016, but is still active in research. He is currently an Emeritus Professor at both University of California, Irvine and the University of Michigan.  Achievements  In 2003, Olson was elected to the CHI Academy. In 2006, Olson, along with his wife Judith S. Olson, received the SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2007, he was elected to ACM Fellows for his contributions to computer-supported collaborative work. In 2009, he was named an APS Fellow for his work in the cognitive field. In 2010, he was named an APA Fellow. In 2016, he received the SIGCHI Lifetime Service Award.

She began exhibiting in 1981. Her works are based and focused on her travels and on nature, mainly working on painting, drawing and video installations and collaborating with other artists such as Barbara Held and Robert Waytt. \\"Painting, drawing and image in movement are the basis and the main instrumental from which arises the system where I start any proposal\\". She has participated in some exhibitions in Spain, France, Switzerland, the United States, Italy, Germany, Korea, China, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and Japan.  Style  Her trajectory and pictorial work begins with the architecture and the influences of the Neo-expressionism movement of the 80s, which serve her to represent the urban culture. She is interested in the city for its urban planning, the city seen from above, and that is why she often uses the labyrinth as a metaphor for defining the city. Her influences come, mainly, from the abstract expressionism of the American painting and from artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Judy Chicago, Meret Oppenheim, Nancy Spero and Eva Hesse. Her latest works, of a more poetic and political nature, are made to be the viewer who completes them.  Artistic and professional career  In 1976 Francesca Llopis enrolles at escola EINA where she meets Dani Freixes, América Sánchez, Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Maria Girona and Manel Esclusa, among others. Between 1979 and 1981 she shares an interior design studio with Josep Maria Civit and Ton Auquer and obtains an artistic residence grant at the Teater Studio in the Pałac Kultury in Warsaw. The inevitable and foreseeable coup d'etat transforms and creates a new pictorial imaginary to the artist, making her to question the lyrical abstraction of her first stage. From this inflection point, the \\"trip\\" will constitute a fundamental part of her process in the artistic work. Between 1983 and 1986, she begins her professional career: Història d'una temptació (History of a temptation) at MedaMOTHI in Montpellier, Barcelona trasbalsada (Barcelona overwhelmed) at Metronome and Els dits gèlids (The Frozen fingers) at Maeght gallery, in Barcelona, and Tráfico de efectos (Traffic of effects) at Montenegro gallery in Madrid. In 1988, she has an artist's residence at the Accademia di Roma and at the École des Beaux Arts of Nîmes, where Arnau Puig defines her painting as \\"semantic structuralism\\" in reference to her obsession with the built space and the meaning of words. In 2002 she presents her first video installation 2 habitacions amb vistes (2 rooms with views), a social portrait of Barcelona. In 2004 she develops ETC as a work in progress to discuss the absence of women artists in the history of art. In 2009, a new pictorial stage begins where inks and notebooks are assembled randomly, rising to different artistic artefacts, films and murals. In 2015, she participates in the Biennial of Noseden (Art line), in Japan, with Dealers of memory, which consists of two interventions: the video installation Apunts per un iceberg (Notes for an iceberg), in the Kurokawana school and the installation Llibre de llàgrimes (Book of tears) in the Myoken temple where she relates the intimate and the public, the original and the Universe. In 2016, in the SakaiArtePorto exhibition in Japan, she makes the installation Traction action from joining humanity to the Universe through an infinity made with pink pigmental footprints from the city's walkers. She makes a residence on performance at Art in Nature in Busan, Korea. In 2017, she presents the installation Llum! (Light!) with neon and glass at Montjuïc Castle in Barcelona, as a reflection of historical memory, the performance us & the state of things in Köln, Barcelona and other places, and Big Draw at Picasso Museum in Barcelona with Insecta'm and Enjardina't (Insect me and Garden yourself).

Height 23cm, width: 16.7cm, depth 9.8cm The Domhnach Airgid (English: Sliver Church) is an 8th-century Irish metalwork and wooden cumdach (book shrine), since 1847 in the National Museum of Ireland (Kildare Street site) in Dublin. It is traditionally associated with Saint Patrick, who was thought to have had it in his possession at one point. The shrine was built in three main phases; in the late 8th and 9th centuries, and in the 14th and 15th centuries.Moss (2014), p. 214 It is thus considered a mixture of the early Insular art and later International Gothic styles. A redesign c. 1350 added most of the extant frontpiece metalwork and relief plaques. Today the Domhnach Airgid comprises two separate main elements: an outer casket or box and an wooden box or container for relics; originally it held fragments of a 6th-9th century manuscript. The oblong box is heavily inscribed with lettering which along its outer borders, and is covered by silver and bronze panels which contain fragments of a vellum manuscript of the Gospels written in Latin.\\"The Study of Celtic Literature\\".

Retrieved 21 February 2020 Description Domhnach Airgid, detail Due to its age, the Domhnach Airgid is in poor condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, giving it its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues. The shrine was originally built in the 8th century, but little is visible from before a major reworking around 1350 by the abbot of Clones. What does remain from the original consists of tinned copper alloy plates positioned on two sides and on the top of the shrine, which are thought to have given it its name (Silver Church). These plates are decorated with cut in interlace designs, which have been dated to the late eight or early ninth centuries. A fully three- dimensional figure of Christ crucified is at the centre of the main face, with relief plaques of saints and the Virgin and Child, and other scenes on the sides which combine principal figures in relief and others in engraving.Wallace; O'Floinn (2002), pp. 261–262, 270 The style is rather more sophisticated than in some 14th century reworkings, with elegant running animals or grotesques placed on small mounts at the corners. A dove, representing the Holy Spirit and decorated with a crystal, hovers above Christ's head.O'Curry (1878), p. 323 Domhnach Airgid, detail There eleven smaller sized figures around Jesus, all ornately and delicately carved. They include a grouping of three apostles, probably James, Peter and Paul, the panel showing the Archangel Michael and the Virgin and Child, a panel with a grouping of Saint Colmcille, St. Brigid and Patrick, while with the saint at the lower right is thought to represent of Patrick presenting a cumdach to St. Macartan.\\"The Domhnach Airgid, an Early Irish Book Shrine\\". Irish Archaeology, 2015. Retrieved 1 April 2018 The casket was built to hold a number of relics, by legend associated with Patrick. In this tradition, the shrine was thought to have been in his possession and was sanctified by himO'Curry (1861), p. 12 before he gave it to St. Macartan. The shrine thus became a significant and prized object that was widely venerated.O'Toole (2013), p. 98 It consists of three covers, with the center one being made of wood, probably from yew. Another is made from copper, plated with silver. The outer cover, pictured above, is of the highest quality, and lined with silver and decorated by gilding.O'Curry (1878), p. 322 History The case was significantly remodeled around 1350 (a dating established by George Petrie) by the goldsmith John O’Bardan, during work commissioned by John O’Carbri, abbot of Clones. O’Bardan, whose signature appears on the object and is known to have lived in Drogheda, modernised the appearance of the shrine in the contemporary International Gothic style,Hourihane (2012), p. 510 and added the figures of Jesus and the saints. O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part by undermining and reforming Irish Christianity, while seeking to detach it from its Celtic basis. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity. In the 19th century, the shrine held the damaged folios of an eight or ninth century gospel (Dublin, RIA MS 214 24 Q23). The original contents may have been related to passages referred to in the 10th century \\"Tripartite Life of St Patrick\\", which mention gifts made to Patrick, including relics of the Apostles, portions of the True Cross, tufts of Mary's hair, or the Holy Sepulchre. Manuscript The manuscript is of the Cathach (literally \\"Battle Book\\") style, indicating an apocryphal use as a rallying cry or protector in battle. There are 39 surviving leaves, with text written in the Irish majuscule script. The manuscript leaves are very worn down, and some have become detached from their casing.

Staatsblibiothek Berlin Yf 8061 R. Ermenrichs Tod or Koninc Ermenrîkes Dôt (the death of king Ermenrich) is an anonymous Middle Low German heroic ballad from the middle of the sixteenth century. The ballad, which is printed in a highly garbled form, tells the story of how Ermenrich is killed by Dietrich von Bern and several other heroes. The poem shows numerous similarities to older stories about Ermenrich attested in early medieval and Old Norse sources. Summary According to the song, Dietrich wants to exile the King of the Franks, van Armentriken, because the latter wants to hang Dietrich. As one of his companions Dietrich receives the gigantic King Blödelinck, who is only twelve years old and is the son of a Frankish widow. Dietrich then sets off to Freysack who the enemy king lives, passing by a set of gallows. He and his companions disguise themselves as dancers and receive an audience with the king before revealing themselves and demanding to know why the king wants to hang Dietrich. When the king is silent, Dietrich cuts off his head and then the twelve proceed to kill everyone in the castle except for Reinholt von Meilan, who is spared due to his loyalty to the king. Blödelinck has disappeared in the fighting and Dietrich assumes he is dead, but the giant reappears. Printing The ballad was originally printed as a broadside titled Van Dirick van dem Berne (concerning Dietrich von Bern) in 1535/45 or 1560 together with another ballad Juncker Baltzer in Lübeck, and was printed again in a Low German songbook from 1590 or 1600. The broadside is heavily corrupted—possibly the work of a printer famous for his mistakes, Johannes Balhorn the Elder—and not always comprehensible. Victor Millet suggests that it was printed in honor of King Christian II of Denmark, who returned from exile in the Netherlands at this time. Elisabeth Lienert finds this interpretation questionable, however notes that Juncker Baltzer, the text printed alongside Ermenrichs Tod, is clearly about Christian. Metrical form The ballad is printed in the so-called \\"Hildebrandston,\\" a stanzaic metrical form named about another heroic ballad, the Jüngeres Hildebrandslied. No melody has been transmitted with the text, but it was likely meant to be sung. The stanza consists of four \\"Langzeilen,\\" lines consisting of three metrical feet, a caesura, and three additional metrical feet. Unlike the similar stanza used in the Nibelungenlied, in the \\"Hildebrandston\\" all four lines are of the same length. The lines rhyme in couplets, with occasional rhymes across lines at the caesura. An example is the first stanza of the poem as contained in the first printed edition: : a : a : b : b Relation to the oral tradition Although the text is very late and at times not clear, it nevertheless contains many references to events in the oral tradition about Ermenrich that are otherwise only found in allusions or Scandinavian sources. Lienert notes that it is possible that the ballad comes from a tradition in which Dietrich successfully returns from exile and avenges himself on his wicked uncle. Joachim Heinzle suspects that many of the mistakes come from the composer of the ballad only partially remembering the heroic tradition. Van Armentriken is clearly the legendary Ermenrich, with his name misunderstood as the name of his country. His misidentification as King of the Franks/France may be connected to a note by Johannes Agricola in which a king Ermentfrid (that is, Ermenrich) of the Franks supposedly conquered Lombardy and there killed his nephews known as the Harlungen. Blödelinck is Blödel, i.e. Bleda, Attila's brother, who also appears in the Nibelungenlied and the historical Dietrich poems. Freysack is probably Breisach, which was connected with the Harlungen from an early date. Lastly, Ermenrich's death is reminiscent of the Svanhild episode recorded in the Poetic Edda and other sources, as the sons of Jónakr also pass by a set of gallows on their way to confront Jörmunrekkr. Dietrich's involvement may be a variant of his return from exile – in a variant of the text, it is even said that Ermenrich wanted to drive Dietrich away, not the other way around. Despite the many apparent connections to the oral tradition, Millet believes that it is useless to use Ermenrichs Tod to reconstruct legends about Ermenrich.

The game was released on Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2016, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One got a late August, 2017 release. The Nintendo Switch port was originally slated for a Spring 2017 release, but got delayed and was re-announced for a May 14, 2019 release. Gameplay Redout is an anti-gravity racing game set in 2560 where players compete in the SRRL (Solar Redout Racing League) by piloting one of a selection of crafts on several different tracks. There are seven racing teams and every team has four ships. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, grip, structural integrity, energy pool and energy recharge speed. The players can customize their ship's characteristics installing upgrades and choosing a passive and active powerup of the six of each available. There are five racing complexes (and an additional seven have been added via DLC) each one consisting of five tracks. Track design includes loops, jumps, teleports, underwater sections, tubular sections and tracks with low or no gravity. The game features different racing modes of which the most unusual one is the boss mode, a race on a very long track obtained by linking via teleports the five tracks of a racing complex. Multiplayer is supported online via lobbies of up to twelve players and locally via two players split-screen. The ship controls are similar to that of aircraft, including strafing and pitching the vehicle; the latter is used when turning uphill to prevent the ship from grinding the floor (slowing and damaging the craft) and when turning downhill to prevent redouts (an aesthetic effect).

History The town of Messines, now known as Mesen, was the location of a number of battles during the First World War, beginning when it was captured by German forces in late October-early November 1914. Later in the war, it formed the southern corner of the Ypres Salient and in June 1917, the New Zealand Division drove the Germans out in the Battle of Messines, taking 3,700 casualties in the process. In March 1918, it was lost to the Germans in the Spring Offensive and returned to Allied control again in September 1918, when it was seized during the Hundred Days Offensive. Foundation Messines Ridge British Cemetery was established after the First World War for the remains of soldiers collected from several smaller cemeteries in the area. These included the Bell Farm Cemetery, Blauwepoortebeek Cemetery, Bousbecques East German Cemetery, Bristol Castle Military Cemetery, Lumm Farm Cemetery, Middle Farm Cemetery, Onraet Farm Cemetery, Queensland Cemetery and the River Douve Cemetery. Most of these cemeteries held men that were killed in the period from June to December 1917. One, the Bousbecques East German Cemetery, held four British soldiers that had died in November 1914 while the Bristol Castle Military Cemetery dated from September–October 1918. Cemetery The cemetery, designed by the English architect Charles Holden and located on the Mesen-Wulvergem Road, to the west of Mesen, holds the remains of 1,493 Allied soldiers, over half of whom are unknown. It was established on land that formerly belonged to the 'Institution Royale'. Within the cemetery are special memorials to several soldiers who are believed to be among the unknown remains buried at the cemetery; four British, ten Australian, thirteen New Zealanders and one South African. In addition, there are special memorials to thirteen British soldiers buried in other cemeteries in the area during the war but whose graves were destroyed by artillery fire. In total, 1,534 soldiers are buried or remembered at the cemetery. Bodies continue to be occasionally discovered in the area and are often interred at the cemetery; one was found while digging a pipeline and was formally interred on 25 February 2013. Although the identity of the soldier was not known, he was believed to be a New Zealander, as badges and paraphernalia from the New Zealand Rifle Brigade was found with his remains. This followed another interment of an unknown New Zealander the previous year. =Messines Ridge (New Zealand) Memorial= The entrance to the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing The cemetery also includes the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing, also designed by Holden, in memory of 840 soldiers of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force killed in the area and who have no known grave.

Biography =Early life and the Russian Revolution= Anatolie Popa was born into a poor peasant family in Cotiujenii Mari, in the Soroksky Uyezd of the Bessarabia Governorate. After primary education in his home village and Vadul-Rașcov, he enrolled in the Bălți municipal school. However, as his family was unable to cope with the high fees, he dropped out before graduating. Nevertheless, with the low literacy rate in Bessarabia, at 15 Popa was able to get a job as secretary of the rural police in his home village. This provided him with an occasion to become acquainted with the anti-Tsarist literature, mainly through the students returning home during the holidays. Proclamation of the Moldavian Democratic Republic in the official journal of Sfatul Țării With the start of World War I, Popa was drafted in the Imperial Russian Army and, after graduating the Odessa War College as an officer, he was sent to the Eastern Front. He was supportive of the overthrow of the Tsar during the February Revolution, and his political views were further influenced by the strong Bolshevik agitation in the 49th Technical Reserve Battalion in Odessa, where he was recovering from a battlefield injury. Popa was eventually put in command of a battalion of the 75th Sevastopol Infantry Regiment and in September 1917 was dispatched to Chișinău, the Bessarabian administrative centre. Popa soon joined the Moldavian national movement, which sought autonomy for Bessarabia, and was appointed a delegate to the Moldavian Central Military Executive Committee. The movement for autonomy, spearheaded by the Moldavian National Party (MNP), was regarded with suspicion not only by the ethnic minorities, but also by the leftist revolutionary committees and the Moldavian peasant majority, who feared autonomy was a step towards annexation to the neighbouring conservative Kingdom of Romania. The October Revolution, however, led to a mood change amongst the more moderate leftist groups, and in November 1917 the various revolutionary committees coagulated into a provisional provincial assembly, Sfatul Țării, which on proclaimed the autonomous Moldavian Democratic Republic within a Russian Democratic Federative Republic. The assembly, proclaiming itself the highest authority in Bessarabia, appointed a provisional executive, the Council of Directors; furthermore, it nominally pledged allegiance to the Provisional Government, placing itself in tacit opposition to the provincial and Chișinău city Soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies, which had recognised the Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) at the end of November. As the latter commanded the allegiance of most regular troops of the Russian Army in Bessarabia, increasingly Bolshevik in outlook, the Council of Directors sought to enlist the Moldavian militias in an effort to create an Armed Force loyal to Sfatul Țării. Anatolie Popa was among the officers chosen for this task and, on , he received the command of the \\"nationalised\\" Moldavian 478th detachment of Bălți. Popa was also appointed military commissioner for the Bălți county, growing close to the local Council of peasants' deputies. The state of emergency was soon declared in the Bălți county \\"in order to preserve public order\\", however Popa was reticent in using violence against the peasants. On , the Council's Military Director had to request the Commissioner for Moldavian Problems in Odessa to order Popa to comply with the directions issued by the local commissioner and commander of the garrison. =Romanian intervention and defence of Bălți= The authority of Sfatul Țării was not universally recognised across Bessarabia; instead, several local committees, some loyal to the Sovnarkom, exercised authority locally. The most serious contender was the Chișinău City Soviet, which, radicalised by the Ukrainian Rada's demobilisation order, had elected a mostly Bolshevik executive committee in mid-December. The Soviet and the Council still collaborated in managing the demobilisation, however they were unable to cope with the disruption caused by the large number of disorganised, badly fed soldiers leaving the front. Confronted with widespread peasant rioting and the unreliability of Moldavian troops, which were also siding with the Bolsheviks, a closed session of Sfatul Țării authorised the Council of Directors to look for military support outside the province: the leftist leaders, Ion Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan, held talks with the chief of the Odessa Military District, while the nationalist MNP sought assistance from the Romanian government in Iași. By , rumours of an imminent foreign military intervention had spread in Chișinău, prompting the Moldavian Military Central Executive Committee, the City Soviet and the provincial Peasants' Council to issue protests, affirming their commitment to the revolution and a federal Russia, and calling for redistributing land to peasants, purging the \\"reactionary\\" elements in Sfatul Țării and establishing relations with the Sovnarkom. In spite of reassurances coming from the leaders of Sfatul Țării that only \\"neutral\\" troops would be brought, the provincial and Chișinău City soviets took steps toward strengthening their positions. On they established a Revolutionary Headquarters, proclaimed the highest authority over all \\"Soviet\\" troops in Bessarabia, and soon they enlisted the support of the frontline department (Frontotdel) of the Rumcherod, which had arrived to Chișinău at the end of December. The Council of Directors also ultimately decided on to request military assistance from General Dmitry Shcherbachev, the nominal head of Russian troops on the Romanian front; the general, who had no effective authority over the troops, forwarded the request to the Romanians. Several leaders of the Nationalist Party would later testify this was the intended course of events, the Council fearing a direct call for Romanian troops would result in a popular revolt. The request precipitated a Bolshevik takeover, as, on , the Frontotdel proclaimed itself the supreme authority over all troops in Bessarabia and took control of the mail, telegraph and main railway stations in Bessarabia. The authority of Sfatul Țării, declared an \\"organ of the bourgeoisie\\", was virtually dissolved. In this context, the Romanian army moved in into Bessarabia in early January and occupied several towns and villages along the Prut, encountering only light resistance from local pro- Soviet troops. The first major encounter took place in Chișinău on , when Moldavian and Russian troops disarmed troops of the Transylvanian volunteer corps sent by the Romanian government to take the city. Later that day, Erhan and Inculeț, summoned at a joint meeting of the provincial and City soviets with the Moldavian Military Central Executive Committee, denied any role in the Romanian invasion, repudiated the MNP directors, and even agreed to send a protest note to the Romanian government, calling for a withdrawal of its troops. The mood among the Moldavian troops was also strongly anti-Romanian, and Erhan and the Military Director, Gherman Pântea, were forced to authorise resistance; however, as the main corps of the Romanian army approached Chișinău on , Pântea directed most Moldavian troops in the opposite direction in order to avert a battle. While the initial Romanian forays into the Bessarabian capital were repulsed with difficulties by the Russian and Moldavian troops, the Frontodel and the City Soviet, faced with a numerically superior opponent, ultimately decided to withdraw towards Bender, and the Romanians occupied Chișinău on . Manifest issued by the Bălți Revolutionary Headquarters calling for mobilisation against the Romanian invasion The news of the Romanian invasion quickly reached the rest of Bessarabia, and resistance was prepared, most notably in Bălți and Bender. On , on the initiative of the Bălți County commissioner Vasile Rudiev, the county's Council of Peasants' Deputies began organising a resistance to the Romanian advance. The Council declared a general mobilisation and established the Revolutionary Headquarters for the Defence of the Country, comprising Andrei Paladi, chairman of the county's Land Committee, G. Galagan, member of the Provincial Peasant's Council executive committee, Rudiev, and others. Already on the 22nd, the Revolutionary Headquarters was able to muster 3,000 workers and soldiers of the local garrison, who held a rally also attended by delegates from nearby villages. The mobilisation was not however supported by all the committees: the Bălți Municipal Council rejected it on January, refused to send delegates to the Revolutionary Headquarters and event requested its dissolution. Its delegates to the joint session of the Peasants' Council, the Municipal Council, the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet and the county zemstvo were even able to obtain a slight majority against armed resistance. According to his own account, the chairman of the local Soviet, the Menshevik Razumovskyi, also attempted to delay the mobilisation, arguing that a hastily armed crowd would not be able to resist a regular army; however, his attempts to persuade the session of the Peasants' Council were received with jeers. In spite of such opposition, Rudiev and Popa, who replaced the former in the Revolutionary Headquarters, handed out weapons to volunteers in the city and nearby villages and ensured that the two artillery pieces available to the garrison were properly manned. According to a witness interrogated by the Romanians after taking the city, the local Revolutionary Committee, led by sub-lieutenant Solovyov, requested Popa to hand in the weapons from the garrison, threatening him with death; another witness however indicated that Popa acted on its own accord, handing out weapons personally, in collaboration with other members of the Revolutionary Headquarters. Popa also took into custody several Romanian officers arrested in the countryside, and rejected Razumovskyi's plea for their release, stating he was acting in retaliation to the arrest of Moldavian officers in Ungheni. The Second Congress of the Bălți County Peasants' deputies, held on , voted to reject the authority of Sfatul Țării as unrepresentative, pledged allegiance to the Bolshevik Sovnarkom and called for the institution of Soviet power. Furthermore, the Congress rejected Bessarabia's separation from Soviet Russia and decided to send Paladi to Petrograd to request for military assistance against the Romanian intervention. The call for an end to the Romanian intervention was initially joined by the Third Bessarabian Peasants' Congress, assembled in Chișinău on and presided by Rudiev. However, as the latter city had already been occupied by Romanian troops, the radical leaders of the Congress were arrested and executed shortly after; a more complacent leadership was installed and renounced overt opposition to the Romanian military occupation. According to the pro-Romanian politician Dimitrie Bogos, Popa also attended the Provincial Congress in Chișinău on the , where he sided with the initial majority, and only afterwards returned to Bălți and began organising the resistance against the Romanian army. Popa also contacted Gherman Pântea, the acting Director for the military of the provisional Bessarabian executive, requesting information about the situation in Chișinău. According to the transcript of their exchange, Popa had managed to enlist an infantry battalion, two cavalry squadrons, a machine-gun company, a motor transport company, as well as an artillery battery. Noting that the population was outraged by the Romanian intervention and the Peasants' Council had switched allegiance to the Petrograd government, he requested more officers and money for the soldiers' pay, and offered to send ammunitions and even troops to Chișinău. In his reply, Pântea repeated the Romanian argument that their intervention was only meant to protect the supply depots and pacify the capital, and expressed his distrust of the Bolshevik government. However, he also noted the Moldavian troops' dissatisfaction with the Romanian presence and affirmed his commitment to a republican Bessarabia \\"alongside Russia\\". Furthermore, Pântea informed Popa about his intention to resign from the executive, as the latter was becoming increasingly pro-Romanian, as well as his decision to mobilise the Moldavian Army to defend the country in case \\"someone looks over the Prut\\", towards the Romanian government. Between , Moldavian and Russians troops, led by the Revolutionary Headquarters, defended Bălți against the Romanian offensive. The defenders of the city, comprising up to a thousand volunteers and the revolutionary troops in the garrison, were also joined by armed peasants from Cubolta, Hăsnășenii Mici and other nearby villages. The initial advance of the Romanian 1st Cavalry Division commanded by general Mihail Schina was temporarily repulsed with losses at Fălești, with the general himself briefly captured by a peasants self-defense group in Obreja on . The same day the Romanians attempted to enter the city, but, coming under machine gun and artillery fire, they retreated with heavy losses; another Romanian cavalry detachment was repulsed near the railway station. Superior both in number of troops and artillery, the Romanian troops were ultimately able to defeat the revolutionary detachments and capture the town in the afternoon of , with part of the defenders retreating toward the north. Soviet sources also indicate the counter-revolutionary forces acting inside Bălți as a factor in the defeat. The Romanian occupation forces immediately began a crackdown on the resistance, with 20 locals executed and more than one thousand arrested in the following two days. Anatolie Popa was also apprehended on the occasion and, on , was sentenced to death by a Court Martial for his role in organising and arming the local troops. The assessment of the battle was mixed: while the Soviet historiography praised the Defence of Bălți as a heroic deed, Bogos saw the battle as an \\"infamy\\" comparable to the events of January 6, when Moldavian troops in Chișinău disarmed the Transylvanian volunteer corps. As argued by historian Izeaslav Levit, the opponents of the Romanian intervention included people of different ethnic backgrounds and political options: while the chairman of the local Soviet, the Ukrainian lieutenant Soloviev, collaborated with the Revolutionary Headquarters chiefly in order to prevent its takeover by the Bolsheviks, the Moldavians Rudiev and Popa were primarily supporters of the Moldavian autonomy and of peasants' interest, pushed into collaboration with the Bolsheviks by what they saw as their betrayal by the right wing of the Sfatul Țării. =Russian Civil War and death= Owing to Popa's good standing with the Bessarabian population, the Romanian authorities sought to co-opt him in their administration; consequently, he was soon pardoned by King Ferdinand and offered a position in the Romanian Army. Anatol Popa however took the occasion and fled over the Dniester, to Ukraine, joining the Soviet partisan groups. Given a command position, he led a partisan detachment that crossed the Dniester back into Bessarabia during the Khotin Uprising in January 1919. After the Romanian Army violently suppressed the rebellion, he returned to Ukraine, where his group engaged troops loyal to the Directorate. By April 1919, Popa was appointed commander of the first infantry regiment of the 1st Bessarabian brigade, led by Filip Levenson. This Red Army unit included many participants in the Khotin Uprising, and was later redesignated as a Special Bessarabian Brigade and in June was integrated into the newly organised 45th Soviet Rifle Division. Under the command of Bessarabian Yona Yakir, the division fought in the Southern Campaign of the Russian Civil War; after the fall of Odessa, it took a 400 kilometre march across enemy lines, engaging along the way the forces of Yudenich, Denikin and Makhno. On February 13, 1920, Anatolie Popa was given the command of the 399th Regiment \\"Communist\\" of the 45th Division, which was sent to the Polish front, suffering heavy losses. Replenished to a full strength of 400, on March 23 the regiment was ordered to capture the settlement of Novo-Miropol'. The assault encountered strong resistance and Popa, heavily wounded, was captured by the Polish forces. He died under interrogation before the Soviets were able to take the town, three days later. Posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner, Popa was praised by Yakir in his 1929 memoirs as a \\"titan commander\\" who \\"possessed both great willpower and great endurance\\".

There is no record of her having captured any British vessels but she did raid Tobago in 1779. The Royal Navy captured her shortly thereafter and took her into service as HMS Tobago. she served in the Leeward Islands until the Navy sold her in 1783, probably at Jamaica. She was apparently wrecked on 16 August 1787 at Tobago. Privateer Governor Trumbull was commissioned on 18 November 1778 under Commander Henry Billings of Norwich, Connecticut, and fitted out at New London. She sailed from New London, Connecticut, at end-November. On 17 December the Connecticut privateer sloop American Revenue, Captain William Leeds, arrived at New London with sails, rigging, and stores from the British transport Marquis of Rockingham, which had wrecked on Gardiners Island on 13 December on a voyage from Newport, Rhode Island, to New York City. Of Rockinghams 22-man crew there were only five survivors. Governor Trumbull had assisted American Revenue in the salvage effort. Governor Trumbull came into Stonington, Connecticut, at about the same time. She sailed from Stonington Point on 25 December, bound for the West Indies, and by mid-January 1779 was off Tobago. Billings decided to raid the lightly-defended island. On 16 January 50 men from Governor Trumbull landed at Man-o-War Bay. They established a small emplacement that they armed with two carriage and some swivel guns, and then the bulk of the force moved inland. An attack on a sugar mill cost the Americans three casualties. On the other hand, the men in the emplacement repelled an attack by Lieutenant Clark and 17 British planters and militia, killing one planter and wounding another. Clark regrouped and a second attack forced the Americans to quit their emplacement and return to General Trumbull. The Americans had lost two men dead and some 26 prisoners. Billings then sailed north. On 5 March Governor Trumbull encountered two British warships, and towards the north end of St Bartholomew's. Venus set off in pursuit and after a chase of six hours, several shots from her chase guns and two broadsides, Governor Trumbull struck. The British took their prisoners of their prize and put a prize crew on board. Reportedly, Governor Trumbull had 103 men on board when the British captured her. Her captors took Governor Trumbull into St John's, Antigua. She arrived there on 7 March and was condemned. A British listing of prizes taken in the West Indies described Governor Trumbull as being of 20 guns and 150 men. It also put the place of capture as off St Christopher's. Royal Navy The Royal Navy took Governor Trumbull into service as HMS Tobago, and commissioned her under Commander Butchart. Commander Charles Hotchkys replaced Butchart in June. Around November 1780 Lieutenant Benjamin Archer assumed command; he was promoted to commander in January 1781. On 9 March 1782 Commander George Martin became captain of Tobago. Tobago was in company with and when they encountered the American frigate which was escorting south of Cape Canaveral on 10 March 1783. An inconclusive engagement developed between Sibyl and Alliance that proved to be the last battle of the American Revolutionary War. Alarm and Tobago neither participated in the engagement nor captured Duc de Lauzun. Commander Martin received a further promotion to post- captain soon after he left Tobago to take command of the 50-gun on 17 March 1783. Lieutenant Rowley Bulteel replaced Martin.

It is managed by Wye Valley NHS Trust. History The foundation stone for Hereford County Hospital was laid in 1937 by Queen Mary. It was built adjacent to the site of the Public Assistance Institute. A new hospital was procured in 1999 under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the old Hereford County Hospital, the Hereford General Hospital and the Victoria Eye Hospital. The new hospital, which was designed by WS Atkins and built by Alfred McAlpine at a cost of £62 million, opened in 2002. At the time concerns were expressed that the new hospital was too small to replace the facilities which were being lost. Consequently an additional ward, the Gilwern Assessment Unit, opened on the site in December 2015 providing an acute geriatric assessment unit. This was followed by a 24 bed medical assessment unit in November 2018. In 2020 construction began on a new three storey block to replace the ageing Nightingale style Canadian Huts built in the aftermath of the Second World War. The new facility will provide 72 new inpatient beds and allow the hutted wards to be demolished. Concurrent works to expand the intensive care bed base from six to eight beds were also commenced. In all the new works will expand the bed base to approximately 272 by 2021. Facilities The hospital has 236 beds.

Such bands do not fall into one sub genre of heavy metal but play music from across the metal spectrum but incorporate indigenous themes both musically and thematically. Some popular metal bands feature indigenous members, like the band Testament. While others represent an indigenous language, cultural and decolonial movements such as War Water and Gyibaaw. Indigenous metal first emerged as lyrical themes that were featured in popular metal bands from the 1980s, like the song Indians (song) by American Heavy Metal Anthrax (American band) written by current singer Joey Belladona who has native American ancestry. Other bands such as Testament (band) have dealt with themes of indigeneity with songs such as \\"Trail of Tears\\" from the album Low (Testament album) and \\"Native Blood\\" from the album Dark Roots of Earth. Their lead singer Chuck Billy is referenced to have Native American ancestry. Artist such as Anthrax, Testament and Iron Maiden had previously dealt with Indigenous themes, or use Indigenous peoples in their lyrics, it is argued that Sepultura were one of the first few metal bands to pioneer the style with their album Roots (Sepultura album) which musically features arranged ensemble percussion playing. The album's style, sound and aesthetic both inspired and highlighted Brazil's indigenous culture. Songs such as \\"Ratamahatta\\", \\"Itsári\\" and \\"Canyon Jam\\" feature contributions and collaboration with one of Brazil's indigenous peoples the Xavante. Many scholars view Roots as part of the global movement of metal music, and interest in local and regional cultures outside of traditional western music. True native metal (heavy metal featuring only Native American artist and use of traditional language and instruments) formed in the areas of Arizona,New Mexico and West Texas. While most of the bands of the early 2000s were Rock bands, Nedaz, Dezba and War Water formed the nucleus that would become Indigenous heavy metal. Raw violent aggressively themed heavy metal.

These artists add cultural music and imagery such as traditional instrumentation, indigenous traditional fashion and melodies. It is influenced by Viking metal bands' approach to cultural heritage. Percussion and traditional wind instruments are becoming a core compositional element in indigenous metal music. Cemican are a Mexican metal band from Jalisco, Guadalajara that incorporate Aztec flutes, wind instruments such as stone flutes, in their songs. In addition, that band's albums' titles, and stage names are in the indigenous language of Nahuatl. Traditional languages (Chickasaw, Navajo), singing styles, and instruments are often included . The band Alien Weaponry from New Zealand uses the Māori language in some of their songs and uses a singing style similar to that used in the haka. In addition to lyrics about indigenous issues, singing in Māori is seen as political and part of a continued revival of the language.O'regan, Sylvia Varnham. \\"Can a Thrash Metal Band Help Save the Maori Language?\\".

Most bands combine the exaltation of violence and decolonial politics through social and current political issues which is common in indigenous bands from North America. the interest lies on ancestral roots before European colonization and is expressed through indigeniety.

The band describes their first two albums as a “…radical political calls to action”.\\"Resistant Culture Interview\\". Blow the Scene. Retrieved 5 April 2018. Resistant culture also incorporates traditional elements like flute, drum, and gourd rattle. A particular community of bands exists on Native American reservations in the southwest that is sometimes referred to as Rez metal. The music is popular among reservation youth and may serve as an outlet for those disaffected by social ills of the reservation system. Nu Metal has found a foothold. Bands like O.T.R.

Some bands use the aggression of the genre to communicate a message of frustration.Turkewitz, Julie. \\"Looking to Uplift, With Navajo 'Rez Metal'\\". The New York Times. Retrieved 5 April 2018. Canadian indigenous metal band Gybiaaw uses metal as a dialogue about Indigenous life and resurgence of indigenous politics within their album Ancestral War Hymns, often singing in the language of S'malygax. As Heavy metal traditionally discusses anti- Christian themes and mythologies of the occult, Indigenous metal bands use specific mythology which informs their textual choices, album artwork imagery, and musical compositions. War Water's second CD (who you calling civilized) used violent native imagery of native American gods such as Redhorn. The band makes use of warpaint, native language on stage, tomahawk/knife throwing, and excessive theatrics. While bands such as Midnight Hag hold a representation not only for native heritage but also southern traditions as well. These elements are also seen in the Latin American metal scene. Mexican metal band Cemican incorporate pre-colonized latinx culture and Aztec mythology which is seen throughout their imagery. For visual representation, they appear onstage in face and body paint, feather and bone headresses, and armor that reflects Aztec tradition. Their album themes focus on Aztec culture and frequently combine ancient and modern instrumentation, traditional percussion, and group chants. Other Latinx bands such as Salvadoran bands Aborigene and Araña use Maya civilization and Pipil people as the main themes in their music, focusing on the resurgence of pre-Hispanic culture in El Salvador. Their album Teotl is the Nawat term for god, and their lyrics focus on Mayan and Pipil indigeniety.

She was named after Themis, Titaness of divine law and order. Design and Construction On March 10, 1911 it was reported that a new company \\"The Wabana Steamship Company\\" (Wabanas Dampskibskompani) with a capital of NOK 1,500,000 was registered in Nøtterøy with the purpose of transporting ore between Newfoundland and Europe. The new company was a subsidiary of the Nova Scotia Steel Company and was managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. Two ships were leased to conduct the operations (SS Tellus and SS Themis) by the newly formed company for a period of 10 years. The ship was laid down in 1910 at William Doxford & Sons shipyard in Pallion. The vessel was launched on 30 March 1911 (yard number 419),, the sea trials were held on 25 April 1911 (April 28 according to Norwegian source) with the ship being able to reach speed of . After completion of her sea trials, the ship was delivered to her owner on the same day. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . Themis was assessed at 7,402 GRT, and 12,925 DWT which made her the largest ship in Scandinavia at the time, slightly larger than her sister ship Tellus. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 412 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history On March 21, 1910 Themis was chartered to Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Company for a period of 9 consecutive navigation seasons (April through December) for a fee of £2,031.5 per calendar month starting in 1911. On March 24, 1910 Themis was also chartered to Gans Steamship Company for nine consecutive winter seasons for a fee £1,562.10 per calendar month, starting in 1911 as well. After completion Themis proceeded directly to North America and arrived at Wabana on May 11, 1911. During her maiden trip in May 1911 the ship brought 12,500 tons of ore from Wabana to Philadelphia. Themis continued operating on Wabana- Philadelphia route for the remainder of 1911. For example, in August 1911 she managed to make three trips from Wabana, bringing a total of 37,560 tons of iron ore to Port Richmond. After the close of navigation Themis was chartered by The Spanish-American Iron Company, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania Steel Company, to transport iron ore from Felton in Cuba to Philadelphia and Baltimore throughout December 1911 and early spring of 1912. The ship departed for her first trip on November 26, 1911 and finished her charter on April 24, 1912. During this service the ship brought in over 100,000 tons of ore in 10 trips. For example, on December 19, 1911 the ship unloaded 11,000 tons of ore at Sparrow's Point in record time. In a similar fashion the ship brought and unloaded 10,900 tons of Cuban ore at Sparrow's Point on April 12, 1912. On April 25, 1912 the ship sailed for Wabana to resume her summertime ore carrying to Philadelphia which continued until the end of navigation season in early November. On November 7, 1912 Themis departed Philadelphia for Tampa arriving there on November 13. There she loaded 3,073 tons of phosphates for transportation to Antwerp before continuing to New Orleans. After loading cargo, the vessel left New Orleans on November 26, but ran aground next day damaging her forpeak. Nevertheless, Themis pressed on with her journey and arrived in Antwerp on December 20 with a leaking forpeak and some damage about her deck caused by storms she encountered during her trip. The ship left Antwerp on January 5, 1913 to Savannah via Cardiff arriving there on February 7. 16,000 bales of cotton were loaded onto the ship in Savannah and she sailed out on February 14 for Bremen. After unloading, the ship then proceeded back to Wabana via Newcastle to resume ore transportation to Philadelphia until October 1913. On October 10, 1913 Themis left Wabana for Rotterdam and continued serving this route for the remainder of 1913. On January 10, 1914 Themis departed New York City for Marseille, arriving there on January 30. After her return to the US, the ship loaded 1,652 tons of phosphate pebble at Tampa on March 10 and 5,500 tons more at Boca Grande on March 14, then proceeding to Galveston and Savannah, where 13,450 bales of cotton were loaded on March 24. Themis departed from Pensacola to Bremen on March 25, and arrived in Germany on April 16. After unloading at Bremen, the vessel sailed on to Wabana and resumed her ore shipments to Rotterdam through mid-August 1914. After arrival in Wabana on August 27, the vessel loaded ore and proceeded to Philadelphia arriving there on September 3, and from there continuing to Norfolk in ballast. After the start of World War I Themis could no longer be involved in her transatlantic ore trade, as the main consumer of her cargo was Germany. She became a tramp ship and was chartered for any cargo that she could carry. She was chartered to carry coal and departed Norfolk on September 10 to Piraeus, arriving there on October 1. The ship then was chartered for one more trip, leaving New York on December 26, 1914 and arriving in Copenhagen on January 18, 1915. On March 31, 1915 Themis together with several other Wilhelm Wilhelmsen's ships was sub-chartered by Nova Scotia Steel & Coal Company to Barber Line for a period of 8 months for a fee of £7,680 per calendar month. The vessel was handed over to Barber Line on April 28, 1915, and departed shortly thereafter for South America, visiting ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, returning to Boston on August 12, 1915. On September 12, 1915 Themis departed New York for Wellington, Sydney, Melbourne and other Australian ports carrying 11,000 tons of cargo, the majority of which was case oil (including 24,000 cases for New Zealand) consigned for the Vacuum Oil Company. The ship reached the Panama Canal on September 21, by which time the slides occurred on the canal and delayed her until October 4, at which point the Canal was closed indefinitely. Themis was ordered to proceed to Australia via the Cape route, arriving at Durban on November 8. After re-coaling, the ship continued on to her destination reaching Wellington on December 13. Themis then proceeded to Australia and visited several ports until her departure on February 23, 1916 from Newcastle for South America. The vessel arrived at Montevideo on April 3, continued on to Buenos Aires two days later where she loaded among other things 8,341 bags of dried blood for New York. The ship arrived in New York on May 5, 1916 and after unloading was immediately chartered for cargo delivery to China. About 10,500 tons of cargo was loaded onto the vessel, including 200,000 cases of oil and 500 bales of cotton. The ship left New York on June 21, passed through the Panama Canal on July 2, arriving at Hankow on August 25, 1916. From there the ship continued on to Shanghai, and then to Philippines where she loaded 11,250 tons of sugar for delivery to New York. On November 21, 1916 Themis on a passage from Iloilo for New York City grounded on the outer end of the West Breakwater in Limon Bay right after leaving the Panama Canal for sea. The ship laid with her bow aground until the afternoon of November 25 while the divers patched the holes in her hull and bulkheads. She was then pulled off and towed stern first into port of Cristóbal to discharge the remaining cargo, before being put into drydock at Balboa for repairs on December 10. About 2,000 tons of sugar were lost in the accident. The repair work was finalized on December 22 and the vessel proceeded through the Canal on December 24 to reload her cargo. Themis finally departed the Canal area on January 1, 1917 after reloading was completed. On February 14, 1917 Themis left Baltimore with a load of acid phosphate bound for Rotterdam. From there the ship sailed to India where she loaded wheat cargo for transportation to Marseilles. =Sinking= Themis sailed from Karachi early in the morning on September 7, 1917 carrying 11,000 tons of wheat, 260 tons of St John's bread and some other general cargo for Marseilles via the Suez Canal. The ship was under command of Captain Erling Jacobsen and had a crew of 36 men. Approximately at 01:00 of October 11, 1917, the vessel departed Malta escorted out of harbor by 4 British patrol boats. At around 07:30 on October 12, 1917 in an approximate position , about north off Cape Bon the ship was suddenly hit by a torpedo on her starboard side, around the No.3 hold. The ship started listing on her starboard side almost immediately and Captain Jacobsen ordered the crew to stop the engines and abandon ship. The lifeboats were lowered, and the crew left the ship in an orderly fashion. Shortly, two British escort vessels appeared, HMT Portsmouth among them, and started assisting the crew. All 37 men boarded Portsmouth who took them to Bizerta where they arrived around 22:30 on the same day. The crew later was transferred to French warship Saint Louis where they were provided with temporary accommodations. Themis sank stern first around 12:15 in an approximate position . It was later discovered that the torpedo was launched by German submarine .

He was of mixed African and European ancestry. He was particularly involved in colonial issues, always seeking administration based on justice and humanity. He was one of founding members of the Human Rights League in France. Early years (1845–85) Pierre Alexandre Ildefonse Isaac was born in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, on 9 January 1845. He came from an influential mulâtre family of Pointe-à-Pitre. The Isaacs were educated and wealthy, and were among a small number of people of mixed race who had managed to join the political and economic elite of the island. Socially, Guadeloupe was still mostly segregated. Alexandre Isaac studied law and became an advocate. He was appointed a sub-inspector of registration, and was Director of the Interior of Guadeloupe from 1879 and 1884. Members of the African community in Guadeloupe had mostly been transported to the island as indentured servants in the 1860s and 1870s. In the 1880s they still lacked basic rights and civil liberties. When they petitioned for citizenship in 1884 Isaac, as Director of the Interior, was strongly in favour of granting their request. He said, \\"these foreigners ... have blended into the local population whose habits they have adopted, and today they continue with their hardworking tendencies, they are a population quite worthy of [our] concern.\\" The island's general council passed a motion in favour of their naturalization by a large majority. Senator: first term (1885–94) On 1 March 1885 Isaac was unanimously elected Senator of Guadeloupe. His brother, Auguste Isaac(fr), became a deputy of Guadeloupe in 1893. According to the black socialist politician Hégésippe Légitimus the Isaac brothers had betrayed the people of the island for the sake of their political ambitions. They had sold out to the white elites and catered to every whim of the sugar producers. From 1885 Isaac was an advocate at the Paris bar. In the Senate he sat with the left, voted with the majority and participated in debates on topics such as primary education, sugar, the insane, the proposals by Anselme Batbie(fr) concerning nationality, relationships between France and the Dominican Republic, organization of Indochina, colonial reform and the naval budget. He voted for establishment of the district ballot, for the Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and for the Senate process against General Boulanger. He was a member of the committees on war, the navy and customs, and was also a member of special committees to study legal and colonial texts. He was elected Secretary of the Senate in 1892, 1893 and 1894. Isaac called for the West Indian colonies to be assimilated legally and administratively as French departments. In 1885 he presented to the senate the case for Guadloupe's African community to be given citizenship. Isaac was a key speaker at the Congrès Colonial International de Paris of 1889. The explorer Gustave Le Bon argued that attempts to educate the \\"inferior races\\" of the colonies would only cause them misery. Isaac opposed this view, reminded the audience of the ideals of the French Revolution and said he could not understand how education could be held to be a bad thing. Alexandre Isaac senate portrait In 1890 Isaac was deeply involved in the discussion of the bill to extend the 1888 bill concerning the Algerian indigenous people. He was a member of a senate committee led by Jules Ferry to overhaul the Algerian organization in 1891, and was one of seven committee members who visited Algeria. In 1893 he submitted a proposed law to change the system of representation of Algerian natives. In this proposal Isaac downplayed the issue of polygamy, and stated, \\"it would not be impossible, after setting aside religious prescriptions, strictly maintained in the field of personal status, to release, as has been done in other respects, local legislation which would, in relation to the metropolitan legislation, only show differences of detail justified by the diversity of needs.\\" He noted that Algerian indigenous people were already subject to most aspects of French law, and the settlers also benefited from legal exemptions. Senator: second term (1894–99) Isaac was reelected on 4 February 1894 by 194 out of 286 votes. In his election manifesto he clearly distanced himself from the revolutionary socialists. He continued to sit with the radical left. He was interested in all legal issues, but his main activity was in colonial issues, particularly those of Guadeloupe, the West Indies in general, and Algeria, and always in favour of humane and just administration. He was involved in discussions on colonial administration in general, the boundaries between the French Congo and German Kamerun, formation of a colonial army, judicial organization of the colonies, creation of a Ministry of the Colonies, Annam and Tonkin, annexation of the islands to the leeward of Tahiti and a colonial health service. Isaac visited Senegal in 1894 when François Devès was accused of libel, and Isaac and Hyacinthe Devès also visited French Sudan. Isaac observed that local slavery was still in practice being condoned by the authorities. He wrote to Senegal Governor Henri-Félix de Lamothe(fr) about his concerns over arbitrariness, the protectorate system and the judicial system. The governor was sure that Isaac was behind the attacks that two French newspapers made on his administration. Isaac was involved in review of various reports on Algeria issued between 1892 and 1896, and submitted his own report on French and Muslim justice, police and security on 28 February 1895. He issued a report on 15 March 1898 in which he asked the Algerian committee to end the system of attachment that Albert Grévy had started in 1881, and that had been expanded by Louis Tirman between then and 1891. Isaac was one of the first members of the Central Committee of Ligue Des Droits De L'Homme, formed in 1898. He was one of the moderate republicans in the early League, others being the first president, Senator Ludovic Trarieux, and Yves Guyot. At an early meeting he pointed out that although the Dreyfus affair was absorbing, there were many other examples of injustice that demanded action, such as the plight of the Algerian Jews. Alexandre Isaac died in office on 5 August 1899 in Vanves, Seine, at the age of 54.

It one of the Scènes de la vie privée in La Comédie humaine. Plot summary The main character, Desplein is a successful surgeon and an atheist. His former assistant and friend is Doctor Horace Bianchon. One day Bianchon sees Desplein going into the Saint-Sulpice church, and follows him. He sees Desplein alone attending a mass. After Desplein departs, Bianchon questions the priest and finds that Desplein attends a mass at the church four times a year which he himself pays for. A few years later, Bianchon again sees Desplein going into Saint-Sulpice for the regular mass. This time he questions Desplein about it. Desplein explains that the mass is in memory of a friend of his, a water carrier named Bourgeat. When Desplein was a poor medical student, Bourgeat was his neighbour in the same building. The landlord evicted both of them on the same day. They agreed to look for a new place together. They eventually found two cheap rooms in the attic of another building. From then on, Bourgeat became a father figure to Desplein. He helped to pay for Desplein's education, and did menial tasks like cutting the wood. After Desplein became successful, he bought Bourgeat a horse and cart for his water carrying work. After Bourgeat's death, and knowing that Bourgeat was a devout Catholic, Desplein decided to have four masses a year for Bourgeat at Saint-Sulpice church. Recurring characters Bianchon appears in several novels and stories of La Comédie humaine, including Le Père Goriot. He is the narrator of Étude de femme and La Grande Bretèche.Raphael, Sylvia. \\"Introduction\\". Honoré de Balzac: Selected Short Stories. Penguin Classics, 1977. Themes Sylvia Raphael wrote \\"..the unselfish devotion of the humble water-carrier is matched only by the profound gratitude and deep religious feeling (in the broadest sense of those words) of the irascible, often selfish, eminent atheistic surgeon. Balzac's awareness of the complexity of human beings, of the coexistence within them of conflicting traits, comes out clearly in the story of Desplein who, self-centered and ambitious, forms a bond with the water-carrier which survives even the latter's death.\\" References External links *\\"The Atheist's Mass\\", translation (by Clara Bell) at Project Gutenberg (full text) Category:1836 short stories Category:French short stories Category:Books of La Comédie humaine Category:Short stories by Honoré de Balzac ","title":"La Messe de l'athée"},{"id":"57005677","text":"Sergio Eduardo Stuparich Clementi (born December 14, 1943) was a Chilean author and philosopher descending from Italian immigrants from the Adriatic island of Lussin, Croatia.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, many proposals for a massive jetport spanning much of Burlington County failed to materialize due to increasing environmental concerns. In 1978, the federal government designated the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, further protecting Penn, Wharton, and Byrne state forests as well as all the surrounding Pine Barrens from future development efforts. History The area was occupied by a branch of the Lenape tribe of Native Americans when the first European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. The Lenape left behind evidence of their passing in the form of shell middens from the shellfish they had consumed. A small village named Penn Place, consisting of just five buildings by the mid-1860s, was constructed by the settlers along the upper Oswego River. The village was named for a Penn family member who had, according to legend, previously resided in the area at some time in the 18th century; however, the first man named Penn to settle there was James Penn, who was the son of a sea captain named William Penn (a different man than the founder of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania). James Penn's descendants may have remained in the area until about 1890. Edwin Pue and his wife acquired the land and sold it to the state in 1910—the state's fifth acquisition for its park system. Foundations of fire lookout tower on the summit of Bear Swamp Hill In 1912, the state ran a telephone line across what was initially called Penn Reserve. A wooden fire lookout tower was constructed on Bear Swamp Hill (elevation ) in 1915. After the wooden tower burnt down, a modern fire lookout tower was built in 1960. That tower was destroyed when a plane crashed through it in 1971. An Air National Guard pilot named William F. Dimas, flying from McGuire Air Force Base, crashed during practice bombing runs in a supersonic F-105 Thunderchief over the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, which is adjacent to the state forest. The crash killed the pilot and destroyed about 1000 trees along a path about wide and long. The first Civilian Conservation Corps enlistees arrived in 1933 and worked on road construction. The CCC workers at Penn State Forest consisted solely of African Americans since construction crews were segregated during that era. The CCC camp area is located to the northeast of Oswego Lake. In the spring of 1941, prior to the US entry to World War II, a five-day military exercise involving 16,000 army troops from Fort Dix participated in a mock invasion that occurred near the coastal areas of the state. Penn State Forest served as the temporary division headquarters during the exercise. In the late 1950s, a large airport was proposed by Burlington County officials to be constructed in the Pine Barrens, mainly to serve New York and Philadelphia. The airport would have spanned from Penn State Forest to Vincentown, a distance of about , including parts of the Wharton and Brendan T. Byrne (formerly, Lebanon) state forests. The plan included filling in Oswego Lake to make it a runway as just one small part of a supersonic jetport with four times the combined capacity of Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK airports. Eventually, environmental concerns about the project led to the federal protection of the Pine Barrens as a National Reserve in 1978, after airport proposals that had lasted for two decades. Road through the Pine Barren Plains, east of Spring Hill The Pine Barren Plains The park preserves an area known as the Pine Barren Plains—also called the Pine Plains or the Pygmy Forest—a globally rare stunted forest ecosystem that reaches a mature canopy height of only about . New Jersey contains the world's largest acreage of this type of dwarf forest, including areas both within and outside the Penn State Forest. The trees are mainly pitch pine and blackjack oak in the northeastern portion of Penn State Forest. Researchers have speculated that the trees evolved to their short statures due to a combination of droughts, nutrient deficiencies, relatively higher-speed winds due to higher elevations than their surroundings, and more than twice as many wildfires as other areas within the Pine Barrens. Partially submerged trees near the eastern edge of Oswego Lake Oswego Lake Oswego Lake, a artificial lake created in 1942 by a dam on the Oswego River, provides opportunities for swimming, boating, and fishing. The lake functions as a reservoir for cranberry farms located downstream along the Oswego River. The upper stretches of the generally slow- flowing Oswego River, along the Papoose Branch at the east end of the lake, can be explored by canoe and kayak. Canoeists and kayakers can also head south out of the park along the Oswego River to Harrisville Lake by portaging around the dam.\\"Park map\\" (archive). state.nj.us.

She appears in a variety of roles, from the most faithful and noble lady to a wicked seductress, often in relation with or substituting for the character of Morgan le Fay. Some tales feature her as a wife of either King Charlemagne or Prince Lancelot, and even as an ancestor of King Arthur. Origins The Cumaean Sibyl by Domenichino (17th century) The character of Sebile has her earliest roots in the Ancient Greek figure of the virgin priestess and prophetess known as the Cumaean Sibyl. This Classic motif was later transmuted into a Christianized character named Sibyl in the Christian mythology of the Early Middle Ages. The further transformation during the Late Middle Ages eventually turned her (as summed up by Alfred Foulet) from \\"the sibyl of antiquity, a god-possessed human prophetess, into the fay of mediaeval, particularly Arthurian romance, a queen and enchantress, only rarely virginal and prophetic, usually a lustful magician who entices heroes to her otherworld lair for prodigiously prolonged sessions of love-making. In the late mediaeval legend Sybil/Sybilla/Sebille comes to resemble Morgan le Fay so closely as to be conflated with her in those places in which she is not Morgan's rival or companion.\\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/2855956 Matter of France Queen Sebile first appears in text in the Matter of France's Chanson des Saisnes (Song of the Saxons, written c. 1200) as the young and beautiful second wife (a daughter in later versions) of the Saxon king named Guiteclin or Geteclin (representing the historical Widukind), who fights against the Franks. Queen Sebile falls in love with the Frankish king Charlemagne's nephew and Roland's brother, Baudoin, for whom she betrays her husband. After Guiteclin is killed, she marries Baudoin, who thus becomes the King of Saxony. Later versions from various countries present her instead as a daughter of either King Desiderius of Lombardy in Macaire ou la Reine Sebile, the Emperor of Constantinople in La Chanson de la Reine Sibile and Willem Vorsterman's Historie vander coninghinnen Sibilla, or the pagan king Agolant in La Reine Sebile. This Sebile marries not Baudoin, but Charlemagne himself. In the early 13th-century French epic poem Huon de Bordeaux, Sebile is a cousin of the story's eponymous hero, the Frankish knight Huon of Bordeaux. She uses her magical abilities to aid Huon in slaying her captor: a monstrous, 17-foot-tall giant named Pride (l'Orgueilleux), whom Huon defeats and beheads after a terrible duel. In La Chanson d'Esclarmonde, one of the continuations of Huon, Sebile is one of the three fay mentioned by name when summoned by the fairy queen Morgue (Morgan), Lady of the Hidden Isle (Avalon), to welcome Huon and Esclarmonde, his lover and daughter of the Emir of Babylon. Matter of Britain Sebile makes her first known appearance in an Arthurian legend in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's late 12th-century German poem Lanzelet, in which the loving fairy mistress of Prince Lancelot is named Iblis (or Yblis), an anagram for Sibil/Sybil. There, she is the only daughter of Iweret of the Beautiful Forest (Beforet), an enemy of the family of Lancelot's foster mother, the sea fairy Queen of the Maidenland. Iblis is the most virtuous woman, as proven by a magic cloak test (an arguably central motif of the entire tale), who falls in love with Lancelot in a prophetic dream before even meeting him. After Lancelot slays her father in combat (she faints when he fights and instantly forgives him after his victory) and he learns his name and real identity, Princess Iblis marries him as the new king of this realm. Lancelot later leaves to defeat hundred knights and marry the Queen of Pluris (marrying for the fourth time), but eventually escapes from her and returns to the faithful Iblis and their kingdom. Ruling their combined lands together, they have four children, and later they both die on the same day. \\"I will serve none of you, for ye be all false spell-workers.\\" William Henry Margetson's illustration for Legends of King Arthur and His Knights abridged from Le Morte d'Arthur (1914) In the early 13th-century French Lancelot-Grail prose cycle, Queen Sebile (Sedile le roine) or Sebile the enchantress (Sebile l'enchanteresse) becomes a villainous character. She takes part in the kidnapping of Lancelot by her, Morgan le Fay (Morgue la fee), and the Queen of Sorestan. This story was made well known through Thomas Malory's retelling in his popular Le Morte d'Arthur, where the three queens became four: Queen Morgan of Gorre (Rheged), and the unnamed trio of the Queen of Norgales (North Galys, meaning North Wales), the Queen of Eastland, the Queen and of the Outer Isles (identified by Malory as the Hebrides). The queens of Eastland and Sorestan appear identical in both versions, so Sebile seems to be the Queen either of North Galys or the Outer Isles in Malory's tale. They all are described as the most powerful female mages in the world after the Lady of the Lake. Sebile, the youngest of them, is noted as so expert at sorcery that she had managed to render Cerberus harmless during her visit to Hell. In a well-known episode from Lancelot- Grail, found largely unchanged in Malory's compilation, the queens are riding together when they find the young Lancelot asleep by an apple tree (apples being a symbol of enchantment in the legends). Amazed by how fairylike handsome Lancelot is, they argue over who among them would be the most deserving of his love for reasons other than their equal social rank and magical powers (at least in the French original version, as Malory turns Morgan into a clearly dominant leader of the group). Each of them states different reasons to be chosen, with Sebile emphasizing her merry character, youth and beauty. The Queens consider waking up Lancelot to ask him to choose among them, but Morgan advises that they take him still asleep to their castle, where they can hold him in their power. The next day, the Queens appear before the awoken Lancelot in their finest clothes and ask him to choose one of them as a lover; if he refuses, he will never leave his prison. Despite this threat, Lancelot, faithful to his secret beloved, Queen Guinevere, categorically and with contempt refuses all three. Humiliated by his response, the angry queens throw Lancelot into a dungeon, but he is soon freed by the daughter of the King of Norgales' enemy (either King Bagdemagus of Gorre or the Duke of Rochedon) who asks him to fight for her father in an upcoming tournament. In the Venician Les Prophéties de Merlin (written c. 1276), Sebile is part of a quartet of enchantresses: besides Sebile and Morgan (Morgain), here being her only lover among all the women, they include also the Queen of Norgales and the Lady of Avalon (Dame d'Avalon). They all are former students of Merlin, who had received dark magic powers through his demonic origin, and are also in good relations with the extremely villainous knight Brehus without Mercy (Brehus sans Pitié). Sebile remains a powerful sorceress, whose special skills include invisibility, but is clearly inferior to the Lady; this is evidenced in the episode where Sebile and the Queen of the Norgales together attack the Lady's castle with their magic (in Sebile's case, trying to set it on fire) without any real effect, while the Lady retaliates by effortlessly taking their clothes off and making the naked Sebile visible for all. Morgan too is greater in her magic and seems to be in a master-to-disciple relationship with the younger Sebile, but they are equal in their lust. The two are usually inseparable companions, but this is tested when they become rivals to seduce the widowed knight known as Berengier of Gomeret or Bielengier the Handsome (Bielengiers li Biaus), who first spends a night with Sebile but then leaves to marry one of Morgan's ladies, the virgin Lily Flower (Flour de Lis), who had kidnapped his child for Morgan. This results in a quarrel that goes from an exchange of worst insults to a physical brawl that leaves Morgan battered half to death by the younger Sebile; the Queen of Norgales then saves the remorseful and terrified Sebile from Morgan's revenge by reminding Morgan how they both stole Lancelot's brother Ector de Maris from her but she had forgiven them, and Morgan and Sebile soon fully reconcile. There are also other knights that Sebile is known to desire, especially Lamorak. In the French text known as the Livre d'Artus (Book of Arthur, written c. 1280), Sebile (Sebille) is a beautiful pagan queen of the Fairy Realm (la Terre Fae) Sarmenie, who has just lost her husband. Queen Sebile has an affair with Arthur's knight Sagramore (Sagremor), who is at first her prisoner until he seduces her. Sagramore converts Sebile to Christianity when she hastily baptizes herself after he refuses to sleep with a heathen. An evil knight known as the Faery Black Knight (Le Noir Chevalier Faé, Cheualiers Faez) or Baruc the Black (Baruc li Noirs) is revealed as the one who had killed her previous husband in order to marry her himself. The villain is then defeated in great battle and captured after a personal duel against Sagramore with Sebile's help. After that, Sebile marries Sagramore, who stays with her for 15 days before leaving to resume his quest. In the anonymous French prose romance Perceforest, a massive prequel to the Arthurian legend written c. 1330, the most beautiful, wise and honorable enchantress Sebile is known variably as Sebile of the Lake (Sebile du Lac) or the Lady of the Lake, Sebile of the Red Castle (Dame du Lac, Sebile du Chastel Vermei). In this tale, King Arthur is the descendant from the union of Sebile and Alexander the Great. Alexander is at first a young knight before becoming King Alexander of England and then battling to conquer the world. Sebile falls in love with Alexander on sight; she incites him into her mist-concealed Castle of the Lake (later the Red Castle) by magic and keeps him there through seduction. Their mutual love then grows, especially after Sebile nurses him back to health from a grave wound and Alexander lifts a siege of her castle by defeating her enemies. In one episode, travelling Sebile is attacked by four evil knights who want to rape her, but the Scottish knight Tor of Pedrac arrives at the last moment and slays the villains (their severed heads are then preserved with a spell and given to him as a memorial of this deed). After Alexander dies, Sebile marries Vestige of Joy, also known as the Knight of the Black Eagle, and gives him a daughter named Alexandre, also known as the Maiden of the Two Dragons. Other characters include her cousin Gloriane, the lady of Castle Darnant. Italian folklore and other classic literature Another Sebile later appears at the end of the 14th century in the French Le Roman d'Eledus et Serene as a maidservant of the heroine Serene, \\"versed in the science of love\\". Serene and Sebile are considered doublets. The peak of Monte Sibilla In central Italy, Sebile features in a local version of the Venusberg motif from Germanic mythology. In The Paradise of Queen Sebile (Le Paradis de la Reine Sebile, Il paradise della regina Sibilla), Antoine de la Sale records a folk legend that he heard from locals at the aptly-named mountain Monte Sibilla in 1420: Sebile/Sibilla is depicted as a demonic fay sorceress who lives with an entourage of amorous nymphs in magnificent palaces and lush gardens within a subterranean, paradise-like enchanted realm (inspired by Morgan's Avalon). She welcomes guests to her kingdom of carnal pleasure (voluttà), but, if, entangled in the delights, they spend more than a year there, the guests are trapped forever in sinful bliss, waiting for the Last Judgment with the fairies. In de la Sale's La Salade (written c. 1440), a German knight and his squire enter Queen Sebile's kingdom out of curiosity and revel for a year in its forbidden pleasures. Before it is too late for him, the knight realizes the sinfulness of this by witnessing how the fair ladies transform each week into adders and scorpions for a night, so he escapes and hurries to Rome to confess to the Pope just in time. The squire, who regrets having left the pleasures of the fairy realm, flees him and returns to the Sebile's earthly paradise; the Pope sends out messengers with the news of his absolution, but they arrive too late. Sibilla is gifted with her famed prophetic powers, but tells only bad news, never good. In a similar story included within Andrea da Barberino's prose chivalric romance Il Guerrin Meschino (the part written c. 1391), a pious knight, advised to seek out the fay Sebile (fée Sébile) in her abode in the mountain near Norcia, goes through a cave to her realm; he stays there for a year, but refuses all temptation and only attempts to learn about his parentage, without success. He boldly resists the flattering advances of the fay and her damsels, whose sinister nature he suspects, but later too receives an absolution after confessing to the Pope in any case. Sebile is also a recurring character in Italian works of the 16th century, such as in Gian Giorgio Trissino's L'Italia liberata dai Goti (1547). The names and characters of Sebile (Sibilla), Morgan le Fay (Fata Morgana) and the fairy queen Alcina are often interchangeable in Italian tales of fairies; for example, Morgan substitutes for Sebile in P.A. Caracciolo's 15th-century Magico. Pietro Aretino's 16th-century Ragionamenti mentions a certain \\"sister of Sibilla of Norcia and aunt of Morgan the Fairy (Fata Morgana)\\". Modern fiction *The wicked Queens of the Wasteland and of North Galis appear with Morgan in Clemence Housman's The Life of Sir Aglovale de Galis (1905) to ensure that Arthur will die after his last battle and will not be saved by Nimue's enchantment. *Lady Sybil appears in the stage musical Camelot, played by Sue Casey in the 1967 film adaptation. *John Steinbeck's The Acts of King Arthur and His Noble Knights retells the Lancelot and The Four Queens scene from Malory in much greater detail. *The scene of Lancelot's abduction also features in the 1988 adventure video game Lancelot. It describes the Queen of Northgales: \\"She was tall, blonde and statuesque. Her imperious eyes have often, it was said, brought knights groveling on their knees.\\" *In Bernard Cornwell's The Warlord Chronicles novel series, Sebile is Morgan's beautiful blond-haired Saxon slave and companion, who had lost her mind when she was gang-raped by Briton raiders after her capture until she was partially healed by Morgan. She ends up murdered during King Gundleus' sacking of Avalon in 1995's The Winter King. *J. Robert King's 2003 novel Lancelot du Lethe includes the chapter \\"The Four Queens\\", retelling Malory's version of Lancelot's abduction from both Lancelot's and Morgan's perspectives. The four witch queens show up again in King's later Le Morte D'Avalon, where it is revealed that they use their magic to rule their respective kingdoms through their king husbands as puppets. *In the 2011 television series Camelot, Sybil is played by Sinéad Cusack. She is a mysterious older nun from the monastery where Morgan studied, who had thought Morgan magic and then became Morgan's adviser. She eventually takes blame for Morgan's treason and is beheaded by Gawain. The series ends with Morgan praying at Sybil's grave and hearing her voice telling her what to do next. *In Kate SeRine's 2012 novel Red, the villain Sebille Fenwick is a sidhe enchantress who has survived to the modern times. *In J.M.

Gilmore (November 12, 1914 – March 18, 2010) was an American archaeologist and specialist on Spanish colonial archaeology. She was the first archaeologist to prove the location of Fort St. Louis, established by the French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. She received the J. C. Harrington Award of Society for Historical Archaeology in 1995, the first woman ever honored by the society. Early life Kathleen Kirk was born on November 12, 1917, in Altus, Jackson County, Oklahoma to Jesse (née Horton) and Rufus Patrick Kirk. She was the middle child of three and had an older sister and younger brother. Raised in Altus until she was twelve, the family moved to Tulsa, where she completed her secondary education. Beginning her studies in geology at the University of Tulsa (TU), after three years, she transferred to the University of Oklahoma (OU), where she obtained a bachelor of science degree. Hoping to work in the growing petroleum industry, she was unable to find employment in the male-dominated field during the Great Depression and enrolled in business school to learn secretarial skills. Career Kirk had worked throughout her schooling at the Bone and Joint Center in Tulsa and the TU Library, after graduation she looked for a position as a geologist and found few opportunities for women. Taking a job as an editorial assistant at the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in Tulsa, she worked for a year, before she found a steady job. In the late 1930s, Kirk moved to Houston and took a job working as a stenographer for Humble Oil. Her employers appreciated her knowledge of geological terms, but hired her as administrative staff. Disliking the stenography pool, Kirk left to work as a typist with Superior Oil Company in Corpus Christi and eventually returned to Houston to work with Standard Oil of Kansas, where she remained until 1940, when she married petroleum engineer, Robert Beattie Gilmore, on Christmas Day. Soon after their marriage, the couple moved to Dallas, where Robert took a position with DeGolyer and MacNaughton, of which he would later become president. Gilmore remained at home and raised their four daughters, Betsy, Judy, Pat and Sally and then in the early 1960s, she became involved with the Dallas Archaeological Society, participating in field schools, hosted around Dallas. One of the first digs she participated in was at the Gilbert site in Rains County, Texas in 1962. The following year, Gilmore enrolled in a new graduate-level program for anthropology offered by Southern Methodist University (SMU), studying under the tutelage of Ed Jelks and Fred Wendorf. Her first published paper, issued in 1967, dealt with the excavations she had conducted at Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas and at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá. At the time of her studies, there was an ongoing academic debate in the archaeological field as to whether the discipline encompassed only pre- historic sites or whether both historic and ancient sites were within the field. She attended a conference in 1967, in St. Louis of the Central States Archaeological Society, where the issue was debated, noting the ongoing reconstructions of Colonial Williamsburg. The group decided to form the Society for Historical Archaeology later that same year. As Gilmore was interested in history, she developed a method in which she used historic archival materials to inform her planning for field work, but was careful to note that flaws in records, inherent systemic biases and human error could alter the reliability of material. Gilmore began searching for the complex of the San Xavier Mission in Milam County, Texas in 1968, which included the missions of Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, San Ildefonso, and San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, as well as the presidio of San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo. Successfully locating all three mission communities, using a Spanish survey from the time of the construction of the missions, and identifying the presidio site, the field work she conducted there became the basis of her master's thesis, The San Xavier Mission: A Study in Historical Site Identification. After completing her master's degree in 1968, Gilmore contracted to work at several sites, focusing on Caddoan excavations around Lake Palestine and Rosario Mission for the Parks Department. Completing her PhD in 1973, with a thesis, Caddoan Interaction in the Neches Valley, Texas she was approached by Curtis Tunnell, state archaeologist of Texas to analyze materials collected from a ranch on the Garcitas Creek to determine whether it might be the location of Fort St. Louis, which had been established by the French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1685. Analyzing artifacts and pottery sherds, she published The Keeran Site: The Probable Site of La Salle's Fort St. Louis in Texas later that same year. In 1986, she sent the pottery samples to Canada because extensive work had been done there on French ceramics of the period. Gerard Gussat analyzed the fragment and confirmed that it had been made in Saintonge and was French. Combined with the other materials she had evaluated, including Spanish artifacts, Gilmore revised her initial paper and confirmed that the site was definitively the location of Fort St. Louis. Her groundbreaking work solved the question of where the fort had been located and was the first proof of the actual site of the structure. In 1974, Gilmore began teaching at the University of North Texas (UNT), as an adjunct professor and her appointment included a research appointment to continue her investigations. Over the next several years, Gilmore worked on numerous cultural resources management (CRM) projects for the state, including digs at Granger Reservoir, Lake Ray Roberts, Lakeview Lake, North Fork Reservoir, and a survey of sites along the Oklahoma/Texas border, known as the Red River Archaeology Project, which she directed. She also led the excavations in 1978 to survey Old Salem, North Carolina's Single Brothers Industrial Complex Site for consideration for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and a 1981 preliminary test at English Turn, Louisiana to identify the location of a French and later an American site of Fort St. Leon. She was elected as president of the Society for Historical Archaeology, the first woman to hold the post. She also served from 1982 to 1983 as the president of the Texas Archaeological Society. In 1990, Gilmore left UNT and began doing consulting work. In 1993, she consulted on a project to locate the site of the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, which she had reported on in 1967. The mission was located in Menard, Texas. In 1995, when La Salle's ship La Belle was located, close to the location Gilmore had predicted, she worked on the excavation, which also discovered eight Spanish cannon at the site. She was the recipient of the J. C. Harrington Award from Society for Historical Archaeology in 1995, becoming the first women honored with the award. Between 1999 and 2002, she worked in conjunction with the Texas Historical Commission on a re-examination of the Keeran site, which not only reaffirmed the accuracy of her location of Ft. Saint Louis and discovered the Spanish presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto en la Bahía, which had been constructed atop the French fort. In the mid-2000s, Gilmore returned to a project researching Felipe de Rábago y Terán, which she had developed an interest in when she was working on her masters thesis. The conquistador, who was the commander of the San Xavier and San Sabá presidios in central Texas, was suspected of involvement in a murder. Gilmore was determined to uncover his history and name his victim, Juana Francesca de Rodriguez, whose identity had been obscured from published accounts. Traveling to Spain, Italy and Mexico with an interpreter, and working with a palaeographer Gilmore pieced together the archival records and began compiling them into a book. During this period, she established the Texas Presidios Project, in part to locate the various sites where Rábago had command. In 2003 Gilmore became the inaugural recipient of the Curtis D. Tunnell Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognizes excellence in Texas archeology and in 2008, was honored by Governor Rick Perry and the Texas History Commission with receipt of the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation. At the time of her death, she was working on the final edits for publishing her book on Rábago, even editing in the hospital emergency room. Death and legacy Gilmore died on March 18, 2010 at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, in Dallas County, Texas, from a heart attack. She is remembered as one of the first architects to study Spanish missions in Texas, one of the pioneer women in the field, and an expert on colonial archaeology.

Products commercialized under the Reynolds name include ballpoint, gel, rollerball, and fountain pens, and mechanical pencils.  History  In June 1945, Chicago businessman Milton Reynolds was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, when he came across the first commercialized ballpoint, the Biro pen. In October 1945, Milton was able to reverse engineer the Biro pen and was the first to manufacture and sell ballpoint pens into the US market. \\"Reynolds Rocket\\" pen was introduced at Gimbel’s department store in New York City, selling $100,000 worth of pens on the first day. Demand in 1945 was running 30,000 pens per day, making it America's #1 ballpoint pen. However, within three years the price of the pen went from $12.50 to 50¢. The Reynolds Rocket Pen had a tiny ball bearing that let ink out only when pressed against the item you were writing on. In advertisements Reynolds claimed it had enough ink to 15 years without refilling. In 1947, in a publicity stunt to promote Reynolds' pens Milton Reynolds and William Odom announced they would beat Howard Hughes's around the world record. They set a new record time of under 79 hours by flying the \\"Reynolds Bombshell\\" around the world while managing to pass out thousands of pens. In 1948, Reynolds expanded overseas and opened Reynolds European, and later in 1959 spun out Reynolds European SA as an independent company focused on non-ferrous metals. The Chicago-based Reynolds Pen Company closed with Milton Reynolds moving to Mexico. The French subsidiary survived as did their Indian licensee. Later, the French subsidiary would be purchased. In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Reynolds Pens France and in 2007, announced they would be closing the French manufacturing plants, causing huge labor union protests. In May 2016, Reynold's license—GM Pens International—in India decided to end their exclusive contract and stopped making Reynold branded pens, instead choosing to make their own Rorito brand pen. Now Reynolds' license is Flair Pens, they market and distribute Reynold's pens in India. Reynolds has a state-of-the-art R&D; facility in Chennai - Irungattukottai SIPCOT is considered one of the most sophisticated in the writing instrument industry worldwide. Reynold Pens, along with Paper Mate and Parker, are brands owned by US based Newell Brands and are sold in more than 70 countries. Reynolds has been a household name for years among those who use pens and particularly students. Reynolds is a popular brand and the most trusted brand in India. The most favorite pens among Indians are the Reynolds 045 and the Reynolds Trimax.

It was initially estimated to cost just $50,000 to build, although this figure soon ballooned to over $600,000 once recommendations from the project's architect and consultants were factored in; ultimately, the total cost rose to nearly $1 million. The tower was planned to be complemented by a new church building and community center, although St. Mary's ultimately ended funding for the project. From the beginning, it was conceived as both a historical and a tourist attraction. The tower was originally intended to house a museum to 17th- and 18th-century missionaries as well as be connected to the planned new church building, effectively functioning as its steeple. Initially called the Tower of Missionaries, it was renamed the Tower of History to broaden its appeal to visitors. The tower was initially projected to cover its costs by visitors paying $1 or $2 to experience the view from the observation platforms, but according to parishioner and building committee member Paul Ripley, the unforeseen oil crisis precluded the tourism growth that they expected. In 1971, due to the financial problems that St. Mary's was enduring, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette assumed responsibility for the tower. In 1972, its operation was reorganized and it became directed by a state-wide board of directors. Also at that time, the tower employed 10 college students as workers. By 1975, it was attracting over 40,000 visitors a year. In 1979, an advisory board to the Diocese of Marquette's administrative board recommended either closing the tower or donating it to a civic organization. In 1980, the diocese donated it to Le Sault De Sainte Marie Historical Sites, Inc. (Sault Historic Sites). The Tower of History includes museum exhibits about Catholic missionaries, local history, and Native American history. The museum exhibits and a video presentation are located on the tower's Lower Level, while three separate viewing platforms (both open-air and glassed-in) and additional exhibit space are located on the Upper Level. The tower features an express elevator that ascends to the viewing platforms in 45 seconds. The Tower of History is open to the public between mid-May and mid-October.

Hemp beer is not brewed from hemp directly, but hemp products such as seeds are a later flavoring addition. American breweries producing hemp beer include the Humboldt Brewing Company and Limestone Brewing Company. Canadian microbrewery Cool Beer Brewing Company produces Millennium Buzz Hemp Beer.  Beermaking  Hemp beer is unique in that its namesake derives from the addition of hemp to flavor beer. Breweries follow a basic guide of water, hops, barley or malt, and yeast in their own brews, which is based on then current German beer purity laws. Due to their close relationship as plants, the addition of hemp to hops based beers will maintain a complementing, but not identical flavor. Most, but not all hemp beers are hopped and then at some point in the process, hemped. Typically, a brew is hemped after the boiling process and then allowed to sit for several weeks to allow the yeast to ferment and the hemp to become infused. = Hemp as an additive = In the United States, hemp is defined under the 2018 United States farm bill as not having more than 0.3 percent THC. The low 0.3 percent dosage of THC is not enough to be psychoactive, whereas any cannabis plant with a greater dosage would be considered schedule 1 and potent. Breweries in the United States are currently experimenting with adding hemp to their own brews. Generally, the beer is brewed and then a body or piece of hemp is added in the final stages to give the brew an infused tastes and aroma. Due to the robustness and usability of the plant, several parts of hemp can be used as an additive during the brewing process in order to bring hemp flavor and aroma. *192x192pxHemp flower: generally the most complete form of hemp as an additive * Hemp leaf: hemp leaves only * Hemp extract: the hemp-derived extract known as CBD or cannabidiol is mixed into the finished beer or brew * Hemp seed oil: similar to extract, essential hemp oil is added to the finished beer or post brew * Hemp hearts: the meat of the seed, minus the shell *Hemp fibers: beer is passed through a filter made of hemp strands = United States breweries = Since marijuana is illegal federally, not every brewery is able to manufacture and distribute their own hemp beer. New Belgium brewery from Colorado was one of the first breweries to experiment with different forms of hemp, before producing a legal beverage. Larger beer producers such as Blue Moon, Constellation Brands, and Molson Coors, are preparing to release their own brews in response to New Belgium's positive reception. Lagunitas Brewing based in California have released a hemp and THC-infused beverage, that is only legal in its home state. As manufactures begin to experiment with the potential market, hemp will likely remain at the forefront followed by more CBD-infused beverages. Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, Georgia have already found success in a hemp infused and cannabis tasting beer without any psychedelic properties. More craft breweries and larger producers are more likely to develop their own products as the market becomes more demanding and legislation more relaxed. = Legal restrictions = Federally, the United States still classifies cannabis as a controlled substance. Although some states have legalized the use of marijuana and hemp for business, personal, and recreational use, the federal restrictions creates a legal grey area. However, with the ratification of the 2018 Farm Bill, breweries and businesses are able to import, grown, and use hemp throughout their manufacturing process. The bill \\"puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law\\". Beers created using hemp or parts of it, have gone on to receive FDA approval. Brewers are unable to claim that their hemp infused products have any health effects without first being approved by the FDA. The administration is particular in what it approves, and beer that may have a pain relieving or psychedelic affect falls beyond the 0.3 percent limit of legal hemp. Beer producers may also choose to advertise their beer as being hemp infused, without any side effects in order to sidestep FDA approval. = Flavors and aromas = The flavor profile of hemp can vary, but the aroma is generally that of the cannabis variety. Depending on the brewer, what part of hemp used, preexisting or other added flavors, and how long the additives are allowed to infuse are variables that can impact the end result. Hemp beers have been described as having an \\"herbal flavor,\\" \\"caramel\\" tastes, and a\\"stickily sweet and lightly bitter finish.\\" https://www.arkinstitute.com/bulk-cbd-hemp-flower/ References Category:Cannabis foods Category:Types of beer ","title":"Hemp beer"},{"id":"57006210","text":"Hellspawn may refer to: * Hellspawn (Spawn), a fictional race in the Spawn comic book series * Hellspawn (comics), a comic book in the Spawn series * Hellspawn Records, a Swedish independent record label ","title":"Hellspawn"},{"id":"57006225","text":"Daphne Mary Blundell, (19 August 1916 – 24 May 2004) was a senior British naval officer, who served as Director of the Women's Royal Naval Service from 1970 to 1973.

It stars May Allison, Wallace MacDonald, and John Elliott, and was released on November 8, 1920. Plot May Allison from the film Theodora Hayden, who gave herself the nickname of Teddy as an adolescent, is a wealthy socialite, with an appetite for airplanes and fast cars. She is engaged to her childhood sweetheart, attorney Gerry Rhinelander West. Spoiled, she is used to following her desires, without a thought to the consequences. When Gerry takes her to a café in Greenwich Village, she decides she loves the freedom of the Bohemian lifestyle the Village affords. Spurning West, she rents a place in the Village, and begins to paint incredibly horrendous pictures. She has her sports car parked in front of her building. In her encounters, she meets Ruby Joyce, another free spirit, and Ruby's boyfriend, Gunboat Dorgan, a boxer. In their interaction, Dorgan mistakes Teddy's flirting with true attraction. Teddy is then introduced to another artist, Raoul Uhlan, who tries to seduce her. When she rebuffs him, he turns aggressive. She is only saved by the entrance of Dorgan, who physically assaults the artist, throwing him out. Feeling that she now owes him something, Dorgan takes her in his arms and kisses her. She pushes him away, after which he storms out and takes her sports car for a joy ride. On his ride, Dorgan strikes another vehicle, causing extensive damage. Teddy receives notice of three lawsuits against her. Ruby is suing her for alienation of affection, due to Dorgan feeling there is something between Teddy and him. The owner of the car which Dorgan plowed into is suing her for damages to the vehicle. Finally, Uhlan is suing her for the assault on him by Dorgan. Teddy confidently turns to her family, expecting their financial backing to get her out of her triple dilemma. However, her family spurns her. Distraught, she doesn't know what she will do, until Gerry re-enters her life. He promises to fix everything if she will simply agree to whatever he wants as his fee. She does, after which he makes everything right, as well as once again winning her affection.

On June 19 the following members of the cast were revealed: May Allison, Wallace MacDonald, Ruth Stonehouse, Winifred Greenwood, John Elliott, Emanuel Turner. The film had wrapped filming and was being edited by the end of August. On November 20, it was revealed that Lester Cuneo had joined the cast. The picture was released on November 8, 1920. Reception Exhibitors Herald gave the film a generally positive review, enjoying Allison's performance, comparing her to Billie Burke, and also singling out the acting work of Ruth Stonehouse, William Green, and Lester Cuneo in supporting roles. They approved of the titles, lighting and cinematography. Overall they felt the film was pleasant, but slow-moving. Wid's Daily (one of the early titles to The Film Daily) gave the film a lukewarm review. They felt the direction and cinematography were good, while the lighting was simply adequate, they highlighted the Greenwich Village feel of the interior shots, as well as some of the exterior locations. They felt that Allison's portrayal was satisfactory, while the supporting cast was adequate. The main detractions were the overall length of the film, based on the slimness of the story, and felt the titles contained extraneous conversation.

It aired in the United States on Fox on April 1, 2018. Plot Principal Skinner tells Groundskeeper Willie that he plans to retire, with Martin discovering the secret and blabbing it to the entire school. During the final sendoff, Skinner chooses Bart Simpson for his final farewell, who attempted to shoot him in the head with a rock. However, it was revealed that the retirement was just a ruse so Skinner would finally blow the whistle on Bart after years of being pranked by him. Feeling embarrassed and angry, Bart chooses to pull off the ultimate prank to the entire staff by super-gluing the faces of Skinner and staff with plastic Krusty the Clown masks. Unfortunately, this causes people around Springfield to become terrified of clowns, and also causes Krusty to lose his comedic edge. Because of this, Krusty is no longer a comedic character and even loses his clown appearance and make-up. Homer Simpson then says that Krusty looks just like him. Lisa then convinces Krusty to turn into a serious actor, and he takes part in a parody play version of Death of a Salesman, called The Salesman's Bad Day, written by Llewellyn Sinclair (his second appearance from \\"A Streetcar Named Marge\\") who at first couldn't do, until Sinclair motivates him, causing Krusty to become a serious actor until his clown self appears in his mind, telling him that he is still a clown and nothing else. Meanwhile, Bart is in court and was about to be free with the \\"boys will be boys\\" saying, until Marge Simpson objects and tells Judge Dowd that what Bart did was terrible and he has a real problem with pranking and suggests that Judge Dowd punishes Bart, resulting in him going to a rehab center for almost a month. Although Marge thinks she did a good thing, she doesn't know if it really was a good thing herself. During a session as Bart places tacks on the doctor's chair, the doctor convinces Marge to come in and sit on his chair, causing Bart to stop the prank and completing one step of his treatment. After being released, Bart goes to apologize to the people whom he pranked. However, with the encouragement of Willie, Bart plans to pull the ultimate prank, staging a fake apology announcement at the gymnasium where above the crowd is a net full of water balloons. But when he sees Marge in the crowd, he tries to tell people to run away but the weight of the water balloons breaks the net, causing the crowd to get splashed with the water, with Marge finally realizing that \\"boys will be boys\\" saying is real and that motherhood \\"sucks\\", followed by Homer saying the same saying and Marge walking into the boys restroom to get even with him. On the night of the play, Krusty is still being haunted by his former clown self. During the play, as Krusty tried to quiet the voice inside his mind, he causes the audience to laugh. He realizes that he is not a serious actor, but a clown, and starts to do comedic antics. In the final scene, the play that Krusty was in is later seen being witnessed by the ghosts of Krusty, Arthur Miller, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, and William Shakespeare. Reception Dennis Perkins of The A.V. Club gave this episode a C-, stating, \\"Sometimes The Simpsons rolls out an episode that’s so pale an approximation of its best that sticking up for it becomes an exercise in hand-waving and deep, deep sighs. 'Fears Of A Clown' isn’t good. It’s also not bad. It is, instead, irrelevant in its hollow echoes of past, actually memorable, episodes. When the book on 'The Simpsons' is finally closed...and the inevitable all-time episode rankings are compiled, 'Fears Of A Clown' is one of those installments destined to elicit blank stares, even from die-hard fans. It barely exists.\\" \\"Fears of a Clown\\" scored a 0.9 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.06 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

The game was designed to be episodic, and spawned sequels entitled \\"Secret Paths to Your Dreams\\" and \\"Secret Paths to the Sea”, which were released under Mattel after its 1999 acquisition of Purple Moon. Plot and gameplay The game sees characters return from Rockett's New School, where in a treehouse they reveal their deepest fears and thoughts. An example is Vietnamese-American child Minh, who is unhappy at the discordance in her parent's cultures. Secret Paths to Your Dreams acts as diary software akin to Rockett's Adventure Maker. Production The game was designed as a result of years of market testing the way boys and girls respond to games differently, something which was heavily discussed at the time in video gaming literature. A 30-second TV spot for “Secret Paths in the Forest” played on network and cable stations in New York and Chicago in late 1997. In 1998, Purple Moon held a Sea World Treasure Trove promotion, part of which included the selling of this software at Sea World. Critical reception In December 1997 alone, Secret Paths sold 23,539 units in the United States, according to PC Data. An article in the New York Times noted that young female playtesters enjoyed the title due to allowing them to see their own experiences played out through video game characters. Superkids felt the game offered a relaxing and contemplative experience. In 2017, Vice retrospectively looked at the game as a \\"(now adorably primitive) digital tool for building visual narratives\\". The Wow Climax: Tracing the Emotional Impact of Popular Culture thought the game wholly embodied the juvenile goth tradition of revealing secrets to how the adult world works and giving the players tools to deal with it. The title was one of the top fifty selling entertainment titles over the 1997 holiday season. It became one of Purple Moon's most popular games, and critically acclaimed. The game was nominated for a 1998 award by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences in the category of Computer Family/Kids Title of the Year.

However, law enforcement, conservative politicians, and grassroots parents' groups opposed this measure. The net result of the Carter administration was the continuation of the War on Drugs and restrictions on cannabis, while at the same time cannabis consumption in the United States reached historically high levels. Campaign position During his presidential campaign, Carter responded to a candidate survey by NORML, and stated that he was in favor of decriminalization of cannabis, as had recently been passed in Oregon in 1973. Presidency In a 1977 address to Congress, Carter submitted that penalties for cannabis use should not outweigh the actual harms of cannabis consumption. Carter retained Nixon-era (yet pro-decriminalization) advisor Robert Du Pont, and appointed pro-decriminalization British physician Peter Bourne as his drug advisor (or \\"drug czar\\") to head up his newly-formed Office of Drug Abuse Policy. =Decriminalization= Six months into his administration, Carter was already speaking in support of decriminalization of cannabis, replacing imprisonment with civil fines, and removing federal penalties for possession of one ounce or less of cannabis. Carter supported softer enforcement regarding cannabis and cocaine, while maintaining a stricter stance against the perceived greater dangers of heroin. =Opposition= Carter's momentum on decriminalization was impeded by the discrediting of Bourne, leading to Bourne's resignation on 20 July, 1978. Bourne came under controversy concerning his efforts to maintain the confidentiality of one of his staff for whom he had written a prescription for methaqualone. Shortly thereafter, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws executive director Keith Stroup leaked Bourne's alleged use of cannabis and cocaine (which Bourne had previously characterized as being \\"acutely pleasurable\\" in \\"The Great Cocaine Myth,\\" a 1974 article for the Drugs and Drug Abuse Education Newsletter)https://oig.justice.gov/special/9712/appc.htm at a party coinciding with the group's annual convention to journalists Gary Cohn and Jack Anderson in retaliation for the Carter administration's continued use of paraquat on Mexican cannabis fields.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/07/21/cocaine- sniffing-incident/9e5b6175-25a7-4169-8a8f-e12484aaa961/HighBeam Grassroots parents' organizations played a role in building popular opinion against cannabis decriminalization. The group Nosy Parents Association met with DuPont in 1977 and impressed upon him that youth cannabis usage was hurting students and families. Following this meeting, DuPont scaled back his support for decriminalization. Carter was also opposed by conservative politicians. Ex- governor of California and future president Ronald Reagan used his syndicated weekly radio show to attack Carter for being soft on cannabis, and support stricter anti-cannabis policies. Congress ultimately ignored Carter's support for decriminalization, alarmed by a sharp increase in the use of cocaine, and seeing cannabis as a gateway drug. =Compassionate Investigational New Drug program= The Compassionate Investigational New Drug program (Compassionate IND) was founded in 1978 by the Carter administration, providing federally- produced cannabis products to a limited number of assigned patients. The program was closed to new applicants in 1992 under the George H. W. Bush administration. =Drug War in Mexico= Carter spoke in favor of Mexico's program, funded by the United States, to eradicate cannabis in Mexico, stating: \\"\\"Marijuana happens to be an illicit drug that's included under the overall drug control program, and I favor this program very strongly.\\" References Carter Category:Political positions of Presidents of the United States Category:Presidency of Jimmy Carter ","title":"Cannabis policy of the Jimmy Carter administration"},{"id":"57006588","title":"Tiger (1813 ship)"},{"id":"57006591","text":"Paul J Brindley (born 1954) is an Australian parasitologist, microbiologist, and helminthologist.

Location The facility would be located in the industrial area of the city of Tema, approximately , by road, east of Accra, the largest city and capital of Ghana. Overview The Armech Thermal Power Station is a waste-to-energy (W2E) power plant located in Tema, Ghana's largest sea-port. The waste that will be burned to generate the electricity, will be sourced from several metropolitan and municipal assemblies in the Greater Accra Region. These include Accra, Tema, Ga South Municipal District, Ga East Municipal District, and La Dade Kotopon Municipal District. The Ghana Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development is a collaborator on this development. The development of this power station is in response to the unsatisfactory waste-management environment in the Greater Accra area, particularly among the low-income communities. The dangers that these communities face include (a) bio-degraded waste that contains parasites and disease-causing microbes (b) toxic leachate which seeps from landfills into the water table and (c) the toxic emissions from landfill burning. The poor environmental sanitation, leads to stagnation of drainage water and the breeding of disease-spreading mosquitoes. In the Greater Accra Area, 3.5 million malaria cases are recorded every year, with 900,000 of them occurring among children of less than five years of age, as of March 2018. The power generated will be sold to the Electricity Company of Ghana, for integration into the national electricity grid. Construction The power station is being built by Armech Africa Limited. The main contractor is Energy China, with money borrowed from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The construction cost is budgeted at US$300 million. This project represents the first grid-ready waste-to-energy project in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States. There are plans to develop a second waste-to-energy plant in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region.

It is the successor to the original F2000, L2000, and M2000 series. It consisted of the TGA (now discontinued), TGL, TGM, TGS, and TGX. As of 2016 the TG range is made up of five models, with the introduction of the TGE light commercial vehicle, a rebadged Volkswagen Crafter. Forward control version = First Generation (2000–2020) = The Forward control version was released in 2000, replacing the existing F2000, L2000 and M2000 series. It was initially developed in Germany. The first heavy duty cab was the TGA. Available models included L, LX, XL, XLX, and XXL. After its discontinuation in 2007, the TGA was replaced by the new TGS and TGX models. In addition to a manual transmission, these models are also available with the company's TipMatic automated manual transmission. In 2005, the TGL and TGM were introduced as the first both light and medium duty trucks by MAN. In 2007, the 16.2 L D28 series turbocharged V8 engine available as an option in the TGX. In 2012 new models were revealed with a chrome Lion grill, though these lacked the option of a V8 engine due to a lack of demand. The carryover 15.2 L D38 series in-line six-cylinder engine added into the lineup for 2014, replacing the D28 V8 engine. In 2016, another updated version was also revealed, and features a new black Lion grill of the MAN logo replacing the chrome Lion grill. = Second Generation (2020–) = On 10 February 2020, the second generation range was unveiled to the public at the event in Bilbao, Spain. The range comprises the four existing models, carried over from the first generation. It also introduces a new fully-digital instrument cluster for the first time in an MAN vehicle. The range also introduced improved aerodynamics, more fuel efficient engines and a more ergonomic experience for drivers.

The Jerusalem Center for Women aims to reduce hostilities between Palestine and Israel, as well as advocacy for women's rights in both areas. Most of the tactics utilized by this organization, include advocacy and workshops for community involvement, in addition to voice therapy sessions. The group receives support through international funding and attention. History =Founding= The Jerusalem Center for Women was founded in 1994. At the time, the First Intifada had come to a close. The fallout that resulted from the conflict, gave rise to a renewed fervor of hostility from both sides, but also a renewed desire for peace advocacy. There was an idea for a collaborative initiative between an organization of Palestinian origin and an organization of Israeli origin, which was conceived during a 1989 summit on the activities of Palestinian and Israeli female activists. This idea would become the Jerusalem Link, a collaborative effort between one Palestinian and one Israeli group to work together on topics of feminism and peace between Israel and Palestine. Within the Jerusalem Link, the Jerusalem Center for Women represented the Palestinian side of the collaboration. Bat Shalom represented the Israeli side. This collaboration served as both a means to further advocacy goals, and a symbol of collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli people. =Aftermath of September 2001= Though the Jerusalem Center for Women had received support at first, the election of President George W. Bush created obstacles that prevented the United States from delivering foreign support to the organization. The priorities of the United States government were altered, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict was not considered as high of a priority as it formerly was. The incident of September 11, 2001 had occurred at the time, and the United States had changed its focus from the Palestinian and Israeli conflict to the activities that occurred in Iraq. This gave rise to a concern among the members of the Jerusalem Link, that the Israeli government could take the opportunity to continue its expansion into Palestinian territories. The Jerusalem Center for Women in response, collaborated with Bat Shalom to ensure that equal rights were maintained while the attention of the United States was elsewhere. =Aftermath of Second Intifada= While the First Intifada created some support for peace advocacy, the aftermath of the Second Intifada reduced the interest of peace in the conflict. This conflict caused some problems for the Jerusalem Center for Women. The governments in both Israel and Palestine were opposed to the idea of communication across the borders, something that went on to cause somewhat strained relationships between both the Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom. Despite this setback, the Jerusalem Center for Women continued their attempt to promote peace and equality. The organization's membership remained strong initially after the Second Intifada, due in large part to the emphasis on equality placed on its structure. During the year 2003, the Jerusalem Center for Women applied a variety of new programs to support and train women on how to advocate for their rights. These new programs were more hands-on approaches, which allowed the group’s members to play a more active role in state building. As the years went on however, tensions between the Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom increased with the hostilities of the Palestine-Israeli conflict. Objectives and activities =Goals and values= The main goal of the Jerusalem Center for Women is to advocate for women's right in Israel and Palestine, and train them in ways with which they could influence the building and maintenance of the state through advocacy. The organization also advocates in favor of peace between the Israeli and Palestinian population. In its conduct towards the goal, the Jerusalem Center for Women tries to retain the value of equality through its structure and actions. The organization's location, membership, and leadership try to reflect this value of equality, and has helped it survive past the Second Intifada. =Activities= In line with its goal of training women to play a more active role in communities, a common method used by the Jerusalem Center for Women is the creation of training camps for women in Palestinian and Israeli communities. These training camps educate women on topics such as politics, leadership, law, and culture. More forms of training would be provided over time. Conflict Resolution Techniques and From Grassroots to Decision-Making for instance, were two training camps led by the Jerusalem Center for Women that sought to convince women to actively advocate for the better of their community. There were other programs outside of training camps established by the Jerusalem Center for Women within communities. During the earlier years of the organization's history, the Jerusalem Center for Women ran various forums for people to debate and discuss the matters of the Palestine and Israeli conflict. These forums were created as early as 1997, in which said forum consisted of a week of activities. Another method of advocacy that was used often by the Jerusalem Center for Women, came in the form of voice therapy projects. Similar to psychological counseling sessions, members of the Jerusalem Center for Women would hear the grievances of women who had fallen victim or knew of someone who had fallen victim to the Palestine-Israeli conflict. The Jerusalem Center for Women has also on occasion, attempted to appeal to individuals that held positions of power. The Jerusalem Center for Women was active during International Women’s Day for instance, to bring concerns of the organization and community to the Israeli government. The Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom also worked on an initiative in which they wrote letters advocating for peace, and sent them to be published on the news of both states. The Jerusalem Center for Women has also attempted to make appeals to foreign governments. These appeals would usually be expressed using active language, such as calling the Israeli occupation the catalyst for the violent response that occurred. An example of advocacy towards a foreign government, was a collaborative appeal to the United Nations, as a call to action. =Collaboration with Bat Shalom= The Jerusalem Center for Women has collaborated with Bat Shalom on multiple occasions. The main goal of maintaining this relationship, was strengthening a sense of unity between Palestine and Israel. The group’s relationship was well at first, though there were some obstacles that sometimes impeded with collaboration. Near the beginning of their founding, the Jerusalem Center for Women encountered some disagreement with Bat Shalom regarding the definition of the Palestinian Right of Return. This was early in the formation of the Jerusalem Link, when both groups were constructing their joint guidelines of conduct, known as the Jerusalem Link Declaration of Principles. Though both groups agreed with the position of the Right of Return, they disagreed on a few details. Around 2001 to 2002, this disagreement caused the relationship between both groups to falter further. Both groups eventually agreed to implement their own definition of the Right of Return as equal dignity and rights for Palestinian and Israeli people. The Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom held their own symposium as early as 1997, known as \\"Sharing Jerusalem: Two Capitals for Two States.\\" The Jerusalem Center for Women has also aided Bat Shalom in developing the Women’s Emergency Network. The network itself was meant to be a sort of reconnaissance measure, and was created after the United States turned its attention away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The network was designed with the intention of monitoring the activity of Israeli detainment. In the event that there was action being taken against Palestinians, the women from either side would inform Bat Shalom. Both organizations would then work together on these issues. There was an attempt to maintain the value of balance in control between both groups, during their advocacy projects. When designing and executing these projects, both Palestinian and Israeli members were given platforms with which to speak and lead the organizational efforts. Furthermore, both groups tended to reflect upon the relationship they had with each other, in order to avoid having one group dominate over the other. Structure and membership =Members and location= The Jerusalem Center for Women is situated between Palestine and Israel, on an area near the border called the West Bank. This location allows both Palestinian and Israeli people to access the organization. Activities are normally performed on the West Bank, as well as within Israel. The Jerusalem Center for Women has multiple forms of leadership. The organization has a board of around 8 to 10 women to lead the group, and a group as large as 42 members that makes up an assembly to further discuss matters of leadership. Many of the members that have a position on the organization's board have also worked on the Jerusalem Link, or had joined the organization since its creation. Though there were no elections to determine new leaders for the organization, there would still be some changes in board members from time to time. If a decision was brought up within the organization, it would usually be passed solely by consensus. The membership of the Jerusalem Center for Women is not entirely composed of these leading bodies however. Some members were hired to handle some of the more administrative roles of the organization. Joining the Jerusalem Center for Women is somewhat difficult, since the organization is more selective in its approach to accepting new members. Demographics are relatively balanced among those from Israel and those from Palestine, though there was a lack of representation from a subset of the Israeli people known as the Mizrahi. This lack of representation was not entirely uncommon, and could have been due to the emphasis on women's rights as a whole instead of having a specific focus on Mizrahi women's rights. Most of the organization's members have some form of education, such as a bachelor's degree or the necessary credentials to hold some government positions. =Funding and support= The Jerusalem Center for Women has been receiving international aid for a long time. The organization has usually received funding from foreign countries. From the beginning, one of the more prominent supporters for the organization was the European Union, which also supported Bat Shalom. The Jerusalem Center for Women’s international funding and support drew the ire from some of the other feminst groups in the area, with the worry that the organization might have been too institutionalized. Though the Jerusalem Center for Women uses foreign support to help fund their activities, they also seek international support in order to attain a better platform to voice their concerns. To attain this support, the Jerusalem Center for Women usually tries to align its objectives with those of international governments. Sometimes, the activities of the group will have the additional goal of attracting the attention of diplomatic dignitaries to raise awareness internationally.

He was heavily involved in the development of New South Wales' telegraphy and telephony networks. Notable for conducting one of the earliest wireless telegraphy experiments in Australia. Early life and family Walker was born at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, 28 February 1840. His father, the Rev. James B. Walker (born 1794),http://straydogphotos.com/familyhistory/languages/en/persons/Person_I19274.html became headmaster of King's School, Parramatta. His mother was Fanny Billingsley (born 1799). They married at Eynsham, Oxfordshire, England on 22 December 1824 and had a large family there, Philip Billingsley Walker being the sixth son. They emigrated to Australia in 1841, arriving at Launceston, Tasmania on 27 August 1841 on board the Arabian. They relocated to Sydney a few years later. The ten children of the marriage were as follows: * Fanny Hannah Waldo Walker (born 22 December 1825); * Billingsley Edmonds Walker (born 1827); * James Charles Walker (born 1829), later of Melbourne; * Samuel Billingsley (born 1831), later of Queensland; * Robert Cooper Walker (born 1833), later principal librarian of the Sydney Free Library; * Llyssye Walker (born 1833); * Fanny Elizabeth Walker (born 1834); * Frederick Walker (born 13 June 1837); * Philip Billingsley Walker (born 28 February 1840); and * Richard Cornelius Crichett (\\"Crichett\\") Walker (born 28 June 1841, on board the Arabian), later Principal Under-Secretary. * Gertrude Walker was a sister in the Prince Alfred Hospital. He married Louisa née Mitchell (born 1839) on 26 October 1861.http://straydogphotos.com/familyhistory/languages/en/persons/Person_I19274.html They had six children: * Isabelle Louisa (born 14 September 1863); * Alice Victoria Walker (born 1865); * Eliza Gertrude Walker (born 1867); * Francis Billingsley (\\"Frank\\") Walker (born 4 September 1868), later with the Commercial Bank, Sydney; * Phillip Stanley Billingsley Walker (born 27 March 1878), predeceased his father; and * Fanny Rosalie Walker (born 1879); Phillip Billingsley Walker received his education at the King's School, Parramatta where his father was the headmaster. Professional career Shortly after leaving school he entered the public service as a clerk in the Works Department, but shortly afterwards transferred to the Telegraph Office, where he secured a position as operator. He rose rapidly in the service, by dint of sheer merit, and became secretary to the department during Colonel Cracknell's administration, when the telegraphs and post-offices were united under one permanent head. For many years he was assistant superintendent of telegraphs, and in the late 1890s was appointed by the Public Service Board to the position of Engineer-in-Chief to the department, an appointment he held until his death. He was a colonel on the staff, and director of telegraphs, and was in possession of the long-service medal. While con-nected with the Telegraph Department Colonel Walker introduced many needed reforms, and proved himself an efficient and painstaking ad-ministrator. When the Pacific cable agreement was being drawn up he was the officer to whom the Minister looked for advice. The late chief was held in the highest esteem, not only by the officers and employees of the department, but by all branches of the public service, and by a large circle of friends. =Development of Telegraphy= =Development of Telephony= =Wireless experiments= On 10 August 1899, the Postmaster- General, one or two officers of the Department and representatives of the press, were invited to a demonstration of wireless under the supervision of P. B. Walker, Engineer-in-Chief of Telegraphs. The transmitting and receiving aerial wires were suspended on the corners of the roof of the Post Office building with the equipment itself in the laboratory below. The demonstration was entirely a success, though interference was present from adjacent tram lines. Walker stated that he felt there was presently limited commercial application, but nevertheless advised that further experiments would be conducted, with sea trials still to be decided upon. The transmitting was undertaken by Walker and the receiving by Watkin Wynne. All the equipment was manufactured by staff of the Government electrician, principally Mr. Nelson. A 12-inch induction coil was used for transmission and a two-inch coherer for reception. An amount of 150 pounds was stated to have been reserved for purchase of equipment from the Marconi Telegraph Company, with further experiments to proceed upon receipt. However Walker fell ill towards the end of 1899, passed August 1900 and with his passing wireless telegraphy seems to have fallen dormant for many years. Personal life Colonel Walker was a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, a justice of the peace, an associate of several electrical societies. He was a noted chess player, and was vice-president or the Sydney Chess Club. Late life and legacy Walker died of diabetes and pneumonia at Bligh Street, Sydney, on 13 June 1903 and was buried in the Waverley cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at £4885.

It is a category of qualitative research together with those that focus on society and culture and those that focus on language and communication. In the philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, the human sciences are based on lived experience, which makes them fundamentally different from the natural sciences, which are considered to be based on scientific experiences. The concept can also be approached from the view that since every experience has both objective and subjective components, it is important for a researcher to understand all aspects of it. In phenomenological research, lived experiences are the main object of study, but the goal of such research is not to understand individuals' lived experiences as facts, but to determine the understandable meaning of such experiences. In addition lived experience is not about reflecting on an experience while living through it but is recollective, where experience is reflected on after it has passed or lived through.

It is the intersection of Charoen Krung, Fueang Nakhon and Ban Mo roads. It is considered to be the second intersection of Charoen Krung, the first official street in Thailand, after nearby Saphan Mon (Mon bridge). The term Si Kak Phraya Si can mean Phraya Si's intersection and comes from the Teochew word \\"角\\" (Kak) meaning angle or corner and \\"四\\" (Si) meaning four, which refers the four-way intersection. Also, Phraya Si (พระยาศรี) is the name of Mon who has a house in this neighbourhood. He was an aristocrat during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV) and the leader in the construction of Charoen Krung including Saphan Mon. In addition, there is also Soi Phraya Si (Phraya Si alley), another way named in his honour. It is an alley that connects Fueang Nakhon and Atsadang roads to the Saphan Hok (Lifting bridge) over Khlong Lot (คลองหลอด; lit: tube canal). At this area, is the site of the first department store in Thailand – Harry A. Badman and Go., by Mr. Badman, British businessman in 1899 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).

Supposedly written between 1697 and 1730s by Jan Fryderyk Rivius, the chronicle remains unpublished. Lithuanian researcher Artūras Dubonis pointed out many inconsistencies in its authorship, unclear provenance, factual and chronological fallacies, and concluded that it is most likely a forgery, though more extensive study is required for a conclusive determination. Provenance According to Narbutt, he accidentally purchased the manuscript in Reval in 1808. He first made references to the chronicle in articles published in 1817. Narbutt did not cite page numbers of the chronicle in his work, though the pages are numbered and he cited the page numbers of the Bychowiec Chronicle. Narbutt prepared a Polish translation of the most important parts of the chronicle and intended to publish it in a collection of primary sources on the history of Lithuania. However, the chronicle remains unpublished and is kept, along with the Narbutt's translation, at the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. Content The chronicle is written in German with some phrases in Latin and words in Latvian. Narbutt analyzed the chronicle and claimed that it used an earlier Russian chronicle, compiled by Mitrofan, a monk in Pinsk. This work by Mitrofan was used both by Rivius and by Augustinus Rotundus for his long-lost history. Thus, according to Narbutt, the Chronicle of Rivius preserved some unique fragments of Rotundus' work. Narbutt lamented that fragments of Rotundus work, including two genealogical tables, were lost when the last pages of the manuscript burned during a fire at his library in 1838. However, the surviving manuscript shows no fire damage. The chronicle contains many obviously wrong and incorrect facts. For example, it claims that in 1276 a woman gave birth to 346 babies or that Turks made an assault on Belgrade in 1717. The chronicle also contains many unique, otherwise unknown, facts from the history of Lithuania. For example, Lithuanian and Samogitian golden coins from the 13th century, a Lithuanian pagan flag with a cock on the tip of the pole, an inscription on the tombstone of King Mindaugas, a description of the Perkūnas shrine in the Šventaragis' Valley in Vilnius. Some events are described differently in the chronicle than in Narbutt's works. For example, the chronicle records that Duke Mindaugas, his wife, and , Master of the Livonian Order, traveled to Rome in 1254 to discuss Mindaugas' coronation with the pope, while Narbutt described the trip in 1262 when Mindaugas traveled to clear his conscience of the apostasy and desire to serve pagan gods. In his comments to the translation, Narbutt even debated which version is more correct (though both are proved wrong by the 13th-century Livonian Rhymed Chronicle). Author Narbutt referred to the chronicle as Kronika niemiecka J. F. R. (German Chronicle of J. F. R.) and revealed its author to be Jan Fryderyk Rivius (1673–1730/1735), grandson of Johann Rivius (1528–1596). However, in his chronicle Rivius provided his grandfather's biography that supplied no new information in addition to what was already known from the encyclopedias of Johann Friedrich von Recke and Karl Eduard von Napiersky, published in 1831, and of , published in 1777. The biography also repeated some mistakes found in these encyclopedias. Also, the 77-year gap between grandfather's death and grandson's birth is virtually impossible. The chronicle makes no mention of Rivius' father or his own life, other than he was born in Königsberg and in 1689 moved to Courland, where he worked as a pastor after pastor Grott moved to Libau. The exact same information about Grott was presented to Narbutt by Napiersky in a letter written in April 1833. Other researchers pointed out a Johannes Fridericus Ruvius from Wenden who became a student at the University of Dorpat in 1690, but Rivius was from Königsberg and it is unlikely that he \\"forgot\\" to mention his university education. Therefore, researcher Artūras Dubonis concluded that Rivius' biography was invented between 1833 and 1842.

Under Reagan the office created the Just Say No ad campaign, for whom the First Lady, Nancy Reagan was also an outspoken proponent and even spokesperson. The campaign focused on \\"middle- class youth smoking marijuana\\". In the first few years of the Reagan Administration, the Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) run by the DEA expanded from seven states to forty. By 1985 it was active in all fifty states.Domestic Cannabis Eradication / Suppression Program (DEA official website) The Campaign Against Marijuana Planting was initiated in 1983 in California, to become the country's largest eradication task force and including National Guard troops and federal resources including U-2 spy planes over Northern California.Marijuana Research Collection - CAMP Reports, Humboldt State University The Reagan Administration saw a change in the Posse Comitatus Act to allow the U.S. Navy to join other Federal agencies engaging in \\"pot war\\" interdiction efforts. \\"For the first time in American history, U.S. naval vessels began directly to interdict drug-smuggling ships in international waters,\\" and the interdiction budget expanded from less than $4 million in 1981 to over a billion by the end of Reagan's second term. In a 1984 radio address, Reagan said his administration had seen military operations like the South Florida Task Force (created in 1982) make \\"interdiction and seizure of major quantities of marijuana and cocaine\\" and had convinced Colombia to spray herbicide on its cannabis crops. The South Florida Task Force was \\"the most ambitious drug-interdiction program in the nation's history – all aimed at keeping marijuana out of the country\\". Under Reagan, in 1985 the DEA began the nation's first non-military public employee mass drug testing program (including testing for THC metabolite). In 1986, Reagan's Executive Order 12564 authorized drug testing for all Federal employees. The President's counsel acknowledged in 1987 that Federal courts had ruled mass testing programs unconstitutional, but the Executive Order \\"should survive a well-reasoned analysis\\", \\"perhaps ultimately by the Supreme Court\\". In 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and \\"grouped cannabis with drugs like heroin\\". The bill was passed without committee hearings. (Chapter 2) Civil asset forfeiture for cannabis-related activities was a major policy decision under Reagan, \\"not only sending pot users to jail but also 'forfeiting everything they own'\\" according to Ninth Circuit Court judge Stephen S. Trott (then a Reagan administration Associate Attorney General). Legacy of the War on Drugs United States incarceration rate The War on Drugs was \\"most fiercely\\" waged by Presidents Reagan and his successor George H.W. Bush. A Government Accountability Office report found billion-dollar Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) media campaigns begun in the Reagan era \\"may have promoted perceptions among exposed youth that others' drug use was normal\\". The campaigns have been described as partly responsible for reframing the 21st-century debate on cannabis legalization \\"not by trying to shift attitudes about drugs, but by redefining marijuana as medicine and by focusing on the economic and social costs of the incarceration that has resulted from drug laws\\". Mandatory minimum drug sentences for cocaine and marijuana, established in the Reagan administration, have been \\"increasingly criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population\\".

At the time of her construction, she was one of the most advanced steamships on the Great Lakes. She offered luxurious accommodations for customers that included heated cabins, ornate wood design, and oil paintings to decorate the rooms. She was then purchased by Milwaukee Railway Company. In February 1885, the Michigan became entrapped in an ice pack, and a few weeks later, sank in Lake Michigan. Vessel Built by the Detroit Dry Dock Company, in Wyandotte, Michigan, the vessel was constructed with an iron double hull, with separating the two hulls. In addition to the double hull, another safety feature added were five watertight compartments. 123 cabins were built and were said to be the grandest on the lakes, decorated with velvet carpets, furniture and oil paintings. Her powerhouse was an F & AC compound engine with and cylinders and a stroke. Along with the engine was a , boiler built by De Soto & Hutton of Detroit. She displaced 1,024 tons, with a length of and a width of feet. The Michigan had a sister ship, the . Rescue attempt In the early months of 1885, a harsh winter had embattled shipping in Lake Michigan. It was typical for Great Lakes shipping trade to halt during the winter months, but an early thaw in February prompted it to resume. As soon as ships left port with cargo, however, a strong winter storm engulfed the region, dropping of snow in two days. This caused many ships to become trapped in ice, including two ships owned by the Milwaukee Railway Company, and one of which being the Michigans sister ship, the Wisconsin. Knowing the ships and their cargo could be doomed if left to the ice pack, the Milwaukee Railway Company decided to use the Michigan and her double hull to break through the ice and free the trapped vessels. On the morning of February 9, 1885, the Michigan and 29 crewmen set up to see if they could free the ships. That same day, a nor'easter gale blew the ship off course and into an ever- growing ice pack. By the morning of the February 11, she was trapped in ice, drifting south. By February 17, conditions remained unchanged, and the crew was quickly exhausting resources. The captain ordered that the sailors ration supplies, and also enlisted a 17-man team to venture across the frozen lake, to land, as the condition of the ship had worsened. The group, using ice picks, axes, and ropes, covered and reached shore in Allegan County, Michigan. On February 21, a resupply ship arrived to restock the trapped Michigan. Loss February turned to March, and although conditions improved, and ice began to break up, the Michigan was still trapped. On March 19, the pressure on the hull was causing the ship to moan, as the double iron hull buckled, and continued throughout the night. A tugboat, the Arctic arrived the following day as a last effort to free the Michigan. The Arctic became trapped as well. Late that night, the hull of the Michigan became inundated with water, and the captain ordered to abandon ship. All the crew was able to leave the doomed ship and watched as Michigan slipped under the ice, to the bottom on Lake Michigan. The crew then waited on the stuck Arctic until conditions improved, and the tug was freed. No lives were lost in the sinking. Discovery of the wreck In 2005 the Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates located the wreck of Michigan in of water off Holland, Michigan. The discovery was made while MSRA members were scanning the lake bottom with David Trotter of Canton, Michigan, who was also instrumental in the 2001 discovery of the H.C. Akeley off Saugatuck.

A. Walker. Georgina Bowers (1836–1912) was a Victorian comic illustrator, and one of the first female humourists to be acknowledged professionally. As a child she had a personal connection with animals, and later in life realistic drawings of horses and dogs became common features in her artwork. Bowers is noted most highly for her work as an illustrator for Punch, though she published many of her own comics as well.  Early life  Georgina Bowers was a Victorian illustrator born in 1836 in London, England. Her mother died before Bowers got to know her, and her father, George Bowers was the Dean of Manchester, though he was the Rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden at the time of Bowers’ birth.Papers of GH Bowers As a child, Bowers loved country life and animals, which would both become recurring subjects of her later work. From a young age she took an interest in drawing dogs and horses, though her governess discouraged it, insisting instead that she focus on needlework and reading. This proved fruitless, however, and Bowers ended up drawing in most of her free time, of which she had quite a lot. At 15 she was sent away from home to Derbyshire, where she was tutored privately in subjects such as music, drawing, and German. Here, however, despite being tutored in drawing, she was discouraged yet again from drawing animals. Instead, her teacher only advised her in watercolour sketching, which was deemed more appropriate for a young woman such as herself.  Career  A panel from \\"Hollybush Hall\\" by Georgina Bowers. After her coming out, in which she was presented officially as a woman in society ready to be married, she decided to begin studying at the Manchester School of Art. This was unusual for a woman in her position, and she devoted much of her time to it. Later she became an illustrator for Punch, working with artists such as Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks, and John Leech. After Leech died in 1864, however, she moved to Hertfordshire to work and be near the countryside she loved so dearly as a child. This move proved beneficial for her, as she was able to partake in many sporting studies, as well as artistic studies of horses and dogs while hunting. Additionally, Bowers once stated that the vast majority of the jokes in her own publications were inspired by incidents that had occurred while out hunting. By 1876, Bowers was designing nearly all of the hunting subjects for Punch, and spent her days with her dogs or on horseback, keeping a sketchbook in her saddlebag at all times so that she could draw the animals and scenery around her.

He explains scientific topics via writing and performing a capella parodies of popular music which he records and posts on his YouTube channel, A Capella Science.  Early life and education Blais was born in Hudson, Quebec. Blais states that he comes from an \\"incredibly musical\\" family. His mother leads a church choir; Blais joined the choir when he was three. He also plays drums, piano, and stringed instruments including guitar. Blais graduated from McGill University in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2013, he earned a master's degree in high-energy theoretical physics with honors from McGill. Career Blais created his first parody video in 2012, motivated by a desire to help people understand the world around them. He states that creating parody videos with a factual science theme came out of being fascinated by science, music (particularly a capella), and parody. He was inspired by \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Bill Nye, Mike Tompkins, and Vi Hart. He was also inspired by the group The Maccabeats, an a cappella group that sings parodies of songs with replacement lyrics about Jewish themes. Blais has had an a cappella singing experience with Vancouver's Acapocalypse group. In his solo videos, Blais performs all the tracks with his own voice, sometimes beat-boxing and creating brass sound effects. Most videos take a few hundred hours to complete. Blais' first video parody was \\"Rolling in the Higgs\\", based on Adele's \\"Rolling in the Deep\\". The video was one of a handful of musical creations that followed the 2012 announcement of the discovery of a boson particle with Higgs-like characteristics. Blais' YouTube video generated over 17,000 hits in its first five days and had almost 800 thousand views as of April 2017. The video took Blais 60 hours to complete. Blais' second video, \\"Bohemian Gravity,\\" parodied Queen's \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" to explain string theory. The video features a sock puppet portraying Albert Einstein. The work attracted the attention of Brian May, Queen's guitarist (who also holds a PhD degree in astrophysics), and May posted the video on his website. Blais' YouTube channel has covered such topics as entropic time, exoplanets, and the discovery of insulin as a treatment for diabetes. Blais has collaborated with Dianna Cowern and others. Although Blais' career in science includes previous employment at the TRIUMF particle accelerator center in Vancouver, Canada, Blais makes a living from creating his videos, being supported by advertising revenue, sales of mp3s and posters, and contributions from fans via the Patreon website. Blais also does public talks which include performances of his creations and as well as discussions of science culture and his experiences as a science graduate student and an artist in new media.

It was written by Eddie Guzelian and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis. Plot In flashback, Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) plays dead to save herself from the massacre of the Scavengers by Simon and the Saviors. In the present, she takes time to compose herself before collecting a captive Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and carrying his modified baseball bat, \\"Lucille\\", and a suitcase. Negan tries to apologize for what happened to her people, recognizing that Simon had gone against his orders in wiping out the Scavengers, but Jadis is steadfast and threatens to kill him. While she is out of sight, he is able to access her suitcase, containing a gun and pictures from her past, convincing her to talk lest he destroy them with a flare. He reveals that he named his bat after his late wife, Lucille, and, like Jadis' pictures, his bat is the last thing he has to remember his previous life. Jadis' wristwatch beeps, and she suddenly rushes Negan to get the flare, but it is knocked out of their hands into a puddle, and extinguishes. She races off to get another flare as a helicopter hovers briefly overhead before disappearing, too late to see Jadis' second flare. Jadis breaks down into tears, and she lets Negan go; he offers her to come with him and follow a new path, but she refuses. Meanwhile, the Hilltop community regroups after the Saviors' attack. Tara (Alanna Masterson) unsuccessfully tries to sway Daryl (Norman Reedus) that Dwight is still loyal to them after the attack. Michonne (Danai Gurira) tries to convince Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to read his son Carl's last message to him, but he cannot come to do it. Instead, he decides to locate the escaped Savior prisoners, and Alden (Callan McAuliffe) suggest that he check a nearby bar. Morgan (Lennie James) feels guilt for Henry's (Macsen Lintz) disappearance, as Henry had been seeking vengeance on Jared (Joshua Mikel), the Savior that killed his brother and Morgan's pupil Benjamin. He goes out to look for him, accompanied by Carol (Melissa McBride). They find a walker with Henry's weapon through it, and Morgan believes Henry must be dead and instead heads further down the road, while Carol goes in the direction the walker came from to find Henry. Morgan meets up with Rick, and while they avoid a walker horde heading towards the bar, they are captured by the escaped Saviors, led by Jared. When Rick and Morgan come to in the bar, they find the Saviors arguing loudly among themselves about returning to the Hilltop. Rick promises amnesty to anyone who wants to return and warns of an approaching horde, but it comes too late as walkers flood the bar. Some of the Saviors cut Rick and Morgan loose of their bonds. Rick helps to eliminate walkers, but then turns on the remaining Saviors. Morgan chases down Jared and purposely traps him in a room with walkers, leaving Jared to die. As they collect themselves, Rick asks Morgan what changed to make him vengeful since their first meeting; Morgan replies that he had his son back then. Meanwhile, Carol is able to find Henry fending off walkers. She helps rescue him and takes him back to the Hilltop for a happy reunion. Rick and Morgan return, and Morgan sullenly informs Henry he killed Jared. Henry says he's sorry, but Morgan tells him to never say one's sorry, and walks off alone. In his room, Rick tearfully reads his letter from Carl. Elsewhere, Daryl and Rosita (Christian Serratos) discover the Saviors' ammunition factory, where Eugene (Josh McDermitt) is helping to keep their ammo supply going. Daryl and Rosita plot to kill the men running the factory to end the supply. Concurrently, Negan is on route back to the Sanctuary when he finds a familiar face and offers them a ride. Back at Sanctuary, the gate guards are surprised to see Negan alive, believing he had been killed based on what Simon had told them. They let Negan and his passenger in, but Negan tells them not to tell anyone else about his return. Production The scene in which Carol saves Henry from walkers while he is trapped among tree roots mirrors the scene from the season two premiere episode, \\"What Lies Ahead,\\" in which Rick ushers Carol's daughter, Sophia, into a similar set of tree roots to have her hide from walkers; this was the last time Sophia was seen alive in the series, as she was found turned to a walker in the mid-season finale episode, \\"Pretty Much Dead Already.\\" Furthering this, Henry is portrayed by Macsen Lintz, the younger brother of Madison Lintz, the actress who portrayed Sophia.

Johnson (1963–1969), the government made moves to reconsider cannabis law enforcement in the nation, including a more treatment-based approach to drug use. However, Johnson was saddled with controversies regarding the Vietnam War and internal national tensions, and was not able to make major changes to cannabis policy before declining to run for a second term in 1968. During the Johnson administration, cannabis usage was an issue of concern both in the youth counterculture as well as among American troops serving in the Vietnam War. Presidency Federal Bureau of Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger, a strong opponent of cannabis since the 1930s, left office in 1963, setting the scene for potential evolution of the national cannabis policy. In 1966, the Johnson administration passed the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act, treating drug abuse as a medical issue similar to alcoholism. Johnson's 1967 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice concluded that the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was ineffective, and over-broad in lumping cannabis use in with the more dangerous use of opiates. Johnson himself considered the possibility of easing cannabis regulations by removing the mandatory minimum sentencing for cannabis possession. Throughout Johnson's administration, cannabis use rose sharply, with arrests increasing from 18,815 in 1965 to 61,843 in 1967. In response to the increasing usage of cannabis and other drugs, in 1968 Johnson placed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (Treasury) and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (Food and Drug Administration) under the control of the Department of Justice, consolidating them as the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

A QRT is trained to serve as a first responder unit for narcotic-related medical emergencies and, thereafter, to approach and counsel overdose victims during their \\"recovery windows\\" — the 72 hours immediately following life-threatening drug overdoses — when users are thought to be more open to accepting help. At present, QRT and/or DART programs are operating in communities in at least 5 states (see \\"Proliferation\\" below).  History  The QRT deflection model was first developed in 2014, in Colerain Township, Ohio — a 45-square-mile suburb in Hamilton County, just northwest of Cincinnati. Colerain's then-safety services director, Dan Meloy – who had previously served as the township's police chief and, later, as the township's administrator — oversaw development of its pilot QRT program, in collaboration with the community's assistant fire chief Will Mueller (who is also an adjunct instructor of Fire science at the University of Cincinnati), and CEO Nan Franks and social worker Shana Merrick from the Addiction Services Council of Greater Cincinnati. Concurrently and independently of the Colerain program, Lucas County, Ohio, developed its similar DART model, which it also first deployed in 2014.  Impetus  Meloy and other Colerain officials saw the need to develop more innovative, person- centered approaches to reduce the then-sharply rising number of narcotic overdoses in their community, which had been particularly hard-hit by the United States' mid-2010s opioid epidemic. At the time of the QRT pilot program's development, Colerain Township had approximately 60,000 residents, usually covered by just 33 fire/EMS personnel and 6 patrol officers at any given time. Whereas in 2011, Colerain reported 51 total overdoses, by 2014 the annual number of overdoses in the community had risen to 141 – a 176% increase in just three years – according to statistics provided in 2016 by the township's Department of Public Safety to the non-profit organization Cover2 Resources, which had asked Colerain to consult as that organization assisted in the development of a similar QRT program in Summit County, Ohio (see \\"Proliferation\\" below).  Organization  In the original Colerain model, a special tactics-trained police officer, a specially-trained firefighter-medic and an addiction counselor from the community were partnered to form a single QRT. The community's initial QRT emergency responder candidate pool included 6 of the community's firefighter-medics who had previous experience serving as military, SWAT, or Hostage Rescue Team tactical medics (TACMEDs) and 5 police officers with special tactics training (through their service in the military, with SWAT, or on Narcotics Squads). The chosen firefighter-medics received additional self-defense, chemical irritant deployment and de-escalation training. Special tactics training was deemed necessary, in township officials' estimation, due to the volatile circumstances that often prevail on scene during narcotics-related emergency responses. Licensed substance abuse counselors were provided to the QRT program through a partnership with the Addiction Services Council of Greater Cincinnati. The QRT program included a \\"360 Solution\\" component, under which all Colerain patrol officers were equipped with nasal-delivery naloxone (Narcan), provided by the Ohio Department of Health and Hamilton County Public Health. Additionally, the police department canvassed the community several times door-to-door, delivering brochures that informed citizens about the township's efforts to respond to the opioid epidemic. Colerain's QRT members were trained to use \\"motivational interviewing\\" principles – expression of empathy to build rapport with the opiate user, helping the user to elicit the pros and cons of entering treatment, respecting the user's right to choose, and communicating to the user that he or she is capable of change – during their post-incident follow-ups with overdose victims, to attempt to divert users into addiction treatment programs. They were also trained to identify barriers to treatment, to assist users and their families in preparing to remove or overcome those barriers, to move the user toward a firm commitment to action, and to engage the victim's family and enlist its help in moving the victim to action. Follow-on counseling encounters were directed to be made in a manner that built trust, maintained discretion and confidentiality, protected the individual's right to choose his or her own care, and complied with all state and federal regulations on patient privacy (i.e.., HIPAA).  Efficacy  In January through June 2015 (the 6 months immediately preceding the unit's first deployment), Colerain's first responders made 96 overdose-related emergency runs (19 of which involved associated cardiac arrests). In the 6 months immediately following the QRT units' deployment, the township made 71 overdose-related emergency runs (7 of which involved associated cardiac arrests). Although those initial, positive indications were not sufficient to conclusively prove the pilot program's effectiveness, they were nonetheless encouraging. A subsequent year-over-year analysis lent support to its developers hypothesis that the QRT program could be effective in reducing the number of overdoses in the community. In January through June 2016, the township made 67 overdose-related emergency runs (just 6 of which involved associated cardiac arrests), representing just over a 30% reduction in such runs from the same 6-month period in the preceding year. At 2016's year-end, Colerain Township's Department of Public Safety reported that its QRT units had conducted approximately 250 overdose follow-up encounters since July 2015, when the units were first deployed, and that nearly 80% of the users counseled by the unit had entered substance abuse treatment. Nearby Middletown, Ohio's QRT arguably did not succeed in reducing overdose rates or overdose-related deaths in its first year of operation. Interviewed by the Journal-News, Middletown's fire chief, Paul Lolli, noted that in 2016 (the year its QRT was implemented), the city's emergency response agencies made 532 overdose-related runs (comprising 5.7% of its total response volume for that year) with 74 deaths recorded. But, from January 1 – June 17, 2017, the city's agencies had already made 577 opioid overdose responses (comprising 12.4% of its EMS run volume to that point in the year) with 51 recorded deaths. In 2017, Lucas County sheriff John Tharp stated that that county's DART program had, in the 3 years since its first deployment, achieved a similar success rate, with 74% of contacted individuals having either entered detox or connected with other substance abuse treatment programs.  Proliferation  The Colerain QRT's initial successes in addressing that township's opiate abuse epidemic garnered close attention from officials in surrounding communities, many of which expressed interest in adopting the model. Within the QRT's first 2 years of operation, communities in North Carolina, northern Ohio, Texas and West Virginia contacted Colerain to inquire about its program. By June 2016, Ross County, Ohio, and its seat, Chillicothe, had launched their joint, multi- agency Post-Overdose Response Team (PORT), based on Colerain's QRT. In August 2016, Oxford, Ohio, in Butler County, had \\"loosely\\" formed a QRT. By September 2016, another Cincinnati suburb, Norwood, had developed and deployed a Colerain-model QRT. In January 2017, the Funders' Response to the Heroin Epidemic – a Greater Cincinnati-based, private funding collaboration operated by InterAct for Change, a nonprofit subsidiary of Interact for Health — awarded both Colerain Township and Clermont County, Ohio, $100,000 grants to support (respectively) their QRT operational and development efforts. Both grants were to be paid over 3 years. By March 8, 2017, two other Tristate communities — Lawrenceburg, Indiana and Kenton County, Kentucky – had developed and launched their own versions of the QRT program. In contrast to the Colerain model, Kenton County's QRT – developed by Kenton County Police Department chief Spike Jones and Independence (Ky.) Fire District chief Scott Breeze – was operated by part-time staffers. Unlike Colerain's QRT members, who are full-time employees but also pull normal fire/EMS, police patrol or special tactics team duty, Kenton County's part-time staffers are not responsible for non-QRT duties. Middletown, Ohio, implemented its QRT program in 2016; the city's fire chief, Paul Lolli, reported that 92% of users contacted by the unit had \\"been able to enter treatment,\\" although he acknowledged that the program had not recorded the results experienced by those who entered treatment, rendering the program's efficacy unclear. In June 2017, citing opiate addiction as his community's \\"No. 1 public safety issue,\\" Boone County, Ky., Judge-Executive Gary Moore announced that county's launch of its own Colerain-inspired overdose response team. By July 2017, several other Ohio communities – including Colerain-neighboring Green Township, the cities of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Hamilton, Mansfield, Oxford and Troy, and Logan and Richland Counties – had developed and implemented QRT programs. Summit County developed its QRT in partnership with the non-profit drug abuse education and prevention organization Cover2 Resources, with significant advisory support from Colerain Township's Meloy.The county deployed QRT units in Akron, Barberton, Coventry, Cuyahoga Falls, Green, Hudson, Munroe Falls, Norton, Stow and Tallmadge, under partnership agreements with those communities. Indianapolis and Raleigh had also deployed QRT units as of July 2017. In June 2017, Butler County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery Services received a $660,000 federal grant, funded by provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, to develop a mobile overdose response program in that Southwestern Ohio locality. Also in June 2017, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed into law a state budget that allotted $3 million in grant funding to assist Ohio communities in developing their own QRT or DART programs. The grants were to be administered by the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the initial application period was set to begin in mid-July 2017. In September 2017, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced that QRT/DART development grants had been awarded to 40 Ohio law enforcement agencies and their partner organizations. Hancock County received $87,500 and, by the end of the year, its QRT was operational; Ottawa and Wood Counties also received funding. The Mahoning County Sheriff's Office was awarded a $150,000 grant to develop a county-wide QRT program. The Newton Falls Police Department in Trumbull County and the East Liverpool Police Department in Columbiana County each received $50,000 grants. Tuscarawas County was another of the first communities to receive an Ohio QRT/DART development grant; its sheriff's department was awarded $83,500 to start a county-wide, multi-agency program, which became operational in mid-October 2017. In December 2017, Meloy resigned from his role as Colerain Township administrator to become an addiction services consultant, helping other communities to start their own QRT programs. In late December 2017, Huntington, West Virginia, announced that it had developed and implemented a QRT program based on Colerain's model. The city funded its QRT unit through two, 3-year grants: $300,000 from the US Department of Justice and $1.05 million from the US Department of Health & Human Services. In 2018, following on Huntington's successful QRT implementation, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) awarded an addiction services provider, the Prestera Center, a $263,000 grant to develop a similar overdose intervention program in the Kanawha Valley. DHHR Secretary Bill J. Crouch told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that funding QRTs is \\"essential part of the DHHR's state opioid response plan,\\" adding that his agency's goal was to, \\"expand the effort until there's a QRT in every major city in West Virginia.\\" Also in 2018, Pittsburgh and its surrounding communities began developing their own QRT-inspired, multi-agency response program – the Post Overdose Response Team (POST) — funded in part by the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania via a $150,000 grant from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. The Congress of Neighboring Communities (CONNECT) — a Pitt-based project that develops programs to address problems shared by Pittsburgh and its several dozen suburbs – will supply community medics and has indicated it will hire a peer recovery specialist to staff the team. Police officers will be provided by the city of Pittsburgh. In April 2018, the Morgan County, Oh. Sheriff's Department announced that it would begin participating in a county-wide QRT partnership with Morgan Behavioral Health Choices, Allwell Behavioral Health Choices and the Muskingham Area Mental Health and Recovery Services Board.  Recognition  On June 2, 2017, at its board's annual luncheon, Meloy was presented with the Hamilton County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board's 2017 Leadership Award. In 2017, Meloy was also honored by the Greater Cincinnati chapter of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) for his work in developing Colerain's QRT program. Colerain Township itself received ASPA's Cincinnatus Government Cooperation Award (sponsored by the Cincinnatus Association) for its successful deployment of the QRT model. On June 11, 2018, Mueller and Colerain's Dept. of Fire & EMS accepted the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities' 2018 CARES Award at Ohio's 2018 Opiate Conference. On June 9, 2018, during the United States Conference of Mayors’ 86th Annual Meeting in Boston, the City of Huntington, W.V. and its mayor, Steve Williams, received the City Livability Awards Program \\"Outstanding Achievement\\" honor for the successful deployment of its QRT. First given in 1979, City Livability Awards honor, \\"mayors and their city governments for developing programs that enhance the quality of life in urban areas,\\" and \\"are given annually to ten mayors and their cities,\\" according to the Conference's website.

He is also a co-theme leader in the SurfNet research network and was a past holder of a Canada Research Chair in Next-Generation Groupware. Gutwin is known for his contributions in HCI ranging from the technical aspects of systems architectures, to the design and implementation of interaction techniques, and to social theory as applied to design. Gutwin was papers co- chair at CHI 2011 and was a conference co-chair of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 2010. Education Gutwin has undergraduate degrees in computer science and in English literature. He received his PhD in 1997 from the University of Calgary, where he worked and developed the idea of workspace awareness as a design factor for distributed groupware systems. Research Gutwin's main research areas are in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), groupware usability, interaction techniques, collaboration support, modelling human performance, information visualization and interface design. Along with his students and collaborators, Gutwin has published more than 200 papers in Human Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work. = KEA: Key Phrase Extraction = In 1999, Gutwin developed a key phrase extraction algorithm along with Ian Witten, Gordon Paynter, Eibe Frank, and Craig Nevill-Manning called KEA. Key phrases are important to a document as they provide a brief summary of a document's content and as document collections such as digital libraries become larger, the value of such summary information increases. The goal of the algorithm is to help alleviate the tedious process of assigning key phrases manually. The algorithm uses machine learning, lexical methods, and calculates feature values for each candidate to predict which candidates are good key phrases. = Workspace awareness for groupware = In 2002, Gutwin along with Saul Greenberg, developed a research paper regarding the idea of workspace awareness (the up-to-the-moment understanding of another person's interaction with a shared workspace) and how it can help and improve the usability of a groupware application. The goal of the research was to provide groupware designers a framework about how to design for awareness in multi-user systems, specifically workspace awareness. The developed framework can help educate designers about awareness in groupware and help to improve the quality of the systems that are built. = Group awareness in distributed software development = In 2004, Gutwin, alongside Reagan Penner and Kevin Schneider, evaluated how distributed developers maintain group awareness (where in the code are they working, what are they doing, and what their plans are). The team interviewed developers and reviewed project artifacts and communications from three open source projects. The findings suggested that developers maintain both a general awareness of the entire team and more detailed knowledge of people that they plan to work with. The primary tools for maintaining awareness were mailing lists and chat tools. The study is one of the first to consider how awareness works in the real world. = Tag clouds = In 2008, Gutwin along with Scott Bateman and Miguel Nacenta, explored the popular method of tag clouds which help visualize and link socially-organized information on websites. The goal of the research was to find out which visual features of tags draw the attention of viewers. The study was conducted by asking users to select tags from clouds that manipulated nine visual properties. The results showed that font size and font weight have stronger effects than other features such as intensity and number of characters. However, when several visual properties are changed at once, there is no one property that stands out above the others. The study also makes way for general applications such as the visual presentation of hyperlinks as a way to provide more information to web navigators. = Touch-based interaction = In 2012, Gutwin along with Andy Cockburn and David Ahlstrom, studied the human factors of touch based interactions such as tapping and dragging. The goal of the research was to provide developers a foundational knowledge in this area. The experiment was conducted using three input devices (the finger, stylus, and mouse as a performance baseline) and three different pointing activities which were bidirectional tapping, one-dimensional dragging, and radial dragging (pointing to items arranged in a circle around the cursor). For tapping, the results showed that finger pointing was faster than the stylus/mouse but inaccurate. For dragging, finger input is slower than mouse and stylus. For radial dragging, it was found that task time and movement distance are all linearly correlated with number of items available. Other radial dragging results showed that the stylus is the fastest but had the highest error rate of the three devices. Awards Gutwin was inducted into the ACM CHI Academy for his contributions to HCI research in 2012. In 2015 he was recognized as an ACM Distinguished Researcher.

This boat is a well-known piece of maritime cultural heritage to the Mandarese people in West Sulawesi, Indonesia. Before the use of outboard motors, the Sandeq was one of the dominant means travelling between islands of the archipelago, not only because of its smoothness and speed, but also thanks to its ability to sail close- hauled almost directly against the direction of the wind. The zig-zag technique called beating in English is called \\"Makkarakkayi\\" in the Mandar language. Although Mandarese seafarers have developed many types of boats, both big and small, the Sandeq is the only fully wind-powered vessel that is still commonly used in West Sulawesi today. The two smaller outrigger hulls serve to balance the vessel, which relies on the wind force captured by the triangular sail. The Sandeq can reach speeds of up to . A Sandeq is also able to survive the wind and waves while chasing a herd of tuna. During the fishing season, skippers use Sandeq to trap eggs from a series of coconut leaves and seaweed. The Sandeq can also be used to collect spices from Ternate and Tidore to be delivered to the city of Makassar. Every year, a Sandeq race is held in mid-August. The route from Mamuju, West Sulawesi to Makassar, South Sulawesi covers a distance of .  Type of Sandeq  * Sandeq pangoli: Used to catch fish near the reef edge and in the region where currents meet by dragging lure made of chicken feathers behind the boat (mangoli). This type of boat is very fast and agile and able to reverse its course quickly in order to hunt fish and not hit by coral.Liebner (2002). p.36. * Sandeq parroppo: Used for fishing in rappo/rumpon (FAD) in the open sea; this type of boat is big enough so that (1) it can load two or three canoes that will be unloaded in rumpon to expand the catching area, (2) sailors can carry shipping supplies that last for two to five days, (3) the boat can withstand big waves and strong winds in the open sea. * Sandeq potangnga: Used to sail the high seas to catch fish and searching for flying fish and their eggs. The type of boat is large in order to be able to load provisions and equipment needed in navigating the ocean for two or three weeks, especially sufficient salt to conserve the fish. In order that the high waves that are usually found in fishing areas will not have the chance to disturb and wet the anglers, this type of sandeq often had additional 'platform' that are higher than the hull deck of the boat, mounted at the left and right side, behind the mast.

History The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 devoured around 28 % of the buildings in Copenhagen. The merchants Hans Henrik Bech (c. 1699 - 1783) and Hans Hansen Berg (1688-1736) proposed a fire insurance scheme and Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring was founded by royal resolution on 26 January 1731. The fire insurance was instrumental in speeding up the rebuilding of the city since lending out money for construction projects became less risky. The first building was insured on 21 December 1731 by Otto Blome at Amagertorv 4. Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring was originally only active in the market for fire insurance of buildings located inside the City Walls but from 1889 it gradually opened up for fire insurances of buildings in Frederiksberg and a number of surrounding districts. The company was based in the Gustmeyer House at Ved Stranden 14 and its last CEO was Frits Pedersen. The company merged with Danmark/Tryg/Fremtiden G/S under the name Tryg Forsikring in 1976.

Early life  Raised Catholic in the Melbourne suburbs of Essendon/Strathmore, Edmonds studied at The University of Melbourne, completing a Bachelor of Arts Degree and Honours in Social Work. Career Beginning her career in comedy at 29 (2010) after working in mental health in rural Australia, Edmonds (nicknamed \\"Eddo\\") uses her suburban background, singing/songwriting and storytelling to create a fearless, self-deprecating and often macabre stand up voice. Humiliation and despair are central themes to Edmonds' comedy, as are stories of teenage mischief, sex, failure, relationships and loneliness. Edmonds has performed extensively at Australian festivals including the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Adelaide Fringe, Brisbane Comedy Festival, Sydney Comedy Festival and toured internationally multiple times to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and to the Soho Theatre, London. Edmonds' solo stand-up shows have received multiple nominations for the Barry Award, an annual prize presented for the most outstanding comedy show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. The comedian is known for her character work, most notably 'Helen Bidou', an emotionally unstable, sarong-wearing, fashion expert who was featured on the ABC hit comedy show Get Krack!n. A full length live performance, \\"Helen Bidou: Enter the Spinnaker Lounge\\" exposed a dark familial relationship with her son 'Connor' (Sam Campbell) and received a Barry Nomination and Sydney Comedy Festival Best Show Award. Other characters created by the comedian include John Watts, Dusty Banjosen and Rebecca, all of which feature on her original ABC show, The Edge of the Bush. Billed as \\"Australia's first Scandi-noir comedy\\", was called \\"bizarre but satisfying\\" by Daily Review. The television show, featuring fellow comedians such as Greg Larson and Damien Power, tells of a callisthenics dynasty which has been torn apart by incest, as a family is forced back into reunion by confronting the truth of what really occurred at the edge of the bush. As well as appearing solo, Edmonds is also a part of a satirical trio called True Australian Patriots, with two fellow comedians, Greg Larsen and Damien Power. A mock- Australian patriots group on Facebook and YouTube, the characters Les, Steve and Gary are portrayed as inarticulate whilst spewing nonsense hate speech. Edmonds comments on the reception to the trio, \\"The real groups are ripe for parody,\\" she says. \\"We get a lot of people who think it's real which is disturbing. Ours is a complete parody but we get people who go 'You guys suck. Stop it', from both sides... Those groups are appalling and we're hoping to show the mis-information that they are spreading. I find that far-right voice in Australia really distressing.\\" Additionally, Edmonds stars and has contributed to Fancy Boy, an Australian six-part sketch comedy television series. Edmonds starred and co-wrote Fancy Boy alongside John Campbell, Stuart Daulman, Henry Stone, Jonathan Schuster and Greg Larsen. Edmonds is one of the voices in the new Australian version of cult US Adult Swim show Fish Centre.Biography at Token Artists token.com.au Edmonds has made guest appearances on All Star Family Feud, Celebrity Name Game, Dirty Laundry Live, The Project, Show Me the Movie!, Have You Been Paying Attention? and Hughesy, We Have a Problem.

The book received negative reviews, accusing Herdt of being biased in his approach and his conclusions. Summary Herdt discusses the culture of the Sambia people. His work is influenced by the philosopher Michel Foucault. Publication history Sambia Sexual Culture was first published in 1999 by the University of Chicago Press. Reception Sambia Sexual Culture received a mixed review from Glenn Petersen in Library Journal, and negative reviews from the anthropologist Jadran Mimica in the Australian Journal of Anthropology and the philosopher James Giles in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. The book was also reviewed by Alexandra A. Brewis in American Anthropologist, Andrew P. Lyons in Anthropologica, and Paul Sillitoe in the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute, and discussed by Nathaniel McConaghy in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Petersen credited Herdt with providing \\"a good deal of theoretical discussion of sexual identity in a cross-cultural framework\\", and with taking \\"great care to relativize the homosexual aspects\\" of the Sambia's ritual practices. However, he criticized Herdt for providing little \\"commentary on the matter of elders taking sexual advantage of children\\", noting that the issue was \\"a topic of considerable immediacy in contemporary America.\\" Mimica considered Herdt's approach to Sambia culture biased. Though she complimented his discussions of topics such as the use of secret flutes in \\"Sambia man-making practices\\", the practice of nose-bleeding, \\"male fears of semen depletion\\", and \\"Sambia semen transactions\\", she found other parts of his work flawed, writing that while they contained interesting information, they were \\"limited by a naive mechanistic-functionalist conceptual framework dependent on uncritically accepted differentiations between 'biological', 'psychological', 'symbolic', 'cultural' and 'social' levels of human existence and ... such pseudo- Aristotelian notions as 'ultimate' and 'proximate' causes\\". She accused him of \\"prevarications and exaggerations about his methodology and data\\", and found his ideas about the Sambia incompletely worked out. She criticized his failure to make a systematic study of the Sambia language or to properly discuss this failure, and argued that despite his use of psychoanalysis and the influence of Foucault on his work, his framework was nevertheless basically \\"positivist\\". She considered him incorrect to describe Sambia culture in terms of categories such as the sacred, the profane, and the supernatural. She concluded that his book was \\"yet another volume in yet another series on the increasingly sterilised and sterilising academic topics of sexuality, gender, and culture.\\" Giles argued that Herdt's view that Sambia boys give up their homosexual desires and acquire heterosexual desires when they become young men conflicts with the conclusion, supported by Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith in Sexual Preference (1981) and John C. Gonsiorek and James D. Weinrich in Homosexuality: Research implications for public health policy (1991), that sexual orientation is set in early childhood. He questioned Herdt's view that Sambia culture determined the sexual desires of Sambia males, and accused Herdt of bias. He criticized Herdt for ignoring nonsexual desires that might motivate Sambia sexual behavior. He argued that the Sambia's sexual rituals are coercive, and that this should \\"make us suspicious of claims that the homosexual activities performed during or as a result of the ritual in any way reflect the participant’s real sexual desires.\\" He criticized Herdt's argument that the \\"bawdy enthusiasm\\" showed by Sambia boys who participate in the rituals shows that their behavior is motivated by erotic desire, noting that \\"child victims of adult or adolescent sexual abuse are often willing, and even enthusiastic, participants in the sexual acts that they are manipulated into performing\\". Though finding Sambia Sexual Culture fascinating, he concluded that Herdt failed to support his main conclusions about Sambia sexual culture. McConaghy criticized Giles for assuming that people are either heterosexual or gay and ignoring the existence of people with both heterosexual and homosexual desires. However, he agreed with Giles that the homosexual behavior of many of the boys may not have been motivated by sexual desire, as well as his criticism of Herdt's idea that culture can implant sexual desires through deep scripting. McConaghy further stated that the distribution of homosexual feelings could be the same in both Sambia and Western culture.

The Western Front was first established on the basis of the administration of the disbanded Northern Front. The Front headquarters were located consequently in Staraya Russa, Molodechno, Dvinsk, Smolensk and Minsk .  Operations  At the time of the formation of the Western Front, Soviet troops were fighting on a front some 2,000 km long, stretching from Murmansk (against the White Northern Army and the Entente interventionists), over the Karelian Isthmus (against Finland), and the Baltics to the Belarussian Front (against Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian formations and Russian White Guards, supported by German and Polish troops). By July 1919, the Soviet Armies of the Western Front had retreated from the Baltic area under the onslaught of the enemy. In Belarus, the Polish offensive was stopped in August on the Berezina River. In August 1919 the Front forces were on the line of the Gulf of Finland-Pskov-Polotsk-Berezina river. In June-August and October-November 1919, the 7th and 15th Armies, supported by the ships of the Baltic Fleet, repelled two offensives of the White Northwestern Army under Yudenich against Petrograd and defeated it, which allowed the concentration of the main efforts of the Red Army in the fight against the armies of Denikin and Kolchak. In 1920, the Western Front became the main front of the Soviet Republic and it participated in repelling the offensive of the Polish Army during the Soviet- Polish War. The May operation (1920) of the Western Front, although it did not achieve its goals, created favorable conditions for a successful counteroffensive of the troops of the South-Western Front in Ukraine. As a result of the July operation (1920) of the Western Front, Belarus and parts of Lithuania were occupied, and in August 1920 the troops of the Western Front approached Warsaw. However, the reassessment by the Soviet command of its forces and the underestimation of the enemy's forces, as well as bad coordination between the Western and South-Western Fronts, led to the defeat of the Soviet troops of the Western Front in the Battle of Warsaw (1920) and their withdrawal. Despite the defeat of the Red Army, Poland didn't continue the War and a truce was signed on 12 October, which enabled the Red Army to concentrate its main forces against Wrangel's troops around the Crimean Peninsula. The Western Front and its administration continued to exist after the end of hostilities, until it was transformed into the Western Military District on April 8, 1924.

Description The covers the Paroo River, Cuttaburra Creek, Sandy Creek, Aarons Creek and Kulkyne Creek, and represent the largest wetland in the state by area. A large proportion, close to , representing 16%, of Nocoleche Nature Reserve is floodplain wetland. Ecosystem Nocoleche Nature Reserve is dominated by mulga and white wood vegetation as well as Poplar box and black box. The Paroo River forms the eastern boundary of the reserve and it is here there is the largest stand of the very rare yapunya is found. Nocoleche Nature Reserve . Large areas of yapunyah (Eucalyptus ochrophloia) woodland can be found on the Paroo and Warrego Rivers and Cuttaburra Creek. Other plant species of conservation significance include the algae Chara braunii, spikegrass (Elytrophorus spicatus), downy mother of misery (Cuphonotus andreanus), chariot wheels (Maireana cheelii), silver turkey bush (Eremophila bowmannii ssp latifolia) and corkbark (Hakea ivoryi). Noclesche is an important stop over for migratory birds. Large mammals include Red kangaroos (Macropus rufus), eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus gigantus), western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus) and common wallaroos (Macropus robustus), which are common throughout the nature reserve. Fish including yellowbelly (Macquaria ambigua), Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii), silver perch (Bidyanus bidyanus) and catfish (Tandanus tandanus) are found in the Paroo river and are much sought after by professional and recreational fishers. Cats, rabbits, goats, and foxes are all pests within the park. Significance > The Paroo River is not yet affected by river regulation and diversions, > making it the last major free-flowing river in the Murray-Darling Basin. > Both the Paroo and Warrego Rivers have extremely high conservation value. Different types of wetlands with distinctive vegetation communities are found within the nature reserve. Plants, waterbirds, frogs, reptiles, fish and many invertebrates rely on these wetlands up and down the Paroo River. > Of the seven different types of wetland identified in the Paroo and Warrego > River catchments, Nocoleche Nature Reserve has claypans, river channels and > waterholes, Eleocharis swamps, lignum swamps and black box swamps. It does > not have large freshwater lakes or salt lakes. Nocoleche Nature Reserve is the only known location in New South Wales of Aponogeton sp. aff. Queenslandicus and the endangered Dentella minutissima. History The traditional owners of the Paroo are the Budjair, Kunja, and Mardgany in the north and the Paruntiji, meaning people belonging to the Paroo, in the south. Aboriginal people are known to have lived along the Paroo for at least 14,000 years (Robins, 1999). Graziers came as squatters to the Paroo in the 1840s. They met resistance from the Aboriginal land owners, and tensions in the area continued well into the 1860s. From the 1850s however a shortage of white labour caused by the exodus to the gold fields saw many in the Aboriginal communities join the pastoral workforce. Aboriginal people continued to be a significant part of this work force for many decades whilst still maintaining their cultural traditions and attending local and regional ceremonies until the 1910s. From the 1920s however, Aboriginal people began to be forcibly removed from their land by government policy. In the 1880s through to the early twentieth century however, drought, severe overstocking and rabbit infestation led to massive damage to land, soil and native plants and animals. Nocoleche station was established some time before 1887 by F.W. Armytage. By the early twentieth century the property was one of four substantial runs leased by Sir Samuel McCaughey on the Darling River. His total holdings were 3.2 million acres where he experimented with a number of farming implements and technologies, including using heavy machinery for ploughing and soil excavation, mechanised sheep shearing and widespread irrigation. The station changed hands eight times between Armytage and when the National Parks and Wildlife Service took ownership in 1978. Heritage To date only seven Aboriginal sites have been formally recorded from Nocoleche Nature Reserve. European buildings that remain include the shearers’ quarters, cooks’ quarters, shearing overseer's cottage, store room, shower room/block, and toilet block.

Formative years  Born in St. Louis, Missouri on May 16, 1876, John M. Tettemer was a son of Hanora Moynihan, a native of County Kerry, Ireland who had emigrated to America with her parents as a child, and Harvey J. Tettemer, a New Jersey native and manufacturer who became \\"the first man to bring shoe machinery west of the Mississippi river,\\" according to historian Walter Barlow Stevens.John M.

Per Tettemer:Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, pp. 4-6. > My parents made a fine combination. My father, Harvey Tettemer, was > Pennsylvania Dutch and Presbyterian. My mother, Nora Moynihan, was County > Kerry Irish Catholic, from Cloughnareeny, a place not important or even > large enough for sophisticated maps of the world to show.... Mother had come > to America with her father and many brothers when she was fourteen years > old.... She was a born story-teller. Her mother was a Connor of County Cork; > telling us tales of Roderick, last high King of Ireland, she made us feel > that it was exciting, but no cause for thinking ourselves better than anyone > else.... The atmosphere of our home was strongly religious.... My first > record of a game is playing priest and hearing my playmates' confessions > through the cane bottom of an overturned chair. The oldest brother, Harvey, > would play at saying Mass and rigged up an altar in the back parlor, with > candles and flowers and such linens as he could beg or remove > surreptitiously from Mother's linen cupboard.... I was his altar boy. My > duty was to swing the censer, made of a tin can containing hot water, which > I replenished whenever the steam (\\"smoke\\") died down. His family experienced a brief period of financial difficulty when competitors to his father's business began operating in St. Louis. As a result, his mother took a job \\"as forewoman of the sewing girls\\" in a factory nearby. In addition, his father was able to obtain an unsecured loan from Morris Levi, a Jewish businessman in St. Louis. Tettemer would later recall that \\"Father used the incident to instill in us some understanding of a people that had experienced harsh tribulations throughout its history, and to lay on us the precept of judging men as individuals and children of God, not accepting ready-made, often prejudiced estimates.\\"Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, pp. 9-10. During his early childhood years, John Tettemer's older sister, Mary, passed away. Sometime around this time, he also developed a speech defect which made it challenging for him \\"to pronounce certain combination of consonants.\\" He later observed that this caused him to be \\"shy and silent,\\" becoming even more so when teased by his siblings and other children. \\"I would listen like a small ghost to a story being told, or would lose myself in some book.\\" His discomforts made him \\"sensitive to emotional appeals, in music, in tales of heroism and pathos, and to beauty in color,\\" and \\"equipped [him] with a spontaneous sympathy for the feelings of others, whether human beings or animals, and with a sense of the utter wrongness of doing anything that may hurt.\\" Although the defect lessened as he entered school, the condition had left its mark. The \\"fear of it ran deep and I became adept at substituting easier words for those which were difficult for me.\\"Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, pp. 10-11, 34. Educated in the parochial schools of St. Louis (St. Bridget's), John Tettemer excelled at grammar and mathematics,Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, p. 11. and was deemed ready for his First Communion by 1885.Los Angeles Times. During summer breaks, he resided on the Montgomery County, Missouri farm of an aunt and uncle \\"about ninety miles from St. Louis,\\" where he \\"rode horseback full-tilt over the countryside,\\" and helped with grain threshing. After completing his schooling at St. Bridget's at the age of 14, he engaged in \\"a supplementary year of English, Latin, algebra, and geometry.\\" His father then helped him obtain a job with the John L. Boland Book & Stationery Company, \\"the largest wholesale bookstore west of Chicago,\\" for which he was paid $15 per month to assist with office work and run errands. After several years in that role, he \\"was promoted to wholesale billing,\\" where he assisted with the company's nationwide invoicing, a job he later noted had honed his powers of concentration. Ultimately, he left that job due to burdensome overtime hours. He then found similar work with the William A. Orr Shoe Company, a firm managed and partly owned by his father.Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, pp. 16-23. While recuperating at home from a cold at the age of 16, his mother gave him several religious books to read, including Alban Butler's The Lives of Saints which, he later said, \\"aroused in [him] a burning desire to do something with [his] own life that would have worth.\\" At this juncture, he began reading only books which were religious in nature, \\"especially longer biographies of the saints,\\" and became increasingly enthralled by the life stories of monks, whom he had come to believe were \\"the only ones who comprehended the true meaning of existence.\\" This, is turn, inspired him to increase his attendance at church services. Sometime around this time, his 19-year-old sister, Nora, with whom he had shared an interest in entering the religious life, fell ill with a severe cold; she died from pneumonia just a few weeks later.Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, pp. 25-26, 34.

John Tettemer later explained his decision:Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk, p. 28. > I chose [the Passionist Order] for two particular reasons.

After decades of religious training and service in one of the most austere branches of his church, he began to suffer health problems, and was ordered by his physician to take time away from his job to rest. During his recuperation, as he reflected on his life's direction, he developed an appreciation for contemplative practice, and when writing his autobiography later in life, described what had happened to him during this time: > My own native mind had had little opportunity to assert itself in the > preceding years, as it had been too occupied with studying and teaching the > ideas of others.... During my 'quiet time,' realizing this, I allowed my > mind total freedom to open to the riddle of the mystery of existence, which > had marked the birth of my philosophic mind at the age of twenty or > thereabouts and always had held a fascination for me in the years > between.... A new faculty of knowing seemed to be born in me, in the quiet > stillness yet intense activity of consciousness within me. I seemed to touch > the heart of reality, the very essence of existence, with a directness, an > immediacy, rendering all my former knowledge false and illusory.Tettemer, > John. I Was a Monk. As a result, he requested release from his church obligations in 1916, a release which was subsequently granted by Rome. After leaving the priesthood, he then embarked on a more traditional journey.Tettemer, John. I Was a Monk.

It has been working since 1250.  History  thumb Drohobych salt plant has been in operation since the 13th century and maybe even earlier on the territory close to sources of raw materials called \\"salt brine\\". The foundation of the salt plant was in 1250, and it is believed that this plant is the oldest working industrial company in Ukraine. During this time, Drohobych was one of the richest cities in the Carpathian region making this important in the history of the last decades in the existence of the Galicia-Volyn principality. Drohobych's growth was caused by the salt manufactory, which provided not only Galician, Transcarpathia but also Volun, Holm, and Kiev regions with salt. In 1339 Drohobych was occupied by Polish seigniors and the Drohobych salt manufactory became the part of the royal property. At that time salt was the most famous good produced in Drohobych. Chumaks from the entire Ukraine (Podillya, Brtislav, and Volun regions) came to Drohobych to purchase salt. Volyn piers (found on the river Sluch and Horyn) were used to load Drohobych salt on the ships (called \\"komyaha\\"), then the salt was transported to Prypyat, and after that it was shipped along Dnipro straight to Kyiv. The towers in Drohobych, Yasenytsya, and other surrounding villages belonged to the king. Peasants were forced to work for the king. The king never visited Drohobych. Rich Italian merchants rented salterns (salt water pools), because they had caravans traveling from Italy through Lviv and Bukovyna to Crimean city Kapha. During the 14th and 15th centuries these merchants were the intendants and the main workers of the saltern in Drohobych. This benefited King and merchants alike. Italians marchants produced high-quality salt, thus greatly expanding trade relations between Drohobych and Europe, however, this brought many conflicts in Drohobych. These conflicts were caused by citizens' opinion that only some people were seeing profit while and others did not. Conflict in 1491, between Italians merchants with Drohobych citizens was resolved with the help of king's decree. The king declared that people have to produce a cart (containing 6000 salt barrels). In the years after this, each citizen entering Drohobych was charged 3 dinnars per cart of either salt or other goods. Money was used to keep the Drohobych city streets in good condition. According to documents dating back to 1768, it is known that the upper layer of the road situated in Zhupna street (which exists today) was made of wood. The territory between the saltern and Zhupna Street was joined by the bridge constructed above the river Pobuk. At that time two wells could be found on the territory of Drohobych saltern: the King's saltern and baron Hartenberg's private saltern. Proceeds from both of these two salters were used to fund Cathedral hospital called \\"The hospital for the poor\\". According to documents from 1565, 26,000 barrels of salt was produced in Drohobych; half of this was produced in King's saltern and other half by private salterns. Nowadays, Drohobych salt is producing two types of salt of the high quality.

Traditional methods for identifying tax havens analyse tax and legal structures for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) tools. However, this approach follows a purely quantitative approach, ignoring any taxation or legal concepts, to instead follow a big data analysis of the ownership chains of 98 million global companies. The technique gives both a method of classification and a method of understanding the relative scale – but not absolute scale – of havens/OFCs. The results were published by the University of Amsterdam's CORPNET Group in 2017, and identified two classifications: * 24 global Sink OFCs: jurisdictions in which a \\"disproportional amount of value disappears from the economic system\\" (i.e. the traditional tax havens). (See the table below for the list of the Sinks) * 5 global Conduit OFCs: jurisdictions \\"through which a disproportional amount of value moves toward sink OFCs\\" (i.e. modern corporate tax havens). (Conduits are: Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Singapore, and Ireland) In 2017, the European Parliament adopted the CORPNET approach into their frameworks for addressing tax havens. In 2018, research by Gabriel Zucman showed that using Orbis database connections specifically underestimates the scale of Ireland, which the Zucman–Tørsløv–Wier 2018 list showed is the largest Conduit OFC in the world. This aside, CORPNET's Conduits and Sinks, reconcile closely with the most noted academic top ten tax haven lists.

The lack of an accepted definition for identifying tax havens (and even offshore financial centres), results in different lists, including: * Academic leaders in tax haven research: Hines (1994, 2007, 2010) Dharmapala (2008, 2009), and Zucman (2015, 2018). * OECD lists: Started with 35 locations in 2000 (none of which were OECD members), but by 2017, only listed Trinidad & Tobago as a tax haven. * IMF OFC lists: Started with 46 OFCs in June 2000 using qualitative methods; refined to 22 OFCs in April 2007 using purely quantitive methods; listed the 8 major OFCs in 2018 who handle 85% of all flows; by 2010, the tax academics considered OFCs as synonymous with tax havens. * Oxfam lists: Focus on legal corporate tax avoidance, and ranked OECD members Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg in their top 10. * ITEP lists: Focus on offshore structures of US S&P500; firms, and list the Netherlands, Ireland, the Caribbean, and Luxembourg in their top 5. There are \\"traditional\\" tax havens common on all these lists (e.g. some Caribbean and Channel Islands locations), which some global regulators have either blacklisted, or have issued formal warnings/threat of sanctions against, unless transparency is increased. However, a key difference between the lists regards the major OECD and EU tax havens (or offshore financial centres), such as Switzerland, Ireland the Netherlands and Luxembourg (amongst others). Major regulators like the EU and the OECD don't regard OECD or EU countries as tax havens, and point to their transparency and compliance with international regulations. Academic leaders in tax haven research, and other non–governmental organizations, point to the role of OECD and EU tax havens in tax avoidance from base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) schemes, like the Double Irish, the Single Malt and the Dutch Sandwich. They regard them as major tax havens in their definitions of tax havens. CORPNET Report \\"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers\\": Example of a corporate global ownership chain. A report published in Nature in 2017 on the analysis of offshore financial centres called: \\"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers: Conduits and Sinks in the Global Corporate Ownership Network\\", provided a quantitative and scientific approach to the classification of tax havens. The report was the result of a multi-year investigation by political economists and computer scientists in the CORPNET research group at the University of Amsterdam. CORPNET is a European Research Council funded group at the University of Amsterdam investigating networks of corporate control. The report used the Moody's Orbis corporate database, to examine 98 million global companies and their 71 million ownership connections (using big data computer modelling) to identify 5 global Conduit OFCs (Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland). These are countries of high financial reputation (i.e. not formally labelled \\"tax havens\\" by OECD/EU), but who have \\"advanced\\" legal and tax structuring vehicles (and SPVs) that help legally route funds to the 24 tax havens (called Sink OFCs), without incurring tax in the Conduit OFC (or even tax in the source of funds location, where royalty payment schemes can be used). The work built on methods established in the \\"Offshore–Intensity Ratio\\", and in particular the understanding \\"activity\\" relative to the \\"scale\\" of the domestic economy in a country. At its crudest level, the Offshore-Intensity Ratio explains why the countries at the top of global GDP per capita lists are mostly tax havens. The EU Parliament's Policy Department on Economic and Scientific Policies included the research in its findings for the EU Committee on Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA), and by tabulating against existing EU–IMF–FSI list of tax havens, showed material gaps in EU understanding of conduits. CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks are 9 of the 10 largest tax havens identified in 2010 by one of the academic founders of tax haven research, James R. Hines Jr.. Hines' 2010 list of 10 major tax havens only differs in its omission of the U.K., which in 2010, had only just reformed its corporate tax system. CORPNET's top 5 Conduits and top 5 Sinks closely reconcile with the top 10 major corporate tax havens of other major academic and non–governmental organisation tax haven lists. Other tax academics have incorporated the research into their understanding of tax havens. Conduit OFC Global Innovation Property Centre (GIPC) Legal Systems League Table: Patents Sub-Category. Conduit OFCs are described as having advanced legal and tax systems designed to enable corporations to route funds from high tax locations (e.g. Germany) to the Sink OFCs (e.g. Bermuda). They tend to have attractive \\"holding company\\" regimes (e.g. no withholding taxes, foreign dividends exempt from taxes, capital gains reliefs, full double–tax relief), advanced tax treatment of intellectual property regimes, and large global networks of bilateral tax treaties. For example, CORPNET's five major Conduit OFCs, all have a top–ten ranking in the 2018 Global Innovation Property Centre (GIPC) IP Index. IP has been described as the \\"raw materials of corporate tax avoidance\\", and \\"the leading corporate tax avoidance vehicle\\". Conduit OFCs are shown to be dominated by major law firms and global accounting firms, who create the lawfully constructed special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and BEPS tools that make the connections with the Sink OFCs, by exploiting legislative loopholes such as the Double Irish and Dutch Sandwich. They advise clients on anticipating future changes (e.g. from OECD BEPS processes), that may need new loopholes (e.g. the Single malt arrangement). Other researchers into tax havens have written that professional service firms in the major OECD and EU tax havens write most of their State's relevant taxation and SPV-related legislation, so that they can create and protect loopholes, and refer to such jurisdictions as being a \\"captured\\" by their financial services industry. The legal and tax structuring undertaken by Conduit OFCs is considered beyond the trust–structuring type work of the traditional tax haven \\"offshore magic circle\\" law firms. Conduit OFCs need structures that can integrate with bilateral tax treaties involving G20 countries, as well as meeting U.S. GAAP / SEC Regulations that U.S. multinationals, one of the largest users of Conduit OFCs, need to adhere to. CORPNET's top 5 global Conduit OFCs channel 47% of corporate offshore connections and include the following: Sink OFC \\"Uncovering Offshore Financial Centers\\": List of Sink OFCs ordered by value (showing U.K. dependencies). Sink OFCs cover a broad range of locations from very small countries (e.g. the Marshall Islands), to major global financial centres (e.g. Hong Kong). Just because funds reach a Sink OFC, does not mean that they remain dormant. Quite the contrary, the funds can be invested in assets all over the world, but their legal ownership and future gains remain in the Sink OFC. For example, the circa US$1 trillion of US company offshore cash is held in Sink OFCs (esp. the Caribbean). The report highlighted some interesting aspects of the 24 Sink OFCs: OECD failings CORPNET highlighted the lack of progress the OECD's Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project was making, and that the OECD's support of transparent intellectual property–based tax structuring (or \\"patent boxes\\" and \\"knowledge boxes\\"), is incompatible with the emerging position of intellectual property as the leading BEPS tool in conduit OFCs. The reasons for this failure are discussed in failure of OECD BEPS Project. An example of an IP–based BEPS tool is Ireland's Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets (CAIA) tool, also known as the \\"Green Jersey\\", which has an effective tax rate of 0–2.5%. Apple used the CAIA (or Green Jersey) BEPS tool in Q1 2015, resulting in the \\"leprechaun economics\\" restatement of Irish GDP by 34.4 percent. Ireland has other IP–based BEPS tools (Ireland as the first OECD nexus-compliant KDB), and is a supporter of the OECD BEPS project (see box). Isle of Man omitted The Isle of Man (the \\"IOM\\") was absent from the list of top Sink OFCs. The IOM appears on tax–haven lists and ranks 42 on the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index. The Chief Minister of the IOM, Howard Quayle, announced that the CORPNET report proved that the IOM is not a tax haven. However, CORPNET researchers from the University of Amsterdam directly replied to Howard Quayle's article clarifying that while the IOM does not appear as a leading Sink OFC for corporate tax avoidance, it does not mean that individuals (personal bank accounts and trusts) do not use the IOM to avoid taxes, and particularly United Kingdom VAT. Other commentators have added that the IOM is \\"failing as a tax haven\\", and is now too small to appear in major studies like the CORPNET research.  Ireland underestimated  The CORPNET report used legal corporate connections on the Orbis database, rather than the actual \\"quantum\\" of money, as its primary metric of analysis. In theory, the authors felt that this does not impede the goal of classification, and of making relative rankings. However, it does mean the \\"monetary amount\\" of potential tax avoidance was not calculated. The acclaimed tax haven academic and author of The Hidden Wealth of Nations, Gabriel Zucman, used a different quantitative approach. Zucman focused on macro–data of national statistical accounts. In theory, the total assets in a system should equal the total liabilities. By aggregating national account data, Zucman identified an excess of liabilities over assets, implying that the missing assets (to balance the equation), are hidden in tax–havens. On this basis, in 2015, he estimated that 8% of the world's wealth (or US$7.6 trillion) was \\"missing\\" in offshore tax–havens. Zucman's analysis highlighted the special case of Ireland and why the Orbis database underestimates Ireland's scale as one of the world's largest corporate tax avoidance, or BEPS, hubs. In 2018, Zucman (et alia) showed that many of Ireland's U.S. multinationals don't appear on Orbis (e.g. Facebook), or only have a small fraction of their data on Orbis (e.g. Google and Apple). Analysed using \\"quantum of funds\\" (not \\"Orbis connections\\"), Zucman showed Ireland is one of the largest corporate tax shelters in the world, and a route for Zucman's estimated loss of 20% in EU corporate tax revenues annually.

IDA ICE is a simulation application for the multi-zonal and dynamic study of indoor climate phenomenas as well as energy use. The implemented models are state of the art, many studies show that simulation results and measured data compare well.  User interface  The user interface of IDA ICE makes it easy to create simple cases but also offers the flexibility to go into detail of advanced studies. Many inputs are adaptable to local requirements such as climate data, material data, system components or result reports. IDA ICE provides a 3D environment for geometry modeling, the table-based input of boundary conditions provide good visual feedback and enables efficient quality check. A simple procedure for calculating and reporting cooling, heating, air demand, and energy, together with a built-in version handling system, makes it efficient to compare different systems and results. Advanced daylight calculation are achieved by interfacing the Radiance lighting simulation tool with result visualization in the 3D environment. A module for Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 is available, this is used for example in LEED and BREEAM. The integrated radiosity method with single reflexion and one measuring point can be used for whole-year daylight analysis and allows modeling daylight-based control strategies (e.g. shading devices, artificial lightening). There is also the \\"Early Stage Building Optimization\\" (ESBO) user interface which makes it possible for users to experiment with variations in both buildings and systems at an early stage with a minimum of user input. A full range of component models for renewable energy studies is available, with boreholes, stratified tanks, heat pumps, solar collectors, CHP, PV, wind turbines, etc. An interface with OpenFOAM for detailed CFD studies is in development.  Strengths  IDA ICE can be used for complete energy and design studies, involving the envelope, systems, plant and control strategies. The equation-based approach enables solving more complex mathematical problems than software using imperative programming languages. The IDA ICE model library is open source, the model equations can be viewed and adapted, every variable in the whole system can be logged. The flexible architecture of the software makes it easy to develop the software continuously to adapt it to local requirements and languages, and to expand it with new capabilities. Additional features like parametric simulation runs and visual scripting support decision making in a parametric design process. The coupling with optimization engines like GenOpt is available directly in the program. The big advantage compared to other BPS software is the coupled simulation of building envelope, systems and controls. IDA ICE library components are either written in the Neutral Model Format (NMF) or Modelica.Sahlin, P. and Sowell, E.F. (1989). A neutral format for building simulation models, Proceedings of the Second International IBPSA Conference, Vancouver, BC, Canada, pp. 147-154, http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS1989/BS89_147_154.pdf The software is fully scriptable with Common LISP. The IDA general purpose solver comes with a variable timestep, which guarantees that no event in the system will be missed.  Input  IDA ICE supports IFC BIM models generated by tools such as ArchiCAD, Revit, MagiCAD, and others. Geometry an shading on site can also be imported from SketchUp, Rhino or other geometry tools. Solar influx is evaluated through windows (also internal) with full 3D accounting for the local shading situation. Additionally it has an integrated geometry editor where building and zone geometry can be modeled with 2D architectural drawings or pictures serving as template. Climate files like EnergyPlus weather files (EPW) or ASHRAE climate files, can be downloaded and installed. The table- based input structure allows full interoperability with MS Excel and comparable software. Modern features like copy and paste and Drag&drop; combined with visual input data check make input data management easier.  Output  IDA ICE output include tables, charts, reports and plots. 3D visualizations (both stills and animations) show geometry, solar shadings, color coded input data as well as results. Arrow animations in 3D visualize ventilation air flows, window energy balance, and wind driven flows. There are special reports for LEED submittal forms included. The diagram plots deliver vector graphics which allows detailed result analysis in custom reports. Results can be exported to Microsoft Word or Excel. A single zone IDA ICE model with default systems comprises a total of approximately 2 000 time dependent variables, any of which may be plotted. Predfined output files and reports cover * Zone heat and energy balances: solar radiation, occupants, equipment, lights, mechanical ventilation, heating and cooling devices, air leakage, heat bridge losses and surface transmission * Control signals: window opening and shading, signals for secondary and primary systems * Building occupancy: for each zone or the whole building * Heat and mass transfer: detailed heat fluxes of surfaces and air streams * Indoor air quality: CO2-content of indoor air and moisture levels, air change rate * Comfort indices: operative temperature, surface temperatures, PPD and PMV, unmet load hours, EN15251 comfort results and daylight availability * Energy demand: total energy separated by application, including energy costs based on time- dependent prices, primary energy results and CO2 emission  References  Category:Solar architecture Category:Building engineering software Category:Simulation software ","title":"IDA Indoor Climate and Energy"},{"id":"57009377","text":"use both this parameter and birth_date to display the person's date of birth, date of death, and age at death) -->  death_place =  death_cause =  body_discovered =  resting_place =  resting_place_coordinates =  burial_place =  burial_coordinates =  monuments =  nationality = Israeli  other_names =  siglum =  citizenship =  education =  alma_mater = *Hebrew University of Jerusalem (BA in romance languages and general history, 1978) *University of California, Berkeley (PhD in modern US history, 1986)  occupation =  years_active =  era =  employer =  organization =  agent =  known_for = 11th President of the University of Haifa  notable_works =  style =  home_town =  net_worth =  height =  television =  title =  term =  predecessor =  successor =  party =  movement =  opponents =  boards =  criminal_charges =  criminal_penalty =  criminal_status =  spouse =  partner =  children =  parents =  mother =  father =  relatives =  family =  callsign =  awards =  website =  module =  module2 =  module3 =  module4 =  module5 =  module6 =  signature =  signature_size =  signature_alt =  footnotes = }} Ron Theodore Robin (רון רובין; born April 23, 1951) is an Israeli scholar whose research focuses on the interface between culture and foreign policy in the United States. He is a senior faculty member at the University of Haifa, as well as a Professor Emeritus at New York University (NYU). Currently Robin serves as the 11th President of the University of Haifa.  Career  Robin was born in 1951 in Tel Aviv to Shani (Rozin), a Jerusalem-born scion of the Shaltiel family, and to Eli, a South African citizen who served as a volunteer in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Robin grew up in South Africa and returned with his family to Israel when he was 13 years old. He joined the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in 1969. He served in the intelligence community, and was discharged with the rank of major. In 1978, he was awarded a BA in romance languages and general history from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1986 he was granted a PhD in modern US history from the University of California, Berkeley. His thesis was entitled: \\"Signs of Change: urban iconographies in San Francisco, 1880-1915\\". In 1986, Robin returned to Israel and was admitted as a faculty member at the University of Haifa. Robin served as professor in the Department of Communications and the Department of General History and in 2000 was appointed Dean of Students, a position he held for five years. In 2006, Robin moved to New York University, where he was appointed a professor in the Department of Media, Culture and Communications, and in 2007 was appointed Associate Dean at the NYU Steinhardt School. In 2008, Robin was appointed Senior Vice Provost, New York University, and was responsible for the establishment of the two NYU international campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai. Robin's main role was to recruit faculty members for the new campuses. In 2016 Robin was elected as the 11th president of the University of Haifa, and in October 2016 he assumed this role. Upon taking office, Robin conceived the program of transforming the University of Haifa into the first Multiversity in Israel- a university with multiple campuses and research portals. In accordance with the program, the central campus on Mount Carmel will be complemented by other portals, specializing in strategic research and multidisciplinary cooperation. In order to implement the program, Robin initiated the integration of Braude Engineering College in Carmiel. The ultimate goal is to transform Braude into the university's Faculty of Engineering. He initiated a similar process with the WIZO Academic Center in Haifa, the objective being to create a new Faculty of Architecture and Design. In addition, an agreement was signed with the Rambam Health Care Campus for the joint establishment of \\"the Helmsley Medical Discovery Tower\\", a 20-story building with a cost of 400 million Israeli shekels (ILS), to be built at the Rambam campus. The center will integrate the research and medical activities of Rambam physicians and University faculty members in the fields of natural sciences, welfare and health, psychology, and more. During 2017, Robin accompanied Benjamin Netanyahu on a mission to China, where he signed an agreement, on behalf of the University, with the CASIA institution of Automation, for the establishment of a research center in the field of artificial intelligence.  Academic expertise  In contrast to the mainstream of modern American historians, who separate cultural history from diplomatic history, Robin's work combines the two currents, claiming that it is impossible to understand the foreign relations of the United States without understanding domestic cultural shifts. In his research, Robin describes US foreign policy in the 21st century as being \\"captive of the past\\", prisoners of an illusory perception, that the United States is under the same threats that cofounded the twentieth century. He describes the second Gulf War in 2003 as stemming from the perception of senior US officials that \\"another Pearl Harbor has to be avoided\\" - even though the cases of Iraq and Pearl Harbor are not at all similar. In his latest book, The Cold World They Made, published by Harvard University Press, Robin claims that US foreign policy in the 21st century is a reproduction of the foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s, when the nation labored under the threat of the Soviet atomic bomb. This policy, he argues, continued without distinction between presidents, parties, or political leanings and is still valid today.  Personal life  Robin is married to Levia (Livi) Wolf, and the couple has four children.

Education and career  During Caspers was born in Amsterdam in 1934. She studied both Mesopotamian and South Asian archaeology at the University of Amsterdam, graduating with an MA in Sumerian and prehistoric archaeology in 1962. She then went on to the Institute of Archaeology in London, where she completed her PhD in 1969. Her thesis, supervised by Seton Lloyd, was on maritime trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley in prehistory. In 1973, after spending several years working in the manuscript room of the University of Amsterdam library, During Caspers was appointed a lecturer at the Kern Institute of Indology at Leiden University. She remained at Leiden for the remainder of her career, taking a position at its newly-founded department of archaeology in 1986. She was the editor of the Annual Bibliography of Indian Archaeology (ABIA) for the years 1967–1969 and 1970–1972. Suffering from cancer in her later years, During Caspers took early retirement in 1995. She began working on deciphering the Indus script, but the project she assembled was cut short by her death from heart failure in 1996.  Fieldwork  During Caspers actively participated in fieldwork throughout her career. In 1966, she met Beatrice de Cardi, who was planning an expedition to Bampur in southwestern Iran. de Cardi invited During Caspers to join her small team as they attempted to relocate and re-excavate sites discovered by Aurel Stein in the 1930s. According to de Cardi's account, During Caspers' six-week stay was eventful. The team encountered outbreaks of both cholera and typhoid fever, and were stranded by car failures or fear of wolves on multiple occasions. During Caspers also received news of her father's death part way through the expedition, but stayed to help finish the work anyway. Just before she left the country, an Armenian workman who had become enamoured of During Caspers proposed to her, and had to be restrained from breaking down her hotel room door when she declined. Despite this \\"somewhat inconsiderate introduction to expedition life\\", During Caspers returned to Iran in 1970, joining C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky's excavations at Tepe Yahya. Her introduction to Arabian archaeology came in 1975, when she joined Michael Roaf's expedition to al- Markh in Bahrain. In 1976, she organised her own expedition to Pakistan, where she and J. C. M. H. Moloney conducted an extensive photographic survey of major sites and museum collections. In the late 1970s she also planned excavations at Saar in Bahrain, but was unable to raise the funds. She returned the Gulf a final time in 1994, joining Jocelyn and Jeffrey Orchard's Hajar Project. At the time of her death, she was planning to follow this up with her own excavations at Wadi Bahla.

The parish has a Köppen climate classification of BWh (Hot desert) (direct: Final Revised Paper). BOM. However, the Paroo River at this point has a number of wetlands, which makes the parish somewhat of an oasis in the otherwise arid landscape. History The traditional owners of the Paroo River area are the Budjair, Kunja and Mardgany in the north and the Paruntiji, meaning people belonging to the Paroo, in the south. Aboriginal people are known to have lived along the Paroo for at least 14,000 years (Robins, 1999). The Burke and Wills expedition were the first Europeans to the area, passing a few miles to the west. > Graziers came as squatters to the Paroo in the 1840s. They met resistance > from the Aboriginal land owners, and tensions in the area continued well > into the 1860s. From the 1850s however a shortage of white labour caused by > the exodus to the gold fields saw many in the Aboriginal communities join > the pastoral workforce. Aboriginal people continued to be a significant part > of this work force for many decades whilst still maintaining their cultural > traditions and attending local and regional ceremonies until the 1910s. From > the 1920s however, Aboriginal people began to be forcibly removed from their > land by government policy. From the 1880s to the 1910 drought, overstocking and rabbit infestation led to massive damage to land, soil and native plants and animals. In 1978 the parish was incorporated into the Nocoleche Nature Reserve. These Paroo River Wetlands are today an important site under the Ramsar Convention.

It is now practiced in a number of countries, primarily for the making of jewellery and decorative sword fittings, but also for material for hollowware and sculpture. Importantly, the same process operates differently on different metals so that a piece with multiple components can be treated in one patination session, developing a range of colours. Etymology All forms of the name refer to the nature of the patination process in Japanese, as this was an exclusively Japanese technique. Ni-iro refers to boiling or broiling, and colour (iro), as the patination is performed by heating the metal to be treated in a special liquid or solution (eki). Ni-age also refers to boiling. Chaku-shoku refers to colouring. Process =Formulation= The colouring and finishing of irogane surfaces generally involves polishing and cleaning, followed by the active chemical patination, and often further includes some waxing or other final treatment. A small range of chemical components are used in the process, with various of recipes for their combination; all traditional formulae include the compound called rokusho (緑青) but at least one modern formula omits rokusho as a distinct ingredient. Sample formulae include: *rokusho 11.25g, copper sulphate 5.63g, water 1.8l *rokusho 5.63g, copper sulphate 5.63g, water 1.8l *rokusho 5.63g, copper sulphate 5.63g, borax 0.375g, water 1.8l *rokusho 3.75g, copper sulphate 3g, vinegar 1cm3, water 1.8l *rokusho 3.75g, copper sulphate 3g, alum 1.13g, water 1.8l *rokusho 3.75g, copper sulphate 3g, alum 0.375g, water 1.8 l *rokusho 3g, copper sulphate 3g, water 1l *copper sulphate 5g, copper acetate 2.65g, 0.65g sodium chloride, water 1l Notably, O Dubhghaill concluded after a study that common salt aided the effectiveness of the formula, while plum vinegar, often mentioned as an additive, he found to be unhelpful. =Preparation= Cleaning is vital for both quality and predictability of the process. At the end of the preparatory phase, a piece to be coloured will also often be scrubbed with, or dipped in material from, a daikon radish. The precise contribution of the radish is still under study. =Boiling= The actual boiling in solution is usually done in a copper container, with the piece to be coloured suspended in some way, for example in a bamboo basket. The final colour can depend on the duration of the boiling period - suaka, for example, may advance from a light brown after 2-4 hours, to orange-brown after 6 hours, to red towards 10 hours. =Finishing= After the core patination process, a piece may, optionally, be washed in cold water, dried, and then coated with a light wax, or in modern times, a sprayed resin. Colour range Colours developed through the niiro process include: *on refined copper (suaka): light orange to dark red, depending on duration of boiling *on shakudo: lustrous purple to violet black, or a shade of purple (some shades are described as \\"like dark grapes\\"). Variations include shi-kin or kurasaki-kin, \\"purple gold,\\" and u-kin, \\"cormorant gold,\\"London, 1915: The Transactions of the Japan Society, vol. XIII: \\"Metals and Metal-working of Old Japan\\" as presented by Prof. Wm. Gowland, A.R.S.M., F.R.C, F.I.C., F.S.A. or \\"karasu-kin.\\" *on shibuichi: silvery, grey, olive brown *on kuromido: dark coppery-black *on sentoku: yellow to brown The material known as yamagane (\\"mountain metal\\"), naturally occurring copper with impurities, produces a wide range of colours, depending on its precise composition. Study Some analysis of treated surfaces done in an attempt to understand the topic further, with considerable but still partial success. Researchers, some of whom also have a craft background, have also explored ways to make the process more predictable, and / or simpler, and at least one patent has been filed in this area. Murakami, Giumlia-Mair, O Dubhghaill and Jones, and Kawasaki are some of the scholars in this area, with O Dubhghaill (also a metalworker) and Jones, and Kawasaki, also working on \\"new\\" methods. Practitioners In Japan, certain workshops and a range of craft workers actively use niiro techniques. Techniques are passed down in craft circles, represented by trade bodies, and within at least one major university, the Tokyo University of the Arts, often known as \\"Geidai,\\" the metalwork department of which preserves formulae and techniques. In the West, craftspeople actively using niiro include Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill. Effects The traditional patination methods have little or no effect on silver and gold elements, allowing for interesting effects. Other effects are created by cutting through layers of patination to let underlying surfaces show through partly. History The method has existed for at least 600 years but if some of the alleged origin timings for shakudo are valid, then, since niiro is intrinsically linked to the production of that patinated alloy, its history may extend over 1200 years. The details of the processes and especially the compositions of the materials used to bathe the metals, are passed on within Japanese craft circles, and not widely documented, though some information was written down from the middle of the Edo period, and published more generally, in Japanese, in the early 20th century. Attention to niiro and the irogane metals it produces came to the West in the late 19th century, in a period when the metalcrafts of Japan were in decline due to changes in tastes.

History The chief designer of the Aprilia racing division, Jan Witteveen , made some comparative calculations between the cornering performance obtained in the MotoGP from the 500 and 250cc bikes and he found that the latter managed to get less travel time than the bikes of the premier class thanks to the greater speed allowed by their chassis. Therefore he thought that if a 250 had a more powerful engine available to recover the disadvantage in acceleration and top speed along the straights, he would also have had the opportunity to compete against the bikes of the upper class. With the weight advantage guaranteed by the regulation (105 kg minimum weight for the two-cylinder and 130 kg for the four cylinders), here the Dutch engineer went to work to prove on the field the goodness of his theory. Initially the RSW-2 500 was a larger version of the motorcycle used by the Noale team in the 250 class (the Aprilia RSV 250), whose capacity was initially brought to 410 cm³; towards the end of the 1996 season it was raised to 430 cm³, then in the middle of the 1997 season it was again raised to 460 cm³. The bike was ridden by Doriano Romboni. In 1998, the bike was not deployed because of the study of a custom engine, which allowed Aprilia to return in 1999 with a 500 cm³ engine ridden by Tetsuya Harada, with the RAVE valve to control the electronically controlled exhaust. In 2000 the Aprilia brought two bikes on the grid, led by Harada (nº 31) and Jeremy McWilliams (nº 99). This last evolution had an inclined aluminum double beam frame, a 42 mm upside-down Öhlins fork and APS progressive system with an Öhlins shock absorber on a carbon swingarm, in which both suspensions were fully adjustable. The braking system was equipped with a double carbon disc at the front and a single 190 mm steel disc at the rear and the wheel rims were made of magnesium alloy. The RSW-2 500 was not very successful in the premier class; although it was a very agile motorcycle (with a total weight of 110 kg, similar to the Honda NSR500, against the 130 kg of the 4 cylinders), it never managed to compete seriously with the 4 cylinders. The bike had a power of about 140 horsepower at 11,500 rpm, compared to the 200 hp of the 4 cylinders; the last models produced were equipped with an injector for indirect injection. In 2000, Aprilia decided to pull out of the 500cc class. In the 7 years of the RSW-2 500 project, the bike managed to gain 5 podiums and 2 fastest laps, the last of which came in the 2000 British motorcycle Grand Prix. After the closure of the RSW-2 500 project, Aprilia re-appeared in the premier class in 2002 with the introduction of the MotoGP class (which had replaced the 500cc class), with the new Aprilia RS Cube.

It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean. Description Trachyrincus scabrus has a large head which measures a quarter to a thirds of the length of the body and which has along, pointed snout with a ridge on side which extends posteriorly to the operculum, The mouth lies beneath the snout and the large eye has a diameter of 24-29% of the head length. The anterior dorsal fin has 11-12 fin rays, the posterior begins just behind the anterior and is much longer than the anal fin. The pectoral fin has 20-22 fin rays and the pelvic fin has 7 fin rays, although it may infrequently it has 6. It has spiny scales which are enlarged along dorsal and ventral profiles, 23-42 such scales sit dorsally behind a vertical line from the anus, but there are none ventrally before the anus. They are greyish-brown in colour. It grows to over 50 cm in total length. left Distribution The roughsnout grenadier occurs in the eastern Atlantic from the continental slope off western Ireland south to Namibia, including the waters off the Azores and the Cape Verde Islands. In the Mediterranean Sea it is known from the waters around Spain and Morocco, the Ligurian Sea and the seas around Greece. Habitat and biology Trachyrincus scabrus is a bathydemersal, non-migratory fish which occurs at depths which range from 400m to 1,700m over soft substrates. Its main food is pelagic copepods but also takes mysids, shrimps, cephalopods, fish, polychaetes and gastropods. This species spawns in winter, during February and March in the Mediterranean. The maximum recorded age of species is 10 year, the specimen being collected in the Ionian Sea. Fisheries T. scabrus is taken as bycatch throughout its range but it is usually utilised to make fishmeal and oil. International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has advised that for the years 2016–2020 there should be no directed fisheries effort for this species and that any bycatch should be counted against the total allowable catch so that any potential misreporting through misidentification is minimised. In most years landings were negligible and in the only year ICES had statistics, 2012, 57 tonnes were landed in the whole of the north-east Atlantic.

Background  During World War I, the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic Sea played a strategical role in naval warfare and was target of the German offensive during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion. During World War II, after the first weeks of quick German advance alongside the Baltic coast, the Soviet Navy begun operations to clear enemy mines, lay own defensive minefields and dispatching warships (including destroyers) into the Irben Straits to harass German naval shipping to supply their forces by sea. The Soviet Navy in the Baltic Sea at the time was under command of Admiral Vladimir F. Tributs. German commander of the Baltic operations was Hubert Schmundt; who, differently from the Soviets, could only commit lighter naval units including S-boats.  June Operations  Both sides laid extensive fields of mines in the Irben Straits: German operations begun on 21 June 1941 (mines laid by S-boats) and others were laid on the next days; such mines caused early damage to the light cruiser and the destroyer two days later in the Irben Straits, while her sister ship was sunk. On 24 June it was Soviets turn to lay mines in the Irben Straits and this was accomplished by the destroyers , and , supported by the light cruiser and the destroyers , , and : over 500 mines were laid in the next two nights. Soviet mines caused the loss of German S-boats S-43 and S-106 on 26 June, the following day other losses were suffered with the sinking of minesweeper R-205 and damage to M-201, R-202, R-203, R-53 and R-63. A S-boat surrendering in 1945 The first direct clash between the opposing forces occurred on 27 June, when German S-boats S-31 and S-59 torpedoed and damaged, with heavy casualties, Storozhevoy. The ship did not sunk despite losing her entire bow up to the (nautical) and returned to service after extensive repairs only on 19 September 1943, while the destroyer was torpedoed by S-54 and later scuttled by the Soviet motor torpedo boat n°73.http://www.navypedia.org/ships/russia/ru_dd_storozhevoy.htm STOROZHEVOY destroyers (project 7U) (1940-1942) navypedia.org  July Operations  Soviet destroyers Serdity and Silny had a surface engagement, on 6 July near Kolka during a minelaying mission, with the German minesweeper M-31 and the larger support-ship MRS-11/Osnabruck: despite enjoying absolute superiority. Soviet ships failed to hit the enemy and Silny received a direct hit from the minesweeper (suffering four dead). Soviet naval units attempted a first attack on a German convoy (Riga was in German hands since 3 July) on 9 July but the attack, carried out by four MO-4 class patrol boats against a group of 6 motorboats with 4 logging ships, was unsuccessful. In July Soviet mines kept on causing damages to minor German units in the Irben Straits: the minesweeper M-201 sunk and M-23 was beached, but both were later salvaged while M-3131 was lost. New Soviet mines were laid by destroyers Serdity and Silny, covered by Stoiky, Grozyashchy and Smetlivy. However Strashny suffered heavy damage by mine on 9 July. On 13 July a coordinated attack of Soviet aircraft and motor torpedo boats managed to sink a German transport and damage 2 barges and 23 minor barges off Riga. Another mixed attack was carried out on 26 July when a plane sank the German minesweeper R-169. Soviet destroyers suffered their third loss when Serdity was hit on 18 July by Ju-88 bombers of Kampfgruppe 806: the ship was scuttled on 22 July after failed attempts to move her.  August Operations  At the beginning of August, Germans were still laying mines in the Irben Straits. On 1 August, Soviet motor torpedo boats attempted an attack, covered by two destroyers, against S-boats off Cape Domesnas but they only lost the motor torpedo boat TK-122 in the process. Between 6 and 8 August, the destroyers and shelled German coastal artillery batteries in the Moon Sound. On 17 August however, four Soviet motor torpedo boats attacked off Cape Domesnas again; and during the engagement the German minesweeper M-1707 Lunenburg was first shelled by Soviet ground artillery and then strayed into mines and sank. Destroyer Stalin, sister-ship of Artem Three days laters Germans retaliated when S-58 torpedoed and sank the Soviet minesweeper T-51 Pirmunas in the Moon Sound. The final Soviet destroyer action occurred on 21 August when the destroyers and Surovy made an unsuccessful attack against a convoy: they managed to force the only escort unit, the auxiliary gunboat SAT-1 Ost, to run aground (later recovered) but this prevented damages to the convoy.  Aftermath  The campaign reached its peak with the fall of Riga on 3 July 1941: Soviet destroyers attacked German convoys of barges and small merchants, but failed to stop this traffic and lost three destroyers in the process. While the Soviet units retreated to Tallinn, the Germans completed swept the Soviet defensive minefields.

Under it, Britain was to recognize the Native Americans as subjects of the Crown, and defend them and their territory from the United States. The treaty was the product of a March 10, 1815 meeting at Nicolls' Outpost, a small fortification built by Colonel Edward Nicolls just south of the U.S. (Georgia) border (in modern Chattahoochee, Florida). Attending, besides Nicolls, were four other British officers, Capt. George Woodbine, Capt. Joseph Ross, Henry Ross, and William Hambly, about to depart after the conclusion of the War of 1812 in early 1815. Representing the Native Americans were Neamathla, Francis the Prophet, Peter McQueen, Thomas Perryman, his son William Perryman, and more than thirty others, the whole of what was about to become a new ethnicity, the Seminoles. In the Treaty the Native Americans promised allegiance to Great Britain, which in turn accepted them as subjects of the British empire. (This is why the Union Jack was raised over the Negro Fort.) The hope was that Britain would provide them with protection against the United States and help them recover their land taken since 1811, which the Treaty of Ghent, ending the War of 1812, said they were to receive. Specifically they meant the huge territory lost under the Treaty of Fort Jackson, which the Red Sticks had not signed and claimed did not apply to them. Nicolls, a champion of Native American rights, created this treaty on his own initiative, without authorization. The outcome was the famous trip of Francis and his son Earle, escorted and hosted by Nicolls, to London, though Nicolls had unsuccessfully recommended to Francis that he not make this trip. Francis, as well as the informal leader of the Red Sticks, was the most articulate Native American at the meeting. He was the representative of the Native Americans, hoping Britain would sign the treaty. Great Britain, having just ended the unpopular War of 1812, was not interested in further armed conflict with the United States. The Regent refused to see Francis, sent him home (not without his meeting a number of prominent Englishmen), and chastised Nicolls. The draft treaty is among the papers in the British War Office. Note that it is not called the Treaty of Nicolls' Outpost (or anything else). The name \\"Nicolls' Outpost\\" for the fortification was not used until the 1950s.

He played an important role during the establishment in 1863 of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and from that year on he was an advocate for the establishment of a national voluntary aid organization in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Red Cross established in 1867. Biography = Youth, early career, and marriage = Basting was born in Enkhuizen on 20 September 1817, the son of hospital master Dingeman Cornelis Basting and Frederika Sophia Wilhelmina Schneider. He was 17 years old when he was admitted as a student at the National Institute for Military Medicine in Utrecht. In 1839 he became army physician Calss 3. In 1844 Basting was placed in Breda , where he became Officer of Health Class 2. After a short interim period in Maastricht, he was transferred to Gorinchem. In 1853 he was promoted to Officer of Health Class 1 and transferred to Leiden. The following year he married in Gorinchem with Amalie Fréderique Kattenbusch, born in Eschweiler. He received his PhD in Leiden on 12 March 1855. In the same year he was transferred from Leiden to the Regiment Grenadiers and Jagers in The Hague where he would stay until 1870, with a short break due to an interim transfer to Bergen op Zoom = First contact with Henri Dunant = A certain Pauline Micheli-Revilliod advised Henri Dunant in 1862 to send Johan Basting a copy of his book Un Souvenir de Solferino. Dunant had written it after having witnessed the suffering at the Battle of Solferino. He then asked Basting to translate the book from French to Dutch. Basting did so, and became fascinated by the Dunant's plea in his book to set up voluntary organizations in all countries that could become lifesaving in the case of armed conflict. The Dutch translation of Dunant's book appeared in Dutch in 1863 = Establishment of the Red Cross Movement = On September 8, 1863, Basting participated on behalf of the Netherlands in the 5th International Statistical Congress that took place in Berlin. Dunant was also present at his invitation because it gave both the opportunity to inform the participating countries about Dunant's idea to set up national aid associations in all countries. Dunant and Basting were helped by Bastings wife, Amalie Kattenburg-Basting, who had met Basting in Gorinchem. Amalie helped with translations and the layout of pamphlets that were distributed there and with the haste and adaptation of the invitation for an international conference that they hoped to organize in October that year in Geneva with interested countries. The lobby in Berlin was a success and already in October of that year the first International Conference of the Red Cross took place in Geneva. On 22 August 1864 this led to the Geneva Convention, ratified by 16 countries. This laid the foundation for International Humanitarian Law . The committee in Geneva, then consisting of five Swiss including Dunant and later called the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), became the custodian of International Humanitarian Law. = Establishment of a national Red Cross Society in the Nederlands and his death = Earlier that year, in April 1864, Basting published a leaflet called Eene roepstem tot mijn vaderland: De hulpmaatschappijen tot verzorging van zieken en gekwetsten in which he pleaded for the establishment of a national Red Cross Society in the Netherlands. In 1866, Basting moved from The Hague to Bergen op Zoom. Despite Bastings' call and the support he received from people like Henry CN Baron van Tuyll of Serooskerken and General Knoop, after a four- year long period of delays, on 19 July 1867, by a Koninklijk besluit, the Nederlandsche Vereeniging finally granted aid. to sick and wounded warriors in time of war . Because of the protection sign to be used in wartime - a red cross on a white surface - the association was soon called the Nederlandse Rode Kruis, but officially the association did not name it until after 1895. In 1868 Basting contributed to the establishment and organization of local Red Cross aid committees in the Netherlands with his book De Nederlandsche Hulpkomités onder het Roode Kruis. Hun werkkring in tijden van oorlog en vrede. Their office in times of war and peace . He also put this into practice himself by setting up a Red Cross auxiliary committee in Bergen op Zoom on 24 March 1868. Basting became ill in the spring of 1870 and died on 24 September that year as a result of liver disease in Den Haag. He was buried on the 27th of September at Oud Eik en Duinen in The Hague. = Importance to the Red Cross = In the early years, Basting was the main international promoter of Dunant's plea to establish national Red Cross associations. Although Dunant had previously been present as an observer at the conference in Berlin, he had been given a specific mandate from the \\"Committee of Five\\" in Geneva. But at the urging of Basting, Dunant in Berlin, without any consultation with his Geneva colleague committee members, added three points to the plea that Basting presented, including the principle of Neutrality. Once in the invitation and in the agenda, co-founders could not simply ignore this. Johan Basting subsequently proved also to be crucial during the subsequent International Conference in 1863, in particular with regard to the introduction of the principle of Neutrality for Red Cross volunteers and medical objects such as ambulances, clinics and hospitals in times of war. Henri Dunant wrote to his Dutch friend and journalist Haje that it was \\"avec sa tenacité hollandaise\\" (his Dutch tenacity) that had been the decisive factor in the endorsement of the fundamental principle of Neutrality by the States present. \\"In the Netherlands, Johan Basting was important because of his advocacy for the establishment of a national volunteer aid association, the Netherlands Red Cross Society. = Basting's Réveil background = Basting, his Swiss friend Dunant, and the first Red Cross volunteer who - together with another Swiss (Dr. Louis Appia, with Dunant and three other Swiss co-founder of the ICRC) - was sent to a war front, the Dutchman (and painter / writer) Charles William Meredith van de Velde, were all born in a Calvinistic Réveil environment. The Réveil movement originated in Geneva at the beginning of the 19th century in response to The Enlightenment. All three had from childhood learned to take care of others, for example Dunant visited with his parents prisoners, and they helped poor in their community. Basting and his wife Amalie have translated a number of writings from the Geneva Réveil theologian and philosopher Jules-Ernest Naville from French into Dutch. And Dunant organized meetings for fellow believers in Geneva. Van de Velde has visited one or more such meetings in Geneva, Basting has likely never been in Geneva. It was this international network of Dunant that brought him in contact with Johan Basting in 1862.

Early life and personal education  Rachel Susan Cook came from an academic family in St Andrews, one of five sisters. Her paternal line included three generations of divinity professors, including a Moderator of the Church of Scotland. Her education was at St Andrew's senior school, Madras College; by a private tutor; and then as one of the first 6 female students enrolled at the College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, which later became the University of Cambridge's Girton College, with another Scottish woman, Louisa Innes Lumsden. At this time, such women graduates were \\"rather special people ... exceptionally able, determined, ambitious\\". In 1873, Cook \\"graduated\\" as one of the first women at the University of Cambridge with honours in the classic Tripos, at second class. This achievement was significant given the challenges women faced in higher education. Sarah Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden were considered \\"the Girton pioneers\\", with Cook also described as \\"a tall, dark, willowy beauty with the melancholy air of one of Rossetti's nymphs, classical features and graceful movements. George Eliot described her as \\"sylphlike\\", and the most beautiful woman she had ever seen; and there still remains in the minds of those who knew her then a memorable picture of her uncommonness, her dramatic instinct and critical quickness, and her eagerness and radiance of mind.  Campaign for women's education  In 1874 she married Charles Scott, known as C. P. Scott, editor of the Manchester Guardian, and moved to Manchester, where she soon joined the governing body of the city's Girls' High School. She continued to champion women's higher education by creating a home-based university level teaching facility, supported by sympathetic professors from Owens College. Through her unstinting efforts this became incorporated into Owens College in 1883. Scott also served on the Withington Girls School governing body and was interested in the co-educational school Lady Barn House School and took a lead role in education in the City; her eloquent elocution at public events to raise support for education for women and girls, was remarked upon on in her obituary. Her final speech in 1900 was in the Free Trade Hall to the assembled Manchester High School for Girls community. Publishing anonymously, Scott translated classical Latin and French texts, including Balzac’s Human Comedy with Clara Bell and others, as well as a guide to pictures in the Manchester Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. With her husband who was the editor, she contributed critical items to the Manchester Guardian and her influence and contribution was also recognised in her husband's obituary.

In reality, like Hotgun, released by Guinness Records the album was a composite, created from unpublished demo recordings made by several different unsigned performers. One of the rarer albums released by Tiger Lily Records, only two copies are known to exist. Album release As the release of a tax scam label, the album came with minimal documentation beyond songwriting credits and claims that the songs had been published by a company owned by Charles Koppelman and Martin Bandier. However, this may be a false claim, in the same way that the documentation on Hotgun claimed that the original songs on that album had been published by R. Stevie Moores father. Record collector Scott Blackerby discovered the album in 2011 and diagnosed it as a composite created from unpublished demo tracks, based on the multiplicity of songwriters, the fact that some of the tracks sounded unfinished, and the differing musical styles involved. This was confirmed in 2013, when Dan Chapman, friend of one of the credited writers, Dennis Wilkerson contacted Blackerby. He revealed that at some point around 1970 he and Wilkerson after having some success with a high school rock band, had been contacted by a producer named John McCauley who offered to professionally produce their music. In the end the project did not result in a recording contract and the pair went their separate ways. Many years later Wilkerson had been contacted by a record collector in Europe who had obtained a copy of Made From Plate and was trying to track down the songwriters. It is likely, as with the tracks that made up Hotgun, that the recording studios who supplied the tracks for Made From Plate sold them to Tiger Lily Records as a means of recouping the recording costs.

It was opened in 1926, when the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;) was extended from Clapham Common to Morden. History In 1913, the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;) and the London Electric Railway (LER) were granted authorisation by separate Acts of Parliament to carry out works on their underground routes. The City and South London Railway needed to enlarge its tunnels to accommodate larger rolling stock and the London Electric Railway obtained permission to construct tunnels to connect the C&SLR; at Euston to its Hampstead Tube station at Camden Town. The work was delayed by the onset of the First World War and both companies obtained further Acts of Parliament to extend the time limits allowed for the works. Increases in the costs of materials and labour following the war meant that building and maintaining underground railways was no longer economic, and by 1921 the country was in recession, with nearly two million workers unemployed. In order to ease the situation, the government passed the Trade Facilities Act 1921, which enabled companies involved in projects that would create employment to borrow money, with the treasury guaranteeing both the capital amounts and the interest payments. Lord Ashfield, the chairman of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London, which owned both the City and South London Railway and the London Electric Railway, applied for and was granted powers to borrow £5 million under the scheme, which allowed the two projects to proceed. The Trade Facilities Act 1921 had allowed the treasury to guarantee a total of £25 million, and the scheme was extended by the passing of the Trade Facilities and Loans Guarantee Act 1922, which increased the amounts of funding to £50 million, while extending the time limits by a year. With the prospect of being able to borrow more money, the London Electric Railway obtained an act that authorised an extension of the Hampstead Tube from Charing Cross (now Embankment) to Kennington in 1923, while the City and South London Railway obtained an act for an extension southwards from Clapham Common to Morden, where a new depot would be constructed. The extension was funded by issuing 4.5 percent debenture stock, backed by a government guarantee. Work on the extension started on 31 December 1923 at Clapham, and the line and the depot were opened on 13 September 1926. Trains of 1956 Stock (left) and 1959 Stock (centre and right) stabled at Morden in 1988 In order to run the extended service, the first trains of what became known as Standard Stock were ordered. 191 cars were ordered in 1923 from three manufacturers, with a further 127 in 1924 and 120 in 1925. All of the cars were delivered by road, the 1923 Stock going to Golders Green Depot, the 1924 batch going to both Golders Green and the newly constructed Morden Depot, while all of the 1925 build was delivered to Morden. Stock delivered to Morden was stored until the line to Clapham was opened. The cars were towed to Morden by traction engines, mounted on road bogies. Two tall gantries were erected, which enabled the cars to be lifted, for the road bogies to be removed. A railway steam crane was then used to place the railway bogies onto the tracks, and once mounted on them, the City and South London's diminutive steam locomotive was used to move the cars to the stabling sidings. The line southwards from Clapham runs almost entirely in tunnel, emerging into the open air just to the north of Morden station. Tracks continue southwards beyond the station, passing under the A24 road to reach the depot, which is only accessible from the northern end. At its southern end, the depot is hemmed in by Morden South station and the tracks of the Sutton Loop Line. Within the depot there is a large car shed, with open-air sidings to either side of it. A long footbridge crosses the depot tracks, providing good views of the facility. Morden Depot is thought to be the first such facility on the London Underground where the term \\"depot\\" was applied to a site for stabling and maintenance of trains. It was probably borrowed from army stores served by railways after the end of the First World War, which were also known as depots. Prior to this, the various underground lines all had \\"works\\" where trains were stabled and maintained. Whereas Golders Green is designated as a main depot, Morden is a subsidiary depot, despite the fact that 38 trains are stabled there, as opposed to 16 at Golders Green. The designation is based on the range of maintenance functions performed at the depot, not the number of trains, and heavy maintenance for the Northern line is only performed at Golders Green. =Rolling stock= When first constructed, the depot was used to stable trains of 1924 and 1925 stock until the line northwards to Clapham was competed. With the 1923 stock, trains were formed into five-car units, but as the number of control trailer cars increased, they were formed into six-car units, with motor cars at the outside ends, two control trailers in the middle, and two trailer cars. The delivery of additional standard stock, 112 cars in 1926 and 306 cars in 1927, enabled all trains on the Northern line to be formed of the new air-door stock. The extra stock meant that the frequency of trains could be improved, and the trains lengthened to seven cars. A seven-car train was formed of a four-car motor-trailer-trailer-motor unit, and a three-car motor-trailer-control trailer unit, with the control trailer in the middle of the train. During off- peak hours, trains were shortened to four cars, by uncoupling the three-car unit. Approximately half of the trains had the three-car unit at the Morden end, and thus could be shortened at Morden, with the three-car unit being shunted into the depot, to be re-attached for the next peak service. Trains with the alternative formation were shortened at Edgware or Golders Green. It is unclear whether any trains of gate stock were ever stabled at the depot, as although both types of train ran on the Northern line, the earlier gate stock was only used on short workings from Golders Green and Highgate to Charing Cross, and from Euston to Tooting, but was never used in passenger service as far south as Morden. The 1935-40 New Works Programme which London Underground initiated included the provision of new trains, and delivery of 1938 Stock began in May 1938. By November, there were 24 trains of the new stock in passenger-carrying service, and further trains were being commissioned at a rate of two per week. At the depot, 1938 Stock gradually replaced Standard Stock, which was transferred to Acton Works and overhauled to see further service on the Central line. Delivery of 1938 Stock continued into the early years of the Second World War, and by mid-1941, there were 96 seven-car trains operational on the Northern line, with 96 spare cars, so the changeover was complete. As a result of the wartime conditions, a considerable number of new cars were stored around the system, some of which had been commissioned, but some of which could not be, because they were missing parts or motors. Five unused trailer cars were listed in the depot returns for Morden, of which some if not all were non-standard cars, which were designed to run in nine-car block trains. The use of nine-car trains was abandoned at the start of the war, and they were not reintroduced. There were also ten non-driving motor cars stored somewhere on the Northern line, but their locations were not specified. In order to improve the situation on the Bakerloo line, there was a concerted attempt to assemble the spare cars into complete trains in 1943, and the five trailer cars left Morden for Acton Works to be modified to run in standard length trains. There was a serious collision of 1938 Stock at the depot on 27 July 1971, when motor car 10278 hit motor car 11159, which was stabled in the car shed on road 6. Both cars were damaged beyond repair, and formed part of the first batch of 1938 Stock to be scrapped in 1972. From 1972, Morden Depot ceased to be the preserve of just 1938 Stock, and by 1978, there were five types of stock in use on the Northern line and stabled at the depot. As part of a major programme of updating the rolling stock on the system, the Piccadilly line was equipped with 1973 Stock. This allowed the 1956 Stock and 1959 Stock on that line to be transferred to the Northern line, and some of the 1938 Stock to be scrapped. To make up the number of trains required, 30 trains of 1972 Mark I Stock were ordered, and subsequently, a second batch of 33 trains, known as 1972 Mark II Stock, was ordered, for eventual equipping of the Jubilee line, then under construction. They operated on the Northern line from November 1973, to enable additional 1938 Stock to be scrapped, and were gradually transferred to the Bakerloo line, as more trains of 1959 Stock were displaced from the Piccadilly line. The first train of 1959 Stock arrived in November 1975, and by 1 January 1978, 56 and a half trains had been transferred. The allocation at the beginning of 1978 comprised 10.5 trains of 1938 Stock, three of 1956 Stock, 56.5 of 1958 Stock, 30 of 1972 Mark I Stock and 15 of 1972 Mark II Stock, making 115 in total, although only 95 were required from day to day. Morden Depot was used to stable 39 trains to run the passenger service at that time, with Golders Green supplying 17, and the remaining 39 being stabled at Highgate and Edgware Depots, and on sidings at High Barnet, Highgate Woods, and Golders Green. Although all of the 1972 Mark II Stock had left the Northern line in time for the opening of the Jubilee line in May 1979, four trains returned in 1983, following service reductions on the Jubilee line. They were modified to be compatible with the Mark I Stock, and a further 14 trains arrived in 1984-1985, as they were displaced from the Jubilee line by newly built 1983 Stock. The extra trains allowed 1959 Stock to be transferred to the Bakerloo line, to replace the remaining trains of 1938 Stock. By mid-1993, there were 2.5 trains of 1956 Stock, 74.5 trains of 1959 Stock, 2.5 trains of 1962 Stock and 24.5 trains of 1972 Stock on the Northern line, making 104 trains in total. The passenger service required 82 trains, of which 38 were supplied by Morden Depot. The return to the depot stabling a single type of stock began in mid-1998, when the first trains of 1995 Stock entered service on the Northern line, after some 18 months of commissioning problems. As they entered service, the 1956, 1959 and 1962 Stock trains were sent for scrap, and the 1972 Stock was converted to one person operation and transferred to the Bakerloo line. The last train of 1959 Stock worked on 27 January 2000, and this was also the last train to be crewed by a driver and a guard on London Underground, as all subsequent trains were one person operated. By that date, 97 of the new trains had been commissioned, sufficient to run the peak-time service which required 84 trains. The final nine trains had been delivered by 10 April 2001. Trains consist of six cars, and are composed of two three-car units, each made up of a motor car, a trailer car, and an uncoupling non-driving motor car. From the introduction of the July 2002 timetable, 91 trains were required for the peak service, of which Morden Depot supplied 38.

He is the director of research at French National Center for Scientific Research and a member of CHI Academy since 2016. He is also an associate editor of ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM TOCHI) and member of the advisory council of the International Association for the Study of Attention and Performance.  Education  Guiard received his PhD in cognitive neuroscience from the University of Marseilles. He was elected a French Government Fellow of Churchill College from 1996 till 1997, in Cambridge, UK.  Work  Yves Guiard's research interests span stimulus-response compatibility and the speed/accuracy of trade-off aimed movement. He has designed and tested his novel models of interaction for mobile devices. He proposed a kinematic-chain model in 1987, but the model was only found useful by HCI researchers a decade later when two-handed interaction with the devices was started being researched. Guiard's HCI Research team at Télécom ParisTech is group is devoted to fundamental and applied research on Human Computer Interaction (HCI). They focus on representing and manipulating big data, and allowing this not only on standard computers but also on small devices – like mobile phones and tablets. Guiard has published multiple papers regarding the usage of two- handed input while using touch screen based interfaces. His main research topics were around the ability of producing such technology and how usable it is for a given moment in time. As the time passed by, the papers focus on improving currently used designs – like gesture based input on tablets or interaction with different modules of GUI of a modern computer through touch pads. Guiard has developed a simple model of wrist-wear (Watchit) which implemented basic gesture-based interaction with the wearable. The research surrounding that model has helped the designs and development of the modern smart wearables. Guiard's publication about the speed/accuracy trade-off of aimed movement goes in depth of how average users interact with common devices – standard computers or mobile phones, and the possibility of developing better designs in order to increase accuracy while not affecting the speed of the input. It explains the mathematics behind common input types and how different designs affect the speed and accuracy. Guiard is currently working on a book titled \\"Human Input to Computer Systems: Theories, Techniques and Technology\\" with William Buxton, where they explain the methods of bringing traditional design skills to interaction design, or the design of user experience.

Early life He was born on 11 April 1874 to Scottish parents, Andrew and Jean Urquhart, in Aydın, from Smyrna in the Ottoman Empire. His father was engaged in the export trade of licorice root and paste, the extract from which was widely used in the pharmaceutical and tobacco industries, as well as confectionery production. Urquhart went to an English school in Smyrna from age 7. In 1887 the family moved to Scotland, settling at Portobello, Edinburgh. Urquhart went to school there, then in Edinburgh, and in 1890 took up an engineering apprenticeship with Crow, Harvey & Co. of Glasgow, also attending evening classes at the Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College. His father was at Oudjari (Ujar), now in Azerbaijan, with a business venture. He also studied chemistry under Stevenson Macadam at Edinburgh University, and in 1896 was set for a career in the oil industry. He was diverted, however, to Ujar and his father's licorice interests there, as the manager of the Oriental Trading Corporation factory there. Thomas Urquhart, his uncle and an engineer who had supervised the Gryazi–Tsaritsyn railway line in Russia, may have influenced his decision. The oil at Baku was possibly another factor: he made a trip there in 1897, and by 1898 had made good progress in the local languages. Oilman in Baku In 1902 Urquhart was offered work by the Schibaieff Petroleum Company, at a time when licorice was in glut, and became a manager for them at Baku. The factory was sold and the Oriental Trading Corporation wound up in 1903, as the American Liquorice Trust sought to create a cartel. British capital was at this point prominent in the Baku oilfields, with at least five companies buying in from 1896. There was some notable sharp practice in deals. The dealings of George Tweedy, in particular, for Baku-Russian Petroleum, brought Charles Leslie, a director of the company, to Baku in 1904. He struck up a friendship with Urquhart. When he was forced to leave the oil business, two years later, Urquhart was able to set up the Anglo-Siberian Company in London, for mining, by combining his contacts with Leslie's. The change was precipitated by political events, starting with a wave of strikes in Baku, and the fall of Sergei Witte, in 1903. It was followed by the Russo-Japanese War, and communal violence between Armenians and Tatars in Baku during February 1905. In private, Urquhart, who employed Tatars and spoke their language, entirely took their side. The disturbances of the 1905 Russian Revolution that took place in Baku in September of that year were particularly bloody. Urquhart was awarded an Albert Medal for Lifesaving, the citation noting his position as British Vice-Consul in Baku, and his actions to save four British workmen in September 1905, with Tatar and Cossack support. After a complex series of events and negotiations, Urquhart left revolutionary Baku on instructions from the British Foreign office and companies, reaching Moscow on 25 September. His life was said to be in danger, but he was also much criticised. Kyshtym Urquhart's setting up of the Anglo-Siberian Corporation then led to other vehicles for capital. The Perm Corporation was likewise intended to exploit minerals in the Urals, and Anglo-Siberian took it over in 1908, once it had acquired the Kyshtym Mining Works of 1900, a Russian company. The Kyshtym Corporation Ltd. then bought the shares from the Perm Corporation. Exploratory surveys at Kyshtym for Anglo-Siberian had confirmed the presence of deposits of copper, iron and sulphur; and gold in the Soymonovsk Valley. The result was that the mineral resources of the Kyshtym estate were controlled by a board chaired by Charles Leslie, on which Urquhart sat. In autumn 1908 Urquhart and Semmy Joseph Blumlein, managing director, went to Kyshtym and supervised investment, including rail track and a smelter. The complex corporate situation proved unstable, because of tensions between British interests related by cross-holdings. American interests became involved. In 1911 Alfred Chester Beatty visited Kyshtym, on behalf of the American interests. By 1912 the future direction was set for investment in the Urals, with Beatty and Urquhart allied, and the British group around Leslie excluded. At this period, Urquhart also acquired interests in what is now Kazakhstan. They were in lead and zinc at Ridder, and coal at Ekibastuz. He chaired the Irtysh Corporation, which held the Kirgiz Coal Mining Company, the owner of the mines. The Irtysh Corporation, in turn, was financed by the Russo-Asiatic Corporation, a British company of which Urquhart was a director.Arno W. F. Kolz, British Economic Interests in Siberia during the Russian Civil War, 1918–1920, The Journal of Modern History Vol. 48, No. 3 (Sep., 1976), pp. 483–491, at p. 488 note 30. Published by: The University of Chicago Press It had been set up in 1912, when it was partly owned by Anglo-Siberian, with two banks; but Anglo-Siberian was wound up shortly after that. Other holdings were at Tanalyk in Orenburg Oblast. They produced copper, and Baron Meller-Zakomelsky, whose family estate was at Kyshtym, invited Urquhart to become a partner in the venture, around 1911. Aftermath of the Russian Revolution A consequence of the 1917 Russian Revolution was the nationalisation of mining interests in the former Russian Empire. Urquhart in 1921 became President of the Association of British Creditors of Russia (ABC of Russia), a broad-based pressure group. His personal objective was to secure for Russo-Asiatic a concession to run again the corporation's mining sites, under the new regime.Thomas S. Martin, The Urquhart Concession and Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1921—1922, Jahrbücher für Geschichte OsteuropasNeue Folge, Bd. 20, H. 4 (Dezember 1972), pp. 551–570, at p. 551 and p. 553. Published by: Franz Steiner Verlag. The Hands Off Russia campaign by the British Left had little purchase, but the Lloyd George administration was keen to trade with the Soviet Union. Urquhart was a strong opponent of the Bolsheviks, and as a backer of Alexander Kolchak an advocate of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Under Sir Charles Eliot, British Commissioner in Siberia, he ran through staff the Siberian Supply Company that operated in 1918–9 behind the White Russian lines, but no further west than Harbin.Arno W. F. Kolz, British Economic Interests in Siberia during the Russian Civil War, 1918–1920, The Journal of Modern History Vol. 48, No. 3 (Sep., 1976), pp. 483–491, at p. 484. Published by: The University of Chicago Press A 1921 agreement made by Urquhart with Leonid Krasin fell through, undermined by a public attack by Urquhart on the Cheka, and Lenin's wish to make an anti-British gesture. By the time of the Genoa Conference (1922), however, Urquhart had come to favour a more co-operative attitude to the Soviet Union. His dealings, however, were caught up with the international tensions caused by the events around the Armistice of Mudanya in October 1922. The Soviets were snubbed by a virtual exclusion from the subsequent Conference of Lausanne. Arthur Ransome argued that their assumption that treating Urquhart harshly would affect the British government was based on faulty reasoning.Thomas S. Martin, The Urquhart Concession and Anglo-Soviet Relations, 1921—1922, Jahrbücher für Geschichte OsteuropasNeue Folge, Bd. 20, H. 4 (Dezember 1972), pp. 551–570, at p. 557. Published by: Franz Steiner Verlag. During the New Economic Policy period, Urquhart persisted in efforts to secure concessions in the territory of the USSR. Lenin's view of 1922 was the Ekibastuz site should not be wholly granted as a concession to Urquhart. By 1925 there was local resistance, for example in the Kazakh Republic by Nikolai Yezhov. Urquhart's approach to dealing with the Soviet concessions, and Georgy Pyatakov who controlled them, on behalf of the Russo-Asiatic Consolidated group, contrasted with the subtler and more accommodating tactics employed by Herbert Guedalla and Grigori Benenson for the Imperial and Foreign Corporation, also based in London. They gained control of Lena Goldfields, by business manipulations, and had a much freer hand in the USSR. Urquhart shunned chances to ally with them. Urquhart attempted, through Midian Ltd., to exploit sites formerly in the Ottoman Empire, to the south of the Dead Sea; but the British government favoured the interests of the Turkish Petroleum Company. Later life In the later 1920s Urquhart was heavily involved in the Mount Isa Mines (MIM) of Queensland in Australia. He repeated there a pattern of local development of towns that he had carried out in pre-war Russia. The Urquhart Shale ore body is named for him. The Australian mining consultant William Henry Corbould, who had worked at Mount Isa, went on in 1928 to survey Edie Creek in the Territory of New Guinea, for Urquhart and the Ellyou Goldfields Development Corporation. There resulted the New Guinea Goldfields Ltd. subsidiary of MIM. Urquhart died in London on 13 March 1933. Awards and honours Urquhart received the Russian imperial Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd class with star, in 1916. Family Urquhart married American-born Beryl da Silva-Bald in 1909; her father was English, her mother from Illinois. The wedding was in London, but the couple went then to Kyshtym, where their first son Kenneth was born the following year. At the end of 1911 Urquhart bought Brasted Place, in Brasted, Kent, England, as a family home, from Henry Avray Tipping. The other children of the marriage were: *Ronald, born 1911 in Kyshtym *Ian Andrew, born 1914 at Brasted *Neil Roy Leslie, born 1915 *Jean Leslie, born 1919, who married in 1942 William Robert Brudenell.
