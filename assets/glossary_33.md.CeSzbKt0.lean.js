The surviving buildings are owned and administered by the Sussex Archaeological Society and are Grade I and Grade II listed. A T-shaped stone-built structure, the east and north wings date from the 13th century and the west wing from the 16th century. The north wing, originally the Priors Lodging, comprises three storeys with an attic and the other two wings two storeys. The roof is tiled. The whole is surrounded by a moat, enclosing an area of almost . A watermill in the grounds of the priory has been restored to working order and is open to the public. History =The medieval priory= The Augustinian Priory of the Holy Trinity was founded at Michelham in 1229 by Gilbert de Aquila, whose father had been a benefactor of Bayham Abbey in Kent and also had connections to Otham Abbey in East Sussex. Michelham was a daughter house of Hastings Priory. All Gilbert's lands and honours were forfeited in 1235 as punishment for his going to Normandy without licence from King Henry III. In 1278 and again in 1287, the prior was fined for exercising illegal privileges. On 26 June 1283, John de Kyrkeby renounced his election as Bishop of Rochester at Michelham Priory before John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury. King Edward I stayed overnight at the priory on 14 September 1302. In 1353, the prior was fined 40d because a bridge at Rickney was broken and blocking the river. By 1398, the priory was reported to be in a ruinous condition. Robert Reade, bishop of Chichester, granted the advowsons of Alfriston and Fletching to Michelham Priory in that year. =Dissolution and later use= The Priory was seized in 1537 under Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the monasteries. The priory and its possessions was then granted to Thomas Cromwell. Following Cromwell's execution in 1540, it was granted to Anne of Cleves. Part of it was leased to Thomas Culpeper, with the greater part of the site passing to William, Earl of Arundel. In 1544, Henry, Earl of Arundel exchanged Michelham Priory with Queen Mary for other property. In 1556, the priory was sold to John Foote and John Roberts for ¬£1,249 16s 10d. Foote alienated the manor and hundred of Michelham Parkegate to Ambrose Smythe in 1574. In 1584, Smythe granted it to John Morely and Elizabeth, his wife. Morley granted the priory to Herbert Pelham in 1587. The church and some of the buildings were demolished between 1599 and 1601. In the former year, the priory was made over in trust to Thomas Peirse, Thomas Pelham and James Thatcher to be sold to provide an annuity of ¬£400 and pay off his debts. In 1601, the priory was sold to Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (Lord Buckhurst) for the sum of ¬£4,700. On his death in 1608, the property passed to his son Robert Sackville, 2nd Earl of Dorset. In 1609, it passed to Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset. On Richard's death in 1630, the priory passed to his wife, Lady Anne Clifford. On her death in 1675, the property remained in the Sackville family, passing down the Earls (later Dukes) of Dorset until the death of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset in 1799, then passing to his daughter Mary, Countess of Plymouth. She married William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst in 1839. It was sold to James Gwynne in 1896 and was where his children Rupert, Roland and Violet grew up.Pamela Cullen, \\"Stranger in Blood: The case files on Doctor John Bodkin Adams\\", 2006 The property remained in private hands into the 20th century, when it was restored by the Sussex architect and antiquarian, Walter Godfrey. It was used as a base for Canadian troops during the winter of 1941-42 while they prepared for the Dieppe Raid. Later it was the East Sussex headquarters of the Auxiliary Territorial Service. In 1958 Mrs R.H. Hotblack purchased the property with the aim of preserving it for posterity. With an endowment from Kenneth, Earl of Inchcape as a memorial to his friend John Fletcher Boughey who was killed during the Second World War, Mrs Hotblack gave the property in trust to the Sussex Archaeological Society on 1 November 1959. =Priors of Michelham= Aerial view of Michelham Priory.

Buildings =Barn= The barn was built between 1587 and 1610. It is on a timber frame clad with tarred weatherboards. The arched queen post roof is covered with pegtiles. The barn is Grade II listed. The barn serves as a function and meeting room. =Chapter house and dormitory= The chapter house and dormitory stood south of the church, on the east of the site. =Church= The church stood to the north of the surviving refectory. It possessed five bells. No trace of it remains today. =Dovecot= The dovecot, also described as a stables or pigeon house, is a single-storey building of sandstone, ashlar on the south facing aspect under a hipped pegtile roof. Built in the 18th century, it is a Grade II listed building. The building has been converted to form a shop and tearoom. =Gatehouse= The gatehouse was built in the early 15th century, during the time when John Leem was prior. A basement at moat level served either as a cellar or prison. The building is about high and contains four storeys, including the cellar. In the 16th century, a stone bridge was built over the moat. The gatehouse and bridge are Grade I listed buildings. =Refectory= The surviving refectory building originally contained a hall long. There was a window at the west end which was wide, the outer frame of which survives today. This and the Prior's House are built of sandstone. At the time of the Dissolution, the refectory was roofless. A second floor was added later and the building was divided into a number of rooms. Adjacent to the refectory is the Prior's House and crypt, which was above ground on account of the low-lying position of the priory and risk of flooding. There is a post-monastic extension on the west, built of stone. The whole is under a pegtile roof. The refectory had been converted to use as a farmhouse by 1848. The crypt was divided into four rooms and used as a dairy by the 1850s. The whole is a Grade I listed building. =Watermill= The moat round the priory was formed by damming the River Cuckmere and the watermill is fed by the moat. A watermill is mentioned at Michelham Priory as early as c.1260, In 1411 it was held by Robert de Blachington from William de Wrotham and his wife Joan de Kelle. In 1478, the priory owned two mills, which were both reported to be \\"in ruins\\". At the time the priory was dissolved, the mill produced an annual profit of 53s 3d. The surviving building dates from the mid-C16th. Built on an oak frame, it is of three bays clad with weaterboards and under a pegtile roof. A porch bears the date 1714. The front of the mill was renewed c.1800. A cast iron waterwheel was fitted in 1896. It was removed in 1924-25, the mill having ceased commercial milling in 1924. As well as the waterwheel, the rest of the machinery was removed and the building served as a store. A turbine was installed in the mill race to generate electricity for the main house in the former refectory. It was still working in 1939. The mill was restored to working order in 1972, new machinery and a new breastshot wooden waterwheel being fitted. The mill is a Grade II listed building. In 1996, the waterwheel was rebuilt and other machinery repaired or replaced as necessary. The work was partly funded by a ¬£42,000 grant from the National Lottery.

There are three mammalian aurora kinase genes, encoding aurora A, B and C. Intense investigation has focused on aurora A and B as they appear to play a role in oncogenesis with aurora A identified as a low penetrance tumor susceptibility gene in mice and humans. Aurora kinases could be potential targets for novel small-molecule enzyme inhibitors. Drug development A new approach to inhibiting cancer growth that shows great promise for structure-based drug development is targeting enzymes central to cellular mitosis. Aurora kinases, so named because the scattered mitotic spindles generated by mutant forms resemble the Aurora Borealis, have gained a great deal of attention as possible anticancer drug targets. The Aurora enzymes are particularly significant because they are involved in a direct path to the nucleosome by phosphorylating histone H3. Furthermore, Aurora kinases are known to be oncogenic and overexpressed in various forms of cancerous growth, including leukemia, colon cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer tumors. So far three Aurora-kinase inhibitors have been described: ZM447439, hesperadin and VX-680. The last is in advanced stages (Phase II clinical trial) of a joint drug development by Vertex Pharmaceuticals's VX-680 (Sausville, 234, last posted on 12/18/06) and Merck & Co., although the Phase II clinical trial was suspended in November, 2007 due to QT prolongation observed in one patient in Phase I trial.

O'Rourke boxed in his youth, but his primary talent was rowing. He began managing boxers in the late 1880s, finally getting the black bantamweight George Dixon in his stable in 1889. O'Rourke saw Dixon outmatch Paddy Kelly in Boston, and began managing him to an eventual meeting with Cal McCarthy, the lightweight champion of the world. The bout ended in a draw, so O'Rourke and Dixon took their show on the road, eventually claiming the world championship in 1891, and the featherweight championship in 1892 in New Orleans in a rare (for the time) mixed-race bout, a tribute to O'Rourke's matchmaking abilities. In addition to Dixon, O'Rourke managed Joe Walcott (note: not Jersey Joe Walcott, who took his name from O'Rourke's boxer), who won the welterweight championship of the world in 1901. Walcott and Dixon are famous for traveling with O'Rourke in a \\"take on all comers\\" tour, where O'Rourke had his own, slightly smaller than usual, boxing ring for the bouts. The smaller ring gave his boxers an advantage, as both men were known for their straightforward style. In 1902, O'Rourke arranged the World Series of Football while serving as manager of Madison Square Garden trying to bring in attractions while promoting various boxing events. Pop Warner played his last game for the event. He held another World Series of Football in 1903 but lackluster support led him to end the event. Another well-known boxer of O'Rourke's is Sailor Tom Sharkey, who was managed by O'Rourke when he lost the heavyweight title bout with James J. Jeffries in 1899. The number one fighter that he began managing was George Gardner, once the Light Heavyweight Champion of the World in 1903. Gardner won the title from Jack Root and lost the title to Bob Fitzsimmons. It is often thought that the Fitzsimmons match was a publicity stunt, possibly a bribery making Fitzsimmons the first triple title champion in boxing history. O'Rourke died after collapsing in Max Schmeling's dressing room prior to his bout with Joe Louis on June 19, 1936. References *Roberts, James B. and Skutt, Alexander G.

During the last decades, the village has converted into a residential community with several farms and craft workshops. The most striking landmarks of the community are all highly visible Ulrich church and the water tower. The boundaries of the municipality covers an area of 809 hectares. With 531 inhabitants (31 December 2012) √ñllingen belongs to the group of the 30 smallest independent municipalities in Baden-W√ºrttemberg. √ñllingen - Church clock and sundial Crest √ñllinger Crest: On a red background is an upright silver (white) lion holding a silver (white) high cross in the front paws. The silver lion on a red background is derived from the coat of arms of the Counts of Dillingen. The cross bears the lion in its paws suggests the relationship to the monastery Anhausen. At the same time, it is considered an indication of historical relations to the Chorherrenstift Wiesensteig. Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor had passed the patronage of √ñllingen church in 1330 to the Chorherrenstift Wiesensteig. The coat of arms was awarded to the municipality by the state government on 21 February 1955, the flag by the District Office on October 1, 1984.

History √ñllingen was documented in 1143 for the first time under the name Elingen, later Ellingen and belonged to the monastery Anhausen. By Excavations in 2002 it was demonstrated that there was a settlement in 2000 BC on the Sandberg. In addition, the Bockstein cave located in the Lone Valley was used by Stone Age hunters. In the 13th century √ñllingen belonged to rule of Albeck and was bundled with Albeck 1383 at Ulm. The basic property of the municipality was sold since the 14th century to the imperial city, which meant that in 1790 the imperial city was almost the sole landowner. 1803 the land went over to Bavaria. Seven years later, in 1810 √ñllingen then went to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg, which assigned √ñllingen to the Oberamt Albeck. In 1934 the supreme office Ulm became county Ulm and later Ulm district (1938). The town remained a part of the district till the year 1973. The local government reform in 1973 led to the dissolution of the district Ulm and √ñllingen came as a separate municipality to Alb-Donau-Kreis.

Sources vary on the number of victims, which range from 54 to over 60 ‚Äì and possibly as many as 69. The Institute of National Remembrance, a Polish organization that carried out research into these events, has declared that the Przyszowice massacre was a crime against humanity. History After the start of the Soviet January offensive in early 1945, the Red Army broke through from the line of the Vistula River well into German-held territory in occupied Poland. By late January, the scattered forces of the Wehrmacht were withdrawn to the line of the Oder River, which was on the pre-war territory of the Third Reich. However, several German units were ordered to prepare tactical counter-attacks, notably in the region of Upper Silesia, on the Polish-German borderland. On January 23, Soviet forces seized the town of Gleiwitz (Gliwice), one of the major industrial centres of the area. On the following day, the Germans counter-attacked, precipitating a three-day-long battle for the area. Eventually victorious, on January 26 the Russians entered the village of Przyszowice, the last Polish village before the Polish-German border. During the following two days, a massacre of local inhabitants ensued. The Soviet soldiers set several dozen houses on fire and began shooting at the civilians trying to extinguish the flames. It is believed that over 60 civilians lost their lives, Polish newspapers gave the high-end number of 69. Men, women and children aged between 10 days and 78 years were killed, although most of the victims were adult males. Among the victims were four former prisoners of the Auschwitz concentration camp who had escaped from a death march the previous day. Except for two of the escapees who were Italian and Hungarian, the rest of the victims were Polish civilians ‚Äì including two former soldiers of the Polish Army, who had recently been freed by the Soviets from a prisoner of war camp. According to Polish media, in addition to the mass murder of civilians, the Soviet forces looted the village and raped an unknown number of women. The reason for the massacre remains unknown. Some authors believe that the Soviet soldiers wanted to take revenge for the losses suffered by the Red Army during the recent skirmishes with the Wehrmacht in the area. During the fighting for Przyszowice, the Soviets suffered 101 casualties and lost roughly 40 tanks. It is also likely that the Soviet soldiers did not know they were still on Polish soil and instead believed they had finally entered the territories of Nazi Germany; Przyszowice was one of the western-most villages of the Second Polish Republic, on the pre-war border between Poland and Germany. Following the massacre, the victims were buried in a mass grave in a local cemetery. Polish newspapers also note that two more civilians were killed in the summer of that year, after the end of the war, when Red Army troops were returning from Germany. A man was strafed by a Soviet plane in June, and a woman killed in July by a group of Soviet soldiers stealing a cow. During the years of Communist rule in Poland (which lasted until 1989), factual knowledge of these events was censored by the communist government, and the mass grave was kept anonymous. It was not until the 60th anniversary of the event in 2005 that a memorial stone was erected at the cemetery. The commemorative ceremony was performed by the bishop of Legnica, Stefan Cichy, who was personally an eye-witness to the events, as well as a relative of one of the victims. Around that time, the Katowice branch of the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) started an investigation into the events, as well as on similar massacres carried out in Gliwice and Ruda ≈ölƒÖska-Halemba. During the investigation, various documents provided by the Defence Ministry of the Russian Federation were examined, however, there was insufficient information to determine which units of the Red Army participated in the massacre or who was responsible for the killings. In reporting the results of its investigation, the IPN declared the 1945 events in Przyszowice a crime against humanity.Informacja o dzia≈Çalno≈õci Instytutu Pamiƒôci Narodowej ‚Äì Komisji ≈öcigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu w okresie 1 lipca 2003 r.‚Äì30 czerwca 2004 r.

ADB became ADB, Inc., in 1999. Career Stephen Cole is a registered engineer and former Texas State Guard company commander (and operations officer). He was awarded the Texas Medal of Merit with \\"V\\" for valor, a non U.S. military citation. In 1973, while a student at Texas Tech, he founded the company JagdPanther Publications, which published JagdPanther (1973-1976), a magazine which featured complete small games in every issue as well as scenarios and variants for existing games. A few years later, Allen Eldridge, who Cole met at a local game club in Amarillo Texas, joined Cole at JP. the company published several games separate from the magazine. Cole and Eldridge decided to close down JP in November 1976, and the company shut down in spring of 1977 after paying all of its bills and subscriptions. JP Publications operated from 1973 to 1977. In the fall of 1978, Cole and Eldridge co-founded Task Force Games which they used to sell only to wholesalers and retailers and not to individuals (until years later when they added mail order sales). They started a \\"Pocket Games\\" line, with four science-fiction releases in 1979 designed by Cole: Starfire, Asteroid Zero- Four, Cerberus, and Star Fleet Battles. Cole had first conceived of Star Fleet Battles in 1975, and finally published the game after obtaining a license from Franz Joseph. Cole's Valkenburg Castle was also released in 1979, and was the company's first fantasy game. Cole has designed over 100 published games on many subjects. He won two Charles Roberts awards for JagdPanther and several awards for Star Fleet Battles. Stephen V. Cole took ROTC from 1971-1975 but the Army chose not to offer him an active duty slot and was placed in the inactive reserves, never attending Officer Basic Course (OBC). He has made claim to have taken US Army Command & General Staff School (a master's degree in military science) through the Army Reserve and the influence of his father, a serving Colonel in the U.S. Army at the time. He wrote and published the military intelligence newsletter For Your Eyes Only from 1983-1999. He was a consultant to the military and DIA during this time. He has written over 200 articles on military affairs for several magazines. In 1983, as the Pocket Games line came to an end, Cole left Task Force Games to form a new company, Amarillo Design Bureau, which would be his design house for future Star Fleet Battles products. Through Amarillo Design Bureau, Cole owned and created all products for Star Fleet Battles, Federation & Empire, etc. After Task Force Games was sold to John Olsen in April 1990, Olsen moved the company back to Amarillo to better coordinate with Cole. Task Force Games published Cole's Star Fleet Battles Captain's Edition Basic Set in 1990 and dozens of other products. Cole took over publishing Star Fleet Battles in 1999, turning Amarillo Design Bureau into a corporation in the process. Star Fleet Battles continues to be published by Amarillo Design Bureau and was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming, Arts, & Design Hall of Fame in 2005 where they stated that \\"Star Fleet Battles literally defined the genre of spaceship combat games in the early 1980s, and was the first game that combined a major license with 'high re-playability'.\\" Cole was previously a contributor to StrategyPage that \\"provides quick, easy access to what is going on in military affairs.\\" Cole has been happily married since 1979 to Leanna.

Browning is a Republican politician and former Secretary of State of Florida. He currently serves as Superintendent of Schools for Pasco County, Florida.  Career  Browning's political career began in 1975 when he started working in the Pasco County Supervisor of Elections office. In 1980, he was elected as the Pasco Supervisor himself, as a Democrat. At 22 year old, he was the youngest county elections official in Florida history. He served in that position for 26 years, until his appointment as Secretary of State. During that time, Browning also served as the President of the Florida State Association of Supervisors of Elections, as a member of Governor Jeb Bush's Task Force on Election Procedures, Standards and Technology, and as a member of the State Planning Committee for the Help America Vote Act. Browning changed his party affiliation to Republican in 2002. = Secretary of State = Governor-elect Charlie Crist announced his appointment of Browning as Secretary of State in December 2006. Browning served in that position until April 2010, when he resigned to comply with state retirement pension compensation laws. While out of office, he was honorary chairman of the failed campaign opposing two anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendments on the 2010 ballot, the \\"Fair Districts\\" Amendments 5 and 6. He was re-appointed Secretary of State by Governor Rick Scott in January 2011. During his two stints as secretary, Browning oversaw the state's defense of several lawsuits challenging Florida's voting laws. He also oversaw the transition from using touchscreen voting machines to paper optical scan machines, even though as Supervisor of Elections he was a strong advocate of touchscreen technology. Responsible for the Division of Corporations, which manages corporate filings, Browning eliminated paper records and instituted electronic filing for businesses, including a searchable public website. = Superintendent of Schools = Browning announced his resignation as Secretary of State on January 11, 2012, effective February 17, 2012. Several weeks later he announced that he would run for Pasco County Superintendent of Schools. He was elected to that position on November 6, 2012, after defeating two-term incumbent Heather Fiorentino in the Republican primary.  First Term  During his first term, the school district saw a dramatic decrease in school performance. Performance grades assigned by the state showed that: * only three schools out of 79 raised their grade one letter, while 40 schools decreased one letter and 11 schools decreased by two letter-grades, * there were 50 C or D rated schools in 2016, as compared to only 27 in 2012, and * there was a near quadrupling of elementary schools on the state's low-300 list. Browning made many questionable decisions during his first term, admitting that he tried to do too much, but often not well. One of which was to eliminate school literacy, media center and technology specialists, which he was later forced to rescind admitting he had removed too much expertise from the schools. A union president representing school district employees directly related this decision to the declining test scores evidenced during his first term. A school board member also charged him with removing too much institutional knowledge from the district offices, creating unneeded new levels of bureaucracy, and taking away creativity from teachers by mandating when they should teach curriculum standards and the need for quarterly tests.  Second Term  Despite poor school performance statistics and questionable business decisions, Browning was reelected for a second term, running unopposed in 2016. Almost immediately, both school performance and his business decisions were again called into question. Preliminary graduation rates that were released in December 2016 showed that only four of 13 high schools in the district increased their graduation rate over the previous year. Also, while presiding over a contentious rezoning issue within two different areas in the school district, Browning suggested different boundaries to the school board than committees of principals and parents that were setup to study the issue of overcrowded schools recommended. Journalism students at Fivay High School actually called Browning out on his circumvention of Florida Department of Education‚Äôs Class Size Laws , reporting that their classes had 40+ students. Possibly due to the fact that local news stations caught onto this (and enraged parents started activating for his resignation on social media), Browning did not take it kindly. In fact, Browning showed up during school hours to tell the students they were spreading misinformation. Residents from both sides of the issue alleged bias during the process. Those arguments were given more credence when Browning himself admitted that he did not intend to alter the committee proposals, but then did so anyway, explaining that he made his comment thinking the committees would act differently. And once again, Browning had to walk back previous business decisions that he made, this time reversing the changes he made to his own administrative team in his first term, instead reverting to the more traditional model that he upended with his previous decision. 2020 Election As the 2020 Pasco County Superintendent Election comes closer and closer, Browning‚Äòs face was once again on social media posts activating for his resignation. The main reason for this wave of criticism was due to the fact that Browning demoted his main opponent David LaRoche, Principal of Hudson High School, to Vice-Principal at Mitchell High School . A move many Hudson High students and parents believed to be politically motivated, and one that was not in the best interest for their school‚Äôs growth. In addition to this, in his candidate interview in July, Browning was accused of making a racist remark. In the video Browning said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not talking about your super bright kids, I‚Äôm talking about your kids of color.‚Äù This was in reference to a question about the College Board awarding Pasco County to be their AP District of the Year. Pasco County students on Twitter explained their outrage by, once again, calling for his resignation - and suggested Pasco County voters vote LaRoche for Superintendent. This election is ongoing and results are expected to be announced in August.  Background  Browning is a native Floridian. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's degree in public administration from the University of South Florida. He has been involved in the Pasco County community for much of his career, including service as President of Downtown Dade City Main Street, Inc., and involvement with organizations including the Boy Scouts of America and the Pasco County United Way.

It was an internal conflict between the newly formed conservative Granadine Confederation and a more liberal rebel force from the newly seceded region of Cauca, composed of dissatisfied politicians commanded by General Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, its former president. The Granadine Confederation, created a few years earlier in 1858 by Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez, was defeated in the capital Bogot√°, with Mosquera deposing the newly elected president Bartolom√© Calvo on July 18, 1861. Forming a provisional government, with himself as president, Mosquera continued to pursue the conservative forces until their final defeat in 1862.

In order to satisfy the member states and avoid a repeat of past mistakes that had led to Venezuela and Ecuador leaving the previous union during the formation of the Granadine Confederation, the central government created a number of sovereign states from the different regions of Colombia. The Province of Antioqu√≠a became the Sovereign State of Antioqu√≠a,Law of the Creation of the State of Antioqu√≠a retrieved on April 13, 2007 and the Sovereign State of Santander, which included the provinces of Socorro and Pamplona, was created May 13, 1857.Law of the Creation of the State of Santander retrieved on April 13, 2007 The Sovereign State of Bol√≠var, which included the Province of Cartagena, the Sovereign State of Boyac√°, which included the provinces of Tunja, Tundama, Casanare, and the cantons of Chiquinquir√° and V√©lez. The Sovereign State of Cauca, which included the provinces of Buenaventura, Choc√≥, Pasto and Popay√°n and the region of Caquet√°. The Sovereign State of Cundinamarca, which included the province of Mariquita, Bogot√°, Neiva,Provinces of The Sovereign State of Cundinamarca retrieved on April 13, 2007 Sovereign State of Tolima, and finally the Sovereign State of Magdalena, which included the provinces of El Banco, Padilla, Santa Marta, Tenerife and Valledupar. The Nine Sovereign States Thus, by the time of the formation of the Granadine Confederation, Colombia consisted of a number of sovereign states, governed by the Congress of Colombia as the office of vice presidency was abolished. Despite the creation of these states, the government under Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez became centralist, contrary to the wishes of the States who wanted more power and autonomy, thus increasing the levels of friction between the two levels of government. On April 8, 1859, the congress of the Granadine Confederation awarded to the president the power to remove the governors of the member states, and on May 10, 1859, it created a second law that allowed the president direct control of the resources and governments of the member states through the creation of a number of administrative departments. Among many angered by these laws was respected and popular politician, leader of the Granada Liberal Party, Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera, who denounced the laws as unconstitutional and rallied Liberal support. On May 8, 1860, the newly appointed Supreme Director of War Mosquera declared the Sovereign State of Cauca a separate nation from the Granadine Confederation and civil war broke out. Response of the Granadine Confederation Eustorgio Salgar, who sided against the central government upon the outbreak of the war In the years prior to the outbreak of civil war, the central government under Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez had attempted to thwart growing Liberal movements by supporting counter-insurrections in the member states. Most notable of these was Eustorgio Salgar and the State of Santander in 1859. Salgar and politician Aquileo Parra were both captured by the army of the centralised government after Santander sided against the centralised government on the outbreak of the civil war, however the unrest continued to spread to other regions of the country, including Bol√≠var and Antioqu√≠a, which extended down to the River Chinchin√° near Manizales.Four Isolated Regions retrieved on April 13, 2007 Salgar, who would later go on to become president of Colombia, was released in 1861. Progress of the war On August 28, 1860, the rebel army marched on Manizales and united with various leaders from the other sovereign states that supported Mosquera. On August 29, an agreement was formed that would result in Mosquera and his forces retiring to Cauca and disbanding, with Mosquera being granted the position of President of the Granadine Confederacy in return. Ospina, however, declined to ratify the proposed agreement and the liberal forces resumed the war. Following a successful invasion of the region of Antioquia by the rebel army, the capital Bogot√° fell to them on July 18, 1861. Mariano Ospina Rodriguez, his brother Pastor, Bartolom√© Calvo and his cabinet were taken prisoner. The following day, Mosquera ordered the execution of a number of politicians and officials from the Confederacy, including Pl√°cido Morales, Andr√©s Aguilar and Ambrosio Hern√°ndez. Following the collapse of the Confederacy government and the assumption of power by Mosquera, a number of renegade generals in command of the remaining Confederate forces continued to resist, including Julio Arboleda in the Cauca, General Braulio Henao in Antioquia and General Leonardo Canal in Santander, however with the assassination of the first on November 12, 1862, the defeat of Henao at the battle of Santa Barbara, and the capitulation of Canal in Pasto, Nari√±o, resistance to Mosquera's new government was relatively short lived, and on May 8, 1863, the United States of Colombia was officially created from the Rionegro Convention.MOSQUERA, Tom√°s Cipriano de, The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition 2006 Consequences of the war President of the Granadine Confederacy Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez Aside from the fall of the Granadine Confederation and the formation of the United States of Colombia, which would itself eventually fall during a civil war which saw the founding of the modern day Republic of Colombia in 1886, Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera's assumption of power in 1861 also had a profound social and economic impact on Colombia. Fearing the strength of Mosquera's power, other political leaders in Colombia worked to avoid a repeat of what Mosquera had done with the conservative government, by strengthening a federal government based on a laissez-faire policy, in which the regional and local autonomy were protected and there was no National Army, with new rules and powers given to the nine Sovereign States and their Presidents.Political Constitution for the United States of Colombia retrieved on April 13, 2007 The new government also clashed with the positions of the church when, to help rejuvenate an economy ravaged by civil war, was put under secular control with its lands being sold to industrialists and developers. The government confiscated the property of religious communities and organizations such as schools, hospitals, monasteries, churches, land, houses and other properties that could be sold.

These were usually named after a memorable occupant of one of the apartments reached by the common entrance, or a trade plied by one or more residents. Generically such an alleyway is termed a close , a Scots term for alleyway, although it may be individually named close, entry, court, or wynd. A close is private property, hence gated and closed to the public, whereas a wynd is an open thoroughfare, usually wide enough for a horse and cart . Most slope steeply down from the Royal Mile creating the impression of a herring-bone pattern formed by the main street and side streets when viewed on a map. Many have steps and long flights of stairs. Because of the need for security within its town walls against English attacks in past wars, Edinburgh experienced a pronounced density in housing. Closes tend to be narrow with tall buildings on both sides, giving them a canyon-like appearance and atmosphere. The Royal Mile comprises five, linear, conjoined streets: Castle Hill; Lawnmarket; High Street; Canongate and Abbey Strand. Closes are listed below from west to east, divided between the south and north sides of the street. This list names closes currently in existence. Since the Council encourages recreation of closes in new developments the list is not static. New buildings traditionally incorporate the name of the close that historically existed on the same site. Castlehill Semple's Close off Castlehill Castlehill forms the western end of the Royal Mile, running from the Castle Esplanade to the junction of Johnston Terrace.

During that time, he was responsible for implementing a number of major projects in the town. Bottle Alley Known on the South Coast of England as \\"The Concrete King\\", Little had great knowledge of reinforced concrete and many of his projects used this material. Improvements to the \\"Front Line\\" sea defences allowed the creation of the first underground car parks in the UK. Also a covered 1,500 feet (455 metres) promenade between Hastings pier and Warrior Square, completed in April 1934 as part of the town's sea defences was created using concrete panels containing thousands of coloured glass fragments for decoration which became known locally as \\"Bottle Alley\\". Other concrete projects included the construction of a large open air bathing pool at West St Leonard's with a set of double decker seaside chalets in concrete. The White Rock Baths were reconstructed along with several other municipal projects such as the conversion of Johns Place into a museum and plans for an aerodrome at Pebsham St Leonards on Sea UK.

The scheme is no longer in operation as the last day on which a new worker in the U.K. was required to register was 30 April 2011.http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/ccmmanual/ccm20110.htmhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/closure- of-the-worker-registration-scheme  A8 countries  The A8 countries were eight of the ten countries that joined the European Union in 2004, namely: *Czech Republic *Estonia *Hungary *Latvia *Lithuania *Poland *Slovakia *Slovenia Note: In 2007, Bulgaria and Romania became members of the European Union but did not become subject to WRS regulations. Bulgarians and Romanians still needed a work permit in order to work legally in the UK until 2014 when the maximum extent (7 years) of this temporary measures allowed by their Treaty of Accession to the EU was reached.  Registration and benefits  Workers from the above countries were required to register on the WRS scheme within a month of joining a new employer. However, there were no incentives to do this: registration took time and money, immigrants were able to work (illegally) without it, and no immigrant has ever been prosecuted for not having registered on the scheme. Consequently, immigration data from the WRS was indicative at best. By registering, immigrants were able to claim some basic benefits, such as Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Tax Credits. However, the worker must have been employed to be able to claim these benefits. If the worker was able to prove that they had worked legally for at least a 12-month period (without a break in employment of more than 30 days) then they gained the ability to claim social security benefits such as Jobseeker's Allowance.  Exemption  Workers that were exempt from registering on the scheme included: * those who were self-employed * those who were students * those who were working legally in the UK on 30 April 2004 and continued in their employment * those who were in continuous employment for a period of at least 12 months falling partly or wholly on or after 30 April 2004 * those who had left to enter on the SAWS scheme before 1 May 2004 and had started working in the UK under the SAWS scheme on or after 1 May 2004 * those who were providing services in the UK on behalf of an employer who is not established in the UK. Abolition On 30 April 2011 the worker registration scheme was abolished. By the time the A8 countries had been in the EU for over seven years (1 May 2004 to 20 April 2011) and the maximum extent of the temporary measures, which were allowed by the Treaty of Accession to the EU (from 2003), had been reached and therefore since then their nationals enjoy the same rights as those of the older member states. While registration was no longer possible from 1 May 2011, because the scheme only required people to register if they were working for longer than one month, this meant that anyone starting work after 1 April 2011 no longer required to register.

Founded in Florence in 1977, the leading core of the PMLI began their political activity as they joined the Communist Party of Italy (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (PCd'I(ml)) in 1967. The group broke away from the PCd'I(ml) in 1969 and formed the Italian Bolshevik Communist Organization Marxist‚ÄìLeninist (, OCBIml). In 1977, the OCBIml was transformed into the PMLI. The current General Secretary is Giovanni Scuderi. The PMLI is opposed to the bourgeois democracy and during political elections carries out an abstentionistic propaganda. It is a communist party loyal to the teachings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, named \\"the five teachers of the international proletariat\\". This movement strives for a proletarian revolution and the establishment of a \\"united, red and socialist Italy\\". The PMLI believes that Maoism is the highest stage of the workers' movement. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin is held in high regard within the party due to his construction of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union; and to his encouragement of the creation of the other socialist countries of Eastern Europe. Consequently, the PMLI refuses Trotskyism, believing it to be an extremist and anti-communist diversion from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism. Furthermore, it views the 1936 Soviet Constitution as example of the existence of the socialism in the Soviet Union. As such, the party's official newspaper is called Il Bolscevico (The Bolshevik). The PMLI is not represented in the Italian Parliament, the European Parliament, nor in any regional or provincial assemblies.  History  = Birth and first battles of Il Bolscevico = The first founders of the PMLI that the party reminds as the \\"four pioneers\\" began their Marxist‚ÄìLeninist militancy in 1967, when they joined the PCd'I(ml). They were Giovanni Scuderi, Mino Pasca, Nerina \\"Lucia\\" Paoletti and Patrizia Pierattini. Afterwards in 1969, one of the densest years of the Cultural Revolution in China, those four pioneers and other followers denounced the CPI(ML) as a revisionist party, judged the left cover of Italian Communist Party (PCI). On 14 December 1969, the four pioneers and the Provincial Committee of Florence left the PCd'I(ml) and along with other Marxist‚ÄìLeninist organizations established the OCBIml and the next day published the first number of the official newspaper, Il Bolscevico. In this number, dense of quotes of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, the Organization wrote: The work of the OCBIml so was mainly the one to accumulate the forces to create a revolutionary party. In 1970, the Organization was officially recognized by the Communist Party of China and the Rome Embassy invited the leaders of the Organization to the official holidays of the People's Republic of China while the Organization sent some messages to the Communist Party of China regarding its 10th National Congress and condolences when Zhou Enlai and Zhu De died. The OCBIml had a wreath near the corpse of Mao Zedong on 18 September 1976, when the funerals finished. To achieve this \\"historical goal\\", the OCBIml immediately launched itself in the student and workers revolts of then, carrying out an abstentionist propaganda and denouncing those who they believe \\"false communists\\" as the PCI. Those were difficult years for the Organization, mainly for the lack of funds. About the history of the party, Giovanni Scuderi said: After having gathered dozen of militants of Tuscany, Lombardy, Sicily and Calabria, the Organization established the Italian Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Party. = PMLI is born = From 9 April to 11 April 1977, it was held in Florence the founding Congress of the PMLI. During this Congress, it was adopted the Constitution and the Program, the symbol (black hammer and sickle and Mao's head) and the party anthems. Giovanni Scuderi was unanimously acclaimed General Secretary. For the PMLI, this date ideally represents the beginning of a \\"new phase\\" for the Italian working class. The Italian Marxist‚ÄìLeninists argue that the first phase (1882‚Äì1921) was dominated by reformism of the Italian Socialist Party; the second phase was dominated by revisionism of the PCI; and today it is pursued by its heirs, the Party of Communist Refoundation and the Party of Italian Communists. = Political and organizational Long March = The PMLI had five Congresses in 1977, 1982, 1985, 1998 and 2008. The central party headquarters are in Florence. Since its establishment, the PMLI began a complex political work. It wanted to gain more and more workers and students and to pursue its abstaining electoral campaign. Through this work, new party centres were created and the PMLI is today present in almost every region of Italy and it is particularly rooted in the South. Many cells were created, among them J. Stalin (Forl√¨), Red Vesuvio (Naples), Mao Zedong (Milan) and Mao (Enna) have headquarters.  Ideology  According to its statute, the PMLI has as theoretical basis \\"Marxism‚ÄìLeninism‚ÄìMao Zedong Thought which presides its ideological, political, organizational and practical work\\".  Foreign contacts  The PMLI had close contacts with the Chinese Communist Party until 1981, when it denounced the restoration of capitalism under Deng Xiaoping and broke the relationship. The PMLI tried to have relations with the Party of Labour of Albania, but the party attacked it after Enver Hoxha rejected Maoism. After 1975, the PMLI had a close relationship with the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK), even after the invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam. A PMLI leader visited a CPK-controlled zone of Cambodia in 1987. After Pol Pot's arrest in 1997, the party denounced the Khmer Rouge's betrayal. The PMLI also supported the Iranian Revolution as an anti-imperialist revolution and a party leader visited Iran in 1992. In 1993, the PMLI took part in an International Seminar on Mao Zedong Thought organized by the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Party of Germany. At the fifth plenary session of the party's central committee on 11 October 2015, the PMLI took a stance of backing the Islamic State against the \\"holy imperialist alliance\\" fighting it, although it also condemned its terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere.

(August 25, 1754 - November 3, 1825) was a Spanish missionary to the Americas. Tapis was born in Santa Coloma de Farners in the Catalan Province of Girona, and entered the novitiate of the Order of Friars Minor at Girona on 22 January 1778. He was sent to New Spain in 1786, where he attended the Colegio San Francisco in Mexico City to train for missionary work among the Native Americans. He then was assigned to Alta California, arriving in 1790, where he worked at the following missions: * Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa (1790‚Äì1793) * Mission Santa B√°rbara (1793‚Äì1806) * Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo (1806‚Äì1811) * Mission La Pur√≠sima Concepci√≥n (1812‚Äì1813) * Mission Santa In√©s (1813‚Äì1814) * Mission San Juan Bautista (1815‚Äì1825) When the President of the Spanish missions in California, Ferm√≠n Francisco de Lasu√©n, O.F.M, died in 1803, Tapis took over as acting President, a post to which he was subsequently elected three times, holding the office from 1803 to 1812. During his administration, Tapis directed the founding of Mission Santa In√©s in 1804. In addition to his authority over the missions, he also served as the local Rural Dean of the Diocese of Sonora which covered that region in that period, responsible for Church matters of any Catholic there. Tapis retired as President in 1812 and was sent to assist Father de la Cuesta at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1815, where he hoped to educate the boys of the indigenous population. Possessing a special talent for music, he created a system using colors for different types of music notes which made it easier for the students to follow, and his choir of Native American boys performed for many visitors, earning the Mission San Juan Bautista the nickname of the \\"Mission of Music.\\" Two of his handwritten choir books are preserved at the San Juan Bautista Museum. Much of Tapis' correspondence has survived. The largest work is his writings in defense of the missions and their methods against the Captain of the Presidio in Santa Barbara. Tapis died at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1825 and is buried in the Mission sanctuary.

Considered as the science of the internal order of the community, it was a comprehensive term, which included today's public law, administrative science, the early political economy, public health concerns, urbanism and urban planning (important in the light of the miasma theory of disease), etc. It overlapped with the simultaneously used term of Verwaltungswissenschaft (or \\"administrative science\\") and was a university course included in official trainings. The first instruction chairs for \\"Cameralia Oeconomica and Polizeiwissenschaft\\" were created in 1727 by Frederick William I of Prussia in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt and Frankfurt.One of the Polizeiwissenschaft first practitioners was Johann Friedrich von Pfeiffer born in Berlin and was a leading exponent of the theory on economic sustainability. Polizeiwissenschaft was quite distinct from today's use of the term \\"police\\", which is strictly reserved for law enforcement activities. It included \\"Marktpolizei\\" (\\"market police\\"), concerned with the surveillance of prices and economical activity, \\"Gewerbeaufsicht\\" (\\"surveillance of trade\\"), \\"Bauaufsicht\\" (\\"construction supervision\\") and \\"Ausl√§nderpolizei\\" (\\"Foreigners' police\\").

Career Turner was with Wishbone Ash, known for their twin lead guitars, melodic songwriting and complex instrumental style, from its inception in 1969 until 1980, during which time he was a key songwriter and creative force within the band. He played on their classic album Argus to which he also contributed vocals as well the bulk of the album's lyrics. Turner's melodic basslines, where the instrument was often used as a third lead guitar, were an important part of the Wishbone Ash sound during the 1970s. In 1980, a decision by the rest of Wishbone Ash to introduce a frontman led to Turner parting company with Wishbone Ash. The frontman never appeared and Turner was replaced by John Wetton, who was formerly with King Crimson, Uriah Heep, Family and Roxy Music. Turner went on to a career in studio management and record production and also formed his own band The Wolfgang (also known as Bamboo and Martin Turner's Stolen Face). The Wolfgang recorded new material, although this was not released until 1996, when it appeared on Turner's solo album, Walking The Reeperbahn. In 1987 the original quartet reformed, and Turner produced and performed on the albums Nouveau Calls, Here to Hear and Strange Affair as well as undertaking worldwide touring with the band between 1988‚Äì1991. In late 1991 Wishbone Ash decided to continue without Turner. He has, however, appeared with Wishbone Ash on several occasions since, most notably the band's 25th anniversary celebrations in 1995/96, as well as being involved in the mixing and remastering of several back catalogue, compilation and archival Wishbone Ash CD titles. In 1996, Turner released Walking the Reeperbahn, featuring material spanning the years 1981‚Äì1996. In 2005, he formed a new band, Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash to perform music from the definitive era of Wishbone Ash. The band's first line-up included guitarists Ray Hatfield and Keith Buck plus drummer Rob Hewins. Their current line-up now includes guitarists Misha Nikolic, Danny Willson (former member of Showaddywaddy) and drummer Tim Brown. Their debut release, entitled New Live Dates Vol.1 was released in 2006, followed by New Live Dates Vol. 2 in 2007. Both featured a guest appearance by original Wishbone Ash member Ted Turner. Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash have since released Argus: Through The Looking Glass, a 2008 re-recording of Wishbone Ash's seminal album, and Life Begins Tour a 2CD/DVD recording of a performance at Leicester Y Theatre in March 2010. In July 2012 Martin Turner published his autobiography No Easy Road ‚Äì My Life and Times With Wishbone Ash and Beyond through his www.martinturnermusic.com website. The book chronicles the classic Wishbone Ash years, as well as Turner's personal journey, and contained contributions from former Wishbone Ash members Ted Turner (who also wrote the foreword to the book), Laurie Wisefield and Ray Weston, as well as other key figures in the story. Following court action pursued by Andy Powell to prevent Martin Turner using the name \\"Martin Turner's Wishbone Ash\\", in 2014 Martin Turner's touring activities were re-branded as \\"Martin Turner plays the music of Wishbone Ash\\". This was later changed to \\"Martin Turner Ex Wishbone Ash\\". In 2015, Martin Turner produced a new album, Written In The Stars. The sound is reminiscent of the classic Wishbone Ash sound from the 1970s, and has received mostly favourable reviews. The album won the \\"Album of the Year 2015\\" award in the What's On magazine 2015 awards. Instruments Turner was known for playing a Jetglo Rickenbacker 4001 bass guitar during Wishbone Ash's most successful spell in the 1970's. The tone obtained from his set-up was an integral part of the bank's early sound. Martin now regularly performs playing a white Gibson Thunderbird bass guitar, which he bought from Peter Overend Watts of Mott the Hoople.

The Braunsel flows here into the Danube. Neighboring communities The municipality is bordering to the east to Lauterach, in the south to Obermarchtal and to the east and north to Emeringen. History The castle Steinburg is the seat of the family from Stain. It was first mentioned in documents in 1331, as Berthold inhabited the castle from Stain. On August 12, 1410 Wolf von Stain sold part of the place which had formed in the meantime around the castle, to W√ºrttemberg. Bernhard Stain acquires 1557 all shares castle and village back, so that the whole place is family owned again. In 1806 the place finally fell to W√ºrttemberg. In 1817 the castle was demolished except for the castle tower. Religions Rechtenstein remained even after the Reformation Roman Catholic. The Baroque parish church of St. Georg was ordained 1744.

Pipes of water are passed through a \\"beam\\" (a heat exchanger) either integrated into standard suspended ceiling systemsPrice, 2011, Engineer's HVAC Handbook, p. 1067, 2012 ASHRAE Handbook HVAC Systems and Equipment, ASHRAE, 2012, p. 20.9, or suspended a short distance from the ceiling of a room.Beggs, 2009, p. 271. As the beam chills the air around it, the air becomes denser and falls to the floor. It is replaced by warmer air moving up from below, causing a constant passive air movement called convection, which cools the room.Hamilton and Watkins, 2009, p. 158.Levermore, 2000, p. 407. Heating works in much the same fashion, similar to a steam radiator. There are two types of chilled beams. Some passive types rely solely on convection, while there is a \\"radiant\\"/convective passive type that cools through a combination of radiant exchange (40%) and convection (60%). The passive approach can provide higher thermal comfort levels, while the active type (also called an \\"induction diffuser\\") uses the momentum of ventilation air entering at relatively high velocity to induce the circulation of room air through the unit (thus increasing its heating and cooling capacity). A chilled beam is similar in appearance to a VRF unit. The chilled beam is distinguishable from the chilled ceiling.Roth, Kurt; Dieckmann, John; Zogg, Robert; and Brodrick, James. \\"Chilled Beam Cooling.\\" ASHRAE Journal. September 2007. The chilled ceiling uses water flowing through pipes like a chilled beam does; however, the pipes in a chilled ceiling lie behind metal ceiling plates, and the heated/cooled plates are the cause of radiation/convection and not the pipe unit itself. Chilled beams are about 85 percent more effective at convection than chilled ceilings. The chilled ceiling must cover a relatively large ceiling area both because it is less efficient, and because it provides heating mainly by radiant means. Radiant heating capacity is proportional to surface area.Chilled beam vs. chilled ceiling, Severn Groupaccessed June 2019 Physics Water can carry significantly more energy than air. Although of air has a capacity to hold heat of 37 joules per kelvin (JK‚àí1), the same volume of water has a heat capacity of 20,050 JK‚àí1.Geary, 2010, p. 9. A metal pipe of water just in diameter can carry as much energy as an metal duct of air. This means that chilled beam HVAC systems require much less energy to provide the same heating and cooling effect as a traditional air HVAC system. Chilled beam cooling systems require water to be treated by heating and cooling systems. Generally, water in a passive chilled beam system is cooled to about .Hare and Fisher, 2000, p. 246.Sisle, Leonard, and Weiss, 2010, p. 152. In active chilled beam heating systems, water temperature is usually .Oughton, Hodkinson, and Faber, 2008, p. 223. (Chilled beam heating systems usually cannot rely solely on convection, however, and often require a fan- driven primary air circulation system to force the warmer air to the ground where most people sit and work.) There are effectiveness and cost differences between the two systems. Passive chilled beam systems can supply about 5.6 to 6.5 watts per foot (60 to 70 watts per metre) of cooling capacity. Active chilled beam systems are about twice as effective. In both cases, convection is so efficient that the ratio of incoming air to heated/cooled air can be as high as 6:1.Alexander, Darren and O'Rourke, Mike. \\"Design Considerations For Active Chilled Beams.\\" ASHRAE Journal. September 1, 2008. However, studies of the energy cost-savings of active versus passive chilled beam systems remained inconclusive as of 2007, and appear to be highly dependent on the specific building. The active chilled beam system employs fins to help heat and cool. Active chilled beam systems are effective to the point where outdoor air can be mixed with the indoor air without any traditional air conditioning (such as heating, cooling, humidifying, or dehumidifying), thus enabling a building to meet its \\"minimum outdoor air\\" air quality requirement. Advantages and disadvantages The primary advantage of the chilled beam system is its lower operating cost. For example, because the temperature of cooled water is higher than the temperature of cooled air, but it delivers the same cooling ability, the costs of the cooled water system are lower. Because cooling and heating of air are no longer linked to the delivery of air, buildings also save money by being able to run fewer air circulation fans and at lower speeds. One estimate places the amount of air handled at 25 to 50 percent less using chilled beam systems. By being able to target the delivery of clean outdoor air where it is needed (rather than injecting it into the entire system and heating or cooling it), there is a reduced need to treat large amounts of outdoor air (also saving money). In one case, the Genomic Science Building at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill lowered its HVAC costs by 20 percent with an active chilled beam system.Studt, Tim. \\"Active Chilled Beam Lowers Energy Use by 20%.\\" Laboratory Equipment. August 1, 2008. This is a typical energy cost savings. Chilled beam systems also have some advantages in that they are almost noiseless, require little maintenance, and are highly efficient.Hundy, Trott, and Welch, 2008, p. 316.Mumovic and Santamouris, 2009, p. 251. Traditional fan-driven HVAC systems create somewhat higher air velocities, which some people find uncomfortable. Chilled beam HVAC systems also require less ceiling space than forced-air HVAC systems, which can lead to lower building heights and higher ceilings.Gelfand and Freed, 2010, p. 146. Since they do not require high forced air flows, chilled beam systems also require reduced air distribution duct networks (which also helps to lower cost). Chilled beam systems are not a panacea. Additional ductwork may be needed to meet minimum outdoor air requirements. Both types of chilled beam systems are less effective at heating than cooling, and supplementary heating systems are often needed. Chilled beam systems cannot be used alone in buildings where the ceilings are higher than , because the air will not properly circulate. A forced-air circulation system must be employed in such cases. If the water temperature is too low or humidity is high, condensation on the beam can occur‚Äîleading to a problem known as \\"internal rain.\\"Hall and Greeno, 2009, p. 240. (In some cases, drier outside air can be mixed with the wetter inside air to reduce interior humidity levels while maintaining system performance.) Chilled beam systems are not recommended for areas with high humidity (such as theaters, gymnasiums, or cafeterias). Because they are less effective at cooling, passive chilled beam systems are generally ill-suited for semi- tropical and tropical climates. Hospitals generally cannot use chilled beam systems because of restrictions on using recirculated air. Chilled beam systems are also known to cause noticeable air circulation which can make some people uncomfortable. (Passive air deflection devices can help disrupt these air patterns, alleviating the problem.)Awbi, 2003, p. 87. Some designers have found that enlarging the ducts around active chilled beam systems to increase air circulation causes echoes in working areas and amplifies the sound of water moving through the pipes to noticeable levels. Installation and adoption Active chilled beams are mounted in a suspended ceiling and then anchored to the overhead structure, because T-bar ceilings cannot support the typical operating weight of a chilled beam. They are generally wide, and require less than of overhead space. A typical wide chilled beam system generally weighs about per length of the beam. Chilled beams are generally installed so that the center of each beam is no more than from the center of the next beam. Some architects and end-users dislike the beams because they do not cover the entire ceiling so ducts, wiring, and other infrastructure can be seen. Some designers have installed one chilled beam system around the building perimeter (where temperature differences can be the greatest) and another in the interior of the building, to better control temperature throughout the structure. Higher system performance may be obtained by increasing the static pressure of the air in the building. The systems generally need little cleaning (vacuuming of dirt and dust from the fins every five years). As of 2007, chilled beam HVAC systems were used more widely in Australia and Europe than in the United States. In Australia, the system was first used in 30 The Bond, Sydney which was the first building in Australia to achieve the rating of 5 stars ABGR. Chilled beam HVAC systems have been used at London Heathrow Terminal 5\\"The Chilled Beams Now Arriving at Terminal 5.\\" Modern Building Services. November 2007. and Constitution Center (the largest private office building in Washington, D.C.).Fruehling, Douglas. \\"Chilled Beam System Comes to D.C.\\" Washington Business Journal. November 26, 2007. The system has also received prominent use at Harvard Business School, Wellesley College, and the American headquarters of the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The multiservice chilled beam is a relatively new form of the chilled beam. Developed in 1996, it incorporates computer and electrical wiring, lighting, motion-detection sensors, and sprinklers into the chilled beam unit.\\"Exploiting the Value of Multi-Service Chilled Beams.\\" Modern Building Services. November 2004. The multiservice chilled beam was first installed at the Barclaycard building in Northampton, England, but has since been used at the headquarters of Lloyd's Register (London), Airbus UK (Bristol), and the Greater London Authority; Riverside House (London); Empress State Building (London); 55 Baker Street (London) and 101 New Cavendish Street (London).

The Aerodyne Jazz Bass is usually equipped with a split single-coil 'p-bass' pickup at the mid position and a single-coil pickup from a Jazz Bass at the bridge position. A number of Japanese domestic market 'non-export' models also come in a standard Jazz Bass' configuration. The bass is fitted with one volume knob per pickup, plus a master tone knob. The body outline is shaped like the Jazz Bass, though substantially lighter (the Aerodyne Jazz Bass weighs about 7 pounds, compared to the 10 pounds of the standard Jazz Bass). It's also slightly thinner than a traditional Jazz Bass body, due to its unusual 39 inch top radius unique to the Aerodyne series. The radius of the top means that the bridge is actually inset slightly into the top of the body. The Aerodyne Jazz Bass has a standard 1.5 inch nut width, a very slim \\"C\\" shaped neck and 20 medium jumbo frets. Lindsey Way (Lyn-Z) of Mindless Self Indulgence playing an Aerodyne Jazz bass. The Aerodyne Jazz Bass has various cosmetic features that differ greatly from similar Fender basses. The 'export model' is only available in black, with a matching black headstock facing, smoked chrome hardware and no pickguard. The neck features dot inlays, but only on the side; the fretboard has no markers on the front. There is cream binding that goes around the front perimeter of the body and newer instruments have a Stratocaster output jack while the earlier instruments have a quarter-inch jack mounted directly in the wood on top of the body. Fender Aerodyne Classic Precision Bass Special This variant has a radiused, carved basswood Precision Bass body with cream binding and flamed maple top, P/J pickups, Jazz Bass neck with a 20-fret stained rosewood fingerboard with aged pearloid dot inlays, matching headstock and a 3-ply white pickguard.

It was introduced in 2006 as a Japanese non export model, available in Black, Dolphin Grey (metallic), Old Candy Apple Red (metallic), Lake Placid Blue and Cream (with black bindings). Fender Aerodyne Medium Scale Jazz Bass (Japan non export model) This version of the Aerodyne Jazz is similar to the other Japan non-export models, except that it has two (DiMarzio-designed, but manufactured in Japan) J-style pickups instead of a stock P/J pickup configuration. It also has a medium 32\\"-scale length (812,8 mm) which plays just like a regular Jazz Bass with a capo at the first fret. The medium scale permits the use of slightly heavier gauge strings while retaining the same \\"feel\\" (string tension) as a standard long 34\\"-scale bass. Production of this model began in 2003 (prior to the introduction of the USA model) and the earliest examples had the model number AJB-90M/DJ.

Nitrile hydratase is one of the rare enzyme types that use cobalt in a non-corrinoid manner. The mechanism by which the cobalt is transported to NHase without causing toxicity is unclear, although a cobalt permease has been identified, which transports cobalt across the cell membrane. The identity of the metal in the active site of a nitrile hydratase can be predicted by analysis of the sequence data of the alpha subunit in the region where the metal is bound. The presence of the amino acid sequence VCTLC indicates a Co- centred NHase and the presence of VCSLC indicates Fe-centred NHase. Metabolic pathway Nitrile hydratase and amidase are two hydrating and hydrolytic enzymes responsible for the sequential metabolism of nitriles in bacteria that are capable of utilising nitriles as their sole source of nitrogen and carbon, and in concert act as an alternative to nitrilase activity, which performs nitrile hydrolysis without formation of an intermediate primary amide. A sequence in genome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis was suggested to encode for a nitrile hydratase. The M. brevicollis gene consisted of both the alpha and beta subunits fused into a single gene. Similar nitrile hydratase genes consisting of a fusion of the beta and alpha subunits have since been identified in several eukaryotic supergroups, suggesting that such nitrile hydratases were present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Industrial applications NHases have been efficiently used for the industrial production of acrylamide from acrylonitrile on a scale of 600 000 tons per annum, and for removal of nitriles from wastewater. Photosensitive NHases intrinsically possess nitric oxide (NO) bound to the iron centre, and its photodissociation activates the enzyme. Nicotinamide is produced industrially by the hydrolysis of 3-cyanopyridine catalysed by the nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1, producing 3500 tons per annum of nicotinamide for use in animal feed. Structure Structure of nitrile hydratase. NHases are composed of two types of subunits, Œ± and Œ≤, which are not related in amino acid sequence. NHases exist as Œ±Œ≤ dimers or Œ±2Œ≤2 tetramers and bind one metal atom per Œ±Œ≤ unit. The 3-D structures of a number of NHases have been determined. The Œ± subunit consists of a long extended N-terminal \\"arm\\", containing two Œ±-helices, and a C-terminal domain with an unusual four-layered structure (Œ±-Œ≤-Œ≤-Œ±). The Œ≤ subunit consists of a long N-terminal loop that wraps around the Œ± subunit, a helical domain that packs with N-terminal domain of the Œ± subunit, and a C-terminal domain consisting of a Œ≤-roll and one short helix. { -valign=top   }  Assembly An assembly pathway for nitrile hydratase was first proposed when gel filtration experiments found that the complex exists in both Œ±Œ≤ and Œ±2Œ≤2 forms. In vitro experiments using mass spectrometry further revealed that the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits first assemble to form the Œ±Œ≤ dimer. The dimers can then subsequently interact to form a tetramer. Mechanism The metal centre is located in the central cavity at the interface between two subunits. All protein ligands to the metal atom are provided by the Œ± subunit. The protein ligands to the iron are the sidechains of the three cysteine (Cys) residues and two mainchain amide nitrogens. The metal ion is octahedrally coordinated, with the protein ligands at the five vertices of an octahedron. The sixth position, accessible to the active site cleft, is occupied either by NO or by a solvent-exchangeable ligand (hydroxide or water). The two Cys residues coordinated to the metal are post- translationally modified to Cys-sulfinic (Cys-SO2H) and -sulfenic (Cys-SOH) acids. Quantum chemical studies predicted that the Cys-SOH residue might play a role as either a base (activating a nucleophilic water molecule) or as a nucleophile. Subsequently, the functional role of the SOH center as nucleophile has obtained experimental support.

It was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967. It was the near direct post-nationalisation descendant of the North Eastern Railway, that had merged with some other companies to form the LNER in 1923. In 1958 in a major re-drawing of the region boundaries it gained those former LMS lines that lay in the present-day West and North Yorkshire. In 1967 it was disbanded and merged with the Eastern Region. The Network Station totem design prior to 1965 The region's trunk routes comprised several important lines. Principal among these was the northernmost portion of the East Coast Main Line in England which ran northwards from Doncaster to Marshall Meadows Bay at the Scottish Border where the route became the responsibility of the Scottish Region. The eastern section of the Trans-Pennine route, Hull to Leeds, also ran through this region, as did the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway. Other connecting routes, largely originating with the former North Eastern Railway connected to the major lines throughout the then counties of Northumberland, Durham and the North Riding and East Riding of Yorkshire. The conurbations of Tyneside, Wearside and Teesside contained a high density of lines carrying not only suburban passenger traffic but also large volumes of freight generated by the coal, steel and chemical industries of the area. There were also branch lines of rural character, particularly in the remoter parts of Northumberland and Durham and the Yorkshire Dales and Moors: these rural lines would bear the brunt of closures during the Beeching period and after. Locomotives and Rolling Stock From Nationalisation the locomotives working in the region remained mainly those of the former North Eastern Railway and LNER. Between 1949 and 1951, 28 locos built to what was essentially the 1898 design of the old NER E1 now known by its LNER designation J72 were constructed in the region at Darlington Works. This was a rare, possibly unique, example of a locomotive class which was built, substantially unchanged, under pre-grouping, post-grouping and British Railways administration. A British Rail Class ES1/NER No.1 electric locomotive As the BR Standard steam locomotives became available they began to appear but with some notable exceptions: for example none of standard pacifics ever found a home in the region. Former LMS locomotive types also began to work in the region from the late 1950s onwards and became a familiar sight on the Stainmore line and on the coastal passenger routes in Yorkshire. The former North Eastern Railway freight types proved especially long-lived and many lasted until the end of steam in the region (by then part of the Eastern) in 1967. The region worked closely with its neighbours to modernise services on the major trunk routes. From 1961 it received six of the 22 production Deltic diesel-electric locomotives which enabled the acceleration of many of the East Coast Main Line passenger services between King's Cross and Scotland. Electrified lines Most lines had steam traction until dieselisation became widespread. A notable exception was in the Newcastle area where some suburban lines were electrified using 3rd rail at 630V DC. In the same area access to the Newcastle Quayside branch was by dual 3rd-rail and overhead electric traction. NER No.1, an electric shunting locomotive, once used on the Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne, is now at the Locomotion museum in Shildon, County Durham. It is one of a class of two locomotives built specifically for the branch using American designs and powerplants, which served from 1903 until 1964.

Early life and marriage She was born in Brighton, the daughter of George Augustus Haig, a merchant and landowner from Pen Ithon, Radnorshire, Wales, and his wife, Anne Eliza Fell. Her father was of Scottish descent and was a cousin of Douglas Haig. Her sister was the suffragette Janet Boyd. On 27 June 1882 she married David Alfred Thomas, a wealthy Welsh industrialist who later became Liberal Member of Parliament for Merthyr Boroughs. Their principal residence was Llanwern, Monmouthshire. Politics In the 1890s Sybil Thomas became president of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations, which was strongly feminist and pro-female suffrage. She was also a prominent moderate in the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. Her sisters Janet and Charlotte were also prominent suffragettes and both went to prison for acts of violence in the name of the cause. Her daughter, Margaret Haig Thomas, became one of the most prominent British feminists of the inter-war years. Under their influence, Sybil joined the more militant Women's Social and Political Union.

Tucker2, Harvard.edu, These genera were previously included in the family Capparaceae, but were raised to a distinct family when DNA evidence suggested the genera included in it are more closely related to the Brassicaceae than they are to the Capparaceae. The APG II system allows for Cleomaceae to be included in Brassicaceae.Stevens, P. F. (2001 onwards) Angiosperm Phylogeny Website: Brassicales. Taxonomy In 1994, a group of scientists including Walter Stephen Judd suggested to merge the Capparaceae (which at that time included the Cleomaceae) with the Brassicaceae. Early DNA-analysis showed that the Capparaceae - as defined at that moment - were paraphyletic, and others suggested to assign the genera closest to the Brassicaceae to the Cleomaceae. The Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae diverged approximately 41 million years ago. All three families have consistently been placed in one order (variably called Capparales or Brassicales). The APG II system merged Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae. Other classifications have continued to recognise the Capparaceae, but with a more restricted circumscription, either including Cleome and its relatives in the Brassicaceae or recognizing them in the segregate family Cleomaceae. The APG III system has recently adopted this last solution, but this may change as a consensus arises on this point. Current insights in the relationships of the Brassicaceae, based on a 2012 DNA- analysis, are summarized in the following tree. = Subdivision = The genera in Cleomaceae include:Germplasm Resources Information Network: Cleomaceae *Cleome *Cleomella *Dactylaena *Haptocarpum *Oxystylis *Podandrogyne *Polanisia *Wislizenia  Description  Floral diagram of Cleome hasslerianaCleomaceae are mostly annual, sometimes perennial herbaceous plants, seldomly shrubs or small trees, and some are lianas. Most of them have glands, a character setting them apart from the related Capparaceae, and contain resins, and may have an aromatic or foetid smell. The alternately set leaves, have stalks and never form a sheath around the stem. The leaves are always palmately compound, mostly with three to seven leaflets, rarely with just one leaflet. At the base of the leafstalk sit scaly, leafy or spiny stipules, a difference with its sister group Brassicaceae that consistently lack stipules, although a pair of glands can sometimes be present at the base of the leaf stalk. Hairs and papillae may be present. The flowers of Cleomaceae are somewhat to strongly bilateral symmetric. There are mostly four, sometimes two or six, free or merged sepals, that may be shed quickly or remain, are overlapping in the bud or are already separate. The corolla consists of mostly four, sometimes two or six petals that have distinctive claws and limbs, free or with merged limbs. The stamens may be placed on the level of insertion of the perianth or on a stalk, raising the bases of the stamens above the perianth. This occurs for instance in Gynandropsis gynandra. There are four simple stamens or branched in four groups of up to 12 stamens each that have a common base, and are free from the petals. When there are groups of stamens, the anthers mature from the middle outwards. The base of the stamens may or may not be fused with the female parts in the centre of the flower. The filaments may be of equal length or strongly differ, and all may carry anthers, but infertile staminodes may also occur. The anther releases the pollen through slits stretching along its length. The ovary is positioned above the perianth and the androecium (a so-called superior ovary), consists of two fully merged carpels, and contains one cavity that may be divided in two by a partition (or replum). Between ten and fifty ovules (future seeds) are set along the margins of each of the carpels. As the fruit ripens, a stalk (or gynophore) develops. The dry fruit opens with two valves. When the fruit has a replum, it has the same basic morphology as the Brassicaceae (called silicula or siliqua), and this sets it apart from the Capparaceae, that have a capsule.

He was the last Plan Commissionner before that Commission was abrogated. He wrote some twenty books, essays and novels. A former student of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, he was a professor in classes pr√©pas at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand, and in a professional lyc√©e in Hauts-de- Seine. Career Etchegoyen started his career (1979-1982) in CNRS, then went to the Industry and Research Ministry (1982-1984), before working in the Plan Commission (1984-1985). In 1985, Etchegoyen founded the Association de l'√©dition du Corpus des textes philosophiques de langue fran√ßaise. In the middle of the 1980s he created a consulting company, with Michelin among its customers. At the end of the 1980s he led the takeover of the faience maker G√©o Martel. In the middle of the 90s he becomes administrator of Usinor- Sacilor (now part of Arcelor). Politics In his book Votre devoir est de vous taire (2005), written after the abrogation of the Plan Commission which he was leading, Etchegoyen had written a few pages about S√©gol√®ne Royal. He was writing among other things about his difficult relationship with the socialist presidential candidate, when she was an advisor to Minister of Education Claude All√®gre. He found his experience working with S√©gol√®ne Royal disappointing. He drew a portrait of Royal as a character \\"obsessed with image issues\\", and outlined how difficult it was to work with her, \\"I have always had trouble having an in depth discussion with S√©gol√®ne Royal, who only thought of scoring points.\\" Books *L'Entreprise a-t-elle une √¢me?

The flagship tournament for promoting the sport in Asia is the Asian Five Nations, which launched in 2008, and which most recently in 2011 saw the national teams of Hong Kong (national team), Japan (national team), Kazakhstan (national team), Sri Lanka (national team) and the UAE, compete in the main tournament. The sport in Asia is currently dominated by Japan, the only Asian nation to be represented on World Rugby's executive council. The Japanese national team are so far the only Asian team to have competed in the Rugby World Cup, having appeared in all seven tournaments so far. Japan served as the hosts for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which saw them become the first Asian country to host the tournament. The Top League is Japan's premier rugby club competition, founded in 2003. In 2016, the Sunwolves joined the Southern Hemisphere-based Super Rugby. The team is based in Tokyo but also plays home games in Singapore.

The Arabian Gulf Rugby Football Union existed from 1974 to 2010 and its Arabian Gulf team represented five countries: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. World Cup qualifying =1991 World Cup= The 1991 World Cup was the first to operate a qualification system, the 1987 WC having been invitation-only. In the qualifying stage, Asia was combined with Oceania and given two berths. Only four countries took part; Japan, South Korea, Tonga and Western Samoa (Australia, Fiji and New Zealand were automatic qualifiers). Played as a four- team round-robin, Western Samoa and Japan finished first and second respectively courtesy of Japan's 28‚Äì16 win over Tonga, with the Japanese becoming the first Asian team to appear at the World Cup. Although they lost their first two games and did not qualify for the quarter-finals, Japan secured third spot in their group with a 52‚Äì8 win over Zimbabwe. =1995 World Cup= For the 1995 WC, Asia held its own tournament, with the winner qualifying for the finals. This time eight countries entered (Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand), and were split into two groups, with the winners of each group playing each other for the single qualification berth. The final play-off saw Japan beat South Korea 26‚Äì11. The group stages showed the inequalities in the Asian game; Japan won 103‚Äì9 against Malaysia, whilst Hong Kong thrashed Singapore 164‚Äì13. The World Cup itself did little to showcase Asian rugby, as Japan lost every game, including a humiliating 145‚Äì17 defeat against the All Blacks. =1999 World Cup= For the 1999 WC, Asia was given an extra qualification spot, albeit a repechage one. The same eight countries entered the qualification stages, but to avoid the scorelines witnessed in the previous competition, it was held on a three-stage basis; Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand competing in the first round-robin (with Sri Lanka going through); Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Taiwan in the second round (with Taiwan progressing); and then Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan in the third round. Japan again emerged victorious, with a 134‚Äì6 win over Taiwan going some way to regain the pride lost in the finals in South Africa four years earlier. South Korea took part in the repechage, beating Holland 108‚Äì45 on aggregate in the first round, before losing 140‚Äì41 over two legs to Tonga. Japan once again lost all their games in the World Cup proper. =2003 World Cup= Asia retained its single berth plus repechage spot (vs. Oceania) in the 2003 WC qualifiers. This time, eleven teams took part, with the Arabian Gulf, China and Kazakhstan joining the fray. Before Japan and South Korea entered the competition, the other nine teams were split into three round-robin pools, with the winners (China, Hong Kong and Taiwan) then playing another round-robin with the top team (Taiwan) going on to the final pool with Japan and South Korea, which would decide the automatic and repechage qualifying spots. Japan again emerged victorious, beating their previous score against Taiwan in a 155‚Äì3 win at home (their largest ever win), followed by a 120‚Äì3 scoreline in the away match. South Korea again finished second, also thrashing Taiwan 119‚Äì7, and repeated their previous repechage performance, losing 194‚Äì0 over two legs to the Tongans. =2007 World Cup= Thirteen teams competed in the Asian qualifying tournament for the 2007 WC, Guam and India joining the competition for the first time. Another new format was tried; this one more complex than previously; The first round, played in 2005, consisted of four \\"divisions\\"; 1, 2, 3a and 3b. In the second round, the top two of Division One (2005) and the winner of Division Two (2005) would form Division One (2006), whilst the bottom team of Division One (2005), the second (of three) in Division Two (2005), and the winner of a play-off between the Division 3a (2005) and Division 3b (2005) champions would form Division Two (2006). In the third round, the top two from Division One (2006) and the winner of Division Two (2006) would play a round-robin to decide the final placings. Hong Kong, Japan and Korea formed Division One (2005), with Hong Kong finishing bottom and replaced by Arabian Gulf, who had won Division Two (2005). Taiwan finished bottom of Division Two, and were replaced by Sri Lanka, winners of the 3a-3b play-off over Kazakhstan. In the second round, Arabian Gulf finished bottom of Division One (2006), and were replaced in the final round by Hong Kong, who won Division Two (2006). In the final group, Japan again emerged victorious, sealing their place at the World Cup with a comprehensive 54‚Äì0 defeat of South Korea, who went on to lose to the Tongans for the third successive time, this time 85‚Äì3 in a one-off match in Wellington.

Early life  He was born in Istanbul (then Constantinople) on November 23, 1838. His parents, John and Zena Skouloudis, were originally from Crete and his father was a businessman in Constantinople, where Skouloudis completed grade school. In 1852, he was sent to Athens to attend high school, after which he completed medical school at the University of Athens. In 1859, Skouloudis joined the famed trading house of Ralli and became a manager of its import/export business, advancing, by 1863, to head of Turkish operations. In 1871, along with Andreas Syngros, Skouloudis founded the Bank of Constantinople. Skouloudis occasionally assisted the Greek government with diplomatic matters with the Ottoman Empire. He earned great wealth, and by 1876, Skouloudis moved permanently to Athens.  Diplomatic and political life  In Athens, Skouloudis became active politically, and the crisis of 1877 provided him an opportunity to serve the government. As the \\"Eastern Crisis\\" developed into the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, Skouloudis was a secret emissary to the Albanian population outside Greece's borders. He also served as a representative of the city of Ioannina in talks leading to the Congress of Berlin which readjusted the border between Greece and the Ottoman Empire after that war. Besides his diplomatic efforts, Skouloudis also involved himself in other public service. He was appointed to the Board of Governors of the Bank of Greece in 1880. In 1882, he formed the first company to drain Lake Copais, a lake that abutted very productive farmland north of Thebes, and which sometimes flooded. First elected to the Hellenic Parliament in the election of 1881, representing Syros (and later Thebes), Skouloudis was a member of Trikoupis' liberal New Party. In 1883, he was appointed Greek Ambassador to Spain where he served until 1886. After Bulgaria's unilateral unification with Eastern Rumelia from the Ottoman Empire, Skouloudis represented the Greek government at peace talks in Constantinople in 1886. He was again elected to parliament representing Thebes in 1892 and was appointed by Prime Minister Trikoupis as Minister of Religion and Education and later as Minister for the Navy. He also was called upon by both the liberal Trikoupis and conservative Theodoros Deligiannis governments to represent Greece in seeking loans and loan extensions from wealthier governments. Skouloudis served on the Organizing Committee for the 1896 Summer Olympics. He noticed that costs for the Games were rising beyond the original estimates given by Pierre de Coubertin and gave a report to the president of the committee, Crown Prince Constantine, recommending that Greece withdraw from hosting the Games. Skouloudis, and a number of others who agreed with him, resigned the committee at that point. However, Constantine decided to allow the Games to continue and the first modern Olympics were widely considered to be highly successful, especially in comparison to the 1900 and 1904 Summer Olympics. Because of his extensive diplomatic service, the liberal Skouloudis was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the conservative government of Dimitrios Rallis in 1897. In this position, he found himself overseeing Greece's diplomatic response to its first military defeat in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897, which despite the fairly complete defeat of Greece's army, resulted in a relatively small loss of Greek territory, partly because of Skouloudis' diplomatic efforts. In 1905, Skouloudis was again elected to parliament from Thebes, but he did not serve in the government. After the Goudi Revolt in 1909, Skouloudis' name was heard often as a potential reformer Prime Minister, along with Stefanos Dragoumis, who was ultimately selected as Prime Minister and who paved the way for Eleftherios Venizelos to assume the premiership in 1910 and end the political crisis. Skouloudis was later tapped by Venizelos to be Greece's representative at peace talks in London after the First Balkan War in 1912.  National Schism and prime ministry  Following the death of King George I in 1913, Greece's Prime Minister Venizelos and new king Constantine were increasingly at odds. As Europe descended into the First World War, the pro-German king and the pro-Allied Prime Minister struggled politically over Greece's entry into the war with the king supporting neutrality and Venizelos favoring entry on the side of the Allies. Venizelos resigned and was succeeded by Alexandros Zaimis. In October, 1915, Venizelos left Athens and would later set up a rival government in Thessaloniki and Prime Minister Zaimis resigned. At that point, the king asked Skouloudis to form a government of national unity, including representatives of all the parties in parliament in his government. The Skouloudis government focused almost exclusively on the question of Greece's entry into World War I, and attempts to stave off the formation of a rival government in the north. Skouloudis was unsuccessful and Prime Minister Zaimis was reappointed by the king. Eventually, with the abdication of Constantine in summer 1917 and the return of Venizelos triumphant to Athens, Skouloudis found himself investigated for collaboration with the former king, such as the reasons for the surrender of Fort Roupel in 1916 to Central Powers. It was decided, due to his age, to not be exiled, such others, but to be placed under custody. He was charged and convicted along with his cabinet and remained in prison until November 1920. With the electoral defeat of Venizelos, Skouloudis' sentence was commuted in 1921 and he was pardoned. Skouloudis died in Athens on August 19, 1928.

It was one of the most important German aero engines in the years leading up to World War II, with thousands built. It was further developed as the BMW VII and BMW IX, although these saw considerably less use. It was also produced in the Soviet Union as the M-17 and Japan as the Kawasaki Ha-9. Design and development The BMW VI was the first twelve-cylinder engine built by the BMW. It essentially consisted of two cylinder banks from the six- cylinder BMW IV bolted to a common cast aluminium crankcase at a 60-degree included angle between the cylinder banks. Series production commenced in 1926 after type approval had been granted. From 1930 on, after 1000 engines of the BMW VI type had already been delivered, Germany was again permitted to construct military aircraft. The sudden additional demand resulted in the production figures increasing rapidly. In 1933 the BMW VI was used for BMW's first experiments with direct fuel injection. The BMW VI was the chosen source of power for numerous record-breaking and long-distance flights, including an east-to-west crossing of the Atlantic in 1930 and a round-the world flight in 1932, both by Wolfgang von Gronau in an open Dornier Wal flying boat powered by two BMW VI engines. The BMW VI was put to unusual use as a power unit for the \\"Rail Zeppelin\\" high-speed railcar. Many versions of the BMW VI engine were developed, and it was built under license in Japan and the Soviet Union. This was further evidence of the reliability of an engine with which BMW made a fundamental contribution to the build-up of German air transport. At least 9,200 were built between 1926 and 1938. The engine was license-built in the Soviet Union under the supervision of Mikulin, who then further developed it as the M-17.

Nimaathap may have acted as regent for her son Djoser.Joyce A. Tyldesley, Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt: From Early Dynastic Times to the Death of Cleopatra, Thames & Hudson, 2006 She is known to have enjoyed a long-lasting mortuary cult.Joyce Tyldesley: Chronicle of the queens of Egypt: from early dynastic times to the death of Cleopatra. Thames & Hudson, London 2006, , p. 25 & 35 - 39.  Attestations  Nimaathap's name appears on clay seal impressions discovered mostly in the tomb of king (pharaoh) Khasekhemwy, the last ruler of the 2nd dynasty. Other seals were found at Beit Khallaf at the burial sites of the mastaba tombs K1 and K2; the relationships of the original tomb owners to Nimaathap are unknown, though. Her name also appears on stone slab fragments from Heliopolis. These show Nimaathap kneeling at the feet of pharaoh Djoser, together with Djoser's wife, queen Hetephernebti and Djoser's daughter, princess Inetkaes. The relief is evaluated as proof that Nimaathap was still alive at that time and that she participated in at least one Hebsed ceremony. Nimaathap's name does not appear in the pyramid necropolis of Djoser at Saqqara; there, her name was replaced by depictions of the god of grief and mummies, Anubis.Toby A. H. Wilkinson: Early Dynastic Egypt. Routledge, London 2001, , p. 80 - 82, 94 - 97. Nimaathap's name also appears in a tomb inscription of the high official Metjen, who held office under the kings Huni and Sneferu. Metjen was \\"overseer of the Ka-house of Nimaethap\\"; thus he oversaw and administered the mortuary cult for the queen. Egyptologists take this as a proof of how famous Nimaathap must have been during the Old Kingdom period.  Identity  = Personal name = Nimaathap's name is also read as Nimaathapi; her name is connected to the earth god Hapi. This is similar to the name of queen Khenthap of the 1st Dynasty. In both cases some scholars believe that the connection between the queen's names and the god Apis refers to a somewhat later introduced title of the king: bull of his mother. An old reading once was Hepenmaat, because the syllable Hapi was not recognized as the name of Hapy yet. = Titles = Seal impression with the name and title of Nimaathap, found at Abydos.see Silke Roth: Die K√∂nigsm√ºtter des Alten √Ñgypten von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zum Ende der 12. Dynastie (= √Ñgypten und Altes Testament, vol. 46). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2001, , Obj. 20. As a queen, Nimaathap bore several elite titularies: * Mother of a king (Egyptian: Mwt-neswt-bity). The most important title of Nimaathap, proving that she gave birth to at least one king. * Mother of royal children (Egyptian: Mwt-mesw-nesw). This unique title may indicate that Nimaathap gave birth to several throne pretenders. * King's wife (Egyptian: hemet-nesw). This title appears on a granite mug, but the authenticity of the artifact is questioned by scholars. * She who says something and it is done (for her) immediately (Egyptian: Djed-khetneb-iret-nes). A seldomly mentioned title of executive powers, giving the queen the right to give any command to the royal court.Silke Roth: Die K√∂nigsm√ºtter des Alten √Ñgypten von der Fr√ºhzeit bis zum Ende der 12. Dynastie (= √Ñgypten und Altes Testament, vol. 46). Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2001, , p. 59-61 & 65‚Äì67. * Sealer of the shipyard (Egyptian: Sedjawty-Khwj-retek). It is unclear, if this title actually was one of hers, or if the jar belonging to the seal simply originated from the (unnamed) shipyard official. = Family = Nimaathap is generally viewed as the queen consort of pharaoh Khasekhemwy. This is based on the fact that most of her seals were found in the tomb of Khasekhemwy at Abydos. It is unknown how many children Nimaathap had. Djoser, his immediate successor Sekhemkhet, and his successor Sanakht are variably viewed as her sons.  Historical role  Outdated theories once held that Nimaathap was the daughter of Khasekhemwy, that she married a king Nebka and that Djoser was the \\"first rightful king\\" from that bloodline. This would have fit with the Ramesside king lists, which let the 3rd dynasty begin with king Nebka. It would also have matched the chronicles of Manetho, who places a king Necher√¥phes before king Djoser (whom he calls T√≥sorthr√≥s). However these theories are now disproven by the large number of seal impressions (and a few stone bowl inscriptions) bearing Nimaathap's titles \\"mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt\\", \\"mother of royal children\\" and \\"king's wife\\". It is now believed that Nimaathap was a princess of the Northern royal house. When Khasekhemwy fought the Northern royal house at Upper Egypt and was victorious, Nimaathap was handed over as some kind of trophy. Scholars are now also convinced that Djoser was indeed a founder of a new dynasty because Djoser and Nimaathap buried Khasekhemwy at the Thinite cemetery of Abydos, but Djoser founded a new Memphite cemetery at Saqqara. Djoser buried his father at the site where Khasekhemwy's house originated from. Together, Djoser and Nimaathap arranged the burial. After this, Nimaathap possibly supported her son for a few years, as the relief fragment from Heliopolis may indicate. After her death, Nimaathap was obviously long remembered and honoured as a co-founder of a new dynasty, as the mortuary service of the 4th dynasty mortuary priest Metjen proves.  Tomb  Nimaathap's tomb has not been identified with certainty. Some Egyptologists consider mastaba K1 at Beit Khallaf to be hers, because a considerable amount of seal impressions with her name were found inside this tomb. Other scholars think that Nimaathap was planned to be buried at Abydos, because of her marriage with Khasekhemwy. But then she was possibly buried somewhere at Abusir, because a high ranked official named Metjen was responsible for the mortuary cult around that queen. Usually, the overseer of a mortuary cult was buried close to the tomb he supervised.

It is on the historical site of the first purpose built nurse training institution, the Nightingale Training School for Nurses, which closed in 1996, at St Thomas' Hospital. Florence Nightingale Museum The collections held by the Museum may be traced back to the gifts from Florence Nightingale to the nurses at St Thomas' in the late 19th century; Lloyd Still was Matron of St Thomas' from 1913-37. There were plans for a Nightingale Museum as early as the 1930s but these were shelved with the Second World War and not reconsidered until the late 1970s. Prior to the formation the collections were displayed and received acclaim on major anniversaries such as 1954 (the Crimean Centenary), 1960 (the Nightingale Training School Centenary) and 1970 (the 150th anniversary of Nightingale's birth). The Florence Nightingale Museum Trust was formed in 1983 and is run as an independent charity with strong links with Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, with the British National Health Service in general, and with nursing organizations across the world. The Museum aims to provide excellent educational services for a range of users from special educational needs groups in the local community to international nurses.

As a goods train was passing over the bridge at Bullbridge, the structure failed suddenly, causing the derailment of the majority of the wagons. There were no serious casualties, but it was a warning of the fundamental weakness of many such bridges on the British rail network. The accident The accident happened on the Midland Railway between Derby and Chesterfield, on the night of 26 September 1860. With visibility only about due to fog, the train was proceeding northwards at only . It was a long train, with twenty-seven wagons loaded with salt, two loaded goods vans, and brake van, hauled by a tender locomotive. The heavy load caused some slippage of the engine's driving wheels on the rail. Half a mile beyond Ambergate station, the driver suddenly noticed that the engine's rear wheels were no longer on the rails. He shut off steam, stopped the engine and went to investigate. His tender was attached to only two wagons, and they were all off the rails too. There were two more wagons about behind, close to Bull bridge, a small viaduct over a local road. The next nine wagons behind were piled in a heap about high from the bottom of the road, reaching up to the telegraph wires by the side of the track. The guard in the brake van had been thrown head first against the front panel when the accident occurred, but was not seriously hurt. All the wagons behind the bridge were still on the line. Investigation Section of broken girder When examined by the driver and fireman, one of the cast iron girders of the bridge was found to have fractured, unusually, near to one of the abutments rather than at the centre of the beam. The track was supported by a pair of identical girders with Barlow rails cut to length laid across the inner flange, with asphalted ballast on top, just below the sleepers. When Captain Henry Whatley Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate examined the fracture surface, he found it rusted over, but the evidence of those who had seen it first, showed just what had happened. The cast iron girder had broken vertically from an enormous defect in the web and flanges, where there was a complete gap between the sides. The girder was completely defective here, but why no one had spotted it before the accident remains a mystery. Tyler suggests that it may have grown from an internal void with time, simply because such a defect would surely have been discovered either by the foundry or the builders. The girder had been installed 23 years before, in 1837, and should have supported a central load of if in good condition. The pair of girders should have supported a total load of distributed over all the structure, and Tyler stated that the girder was much bigger than was needed for the job. The engine weighed and the tender . The source of the defect remains unknown, but may have been caused initially by a \\"cold shut\\", where the molten metal does not fuse together during metal casting. It often occurs when two waves of fast cooling cast iron meet, but why it should have occurred only about from one end remains unknown. It could have grown with repeated loading from passing traffic, and Tyler thought it lucky that it had failed when a goods train was passing, rather than a passenger train, when casualties would have been inevitable. So it is possible that fatigue had caused the failure by steady growth of a brittle crack from the initial defect. Implications Together with the Wooton bridge collapse the following year in 1861, there should have been some concern within the railway companies about the number of cast iron girders used as under-bridges on railway lines. Engineers would also have been aware of the problems of cast iron in railway bridges after the failure of the Dee bridge in 1847. Whether or not such structures were inspected is unknown; it seems not, as several more collapses occurred some years later, at the Inverythan crash and the Norwood Junction rail accident in 1891. Thereafter, the vast majority of cast-iron underbridges on the rail network were eventually replaced by wrought iron or steel structures, although some cast- iron underbridges remain today, i.e. Robert Stephenson's High Level Bridge in Newcastle.

For historical reasons it has often been described as \\"a Protestant enclave\\".  Location and access  Carnew is a market town situated in the extreme south of County Wicklow, almost on the County Wexford border on the R725 Carlow to Gorey road.  Transport  Bus √âireann route 132 from Rosslare Europort to Dublin serves Carnew on Thursdays only providing a means of travelling into Tallaght or Dublin for a few hours. Wicklow Rural Transport operate a route linking Carnew to Gorey. History Carnew made its first appearance in historical records in 1247 as the Norman borough of \\"Carnebothe\\" with its own Royal Charter granted by King Henry III of England. A Welshman, Calcott Chambre, leased Carnew Castle in 1619, and over the following two decades established a large iron smelting industry just outside the town. He encouraged Welsh families to settle in the area, and created one of the country's largest deer parks, with a radius of about seven Irish miles. During the Rebellion of 1641 Chambre and about 160 settlers were besieged in the castle for 22 weeks, compelled to feed on carcasses that \\"had long lain in lime pits\\", by a force of around 1,000 insurgents led by the Mastersons, Byrnes and Donal Kavanagh of Ballingate, who also \\"pulled down ye pulpits, burned ye seats and defaced and demolished the church of Carnowe\\". When the besieged finally surrendered some of them were hanged, some were detained for service while the largest number, including Chambre, were accompanied by a convoy to Dublin. The castle was held by the Knockloe O'Byrnes until 1649, when it was taken by Sir Richard Talbot. Two years later the castle took a pounding from Cromwell's Roundheads under the command of Colonel Hewson during the course of which the roof was destroyed. In 1655 an edict was issued ordering all \\"inhabitants of Carne, Coolattin and Clohamon who had not shown good affection\\" to be banished, and their property shared amongst the Adventurers. Protestant colonisers arrived during the second half of the 17th century when the exploitation of the great oak forest of Shillelagh was at its peak; many were skilled specialists such as bellows makers, founders, finers and hammer men, who worked in the local ironworks, which used vast quantities of oak for the manufacture of charcoal to smelt iron ore shipped from Bristol. The 1798 rebellion All Saints, Church of Ireland On the morning of the 25 May, news of the long-expected outbreak of the 1798 rebellion in neighboring County Kildare and of military losses in the battles of Ballymore-Eustace, Naas, and Prosperous had reached the garrison in Carnew, who decided to take preventative measures by assembling the rebel suspects in detention. The suspects were marched from Carnew Castle to the local handball alley and executed by firing squad as a warning to the local populace. On 4 June, the government evacuated the town and four days later it was attacked and burned in a revenge raid by Wexford rebels, led by \\"the screeching general\\" Anthony Perry. On 30 June, rebel forces inflicted a heavy defeat on government cavalry at the Ballyellis ambush. Crown losses numbered 49 but many more died as a result of injuries sustained in the battle. Casualties included 25 of the Regiment of Ancient Britons. Following the battle Carnew was once again attacked. The loyalists under the command of Captain Thomas Swan of Tombreane barricaded themselves in Blayney's Malthouse (now Quinn's estate agents). The rebels failed in their efforts to either dislodge them or to set the building on fire, and incurred 19 casualties in their efforts to do so. Carnew's most infamous daughter, Bridget \\"Croppy Biddy\\" Dolan, spent three months as a camp follower with the rebels. As a paid government informer, she helped to convict many of her former associates and relatives. Her most notable victim was Billy Byrne of Ballymanus who was hanged in Wicklow Gaol in September 1799. On Dolan's evidence, at least nine Carnew men were transported to New South Wales in 1802. In later life she was compelled to eke out a living from the poor box in the town's Protestant church. She was stoned every time she appeared in public, and kept two bulldogs for her protection. She died aged 50 in 1827, and is the only member of her family to be interred in Carnew's Church of Ireland churchyard. The early decades of the 19th century saw the rebuilding of Carnew and Tinahely, heavily funded by the Coollattin Estate. Carnew Castle was re-roofed and modernised for the arrival as rector in 1813 of a brother in law of Earl Fitzwilliam, Rev. Richard Ponsonby (later Bishop of Derry). His successor, Revd Henry Moore, who built the high castle wall, strongly opposed Earl Fitzwilliam and his agent Bob Challoner's efforts to provide an interdenominational school (now Carnew Enterprise Centre) as a means of healing old wounds. Following a Chancery Court ruling, Moore got his way and was allowed to build a Protestant school on the only site available to him, the corner of the churchyard. Fitzwilliam's reaction was to evict the rector from the castle. Sectarian strife was never far below the surface. During the latter part of the century there were prosecutions for the removal of a Union Jack from the churchyard on 12 July. In court, discretion generally prevailed and the offenders were released with a warning. Sport Carnew has a Gaelic Athletic Association team, the Carnew Emmets. Their colours are blue and gold.

These structures are designed to be self-sufficient, being able to structurally modify themselves in response to the fluctuating internal and external forces such as changes in weather and temperature. Although this style of architecture has existed since the early 18th century period, the movement only began to mature in the early 21st century, following society‚Äôs growing concerns over climate change and global warming. These influences led to bionic architecture being used to draw society away from its anthropocentric environment, by creating landscapes that allow for the harmonious relationship between nature and society. This is achieved through having an in-depth understanding of the complex interactions between form, material, and structure in order to ensure that the building‚Äôs design supports a more sustainable environment. As a result, architects will rely upon the use of high-tech, artificial materials and techniques in order to conserve energy and materials, lower the consumption of construction and increase the practicality and reliability of their building structures.  History and theoretical framework  The word ‚Äòbionic architecture‚Äô is derived from the Greek word ‚Äòbios‚Äô (life) as well as the English word ‚Äòtechnics‚Äô (to study). The term was originally used to describe the scientific trend of ‚Äòtransferring technologies into life-forms‚Äô. The term ‚Äòbionic‚Äô was first used in 1958 by U.S army colonel, Jack E. Steele and Soviet scientist, Otto Schmitt during an astronomer project that focused on research surrounding the field of robotics. In their project, both researchers initially recognised the concept of bionics as ‚Äòthe science of systems based on living creatures‚Äô. The idea was then expanded upon in 1997 by Janine Benyus, who coined the term ‚Äòbio mimicry‚Äô which referred to ‚Äòthe conscious emulation of nature‚Äôs genius'. In 1974, Victor Glushkov published his book The Encyclopedia of Cybernetics, in which the study of bionics was applied to architectural thinking, and claimed that: ‚ÄúIn recent years, another new scientific direction has emerged in which bionics collaborates with architecture and building technics, namely architectural bionics. Using models of nature as samples, such as plant stems, living leaf nerve, eggshells, engineers create durable and beautiful architectural structures: houses, bridges, movie theatres, etc.‚Äù Later, J.S Lebedev published his book, Architecture and Bionic in 1983 and focused on the classical theory of architecture. It explored the possibility of studying the behaviours of different biological life forms and integrating these observations into building and design. He also theorised that bionic architecture would solve many problems associated with design and construction because it would allow for the ‚Äòperfect protection‚Äô through mimicking the same survival mechanisms used by organisms. By the late 1980s, architectural bionics finally emerged as a new branch of architectural science and practice. This then influenced the creation of the Central Research and Experimental Design Laboratory of Architectural Bionics, which became the main research centre for the field of bionic architecture in the USSR and a number of socialist countries.  Purpose  The built environment contributes to a majority of waste, material production, energy use and fossil fuel emissions. Thus, there is a responsibility to develop a more efficient and ecologically friendly construction design that still allows for daily activities in society to take place. This is achieved through the use of renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind energy, hydro power, and natural sources such as wood, soil and minerals. In her book, Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature (1997), Janine Benyus formulated a set of questions that can be used to establish the level of bio mimicry within an architectural design. In order to ensure that an architectural design follows the principles of bionics, the answer must be ‚Äòyes‚Äô to the following questions: * Does its precedent relate to nature? * Is it solar-powered? * Is it self-sufficient? * Does it fit form to function? * Is it sustainable? * Is it beautiful? = Styles of bionic architecture = The classifications of bionic architecture are: * Arch form structure: inspired by an animal‚Äôs spinal column, thereby creating a more stiff and rigid building. * Thin shell structure: inspired by various crustaceans and skulls due to its ability to distribute internal force across its surface area. Buildings that employ this style are malleable and flexible. * Puffing structure: inspired by plant and animal cells. It is mainly used for aesthetic purposes. * Spiral structure: inspired by plantain leaves and its ability to regulate sunlight. Buildings with this design have the most abundant sunlight.  Historical evolution  A piece of the Corinthian column capital which is decorated with acanthus leaves = Pre-18th Century Period = Archaeological data suggests that the first forms of bionic architecture can be traced back to ancient Greece and was primarily focused upon anatomical observations. This is because the Greeks were fascinated by the features of the human body, which influenced the symmetrical design of their architecture. Bionic architecture can also be observed through their use of plant elements within their stucco mouldings. This idea was said to have originated from one of Polykleitos‚Äô students, who observed the acanthus leaves decorated on a Corinthian grave. This provided inspiration for the Corinthian column capital‚Äôs design, which was surrounded by an acanthus foliage. = 18th ‚Äì 19th Century Period = The ceiling of the 'Sagrada Familia', with patterns that mirror the shapes of flowers 'The Eden Project', which has solar-powered domes Following the rise of the Industrial Revolution, many theorists became concerned with the underlying implications of modern, technological advancements and thus, re-explored the idea of ‚Äònature-centred architecture‚Äô. Most bionic architectures built during this era can be seen drawing away from the common iron construction and instead, exploring more futuristic styles. For example, Antonio Gaudi‚Äôs Sagrada Familia‚Äôs interior design drew its inspiration from various shapes and patterns of plants while its pillars mirrored the structure of human bones. Such influences were based on Gaudi's realisation of the potential for mimicking nature in order to enhance the functionality of his buildings. Joseph Paxton‚Äôs, Crystal Palace also uses lattice grids in order to mimic the human bone structure and thus, create a more rigid structure. The Crystal Palace has also imitated the vein tissues found in water lilies and the human thighbone. This reduced the building‚Äôs surface tension, thereby allowing it to carry more weight without the use of an excessive amount of materials. = 20th ‚Äì 21st Century Period = Due to growing concerns surrounding global warming and climate change, as well as the rise of technological improvements, architectural bionics became primarily focused on more efficient ways to achieve modern sustainability. An example of the modern architectural bionic movement includes the 30 St Mary Axe (2003), which is heavily inspired by the 'Venus Flower Basket Sponge', a sea creature with a lattice-like exoskeleton and round shape that disperses force from water currents. The building‚Äôs design features an aluminium coated steel diagrid structure. This allows for passive cooling, heating, ventilating and lighting. Nicholas Grimshaw‚Äôs, The Eden Project (2001) features a set of natural biomes with several geodesic domes inspired by bubbles joined together. These are made of three layers of Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), a form of plastic that provides a lighter steel frame and allows for more sunlight to enter the building in order to generate solar power. Its pillows are also built to be easily detachable from its steel frame should more efficient material be discovered in the future.  Evaluation  The BIQ House located in Hamburg, Germany The Sahara Forest Project in development = Advantages = The main advantage of bionic architecture is that it allows for a more sustainable living environment through its reliance upon using renewable materials. This allows for an increase in monetary savings due to the increased energy efficiency. For example: * The BIQ (Bio-Intelligent Quotient) House in Germany was designed by Splitterwerk Architects and SSC Strategic Science Consultants. It is completely powered by algae. It features a heat exchanger which cultivates micro algae within its glass panels in order to be used as a resource for providing the building with energy and warmth. This produces zero carbon electricity, which is twice as effective as photovoltaics. *The Sahara Forest Project in Tunisia is a greenhouse project that is heavily inspired by the Namibian fog-basking beetle, which can regulate its body temperature and develop its own fresh water in arid climates. Like the beetle, this building features a saltwater evaporating, cooling and humidifying system that is suitable for year-round cultivation. The evaporated air condenses to fresh water, allowing the greenhouse to remain heated at night.. The salt extracted from the evaporation process can also be crystallised into calcium carbonate and sodium chloride, which can be compressed into building blocks, thereby minimising waste. = Disadvantages = Bionic architecture has been heavily criticised for being difficult to maintain due to its tendency to be overly technical. For example: * The East Gate Centre in Harare, Zimbabwe had to follow a strict set of rules during its creation. Its engineers claimed that the outer walls must not be under direct sunlight, the window to wall ratio must be approximately 25% and the windows must be sealed with ventilation, in order to combat noise pollution and unpredictable weather.  Future use  With the rise of technological advancements, the full potential of Bionic Architecture is still being explored. However, due to the rapidly growing demand for a more effective, ecologically sustainable design approach that does not compromise the needs of society, many ideas have been put forth: = Ocean Scraper 2050 = This essentially involves creating floating buildings inspired by the buoyancy of icebergs and the shapes of various organisms. In particular, its internal structure will be based on the shape of beehives and micropal-radiolares in order to house different residential and office spaces. Its proposed design allows for the building to be self-sufficient and sustainable as it will aim to generate energy from various sources such as wind, biomass, solar energy, hydro energy and geothermal energy. Moreover, as the ocean scraper is intended to be built on water, its designers are exploring the idea of extracting and generating electricity from new sources such as under-water volcanoes and earthquake power. = Supercentre Beehive Concept = This idea explores the possibility of creating an area that requires less travel time between places, thereby reducing the amount of fossil fuel emissions and CO2 pollution. As this design is meant for sites that are ‚Äòalready a large hub for activity‚Äô, it will particularly be useful for high schools, colleges and grocery stores. The architectural design is also very compact and aims to increase the amount of green area, thereby allowing for the full advantage of space. = Pod Housing Units = This idea focuses upon creating a set of interconnected living units that ‚Äòcan be networked together in order to share and benefit from one another‚Äôs utilities‚Äô. The design is also intended to be self-sustaining and can be changed based on the needs of the user. For example, the roof can be modified to be slanted in order to collect solar energy, pitched to collect rainwater, or smoothed in order to allow for better airflow.

Born in Belgrade, she was the only child of well-known theatre and television director Slavoljub Stefanoviƒá-Ravassi and Desanka Nikoliƒá. After finishing elementary school, Margita enrolled in the \\"Josip Slavenski\\" music high school from which she graduated as the most talented pianist in her class alongside Ivo Pogoreliƒá. Her impressive school performance led to an offer of further studies at the famed Moscow Conservatory, which she ended up turning down due to family reasons‚Äîher mother very much disliked the idea of letting her go to Moscow by herself at such a young age. Instead, Margita enrolled at the University of Belgrade's School of Architecture where she was no less successful. Throughout her architecture studies she still continued practicing the piano as well as playing and occasionally touring with various small orchestras. After graduating university in 1982, along with her then-boyfriend Srƒëan Vejvoda, she began to take an interest in Belgrade's underground music scene, which struck her as a completely different lifestyle from the one she was used to. During the spring of 1982 she was introduced to Milan Mladenoviƒá by her cousin Gagi Mihajloviƒá. Soon thereafter, at one of Katarina II's early rehearsals, she got an offer to join the band. After returning from a three- month trip to South America she decided to take the still-standing offer, joining Katarina II in late 1982. Margita was Katarina II/Ekatarina Velika's member until its very end in late 1994. During her time with the band she also collaborated on the albums of many other Yugoslav bands such as Karlowy Vary produced by Tomo in der M√ºhlen, Elvis J. Kurtoviƒá & His Meteors, Van Gogh, Babe, etc. She composed the score for several TV films (\\"Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje\\", \\"Vera Hofmanova\\", \\"Povratak Vuka Alimpiƒáa\\", \\"Plavi plavi\\") and theatre productions (\\"Klasni neprijatelj\\", \\"Tri sestre\\"). In 1985 she was introduced as an actress (the role of Dragana) in the movie \\"Tajvanska kanasta\\" (The Taiwan Canasta) directed by Goran Markoviƒá. After Milan's death and Ekatarina Velika's end, Magi continued her work as a musician. During 1994/1995 she played in a band called Kurajberi, which gathered several Belgrade musicians and was focused mainly on performing covers at club gigs and jam sessions. In 1995, with a group of young Belgrade musicians involved in a techno movement, she formed a band called EQV and released an album Ti si sav moj bol (You are All of My Anguish) named after the famous Ekatarina Velika song, the album itself containing a techno version of the same song. The album was published by the Austrian label Coop Arts & Crafts Unlimited. In October of the same year, EQV participated in Tactic Festival in Vienna. She further continued contributing as a guest star on albums and concerts of many Serbian bands and occasionally played with bands Glisers, Zion banda and Direktori. Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band \\"The Glissers\\" 1995. and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD \\"The Glissers Vol. 1\\" for IMAGO Records. She also designed the cover for it. In 2019. it came out in vinyl form as an Album The Glissers for Yugovinyl and BIVECO. In 1996 she played several unplugged concerts with Elektriƒçni orgazam, one of which was recorded and released the same year by B92 as ≈Ωivo i akustiƒçno (Live and Acoustic). During that time she was also involved in several significant music projects (\\"S one strane duge\\", \\"Pesme iznad Istoka i Zapada\\"). Sometime in 1996 Margita became a member of Ars Antibari writers society from Bar, which published several of her stories in two books (\\"Izgleda da ƒáe Jugo\\", Bar, 1996, and \\"Da li da ti ka≈æem ko te je ubio, Gea?\\", Belgrade, 1999). In 2002 she composed the music for \\"Kaput mrtvog ƒçoveka\\" (The Coat of a Dead Man) theater play directed by Hajdana Baletiƒá, which turned out to be Magi's last ever music-related work. However, from 1996 onwards her life was mostly spent struggling with heroin addiction and the physical effects of long-term drug use. Following the passing of her father in February 1996, Margita's drug problems intensified. In order to support her habit, she sold pretty much all of her possessions including an apartment in downtown Belgrade. She used part of the money for a trip to India and also to buy two smaller apartments. Not long thereafter she sold those as well and eventually ended up living in a ramshackle modified garage in the suburb of Borƒça. By this time she was basically penniless, depending on charity and handouts for even the basics such as food.Milosrdni anƒëeo by Goran Tarlaƒá, POPBOKS, 10 February 2009 Margita Stefanoviƒá spent the last months of her life living in a homeless shelter in Vo≈ædovac. She was diagnosed to be HIV positive, which she contracted through intravenous drug use. She died on 18 September 2002 (aged 43) at the Belgrade Hospital for Infective Diseases where she had been sequestered since August of the same year. Other Magi played keyboards in Belgrade's band \\"The Glissers\\" 1995. and 1996. They performed on a weekly basis and released a CD \\"The Glissers Vol. 1\\" She also designed the cover for it. In 2019. it came out in vinyl form as an Album The Glissers. *There is an urban legend about Margita being the subject of the first-ever graffiti that appeared in Belgrade. The graffiti was written on the wall of her apartment building, and it said \\"Margita je deƒçak\\" (\\"Margita is a boy\\"), implying that she was an atypical girl of the era. The graffiti was sprayed by Neboj≈°a Krstiƒá, at the time a member of the Serbian new wave band VIS Idoli. *In July 2008, a book Vrati unatrag by Aleksandar Iliƒá, featuring conversations with Magi was released.\\"Vrati unatrag\\" - razgovori sa Magi, POPBOKS, 12 July 2008Objavljeni razgovori sa Magi iz EKV u knjizi \\"Vrati unatrag\\", Blic, 11 July 2008 Knjiga o EKV probudila duhove , Mondo portal, 20 September 2008 *In October 2011, a voluminous, richly illustrated intimate memoir titled \\"Oseƒáanja.

Directed by Michael Anderson, it stars Julia Ormond as Catherine and Vanessa Redgrave as Empress Elizabeth. Plot summary In the early 1740s, Elizabeth, Empress of Russia, is seeking a bride for her nephew and heir, Peter. She picks the beautiful Princess Sophie, a teenager from a tiny German-speaking state. It's a huge change of fortune for the naive young girl. After arriving in Russia, she is received into the Russian Orthodox Church under the new name Catherine. Though she feels like an outsider at first, she eventually becomes devoted to her new homeland, its culture and its people. But her personal life is in turmoil. Peter is mentally unbalanced and sometimes vicious. Shortly after the couple's wedding, he makes clear that the marriage will never be consummated. Meanwhile, Empress Elizabeth, whose anger is legendary, expects Catherine to produce an heir or perhaps suffer the consequences. One of the troubled Catherine's few confidants is an aging, worldly-wise British diplomat, Sir Charles Williams. On his advice, she gives up her virginity to a soldier who is devoted to her, and bears a child, Paul, who is officially Peter's son and heir. As the life of the old empress draws to an end, Peter increasingly threatens to take \\"revenge\\" on Catherine, and on Russia itself, once he occupies the throne. Catherine and her supporters at court realize that action is needed to protect her, and some warn that ultimately, the struggle may come down to her life or Peter's. Cast *Vanessa Redgrave ...

In 2013, Moneytree won \\"Best Place to Work in Colorado\\" in the small business category.\\"Best Companies to Work for 2013\\"  Origins  In the early days, Moneytree used a gorilla suit in their advertisements. Moneytree first opened on October 31st, 1983 in Renton, Washington as a check cashing store. Over the years, the business expanded its product lines to what it offers today. Dennis Bassford, an Idaho native and Boise State University alum, has been the CEO and owner since the inception, along with his brother David and his wife Sara.  Controversy  A poster showing loan Moneytree products available in Idaho. Criticism of the company and their practices are commonly based on the claim that Moneytree creates a \\"debt trap\\" that encourages irresponsible borrowing. Bassford has stated that Moneytree's products are not predatory in nature, but instead that \\"for the most part, they are [a] responsible business\\" and \\"there are people who misuse all kinds of products in society.\\" The company also claims to promote financial literacy for customers, with Bassford saying he sponsors a group of students at the University of Washington who \\"deliver financial literacy in schools\\" though he could not recall any specific programs. Asked whether he works to improve financial education among potential clients, he said, \\"We're not conducting programs with our customers.\\" In 2010, Moneytree was accused of \\"skirting\\" consumer laws which prohibit borrowers from taking out more than eight payday loans in a 12-month period. When pressed by the Kitsap Sun, Moneytree CEO Dennis Bassford responded by saying that Moneytree and Washington State Department of Financial Institutions ‚Äújust interpret[ed] the statute differently.‚Äù In March 2016, Moneytree fell victim to a CEO Email scam. A scammer impersonating Bassford send an email to the payroll department requesting names, home addresses, social security numbers, birthdates and W2 information of employees. In a letter to employees detailing the breach, Bassford said the following: > \\"Unfortunately, this request was not recognized as a scam, and the > information about current and former Team Members who worked in the US at > Moneytree in 2015 or were hired in early 2016 was disclosed.

Biography His first notable effort was playing guitar in The Extorts in early 1980. There are a few live recordings and a demo tape as evidence of their existence. After The Extorts broke up, Hampton and Henry Garfield (later to become Henry Rollins) formed a new group called S.O.A. (State of Alert) and they released a 7\\" on Dischord records. When S.O.A. split up, Henry Garfield changed his surname to Rollins and moved to Los Angeles as singer of Black Flag. Hampton then joined fellow D.C. punks Alec MacKaye (brother of Ian MacKaye), Eddie Janney, Chris Bald and Ivor Hanson and formed The Faith who released two recordings on the Dischord label - a split LP with VOID and the Subject to Change 12\\". This group broke up in 1983. Hampton soon joined Ian Mackaye, Ivor Hanson and Chris Bald in another D.C. group called Embrace. Along with Rites of Spring, Embrace is credited as a seminal emo group, however Ian Mackaye found the term \\"emocore\\" disgusting and did not accept the label. A posthumously released album appeared on Dischord in 1987, after they had split up. Hampton then joined a short lived project called One Last Wish, composed of three ex members of Rites of Spring. This band lasted only a matter of months, but they had recorded one demo which was released some years later on Dischord. Concurrent with One Last Wish, Hampton was involved in another project with Simon Jacobson called The Snakes. This group was primarily a recording project, and rarely played live. The Snakes released two albums on Dischord. In 1990 Hampton teamed up with Ivor Hanson and Bert Queiroz to form Manifesto who were influenced by the English music of the time. They released one album and one 7\\" to critical acclaim in the UK, but records sales did not follow and soon Hampton's itchy feet made him leave. He has spent the years after producing soundtrack music for many TV programmes, video games and films. Hampton lately performs in a band called Paco along with fellow members Dominique Durand, Andy Chase and Gary Maurer. This group released an album in May 2004 called This Is Where We Live on Unfiltered Records.

Considine was ratified as the Clare hurling manager to succeed Anthony Daly in November 2006 at a county board meeting in Ennis. He had previously served as a selector on the successful Clare all- Ireland junior winning team of 1993 under Scariff man Mike McNamara. At senior level he was also part of Ger Loughnane's backroom team (along with McNamara) that guided Clare hurling to its most enduring and success-laden period between 1995 and 1998. Clare ended a 63-year wait to win the Munster title and 81-year wait to lay claim to the all-Ireland senior championship title in 1995. The new incumbent had drawn the ire of certain GAA followers in Clare in October 2006 when he outlined his dismay and frustration on local radio in Clare that his close friend Ger Loughnane had accepted the role of the Galway senior management role urging Clare Gaelic Athletic Association leaders to stop talented gaa people leaving Clare. Shortly after this juncture Considine was approached to take over the role of the vacant Clare manager's role which had been previously held by the hugely popular Anthony Daly who subsequently went on in 2007 to become a respected Gaelic games pundit on national television. The new Clare manager, a native of Cratloe in south east Clare drew some satisfaction from the club delegates by announcing he would allow the county players to play for their clubs during the summer, something that had been essentially prevented by prior Clare managers over a twelve-year period.  Role with Clare ends  His reign as manager of the 'Banner' county hurlers was shrouded in controversy for most of his tenure and it came as little surprise when he was overwhelmingly dismissed from his role on 14 August 2007 at the meeting of the Clare county board. A series of events throughout most of 2007 brought great controversy upon Considine and club delegates in Clare voted 45 to 6 to remove the management from their roles at the August board meeting of Clare gaa.  Many Controversies  His appointment did not please all grassroots followers in Clare Gaelic games as it was perceived by many that his appointment had been rushed through without due process by the county board officials and the consideration of other candidates. Considine had spent a number of years as a controversial and very earnest pundit with the Irish Examiner newspaper where his critical viewpoint did not always draw the appreciation of players. Upon his ratification as the manager at the meeting in November 2006 of the 'Banner' county he announced his backroom team of Tim Crowe, Ciaran O'Neill, Ger Ward, former Clare hurler and successful club coach Pat O'Connor and fitness coach and former Limerick trainer Dave Mahedy as his colleagues in the Clare senior hurling management. A mere six weeks after securing the services of the highly respected Mahedy it emerged that the ex-Limerick gaa and league of Ireland soccer physical trainer had decided to leave the Clare training set-up much to the disbelief of Clare followers. Tony Considine explained that Mahedy was only able to commit to a six-week period and consultancy role despite previous announcements that he would be a full-time member of the backroom team. In the early season at the Waterford Crystal tournament it was reported that the Clare management had asked a medical officer and county sponsor Pat O'Donnell to leave the team's dressing room prior to their meeting with Tipperary. In February respected Clarecastle man Ger Ward stood down from his role as Clare selector after issuing a letter to the county board meeting outlying essential differences of opinion with the manager and was widely noted by many in the local media that he did not travel to Clare's opening competitive appearance of the year when running out easy winners over Down in Portaferry in the national league. It subsequently emerged that Tony Considine failed to meet Ger Ward for a second proposed meeting in Ennis to discuss their issues. This incensed the Clarecastle club and further damaged the position of the under-fire manager. It was alleged that Ger Ward had great issues over the reported treatment of certain players most notably Davy Fitzgerald a three time all-star recipient and two time all-Ireland winner within the Clare camp. Mere weeks before Clare's championship clash with Cork in a stunning turn of events the Clare manager had to survive an attempted vote of no confidence at a county board meeting. However the vote did not get off the ground for debate as a motion. It sparked senior members of the Clare panel to defend their manager and to call for people to allow the manager and players to get on with their role in trying to be successful.  Davy Fitzgerald saga  The undoubtedly shocking decision of veteran goalkeeper Davy Fitzgerald to walk away from the Clare panel a mere three weeks into the tenure of Tony Considine, has been in the view of many as the defining and decisive moment in Considine's brief role as Clare manager. The withdrawal from the Clare panel of the celebrated seventeen-year veteran goalkeeper reported in January 2007 over an alleged disagreement between the pair, was believed to have revolved around the squad's intense training preparation and techniques. This news set in motion a position from which from Tony Considine would ultimately not recover and despite Fitzgerald not speaking on the matter publicly, it had and would prove a constant milestone around Considine's neck. Tulla goalkeeper Philip Brennan became Clare's number one in 2007 and enjoyed a solid year as the Banner custodian in the absence of the three time all-star winner Fitzgerald. Added to that controversy the withdrawal of the hugely talented forward Tony Carmody from the panel in the middle of the national hurling league was another significant blow to the county team and its supporters. An explanation as to why Carmody an all-star nominee decided to leave the set-up had in many eyes not been properly explained by the manager or the county board. Clare's most influential forward Tony Griffen an all-star winner in 2006 decided to undertake a mammoth cycle across both Ireland and Canada to raise funds for the cure for Cancer in the wake of the death of his father from the disease between February and June 2007 meant Clare were shorn the service of another outstanding attacking player. Prior to the start of the Munster championship clash with Cork at Semple Stadium on 27 May, a number of players from both the Clare and Cork teams burst onto the field to engage in a pre match scuffle to the disbelief of the crowd at the venue. Subjected to huge media scrutiny and vociferous condemnation from the GAA and media commentators both Clare and Cork were issued with one month bans to four players. The media criticism of the events in the wake of the events at Semple Stadium was severe and drew more controversy on Clare with the loss of established players.  On the field performance  The Clare senior hurling team endured a poor 2007 failing to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Allianz National Hurling League. The division 1A campaign saw defeats to Wexford and Cork with the home win over Waterford the subsequent League and Munster champions the only highlight of a drab campaign. On 27 May 2007 the Clare side lost by seven points to a more decisive and talented Cork in the Munster championship opening round game at Semple Stadium in Thurles, County Tipperary on a scoreline of 1‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì11. The pre-match scuffle between these sides resulted in Clare eventually handed one month bans to Colin Lynch, Alan Markham, Andrew Quinn and Barry Nugent. The Clare manager subsequently saw his side draw Laois, Antrim and Galway in the back-door qualifiers, which affords previously beaten teams in the championship another chance to prove themselves in the hurling championship series. In Clare hurling's most glorious era when three Munster titles and two all-Ireland titles were secured between 1995 and 1998, Tony Considine served as selector to Ger Loughnane the Clare manager of the time. Ger Loughnane was announced as Galway manager at the end of 2006 and the draw which pitted Clare his former team, against his new Galway charges drew huge interest and a large crowd to Cusack Park, Ennis on 7 July 2007 in the second of the backdoor qualifiers. Indeed, the official declaration of an attendance of 14,000 drew laughter from many sections of the Ennis crowd that seemed much closer to 20,000 as they awaited the return of Ger Loughnane against his native county. However a poor match ensued with Clare narrowly defeating Galway by 2‚Äì10 to 0‚Äì14 thanks to a goal in each half, first from Declan O'Rourke and in the second half from Niall Gilligan, which proved the difference between the two sides. Previously Clare defeated Antrim at Casement park and following an unconvincing final qualifier win over Laois at O'Moore park in Portlaoise, Clare emerged top of group A to qualify for the quarter-final of the all- Ireland. Clare were drawn to face 2007's surprise packages Limerick, the Munster finalists who had drawn huge praise following their enduring three game series with Tipperary in the Munster championship. On 29 July 2007,Tony Considine served his final game in charge of Clare as their near neighbours Limerick proved far too strong to end the Clare team's championship hopes with Andrew O'Shaughnessy proving his credentials in the Limerick attack as one of the game's bright new talents to inspire Richie Bennis's side to an all- Ireland semi-final appearance against Waterford. Limerick defeating Clare. which Limerick eventually won after a classic encounter to reach the all- Ireland final against current champions Kilkenny. Limerick's passion, work ethic and team spirit in contrast to Clare who fielded Gerry Quinn at centre half-back despite carrying a very serious knee injury picked up against Galway in the qualifiers.  Post sacking  Tony Considine outlined to a number of media outlets that he was not officially told of his removal from the job in the wake of his and his backroom team's dismissal. Clare's initial back room team of six was halved prior to the county board meeting on 14 August when Tubber man Pat O'Connor stepped down from his role. Considine outlined his disappointment at the manner of his dismissal by likening members of the Clare county board to the 'mafia' clearly displaying his disappointment at the news. Its widely expected and speculated that Tony Considine will resume his work as a hurling media pundit in the near future although this has not been substantiated by the outgoing Clare manager. Considine previously guided the Limerick club Garryspillane to their solitary county senior title in 2005 and could prove a catalyst as a means of a return to the role of a hurling team manager. The Clare county board have confirmed their intention to fill the vacant Clare role swiftly with Considine's former selector Ger Ward and former Clare hurler and selector Alan Cunningham early favourites for the role. Davy Fitzgerald has been reported as ruling himself out of contention for the role despite his strong track record of success with Limerick third level facility LIT, native club Sixmilebridge as well as a host of club teams all over Ireland.

It is on the island of Maui, Hawaii, on Kauiki Head. Location Kaihalulu Bay and Red Sand Beach lie at , on the side of Ka'uiki Head, which is a cinder cone just south of Hana Bay, on the eastern coast of Maui island. The bay name comes from kai halulu which means \\"roaring sea\\" in the Hawaiian language. The hill name comes from ka uiki which means \\"the glimmer\\". It was the site of a fortress and temple (heiau) where several battles were fought against invaders from Hawaii island. It was also the birthplace of powerful civil leader Queen Kaahumanu. Red Sand Beach is partially shielded from the rough open ocean by an offshore reef. The result is a natural sea wall that protects the bay from large waves. Kaihalulu is one of the few red sand beaches in the world. The sand is a deep red-black, which contrasts with the blue water, the black sea wall, and the green ironwood trees. The cinder cone behind the beach erodes constantly, which continually enlarges the cove. This hill is rich in iron and is why the beach's sand is such a deep red. Kaihalulu is extremely isolated and requires a fairly short, yet perilous hike to reach. The trail to the beach crosses over private property and follows a ridge high above the ocean below. The path is rather steep and narrow and is quite slippery due to the loose and crumbling cinder as well as needles from nearby ironwood trees. The trail also passes by an ancient Japanese cemetery. Because of the beach's isolation and difficult access, some visitors consider it to be clothing optional.

Barely hanging on, Olympus Hills slowly began to recover. As the only shopping center located of the I-215 belt route in Utah, it once again began to attract the attention of bigger clients. In 2004 the Shopping Center was put back on the hot seat, as a billboard was erected directly in front of the shopping center at a small gas station owned by another party.Alan Edwards, \\"Billboard's a sign of anger: Residents say it mars their view, want it removed\\", Deseret Morning News (Thursday, Aug. 26, 2004). The community was in an outrage, and instantly accused the shopping center of this action. The center defended itself from the onslaught of people protesting. Reagan sign company refused to respond to letters and phone calls. In return they instead posted US Marine Corps advertisements along with Air Force. Working hand in hand with the community leaders, legislation was agreed upon and the sign was finally removed. Once again the shopping center struggled a little, but it pushed forward much faster this time.

It is a layer that exists between UE and eNB and exists at the IP level (Layer 3/Network Layer). This protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.331 3GPP TS 25.3331 Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification for UMTS and in TS 36.331 3GPP TS 36.331 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA); Radio Resource Control (RRC); Protocol specification for LTE. RRC messages are transported via the PDCP-Protocol. The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the user and control planes according to the network status and allows for Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented. The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of resources are available at different states the quality of the service that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are influenced by this state machine.  RRC inactivity timers  The configuration of RRC inactivity timers in a W-CDMA network has considerable impact on the battery life of a phone when a packet data connection is open. The RRC idle mode (no connection) has the lowest energy consumption. The states in the RRC connected mode, in order of decreasing power consumption, are CELL_DCH (Dedicated Channel), CELL_FACH (Forward Access Channel), CELL_PCH (Cell Paging Channel) and URA_PCH (URA Paging Channel). The power consumption in the CELL_FACH is roughly 50 percent of that in CELL_DCH, and the PCH states use about 1-2 percent of the power consumption of the CELL_DCH state. The transitions to lower energy consuming states occur when inactivity timers trigger. The T1 timer controls transition from DCH to FACH, the T2 timer controls transition from FACH to PCH, and the T3 timer controls transition from PCH to idle. Different operators have different configurations for the inactivity timers, which leads to differences in energy consumption.L. de Bruynseels, ‚ÄúTuning Inactivity Timer Settings in UMTS‚Äù, white paper, Commsquare Ltd., 2005 Another factor is that not all operators use the PCH states.

Hohenpei√üenberg is situated in the Bavarian Oberland, in the alpine uplan. It exists only as a local subdistrict.  Geography  The highest point is the peak of the 988 meter high Hoher Pei√üenberg (high Pei√üenberg). Because of the panoramic view from it, it is also called the Bavarian Mount Parnassus or the Bavarian Mount Rigi. It is regarded as the most beautiful panoramic mountain of Bavaria and it is also a favoured destination for excursions. Formerly it was referred to as the Mount Doctus, due to the scholarliness of the meteorological research taking place at its peak. The largest part of the areas population is found on the south side of the mountain, a smaller part on the west side (districts of Hetten and Buchschorn); a yet smaller part of the population is found on the north and the east side. The region is situated on the left bank of the Ammer. The Ammer flows south of the local center in a small ravine called the \\"Schnalz\\". = Climate = The climate is oceanic (K√∂ppen: Cfb), affected by altitude and proximity to the Alps (especially in precipitation). Registering data continuously since 1781, the Hohenpei√üenberg Observatory is the oldest in the world located on a mountain. The station located in the alpine foothills integrates the German Meteorological Network and served for the program Global Atmospheric Watch program (GAW).  Local History  In 1514 a chapel was built on the Hohen Pei√üenberg. A carved image of the Mother of God was brought there from the castle chapel in Schongau. The figure soon became renowned as being a figure of mercy and pilgrimage to it began. Because of this, a second church, the Pilgrims church, was added to the chapel. Thus the two churches we know today came to be. The chapel lies west of the church tower, the pilgrims church lies east. The ensemble lends the peak its unique silhouette. From 1604 until the secularization in 1803, the augustinian canons regulars in charge of the cloister Rottenbuch also supervised the pilgrimage to the Hohen Pei√üenberg. The large ceiling fresco by Matth√§us G√ºnther inside the chapel of Mercy also depicts the committal of the pilgrimage site to the cloister Rottenbuch. It was the Augustinian monks who also carried out the first meteorological observations on the site and these have been carried out continuously since 1781, making Hohenpei√üenberg Meteorological Observatory the oldest meteorological station in the world. Following the secularization, it was initially the priests and the school teachers who carried on recording and observing meteorological conditions; after World War II the German Meteorological Service took over this duty. The monks also ran a school on the mountain. The Volksschule was founded by the Augustinian regular Primus Koch (1752-1812) and in April 1802 it first opened its doors to students.Hubert Assum, Lepold M√ºhlegger, Max Biller: Schulgeschichte. In: Max Biller: Hohenpei√üenberger Heimat-Lexikon, page 468 In lieu of the bavarian administrative reform, the community edict gave rise to the local centres as we now know them. Formerly, the district belonged to Peiting. Hohenpei√üenberg belonged to the reformation of Munich and to the district of Schongau which in turn is part of the electorate of Bavaria. The first building section of the former school was built after the monks time there from 1882 until 1883.Hubert Assum, Lepold M√ºhlegger, Max Biller: Schulgeschichte. In: Max Biller: Hohenpei√üenberger Heimat-Lexikon, page 471 = Mining = The discovery of pitch coal as the 1600s gave rise to mining activity in the area, mostly on a small scale. State-owned mining began on May 8, 1837 with the inset of the so- called Hauptstollen (main adit) in the area of Brandach, whereby the initial sinking of the Unterbauschacht (Unterbau shaft) took place from the first of July 1889 onwards.Max Biller, Ludwig Stippel: Bergbau und Bergbau-Museum am Hohen Pei√üenberg, 3. erweiterte Auflage von 2006, page 28 A 3.6-kilometer-long cable car, operating from 1898 to 1928, transported coal from the coal washing plant to the Tiefstollen (deep adit) in Pei√üenberg. Old adits exist in the region, the Hauptstollen is open to guided tours several times a year. The air shaft at the Hohenpei√üenberg train station was sunk from 1937 to 1939. From mid-October 1960 onwards it was the deepest shaft in Bavaria, measuring a depth of 1150 meters.Werksinformation f√ºr die Belegschaft des Kohlenbergwerks Pei√üenberg, Nummer 1, Januar 1961, page 6Max Biller, Ludwig Stippel: Bergbau und Bergbau-Museum am Hohen Pei√üenberg, 3. erweiterte Auflage von 2006, page 33 There was also an air shaft in the district of Klausen. Mining in the Pei√üenberg basin discontinued first in Peiting (in 1968) and in 1971 in Pei√üenberg. The closure of the Pei√üenberg pit also marked the end of mining activities in the area. Until 1972, the border of the administrative districts Schongau and Weilheims ran through the village. Now Hohenpei√üenberg is the local center of the new administrative district of Weilheim-Schongau. In 1978 a large part of the former community of Ammerh√∂fe was added to the area of Hohenpei√üenberg, because of the restructuring of the administrative district of Weilheim-Schongau of April 12, 1976.Max Biller: Gemeindegebiet/Gemeindegebietsreform.

The Arlanda Line branches from the East Coast Line at Rosersberg and rejoins again at Myrbacken. It is built for speeds of , is electrified at and is double track. The section under the airport runs in a tunnel, and has three stations: Arlanda South, Arlanda Central and Arlanda North. The Arlanda Express operates four times per hour, increasing to six times per hour during rush hour, to and from Stockholm Central Station, the largest railway station in Sweden and in the Nordic region. Operated by A-Train, the service uses seven X3 trains and calls at the north and south stations. The line is also served by 70 other regional and intercity trains daily, operated by SJ, SJ Norrlandst√•g and (with very limited service) Uppt√•get, and since December 2012 also by Stockholm Commuter Rail. These all stop at Arlanda Central. In 1994, A-Train was awarded the right to build the line in a public‚Äìprivate partnership, where A-Train financed about half the 6 billion Swedish krona (SEK) to build the line. The private consortium was granted a 40-year permit to operate the line in exchange for all direct traffic and the right to collect usage fees from other train companies. The line opened in 1999 and A-Train holds the sole right to operate to Stockholm, and collects a fee from other train operators using the line. The line itself is owned by Arlandabanan Infrastructure AB, which is owned by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. Service The Arlanda Express is the main operator of the line and offers a direct service from Stockholm Central Station to Arlanda North Station and Arlanda South Station up to six times per hour. Travel time is 20 minutes using the company's seven X3 trains. Since 9 December 2012, Stockholm commuter rail trains stop at Arlanda Central every 30 minutes (60 minutes on weekend mornings and nights). It takes 38 minutes from Arlanda C to Stockholm C, and 18 minutes to Uppsala C.Commuter rail service now available at Stockholm Arlanda . Swedavia. Retrieved 5 August 2013. The station is also served by 70 daily long-distance trains operated by SJ. SJ operates northbound X 2000 trains from Stockholm, which may continue southwards to destinations in southern Sweden. SJ Norrlandst√•g, a subsidiary of SJ, operates Norrlandst√•get (\\"The Norrland Train\\") with two daily connections from Stockholm to Narvik. From 2006 to 2012, Uppt√•get operated a commuter train service every 30 minutes between Upplands V√§sby and Uppsala via Arlanda C. At Upplands V√§sby, passengers could transfer to Stockholm commuter rail. When Stockholm commuter rail started its service from √Ñlvsj√∂ (Tumba) to Uppsala C, Uppt√•get ended its commuter service, except for a few morning and night trains on weekends. In 2007, the line transported 4 million people, of which 2.7 million were air passengers who used the Arlanda Express, 0.6 million were employees at the airport, and 0.7 million traveled with other train operators. Between 1,200 and 1,500 passengers board and disembark Uppt√•get trains at the airport each day. There are no freight trains because of safety considerations in the underground station. Before construction there was a plan to transport aviation fuel to the airport, which was transported by truck from the port of Stockholm. Since 2006 the fuel is transported by train on the old line to M√§rsta and transported by pipeline to the airport. History Entrance to Arlanda Central Station from the airport Plans for an airport rail link from the central business district of Stockholm and the airport was launched in the early 1980s. The goal was to reduce road congestion and emissions while allowing Arlanda to keep increasing passenger numbers. The Swedish Rail Administration made a specific plan in the late 1980s which involved the construction of a branch from the existing East Coast Line. This resulted in a project plan which was launched in 1990, which specifically suggested Rosersberg and Odensala as the intersections with the existing line. The political decision to build the line was taken in 1993. Estimates at the time gave a ridership of 5.1 million passengers per year in 2005. The Swedish Rail Administration had proposed that the line was to be built with the government agency as owner and with either SJ or private railway companies as train operators. However, the Cabinet of Carl Bildt wanted private sector involvement in the construction and operation of the line. In 1993, the Government put in place a public tender to build and operate the line. In 1994, Arlanda Link Consortium was chosen, consisting of the Nordic Construction Company, SIAB, Vattenfall, GEC-Alsthom and Mowlem. A-Banan Projekt AB was established as a limited company in 1994 to oversee the project. The consortium established A-Train AB to be the project developer and then operate the Arlanda Express until 2040. The legal responsibility for the project was transferred from the consortium to A-Train in 1995. As part of the agreement, A-Train received from the Swedish Government 850 million Swedish krona (SEK) in a grant and SEK 1 billion in a loan to help finance the project. The company was also allowed to operate a shuttle service from Stockholm C to Arlanda and charge a non-discriminating fee for all other trains using the line. Total investment costs for the project were SEK 6 billion, of which SEK 2 billion was financed through state grants to the Swedish Rail Administration who built the quadruple track along the East Coast Line. The public‚Äìprivate partnership part of the project involved two new tracks at Stockholm C and the Arlanda Line, costing SEK 4.1 billion. Of this, SEK 2.4 billion was financed by the state. In addition, the state held a financial guarantee to Nordea for the X3 trains, should A-Train fail to meets its financial obligations to the bank. A-Train was also granted an interest- free deferral on the payment of the fees at Stockholm C and Arlanda, costing the state SEK 90 million. Of A-Train's capital loan for SEK 2.2 billion, SEK 1.8 billion was borrowed from three state-owned financial institutions: the Swedish National Debt Office, the Swedish Export Credit Corporation and the Nordic Investment Bank. In addition, 20% of the share capital was secured through Vattenfall's equity in the company. X3 on the East Coast Line The Arlanda Line and the Arlanda Express started operations on 25 November 1999. After the construction was completed, the ownership of the infrastructure was transferred to A-Banan Projekt. However, A-Train is responsible for paying for all maintenance and operating costs of the line. In 2004, A-Train was bought by Macquarie Group, who paid SEK 70 million for the company, in addition to taking over debt worth SEK 330 million. In 2004, the Swedish National Audit Office criticized the process of building and financing the Arlanda Line, and stated that the State had taken more financial risk than the Riksdag had been informed about. It also criticized the Government for giving additional financial support to A-Train in the form of guarantees without informing the Riksdag, and having an unclear management strategy. It also commented that the traffic forecasts during planning were incorrect. The original plans showed an economic benefit of SEK 4 billion. However, because A-Train is free to set its ticket prices as it wishes, the high prices resulted in too few passengers taking the Arlanda Line for it to be of economic benefit to the Swedish community, and the line failed to maximise its economic impact through reduced road congestion and emissions. In 2006, Uppt√•get started operating on the Arlanda Line. In 2008, A-Banan Projekt changed its name to Arlanda Infrastructure. Storstockholms Lokaltrafik stated in 2008 that they intended to use the line for a new branch of the Stockholm Commuter Rail. In a motion passed by the Riksdag on the 7 October 2008, the Arlanda Line Agreement was unanimously criticized and characterized as the \\"worst possible agreement Arlanda could have\\". A-Train is free to set whatever fees its sees fit on the line, both regarding their own ticket prices on the Arlanda Express and what fees it charges other train operators. This framework had resulted in a significant rise in ticket prices and results in a low levels of public transport use for ground transportation to the airport. The Swedish State holds an option to purchase the traffic rights from A-Train in 2010, which would eliminate the fees and allow other operators to run directly from the airport to the city center. As of 2008, the train had a 9% market share for employees and a 25% market share for passengers traveling to the airport. Commentators and politicians have stated that the business model results in a low utilization of the line because of the high ticket prices, which has caused the airport to not reach its targeted emission goals. The CEO of A-Train, Per Thorstensson, stated that it would be a waste of tax payers' money to purchase the line in 2010, as the state would receive the line free of charge in 2040. Originally A-Train was required to accumulate capital of SEK 600 million before it could pay dividends, but this was changed to SEK 150 million in 2008, after an agreement was made with Arlandabanan Infrastructure. Organization The Arlanda Line in its entirety is owned by the state-owned Arlanda Infrastructure, which also owns platforms 1 and 2 at Stockholm C. A-Train holds a monopoly on the right to transport passengers from Stockholm to Arlanda; other train operators only have the right to transport passengers to the airport from other towns and cities. In 2008, the cost of a boarding or embarking passenger at Arlanda C was SEK 75\\\\. This results in a ticket from Uppsala to Arlanda costing SEK 136, while a ticket on the same train but traveling onwards to Stockholm C only costs SEK 64. Similarly the cost of a ticket to the airport with the Arlanda Express is considerably higher than that of a ticket to Uppsala, which is twice as far away.

Anchor stores are Dillard's, Macy's, and Nordstrom. History Originally known as Kenwood Plaza, the linear strip shopping center opened in 1956. At first, it was anchored only by Cincinnati-based McAlpin's. An H & S Pogue was in business by 1959. The PLAZA was situated on a tract, north of downtown Cincinnati. The site is not located inside a physical city limits, but lies within Sycamore Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, in an area commonly known as Kenwood, Ohio. The original center underwent a major renovation in the late 1980s. The eastern half of the structure was razed. The western portion, and the two anchor stores, were incorporated into the first phase of a , enclosed shopping mall. Renamed Kenwood Towne Centre, it opened in October 1987. The second phase of the project involved the construction of a second, bi-level mall concourse, with Columbus-based Lazarus department store on its northern end completed in late 1988. In 1983, Pogue's merged with their Indianapolis-based sister store L. S. Ayres and the store name changed accordingly. In 1988, L. S. Ayres closed all their Cincinnati locations. The Kenwood anchor was sold to JCPenney which closed in 1993. Birmingham, Alabama-based Parisian purchased the location in 1993. That store closed in February 2007 after Parisian was purchased by Belk of Charlotte, North Carolina. The building was demolished to make way for a new Nordstrom store on the same site that dedicated on September 25, 2009. The original McAlpin's anchor was renamed Dillard's in 1998 after McAlpin's parent, Mercantile Stores was bought by Dillard's. The Lazarus store, built during the 1988 renovation, was renamed Lazarus-Macy's in 2003. The store fully adopted the Macy's name in 2005. In 2005, renovations expanded the Macy's to over , and added an adjacent, multi-level parking garage to the rear of the store. The entire south facade of the mall was expanded to create an exterior streetscape of restaurants and retail with more inviting entrance features, designed by local architecture and interior design firm FRCH Design Worldwide. A remodeling in 2007 consisted of the razing of the former Pogue's/Parisian anchor (on the mall's southwest end). The store was replaced by a 2-level (140,000 square foot) Nordstrom department store that opened on September 25, 2009. An extension of the mall concourse designed by FRCH was created to access the new anchor. In 2018, Macy‚Äôs revealed that their Kenwood store was one of their ‚ÄúGrowth 50‚Äù stores meaning that it is one of their highest performing locations nationwide. Because of this, the store received a series of renovations and improvements including new carpeting and paint as well as many other beneficial updates. In 2019, Forever 21 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and announced that they intend to close most Cincinnati area locations including the Kenwood store. However, an official closing date has not been determined or disclosed yet as of now and the store and the other announced closures in the metropolitan area remain open until further notice. The other area locations the company intends to shutter are the locations at Liberty Center, Dayton Mall, and their outlet location at the Tanger Outlets in Jeffersonville, Ohio. During the 2019 holiday season, the mall implemented a youth escort policy/curfew in response to a fight in one of the mall‚Äôs stores. The policy requires teens ages 18 and under to be with an adult age 21 or older on December 27, 28, and 30 after 4 pm, December 29 and December 31 (Net Year‚Äôs Eve) after 2 pm. The curfew only applies to the 2019 holiday season and is scheduled to be lifted as of January 1.

The model's inventors believe that the current economic system is unsustainable, because they believe it exists to produce maximum profits and ever increasing growth for a minority of investors on a planet with limited resources. They assert that growth is driven by consumer purchases which result in ever increasing debt on the populace, ever decreasing resources, unending production of waste, and excessive industrial activity that the group believes leads to global warming. Under the E2M model, regional communities would share in the equity of corporations which are then patronized by community members, thus creating income streams to the E2M Regional Economic Councils (E2M-REC) which would act in the best interests of the regional community. Wealth earned by the community under E2M would then be invested in additional business start-ups in which the E2M-RECs own even more equity. E2M.org is the organization that charters the E2M Regional Economic Councils. These councils are independent of E2M.org and each other, yet may collaborate to develop broader initiatives where necessary to address national and international issues. The group asserts that as the community wealth held by the E2M-RECs grows, investments in businesses will increase as well as social investments which might include mortgages of 50 year terms and 1 percent interest rates, purchases of commercial and residential real estate to be rented at stable rates over decades, and other investments based on the goal of achieving adequate profits and sustainable growth for the common good. The group states that this would counterbalance the traditional investment goal of maximum profits and maximum growth for the private investor, which they believe to be an unsustainable investment criterion that endangers the planet and its inhabitants. The economic model E2M is designed to enable local communities to create the wealth necessary to address their socioeconomic and environmental problems. The E2M.org economic model consists of three main groups: # The E2M Regional Economic Council (E2M-REC) - a 24-member body composed of community representatives, tasked with managing the funds to serve the best interests of the regional community. # The Community - the geographically defined economic community # E2M Certified Businesses - companies that sign an agreement with their local E2M-REC, which outlines their economic commitment to the E2M-REC and what benefits they can expect from E2M certification. =Board of directors= E2M.org was founded on January 1, 2000 by Michael Garjian, an entrepreneur from western Massachusetts.

He names his favourite musical artists of the time such as Muddy Waters, Jimmie Rodgers,Rogan, No Surrender, p.20 (*refers to the country singer) and Lead Belly, along with author Jack Kerouac and his books The Dharma Bums and On the Road,Hinton, Celtic Crossroads, p.235 and even Buddhist judge Christmas Humphreys and his \\"... book on Zen.\\" He was soon to leave his boyhood behind and after joining the Monarchs, spend several months in Scotland, Germany and England touring with them as the International Monarchs. According to Steve Turner in \\"Cleaning Windows\\" \\"Van sketched the details of his life during 1961 and 1962, and captured the balance between his contentment at work and his aspirations to learn more about music. It conveyed the impression that his happiness with the mundane routine of smoking Woodbine cigarettes, eating Paris buns and drinking lemonade was made possible by the promise that at the end of the day he could enter the world of books and records...\\"Turner, Too Late to Stop Now, p.31 John Milward wrote in a 1982 Rolling Stone review: \\"Hung on a metaphor as clear as glass, 'Cleaning Windows' applies one night's notions to a lifetime. It's the LP's musical highlight as well, with a guitar-organ combination reminiscent of the Band, and a jumping sax solo to boot. Shaking himself awake each morning, the dedicated romantic looks to see how he's grown. Peppered with fraternal details that recall 'And It Stoned Me,' 'Cleaning Windows' boldly restates the self-help maxim that you are your own best friend.\\" Paul Macinnis with The Guardian wrote: \\"The message of the song is simple ‚Äì the window cleaner's happy in his work ‚Äì and the lyrical vignettes combined with delicate, upbeat R&B; (with Mark \\"That ain't working\\" Knopfler on guitar) convey that feeling wonderfully.\\" In his descriptions of the songs on Beautiful Vision, Erik Hage wrote that this song is an exception as it is \\"stuffed with images and remembrances ... and is therefore somewhat anomalous to the rest of the record, which took up more esoteric and spiritual matters.\\"Hage, The Words and Music of Van Morrison, p. 98 AllMusic's Bill Janovitz, on the other hand, suggests a spiritual reading of the song, with Morrison's literal image of \\"cleaning windows\\" doubling as \\"a metaphor for Zen-like clarity, seeing the essence of life via the repetition of basic chores.\\" Release \\"Cleaning Windows\\" was released as a single in March 1982 but was not promoted as a 45 single by Mercury records and therefore did not chart. Writer Howard A. DeWitt felt that it would have charted \\"because it generated a response similar to \\"Domino\\" in Van's 1982 concerts\\".DeWitt. The Mystic's Music. p.109 (\\"Domino\\" charted at #9 in America in 1970.) Other releases Morrison chose \\"Cleaning Windows\\" to be one of the songs included on The Best of Van Morrison, his first \\"Best of\\" album, which was released in 1990.

History 1928: The original land acquisition for the establishment of the \\"Roseburg Aviation Park\\" occurred in 1928, with additional property purchased in 1929. This brought the airport and aviation park area to about 100 acres, with additional property made available for industrial development. Funding for the initial purchase was achieved through a successful bond initiative, spearheaded by the Umpqua Post of the American Legion. The bond measure provided $25,000. Twelve thousand of this sum purchased the properties and thirteen thousand was used for hangar construction, drainage improvements, and the initial runway construction. The initial runway was approximately 3,800 feet in length. A portion of the original property was later sold to the State to construct Interstate 5 and a portion west of the future freeway was sold to an individual for future development. These funds were utilized for airport purposes. 1931-August 23: Earl Branson owned the Roseburg Flying Service. on Sunday, August 24, 1931 an advertisement appears in the local newspaper (name unknown) He advertised \\"FLY $1.00, Licensed Pilots--Licensed Planes.

After the Buck O'Neil Bridge opened in 1956, vehicular traffic was switched over to the new span and the auto deck was removed later that year. The bridge is owned and maintained by the BNSF Railway and carries two tracks. A bridge tender at the bridge can open and close the drawspan as well as operate the nearby ASB Bridge, which is also owned by BNSF. The Hannibal Bridge survived the 1951 Kansas City flood after being hit by four river boats that tore loose from the mouth of the Kansas River, forcing the swinging span open.

Norris and Catherine (Wunderle) Norris. She began drawing at the age of 4 and attended free classes at the Cleveland Museum of Art during grammar and high school. After attending Lourdes Academy in Cleveland, she earned a scholarship to Cooper School of Art in Cleveland, OH graduating with a major in illustration.https://www.tulsaworld.com/entertainment/strawberry-shortcake- at-beloved-character-was-created-by- tulsa-s/article_c691e933-bc32-50c2-8586-42bbf6fdb37e.html  Career  Strawberry Shortcake and Apple Dumplin' Immediately following art school, Fahrion was hired by American Greetings as a greeting card designer. She worked in Juvenile & Humorous Planning in creative division where she created cute, whimsical and humorous illustrations to tie in with verses.https://www.buzzsprout.com/216735/963405-coffee-house-interviews- muriel-fahrion' In 1977, while Fahrion worked in her department, she was asked to come up with a rag doll character with strawberry and daisy theme in colors of pink and green for a greeting card series. It was then Fahrion created the original graphic and color depiction for Strawberry Shortcake, her cat Custard along with Blueberry Muffin and Huckleberry Pie. The line was determined to be a licensing property after a presentation given to Bernie Loomis of General Mills. Moving to TCFC (Those Characters From Cleveland) in 1978 Fahrion continued on the Shortcake line eventually depicting 32 characters in the line. Her sister, Susan Trentel, also of Cleveland, crafted the first Strawberry Shortcake doll based on the Fahrion's original greeting card design. The line was launched in the winter of 1979 and 1980. This design made a big impact, and in two years, Strawberry Shortcake went from 12 card series to an entire selection of books, clothing, dolls, toy accessories, and home decor. The Shortcake group joined Herself the Elf, Holly Hobbie and Ziggy forming the new toy and licensing division \\"Those Characters from Cleveland\\" (TCFC), under American Greetings banner but located in separate building. TCFC became a well known think tank for toys and licensing. While there Fahrion also worked on drawings and ideas for numerous licensing items. While working for Those Characters From Cleveland, Fahrion also participated with other toy design teams which included artists, prototypist and writers. She depicted the first concept art for the characters of The Get Along Gang and Care Bears, once they were tagged as licensable both properties moved to other design teams. Like the first Strawberry Shortcake doll, many of these were first prototyped by her sister Susan Trentel who began working at TCFC. Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Get-Along-Gang were all made into animations. Fahrion took several years away from American Greetings freelancing for Fisher-Price, developing illustrations for the Puffalumps and working with Disney and Snoopy licensing. American Greetings' toy division eventually was reduced in size and moved back to the corporate headquarters. Fahrion then moved and became senior art director for Enesco in Chicago. After working a few years at Enesco, Fahrion moved to Oklahoma 1995 in the position of Creative Vice President at United Design in Noble, Oklahoma, where she headed up sculptors and paint designers she worked for United Design for seven years.

As of the 2010 census it had a population of 90. Geography Canaan is located in northeastern Jefferson County at , in the center of Shelby Township. State Roads 62 and 250 pass through the community together, along the eastern and southern sides. State Road 62 leads northeast to Dillsboro and southwest to the northern outskirts of Madison, the Jefferson county seat. State Road 250 leads east to Pleasant and southwest to U.S. Route 421, which leads south to the center of Madison. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Canaan CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.26%, are water. The center of the community drains north via Canaan Branch into the valley of Indian Kentuck Creek, which flows south to the Ohio River at Brooksburg. The western edge of the Canaan CDP drains west to Toddys Branch, which flows to the West Fork of Indian Kentuck Creek. Demographics History Canaan began growing slowly with the establishment of John Warfield's farm in 1812. The first known use of the name \\"Canaan\\" is dated November 15, 1832, when Edwards Ayres advertised that he had opened the Bee Hive, a public house, 14 miles from Canaan and 12 miles from Madison. On May 6, 1833, a road petition mentions Canaan in renaming a road to Versailles beginning at Canaan. It is generally recognized that Amos Simpers founded Canaan by virtue of the fact that he sold seven lots laid out along the road that is now State Road 62. On March 15, 1836, Canaan's original plat was filed in a Jefferson County deed book. =Indian-Kentuck Baptist Church= The Indian-Kentuck Baptist Church was established in 1814. In 1815, the church joined the Silver Creek Baptist Association, according to the earliest independent record. On November 27, 1819, the church purchased a lot on Toddy's Branch for relocation but instead chose a site at Flat Bottom Cemetery circa 1820. In either 1844 or 1865, dates being disputed, the church was moved to its present site. =Canaan Methodist Church= Canaan Methodist Church was founded in 1830 by John Cain, William C. Sullivan, John Warfield, and Marscia Cook and their wives. The cemetery dates to 1829, with the first burial being that of a child named Susan Littlejohn. Katherine Cain is reported to be the next burial, which took place July 30, 1833. The land on which these burials occurred was deeded to church trustees by Amos Simpers on April 22, 1834. Three buildings were reported as church buildings. One made of logs was located about one-quarter mile north?est of the final church site. The other two were located next to the graveyard building, with the second in the 1840s and the last in 1868. On July 10, 1866, Joseph Lochard opened a store after operating a similar establishment in Manville for some time. This store was run by Joseph and later by his son Solomon Lochard, followed by Don Carlo Lochard. =Early business= During the 1840s and 1850s, a number of people operated businesses in Canaan. In 1829, a tavern was established by E.B. Bishop and a man named Etherton. In 1837, Ephraim and Coy Kennedy opened a store, and by 1840 they were operating Kennedy & Bros., a tobacco factory employing seven people. By 1850, 8,000 pounds of tobacco was used in the production of cigars, from which 780,000 were produced in 1850 and 750,000 were produced in 1870. By 1878, Canaan also had a drug store. =Social centers= On February 1, 1872, the Canaan Lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows was incorporated.

It follows the life of legendary entrepreneur James Buchanan Brady, including his romance with entertainer Lillian Russell, and stars Edward Arnold, Jean Arthur, Cesar Romero and Binnie Barnes. The screenplay by Preston Sturges never lets the lurid facts of Brady's life get in the way of the story.Erickson, Hal Plot Synopsis (Allmovie) Edward Arnold went on to play Diamond Jim Brady again five years later, opposite Alice Faye in Lillian Russell. Plot Diamond Jim Brady (Edward Arnold) is born to an Irish saloonkeeper and his wife in 1856, but is soon orphaned. At the age of thirty, working as baggage master at the Spuyten Duyvil train station, he rents a suit and a diamond from a pawn shop, and gets a job as a salesman; soon, he is the top salesman on the staff. While on a cross-continental sales trip, Brady rescues Mr. Fox (Eric Blore) from a crooked salesman, but in the process they are forced to jump from the train. Brady soon discovers that Mr. Fox is trying to sell something called an \\"undertruck\\" to be used at railroad stations, so he takes on the product himself. With success, Brady wants to marry his sweetheart, Emma Perry (Jean Arthur), but finds out that she is engaged. Heartbroken, he devotes all of his energy to the Brady-Fox Company. A grand success, Brady has ostentatious diamond jewelry designed for him, leading to his nickname, \\"Diamond Jim Brady\\". Brady spares no expense to indulge his every whim, lavishing money on wine, women, song and especially food. Brady sees singer Lillian Russell (Binnie Barnes) perform, introduces himself, and soon he is promoting her career and flirting with her. Russell, however, is in love with businessman Jerry Richardson (Cesar Romero). Brady soon meets Jane Matthews (Jean Arthur again), a lookalike for Emma, and is instantly smitten with her. They become engaged, but on the eve of their wedding, Brady gets drunk because of his suspicions about Jane's relationship with a banker named \\"Briggs\\" who is supposedly her \\"uncle\\", and the wedding is called off. Jane remains his friend, but refuses to give in to his occasional proposals - for one thing, she has fallen in love with Jerry, but neither want to tell Brady for fear of hurting his feelings. When the stock market crashes, Brady loses his fortune, and starts again from scratch, promoting a steel railroad car for its supposed safety. He is injured during a public demonstration of the car, and spends a year recovering in the hospital, while at the same time rebuilding his fortune. When he gets out, he plans a trip to Europe for himself, Jane, Lillian and Jerry, during which he believes he will finally get Jane to marry him. Instead, Jane and Jerry confess their love, the news of which shatters Jim. On the rebound, he proposes to Lillian, but she rejects him as well. Despondent, he returns home and prepares to eat himself to death, but not before burning up all the I.O.U.'s in his possession.

Demarest would go on show up in nine other Sturges films: Easy Living (1937), The Great McGinty (1940), Christmas in July (1940), Sullivan's Travels (1941), The Lady Eve (1941), The Palm Beach Story (1942), The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (1944), Hail the Conquering Hero (1944) and The Great Moment (1944). Symphonic composer Ferde Grofe wrote a large amount of the score, yet remained uncredited on the movie. Production Diamond Jim, which had a working title of Diamond Jim Brady, was based on the 1933 biography of Brady by Parker Morrell, to which Universal purchased the rights. However, prior to that, Paramount Pictures had bought the rights to a short story by Mike Simmons based on Brady's life, and had registered the title with the Hays Office. Paramount subsequently protested Universal's production, but how the matter was resolved is not known.TCM Notes Brady died in 1917, but Edward Arnold had met him twice early in his acting career: once when Brady came to meet an actress who was performing in the show Arnold was in, and once when he came backstage to meet Ethel Barrymore, whose acting company Arnold was a part of. Joseph Breen, head of the Hays Office, objected to the sexual innuendo in the relationship between \\"Jane\\" and \\"Briggs\\", who was supposedly her uncle, and wanted it changed as it violated the Code. In addition, Dorothy Russell, the daughter of Lillian Russell, objected that the screenplay misrepresented the relationship between Brady and Russell, which she characterized as not a lifelong friendship, but a short term acquaintanceship that lasted only from 1902 to 1916. She also believed that the film used material from an article about her mother she had written which was published in a magazine. She engaged an attorney to file a lawsuit, but the outcome is unknown. Diamond Jim was in production from 3 April to 20 May 1935,TCM Overview at a cost of over $750,000. The filming of the train crash took place at a narrow-gauge railway near San Luis Obispo, California with vintage cars donated by the Pacific Coast Railway. Jack Foley, head of Universal's sound effects department, recorded the crash. The film was released on 2 September 1935.

Early years Darley was born in Ireland, the first child of Henry Darley (son of Frederick Darley) of Wingfield, Bray, County Wicklow and his wife Maria Louisa Darley (n√©e West, daughter of Matthew West of Dublin). Darley's father was a member of the Irish bar and according to Bennett, he was described by Lord St Leonards as \\"not only the best officer in the Court of Chancery in Ireland, but the best officer he had ever come across\\". Darley was educated at the Royal School Dungannon (sometimes known as \\"Dungannon College\\") in County Tyrone, Ireland where he had as a fellow student George Higinbotham was who afterwards to become Chief Justice of Victoria. Darley's uncle, the Reverend John Darley, was headmaster of the college. In July 1847 Darley commenced studying at Trinity College, Dublin, and he graduated in July 1851 with a Bachelor of Arts (BA). He was called to the English bar at the King's Inn in January 1853 but returned to Ireland and practised there for about nine years on the Munster circuit. He met Sir Alfred Stephen when Stephen was on a visit to Europe, and was told that there were good prospects for him in Australia. Darley married Lucy Forest Browne at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire, on 13 December 1860. Lucy was the sister of novelist Rolf Boldrewood (Thomas Alexander Browne) who is best known for the book Robbery under arms. Darley and Lucy had two sons and four daughters. One of their daughters Frederica Silvia Darley married firstly Sir Windham Robert Carmichael-Anstruther 9th Bt, and secondly the Hon. Major Algernon Henry Charles Hanbury-Tracey, their son became the 6th Baron Sudeley of Toddington. Emigration to Australia Darley decided to emigrate to Australia and arrived in Sydney in 1862. He was admitted to the NSW Bar on 2 June 1862 and was later appointed a Queens Counsel (QC) in 1878. Biographer Percival Serle states that Darley had established a good practice, and that for the twenty years preceding his elevation to the bench, there was hardly an important case at Sydney in which he did not appear on one side or the other. Biographer John Bennett, on the other hand, states that Darley found his early years tiring and not particularly well remunerated, and that it was Darley's zeal rather than his legal skills that brought him to attention. In September 1868 he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council. Serle states that he was a constant and conscientious attendant at its debates. In November 1881 he became Vice-President of the Executive Council and Representative of the Government in the Legislative Council in the third Henry Parkes ministry. In parliament Darley introduced \\"an equity act, a divorce act, which gave to the wife the same rights as those of the husband, and the act authorizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister\\". In November 1886 Darley was offered the position of Chief Justice of New South Wales in succession to Sir James Martin. He did not desire the office and to accept it would have meant a considerable monetary sacrifice. As a barrister, he was probably earning more than twice the amount of the salary offered. Darley declined the position and it was accepted by Julian Salomons who subsequently resigned a few days later. Appointment as Chief Justice Darley was again approached, and this time he accepted it. He was sworn in on 7 December 1886. He carried out his duties with great distinction, although Bennett notes that Darley was not an exceptional jurist. Sir Samuel Way, Chief Justice of South Australia, spoke of him \\"as in many respects the noblest figure we have ever had on the Australian bench\\". On the retirement of Sir Alfred Stephen in November 1891, Darley was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New South Wales, and he administered the government seven times in that capacity. When the position of Governor of New South Wales became vacant in 1901, Serle notes that there were many suggestions that Darley should be given the post, but the post was given to Sir Harry Rawson. Darley's longest period administering the government was from 1 November 1900 to 27 May 1902, a significant period in Australia's political history with the lead up to and the aftermath of federation of the then Australian colonies. But his anxiety for New South Wales's supremacy may have contributed to the 'Hopetoun Blunder'. According to Bennett, Darley's private assessment in 1902 was that 'Australian Federation is so far a pronounced failure'. Honours and later years Darley was knighted in 1887, created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1897, and received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) 15 May 1901, in preparation of the forthcoming royal visit of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York (later King George V and Queen Mary). He visited England in 1902 and was appointed a member of the Royal Commission set up to investigate the conduct of the Second Boer War (the Elgin Commission 1902-1903). He was also appointed a member of the privy council in 1905. He died in London on 4 January 1910. Trivia Mary McCarron Maguire composed the \\"Katoomba Waltz\\" in honour of Darley and Lady Darley. Darley Road at Randwick, Sydney was renamed from Boundary Street in honour of Darley. Darley lived at Quambi, Albert Street, Woollahra and had a mountain retreat \\"Lilianfels\\" in Katoomba. This retreat is now a hotel, and \\"Quambi\\" was demolished in the 1930s to become Quambi Place.

They play at multiple venues in the Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania area. They play a mix of Kix covers as well as original material. History =Early years= Funny Money was founded in 1996 in Maryland by lead vocalist Steve Whiteman of Piedmont, WV and guitarist Billy Andrews, who met at a charity gig in Baltimore. Their initial sessions consisted of Kix material and material written by Whiteman with Shea Quinn of the Sharks. Whiteman and Andrews recruited guitarist Dean Cramer, one of Whiteman's vocal students, bassist Ned Meloni, who had played with New York's Ice Water Mansion, and Washington, D.C.'s Monarch in the 1980s and had extensive studio experience, and drummer Bobby George. George left the band shortly afterward, and Geoff Burrell of Tubefreeks and Swingin' Dix was recruited in his place. =Background= After attempting to make a name for themselves with new material, the band began incorporating Kix material into their shows, in response to fan demands. In 1998, Funny Money released their self-titled debut album, Funny Money, produced and engineered by Andrews. It was followed in 1999 with Back Again, recorded, produced, and engineered at Andrews' home, and a live album, Even Better Live, recorded at Jaxx Nightclub in Springfield, Virginia in 2001. However, in 2003, Andrews, Meloni, and Burrell all announced that they were leaving to pursue other interests. Whiteman and Cramer recruited guitarist Louis Coppola, former Centerfold bassist Mark Schenker on Meloni's recommendations, and drummer Sam Stillwell. =Recent events= In 2003, while Funny Money were working on their fourth release, Skin to Skin, Coppola and Stillwell were replaced by former Centerfold guitarist Rob Galpin and Kix drummer Jimmy Chalfant respectively. Skin to Skin went on to become the band's best-selling album. In 2006, Cramer left the band to work on material with Marc Ferreira and their new band Goodbye Thrill. Their fifth record, Stick It!, was released in December 2006, mixed by Kix's ex-producer Beau Hill. Dean Cramer returned in November 2008. The band's music is frequently heard on 97Underground.com a hard rock online radio station based out of Baltimore. Funny Money has consistently been one of the most requested bands on the station. Dean Cramer's side project band So Low won an online vote competition to open up for KISS at the Jiffy Lube Live/Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia on Saturday August 21.

A supporting organization either makes grants to, or performs the operations of, a public charity similar to a private foundation. However, unlike donations to a private foundation, donations to a supporting organization garner the same higher deduction rate as donations to public charities. However, supporting organizations allow less control over the organization to the founders than private foundations. The Internal Revenue Code calls a public charity that relies on a supporting organization a \\"supported organization\\". History The Tax Reform Act of 1969 created private foundations and imposed greater restrictions on this classification, including excise taxes and lower donor deductions for contributions.Tax Reform Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-172, 83 Stat. 487 This Act created supporting organizations as an exception to private foundations‚Äîbecause they are organized, operated, and controlled in the public interest.Tax Reform Act of 1969: Hearings on HR 13270 Before the House Comm. on Fin., 91st Congress 115-43, 34 (1969) Supporting organizations are not subject to the problems and abuses found in foundations that led to the creation and associated restrictions on private foundations.Mark Rambler, Best Supporting Actor: Refining the 509(a)(3) Type 3 Charitable Organization, 51 Duke L.J. 1367, 1378 (Feb 2002). Reform =Past impact and criticism= Mostly large and medium-sized donors created supporting organizations in order to retain some control over their donated assets.Victoria B. Bjorklund, Choosing Among the Private Foundation, Supporting Organization, and Donor- Advised Fund, SK088 ALI-ABA 83 (2005). Type III supporting organizations comprised the sort of supporting organization with the least surveillance by the supported organizations, which meant greater donor control, and so Type III supporting organizations quickly became the favored form.Commissioner Mark W. Everson Testimony to the Senate Finance Committee, Charitable Giving - Part 2, 4/5/05 CONGTMY, 3. Despite this flexibility, few donors outside of high and middle-high value donors created supporting organizations due to complex regulations and tax code provisions governing the formation and operation of supporting organizations. This entailed high transaction costs. Further, the demands of the tax code and associated regulations required the Type III supporting organizations to make such great relative donations of activity or grants to assure the attentiveness of the supported organizations. As a consequence, supporting organizations (particularly Type III) proved attractive to high and middle-high value donors with anecdotal evidence of their widespread abuse.Ron Shoemaker & Bill Brocker, P. Public Charity Classification and Private Foundation Issues: Recent Emerging Significant Developments, 2000 EO CPE Text, 223. Supporting organizations became subject to much criticism upon two perceived abuses. One perceived abuse related to control. Senators Baucus and Grassley argued that supporting organizations, particularly Type III, allowed donors to retain too much control over their assets.Sens. Grassley, Baucus Plant to Take Aim at Abusive 'Supporting Organizations' For Charities, 4/25/05 USFEDNEWS. Another perceived abuse related to liberal charitable deductions allowed to donors who contribute to supporting organizations. Since donors retained so much control, these critics believed that they should not also enjoy deductions that they would get for donating to public charities.Grassley, Baucus Plan To Take Aim At Abusive \\"Supporting Organizations\\" For Charities, 4/26/05 GOVPR: Page 2. Instead, these critics argued that such deductions should be no more favored than private organizations or even less favored because of the greater control afforded to supporting organizations compared to private foundations.Grassley, Baucus Plan To Take Aim At Abusive \\"Supporting Organizations\\" For Charities, 4/26/05 GOVPR: Page 4. =Pension Protection Act of 2006= The Pension Protection Act of 2006Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR4) cracked down on supporting organizations, particularly Type III. This act applied further regulations and penalties that took away many of the privileges that supporting organizations had over private foundations. The act applies the self-dealing regulations of private foundations on supporting organizations.Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), ¬ß 1242 The act requires a payout‚Äîbut leaves the exact demands of the payout, including rate and from which assets for the Treasury to determine later.Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), ¬ß 1226. The Act applied the private foundation rules of excess business holdings and the excess benefit prohibitions from the private foundation law. The act also tightened the tests for Type III supporting organizations to demonstrate that Type III supporting organizations has dependent supported organizations and that has no more than five supported organizations.Richard L. Fox, Charitable Incentives and Limitations of the Pension Protection Act, Estate Planning, 33 Est. Plann. 03, 13 (Dec. 2006). The act also made collateral attacks on supporting organizations by forbidding donor-advised fundsPension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), ¬ß 1231((c)(2)(A)(ii) taxable distribution). and private foundationsPension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), ¬ß 1244. from making qualifying distributions to Type III supporting organizations, and should they do so the distributions would become taxable subject to their respective excise taxes. Further restrictions, including explication of the payout rate contours will result from the Congress mandated survey that the IRS promulgated. =Congress-mandated survey= In the Pension Protection Act, Congress mandated a studyPension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR4), ¬ß 1266 on the supporting organizations to understand their role in the exempt organization world and determine what future action remained necessary.Study on Donor Advised Funds and Supporting Organizations, Notice 2007-21. It was called the \\"Study on Donor Advised Funds and Supporting Organizations.\\" Definition Under ¬ß 509(a)(3) the Internal Revenue Code defines supporting organizations as being: *(A) is organized, and at all times thereafter is operated, exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or (2); and *(B) is (i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations described in paragraph (1) or (2), (ii) supervised or controlled in connection with one or more such organizations, or (iii) operated in connection with one or more such organizations; and *(C) is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more disqualified persons (as defined in 26 USCA 4946) other than foundation managers and other than one or more organizations described in section 509(a)(1) or (2). =509(a)(3)(A)= > Is organized, and at all times thereafter is operated, exclusively for the > benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one > or more specified organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2) This section breaks down into two tests: the organizational test (\\"is organized\\") and the operational test (\\"is operated\\"). *The organizational test demands that the supporting organization organize and operate exclusively to support one or more specified publicly supported charities. Here, the supporting organization must have its governing documents limit the organization to charitable purposes for specified supported organizations. An exception exists for the specification requirement when the two organizations have a continuous and historic relationship.Cockerline Memorial Fund, 86 TC 53, 63 (1986) *The operational test demands that the supported organization operate exclusively for the benefit of, to perform the functions of, or to carry out the purposes of one or more specified organizations described in ¬ß 509(a)(1) and (2). =509(a)(3)(B)= > Is (i) operated, supervised, or controlled by one or more organizations > described in paragraph (1) or (2), (ii) supervised or controlled in > connection with one or more such organizations, or (iii) operated in > connection with one or more such organizations This part provides three possible relationships between a supporting organization and its supported organizations. A supporting organization must fulfill the requirements of one of these three types and report it in its annual reporting to the IRS. Through either of these relationships the supported organizations provides the requisite public scrutiny over the supporting organizations. Type I resembles a parent-subsidiary relationship.Joint Committee on Taxation, Technical Explanation of HR 4, The \\"Pension Protection Act of 2006,\\" JCX-38-06, Aug 3, 2006: Page 354. Type II resembles a brother-sister relationship.Joint Committee on Taxation, Technical Explanation of HR 4, The \\"Pension Protection Act of 2006,\\" JCX-38-06, Aug 3, 2006: Page 355. These two types are the stricter of the relationships while Type III has the most relaxed standard for scrutiny by the supported organizations. In exchange for this flexibility, type III supporting organizations must pass two additional tests to ensure that the supported organizations provide public scruinty.Merrie Jeanne Webel, The Supporting Organization: A Beneficial (but Tangled) Alternative for the Directed Donor, 15-APR Prob. & Prop. 55, 56 (March/April 2001). The first test is the responsiveness test and the second test is the integral part test. The integral part test may further breakdown into two subtests, the \\"but for\\" subtest and the \\"attentiveness\\" subtest, either of which the organization may satisfy.Cockerline Memorial Fund, 86 TC 53, 61 (1986); Victoria B. Bjorklund, When is a Private Foundation the Best Option?, C911 ALI-ABA 135, 145 (June 27, 1994). This type III relationship, however, recently has received a crackdown by Congress and so its flexibility and relaxed standards for control and scrutiny is short-lived. =509(a)(3)(C)= > Is not controlled directly or indirectly by one or more disqualified persons > (as defined in 26 USCA 4946) other than foundation managers and other than > one or more organizations described in paragraph 509(a)(1) or (2) This requirement provides prophylactic protection against self-dealing, a potential abuse.Ron Shoemaker & Bill Brocker, P. Public Charity Classification and Private Foundation Issues: Recent Emerging Significant Developments, 2000 EO CPE Text: Page 223. Some donors try to engage in self-dealing activities in order to maintain control over their assets by controlling the supporting or supported organizations. This requirement curbs nearly every possible way a donor may exert control over the organizations and their assets. Restrictions imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 =509(f)= Through the Pension Protection Act, Congress recently added (f) to ¬ß 509. Section 509(f) adds new requirements for supporting organizations. Under ¬ß 509(f)(1), the IRC imposes new requirements on type III supporting organizations in particular. Here, they impose a stricter definitions upon their relationships with their supporting organizations: *(A) The IRC does so by amending the responsiveness test to require the type III supporting organization to provide any documentation to their supporting organization that the IRS deems necessary; *(B) Further, type III supporting organization may no longer support foreign entities. In ¬ß 509(f)(2), the IRC concentrates on organizations controlled by donors: *(A) Where a type III supporting organization may not have a relationship with a public charity that accepts donations from a person defined, in (B), otherwise known as a disqualified person or a close relative or spouse of that disqualified person. \\"Person\\" includes 35% controlled business entities. (3) codifies the present understanding of \\"supported organization\\" as a public charity supported by a supporting organization. =Charitable trust= For an organization to qualify as a type III supporting organization, it must first prove that it constitutes a charitable trust under state law, the beneficiary is the supported trust, and the supported organization has the power to compel an accounting and enforce the trust.Pension Protection Act of 2006, PL 109-280 (HR 4), Title XII, ¬ß 1241(c). Then, the organization must provide further evidence to prove that it operates in connection with its supported organizations. =Functionally integrated= A functionally integrated type III supporting organization (\\"FISO\\") performs the operations of the supported organization26 USCA 4943(f)(5)(B) and remains free the excess business holding excise tax and from the payout rate that shall apply in the near future.26 USCA 4943(f)(6). A FISO resembles a type III supporting organization that satisfies the \\"but for\\" test because they both perform the operations of the supported organization, but the exact requirements for qualifying as a FISO remains unknown. Currently, the IRS has halted determinations on all requests by organizations for FISO classification until the US Treasury Department issues guidance on this matter.IRS Acting Director, EO Rulings and Agreements: Robert Choi, Memorandum For Manager, EO Determinations, Supporting Organizations IRC ¬ß 509(a)(3), February 22, 2007. =Excess benefit transaction= A disqualified person may not receive any benefit from a supporting organization otherwise the IRS may apply intermediate sanctions that tax that person 25% of the value of the benefit and tax the manager 10% of the benefit.PL 109-280 (HR 4), ¬ß 1242; 26 USCA 4958. This tax may increase further if the offenders fail to rectify the transaction and lead up to revocation of tax-exempt status. =Excess business holdings= A supporting organization in combination with its disqualified persons may not own more than 20% of voting stock in a business entity not related to the furtherance of its charitable purpose.26 USCA 4943(c). Should a supporting organization do so, then it may subject itself to the excise tax.26 USCA 4943(a) & (b). Treasury regulations The Treasury Regulations for supporting organizations contain detailed explanations for the applicable tests.26 CFR 1.509(a)-4 The regulations may change as the IRS has suspended determinations of what constitutes a functionally integrated type III supporting organization until such time that the Treasury Department may issue further guidance.

He was a second cousin of Inayat Khan, the grandson of Inayat's grandfather and therefore according to Indian custom considered a brother. Ali Khan apart from Indian classical music, received training in European music, and played the trumpet trombone and bagpipes. As a young man, he was also keenly interested in physical culture and wrestling, which, in the words of the biography of Inayat Khan, \\"prepared him to become an iron wall to stand in support of Inayat against many opposing influences.\\" In the West, Ali Khan continued his musical career, receiving training in operatic singing from Mme. Emma Nevada, who recognized great potential in his tenor voice, and even appearing on the stage of La Scala. Ali Khan was believed by some to possess a natural gift of healing, a gift which they say was developed immeasurably through his deep devotion. There are many stories of friends and mureeds receiving help from his touch, his glance, or by prayers and absent healing, but in reply to their thanks he would humbly point to heaven and say, 'Not I. God.'  Sources  *Healing by Murshid Ali Khan. \\"The Sufi\\" A Quarterly Journal of Mysticism, Vol. II, No. 2. April 1936 pp. 51‚Äì58 *Inayat Khan by Ronald A. L. Mumtaz Armstrong.

It became a popular literary form in the Middle Ages, when they were written in Latin and in the vernacular (e.g., the planh of the troubadours). The most common planctus is to mourn the death of a famous person, but a number of other varieties have been identified by Peter Dronke. The earliest known example, the Planctus de obitu Karoli, was composed around 814, on the death of Charlemagne.Peter Godman (1985), Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 206‚Äì211. Other planctus from the ninth century include vernacular laments in a woman's voice, Germanic songs of exile and journeying, and planctus on biblical or classical themes (like the Latin Planctus cygni, which is possibly derived from Germanic models). The earliest examples of music for planctus are found in tenth- century manuscripts associated with the Abbey of Saint Martial of Limoges. From the twelfth century Dronke identifies a growing number of laments of the Virgin Mary (called a planctus Mariae) and complaintes d'amour (complaints of love) in the courtly love tradition.Stevens, \\"Planctus\\". From the mid- thirteenth century survives an early Catalan Marian lament, Augats, sey√≥s qui credets D√©u lo Payre, and around 1300 the Lamentations of Mary were composed in Old Hungarian. The Mongol invasion of Europe drew a planctus from an anonymous monk in the entourage of B√©la IV of Hungary, the Planctus destructionis regni Hungariae per Tartaros (1242).

Prelude Like similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the Communists and the Nationalists in China, this conflict was also rooted in the fact that Chiang Kai-shek had realized his nationalist regime simply had neither sufficient troops nor enough transportation assets to deploy his forces into the Japanese-occupied regions of China. Unwilling to let the Communists, who had already dominated most of the rural regions in China, to further expand their territories by accepting the Japanese surrender and thus would consequently control the Japanese-occupied regions, Chiang Kai-shek ordered the Japanese and their Chinese puppet regime not to surrender to the Communists and keep their fighting capabilities to ‚Äúmaintain order‚Äù in the Japanese-occupied regions, fighting off the Communists as necessary until the final arrivals and completion of the deployment of the Nationalist troops. As a result, most members of the Japanese puppet regimes and their military forces rejoined the Nationalists. However, most of these former Nationalists- turned-Japanese-puppet-regime forces were not from Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs own clique, but instead mainly consisted of troops of warlords who were only nominally under Chiang Kai-shek before World War II, since they were Nationalists in name only and mostly maintained their independent and semi- independent status. These warlords were only interested in keeping their own power and defected to the Japanese when Japanese invaders offered to let them keep their power in exchange for their collaboration. After World War II these forces once again returned to the Nationalist camp for the same reason they defected to the Japanese invaders. Obviously it was difficult for Chiang to immediately get rid of these warlords as soon as they surrendered to Chiang and rejoined the Nationalists, because such a move would alienate other factions within the Nationalist ranks, and these former warlords could still help the Nationalists gain more territories by holding on to what was under their control until Chiang completed the deployment of his own troops to take over. Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs objective was to simultaneously solve two problems: the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of Communism together. This, as subsequent history has shown, was his fatal mistake. Nationalist Strategy In accordance with his strategy to simultaneously solve these two problems, Chiang Kai-shek and his followers had hoped that these former Japanese puppet regime's warlords who rejoined the Nationalists would be able to hold on to their territories long enough for Chiang to deploy his own troops. If the Communists were victorious in such conflicts, however, the result could still benefit Chiang and China because the power of these warlords would be reduced as their military forces were smashed by the Communists, and the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long could thus be greatly reduced, while at the same time the Communists would be weakened by their battles with the warlords and Chiang's own troops would have an easier time in taking control. For the former Nationalists-turned-Japanese-puppet-regime forces it was no problem to again follow Chiang's orders, and they were eager to prove their \\"loyalty\\" to him. They were well aware that their collaboration with the Japanese invaders resulted in their being hated and despised by the Chinese population, including their former Nationalist colleagues who had refused to surrender to or collaborate with the Japanese and in fact continued fighting against the invaders to whom these warlords had defected. Therefore, in the impending demilitarization after World War II, they were certainly to be‚Äîat best‚Äîdisarmed and discharged, resulting in their power being reduced or even completely eliminated. Therefore, if they saw a chance to retain the power they saw slipping away from them they would seize the chance to grab at it, and if they could legitimize and ingratiate themselves to their former commander by helping him to fight the Communists, they were more than happy to do so. Communist Strategy The Communist strategy was much simpler than that of the Nationalists because there was no huge division within the Communist ranks, as there were among the Nationalists. The Communists had already earned considerable popular support by being the only Chinese force left in the region fighting the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime after the Nationalists withdrew, and after successfully establishing Communist bases in the rural regions, where the general populace had a much better life under them than they did in the Japanese-occupied areas. The people generally agreed that the Communists, rather than the Nationalists, deserved to represent China in accepting the invaders‚Äô surrender. The battle After the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II had refused to surrender to the communists, the only Chinese force in the region under the order of Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs regime, the 15th Brigade of the 5th Division of the communist New Fourth Army launched its offensive in Tianmen, Hubei, China against these units. Unable to fight off the communists, these former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II enlisted the help of their former Japanese master, which only further enraged the local population, whose support went to the communist side as a result. The battle lasted only several hours, and after 50 Japanese troops and over 100 troops of the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II were killed, the remaining 5 Japanese troops and 200+ troops of the former nationalist turned Japanese puppet regime forces who rejoined the nationalists after World War II were forced to surrender. The communists had captured a cannon, a heavy machine gun, five light machine guns, and over 270 repeating rifles. The communist casualties was light in terms of numbers, but Huang Xiting (ÈªÑË•øÂª∑), a battalion commander and Yang Li (Êù®Âäõ), a battalion level political commissar were among those killed. Outcome Like other similar clashes immediately after the end of World War II between the communists and the nationalists in China, this conflict also showed that Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs attempt to simultaneously solve the warlord problem that had plagued China for so long and the problem of the extermination of communism together proved to be a fatal mistake. Although the result of the campaign turned out exactly like Chiang Kai-shek and his subordinates had predicted, and consequently the power of the warlords in this region was indeed reduced as their military forces were smashed by the communists, so that the warlord problem plagued China for so long was thus reduced for this particular region, and Chiang Kai-shek‚Äôs secondary objective was achieved here, any positive gains obtained by the nationalists were negated by the politic fallout. The reason was that this success of achieving the secondary objective came at a huge cost in nationalists‚Äô loss of popular support in this region formerly dominated by the Japanese, because the local population had already blamed nationalists for losing the regions to the Japanese invaders, while reassigning these former Japanese puppet regime forces as the nationalist forces to fight the communists, the only Chinese force left in the regions, only further alienated the local populace and strengthened the popular resentment to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist regime.

The result of the Tianjin campaign helped to determine the outcome of the Pingjin campaign. The original communist plan was to capture Tanggu first to cut off the nationalist escape route via sea and then force the nationalists in Beijing and Tianjin to surrender, in order to save the two historical cities from the destruction of the war. However, the nationalist resolve to defend the cities to the end was strong and reconnaissance had revealed the sounding regions of Tanggu was not suitable for building fortifications and deploying assaulting forces, and the region strongly favored defenders. The communists were forced to change their plan by attacking Tianjin first. According to the geography of Tianjin, which was characterized in its long span in the north-south direction and short span in the east-west direction, the communists made a plan of simultaneously attacking from the east and west, cutting off the city in the middle, and then first taking the southern portion of the city, and afterward taking the northern portion of the city. From January 3, 1949 through to January 12, 1949, the communists cleared all 18 nationalist strongholds outside the city, and the defenders were forced to take refuge behind the city wall. After the nationalists behind the city wall had refused to surrender for three times when asked, the communists launched their final offensive on the city on January 14, 1949 at 10:00 AM. After 29 hours of fierce fighting, the entire besieged nationalist garrison of the city totaling more than 130,000 was completely annihilated, and Chen Changjie(Èô≥Èï∑Êç∑), the nationalist commander-in- chief of the defense, was captured alive along with many of his subordinates, including his deputy, Major General Qiu Zongding (ÁßãÂÆóÈºé), the deputy commander- in-chief of nationalist Tianjin Garrison, Major General Yang Wei (Ê•äÂ®Å), the chief-of-staff of the nationalist force defending Tianjin, Major General Li Yeqing (ÊùéÂè∂Ê∏Ö), the secretary-general of nationalist headquarter in Tianjin, and Major General Cheng Zijian (Á®ãÂ≠êË∑µ), the nationalist inspector-general from Nanjing, hand-picked personally by Chiang Kai-shek himself. With the exception of the 7th Chinese Textile Factory, which was completely destroyed in the final offensive, most of the rest of the infrastructure of Tianjin was captured intact. The price paid by the attacking communist force is relative low in the campaign, suffering a casualty rate that included 7,030 killed, and 19,214 wounded, without any missing or being captured. Among those communists killed were several hundred Japanese troops of the former-Japanese Imperial Army, who stayed in China after World War II and joined the communists. Outcome The immediate consequence of the nationalist defeat in Tianjin campaign was that the nationalist garrison of Tanggu, consisting of the 17th Army Group and five divisions from the 87th Army, had been completely isolated and had to withdraw via sea, which in turn, worsened the overall situation for the nationalists during the Pingjin campaign. The nationalist defeat in the Tianjin campaign was also one of the most important factors forcing Fu Zuoyi to surrender to the communists, which resulted in the conclusion of the Pingjin campaign.

Prelude In July 1947, the nationalists in Northern China launched an offensive to eradicate communists in the local regions and stationed troops in the towns and cities of the newly conquered regions for a garrison. The communists, in turn, attempted to retake the lost region by attempting to annihilate the nationalist force and dislodge the surviving nationalists from their new posts. Order of battle Nationalist order of battle: *The 94th Army *The 4th Division of the 13th Army *The 22nd Division of the 16th Army *The 94th Division *The Independent 95th Brigade *A security regiment Communist order of battle: *The 2nd Column of the communist Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Field Army *The 3rd Column of the communist Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Field Army *The 4th Column of the communist Shanxi-Chahar- Hebei Field Army *The Independent 7th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Military Region The Campaign On the night of September 2, 1947, the communist 3rd Column took the town of Xushui (ÂæêÊ∞¥), inflicting heavy casualties on the nationalist Independent 95th Brigade in the surprise attack, and forcing the defenders to abandon the town to regroup. After the initial success, the communists played the same trick again, this time targeting Laishui (Ê∂ûÊ∞¥). This time, the nationalist garrison of the 5th Division of the 94th Army became the victim and was forced to abandon the city after suffering heavy loss in a fierce battle that lasted from September 6, 1947, to September 8, 1947. The three divisions of the nationalist 94th Army, the 5th Division, the 43rd Division and the 121st Division each sent out a regiment to reinforce the defenders at Laishui (Ê∂ûÊ∞¥), while the 4th Division of the nationalist 13th Army and the 22nd Division of the nationalist 16th Army were mobilized for reinforcement by railway transportation. Although the nationalist response to sending out reinforcement was swift, the reinforcement was extremely slow in reaching their destination because major sections of the railway from Solid City (Gu Cheng, Âõ∫Âüé) to Baoding, the important transportation the nationalists depended on, was destroyed by the enemy units from the communist 5th and 9th sub-Military Regions. As a result, before the nationalists reaching their destination, the communist 3rd Column had plenty of time transferring a lot of supplies captured at Laishui (Ê∂ûÊ∞¥) to other communist bases and then turning toward Liang (ËâØ) County, Fangshan, and Zhuo (Ê∂ø) County to further strike and harass Nationalist garrisons in these regions by the night of September 9, 1947. While the nationalist reinforcement was out, the communist 2nd Column and the 4th Column attempted to annihilate the isolated nationalist 94th Division. On September 10, 1947, the communist 2nd Column threatened a brigade and a regiment of the nationalist 109th Division at Ban Family's Nest (Ban Jia Wo, ÊùøÂÆ∂Á™ù), after wiping out the nationalist battalion stationed at Wu Family's Stage (Wu Jia Tai, Âê¥ÂÆ∂Âè∞). The Independent 7th Brigade of the communist Central Hebei Military Region had taken most of the town of Ba (Èú∏) County after badly mauling the loca nationalist garrison consisted of a nationalist security regiment and a regiment of the nationalist 22nd Division, forcing the surviving defenders into the isolated region of Northern Pass (Bei Guan, ÂåóÂÖ≥) of the town. At Open Mouth Village (Kai Ko Cun, ÂºÄÂè£Êùë), units from the communist 10 sub-Military Region forced the defenders consisted of a regiment of the nationalist 94th Division to give up most of the area and withdrew into three large bunker complexes. However, communists failed to annihilate the nationalist's forces at Jiu Hill (Jiu Gang, ÂíéÂ≤ó) consisted of a brigade and two regiments after the communist 4th Column was beaten back twice in their attacks on the besieged nationalists. On September 12, 1947, the 4th Division of the nationalist 13th Army, the 22nd Division of the 16th Army, the nationalist Independent 95th Brigade, and the nationalist 157th Brigade went out to reinforce their besieged comrades-in-arms and learning the news, the communists withdrew, and the campaigned ended in stalemate. Outcome The result of this campaign was indecisive because neither side had achieved their original objective completely. For the communists, they had succeeded in forcing the nationalists to end their communist eradication offensive early and retreated to the urban centers; they had failed to achieve their original goal of annihilating the nationalist 94th Division. For the nationalists, they were successful in avoiding annihilation and beaten back enemy attacks on urban centers, but their communist eradication campaign was forced to end early with vast newly conquered rural areas falling back into the enemy hands. The campaign, therefore, can be described as a stalemate.

At 7:00 PM, the first assault wave successfully landed on the two islets. Afterward, naval gunboats approached Da Lu Shan Dao and Xiao Lu Shan Dao and bombarded the nationalist positions on the islands. At 9:00 PM, the battle ended with 53 nationalists killed and 186 captured, including the commander of The 42nd Column of the Anti-Communist Assault Army, He Zhuoquan (‰ΩïÂçìÊùÉ). The Nationalists also lost 2 junks, 8 radio sets along with code books. The communist victory insured further isolation of the nationalist strongholds along the coast of Zhejiang, such as Dachen Archipelago and Yijiangshan Islands, and another nationalist threat to the vital coastal sea lines of communication was eliminated. As for the nationalists, these islands and islets were simply too small to station the large number of troops required for any effective defense. They were also simply too far away from the nearest nationalist stronghold along the coast so it was impossible to reinforce the local garrison in time.

It was proposed by Rummery and Niranjan in a technical noteOnline Q-Learning using Connectionist Systems\\" by Rummery & Niranjan (1994) with the name \\"Modified Connectionist Q-Learning\\" (MCQ-L). The alternative name SARSA, proposed by Rich Sutton, was only mentioned as a footnote. This name simply reflects the fact that the main function for updating the Q-value depends on the current state of the agent \\"S1\\", the action the agent chooses \\"A1\\", the reward \\"R\\" the agent gets for choosing this action, the state \\"S2\\" that the agent enters after taking that action, and finally the next action \\"A2\\" the agent chooses in its new state. The acronym for the quintuple (st, at, rt, st+1, at+1) is SARSA.Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (chapter 6.4) Some authors use a slightly different convention and write the quintuple (st, at, rt+1, st+1, at+1), depending to which time step the reward is formally assigned. The rest of the article uses the former convention.  Algorithm  :Q(s_t,a_t) \\\\leftarrow Q(s_t,a_t) + \\\\alpha \\\\, [r_{t+1} + \\\\gamma \\\\, Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1})-Q(s_t,a_t)] A SARSA agent interacts with the environment and updates the policy based on actions taken, hence this is known as an on-policy learning algorithm. The Q value for a state-action is updated by an error, adjusted by the learning rate alpha. Q values represent the possible reward received in the next time step for taking action a in state s, plus the discounted future reward received from the next state-action observation. Watkin's Q-learning updates an estimate of the optimal state-action value function Q^* based on the maximum reward of available actions. While SARSA learns the Q values associated with taking the policy it follows itself, Watkin's Q-learning learns the Q values associated with taking the optimal policy while following an exploration/exploitation policy. Some optimizations of Watkin's Q-learning may be applied to SARSA.  Hyperparameters  = Learning rate (alpha)= The learning rate determines to what extent newly acquired information overrides old information. A factor of 0 will make the agent not learn anything, while a factor of 1 would make the agent consider only the most recent information. = Discount factor (gamma) = The discount factor determines the importance of future rewards. A factor of 0 makes the agent \\"opportunistic\\" by only considering current rewards, while a factor approaching 1 will make it strive for a long-term high reward. If the discount factor meets or exceeds 1, the Q values may diverge. = Initial conditions () = Since SARSA is an iterative algorithm, it implicitly assumes an initial condition before the first update occurs. A low (infinite) initial value, also known as \\"optimistic initial conditions\\", can encourage exploration: no matter what action takes place, the update rule causes it to have higher values than the other alternative, thus increasing their choice probability. In 2013 it was suggested that the first reward could be used to reset the initial conditions. According to this idea, the first time an action is taken the reward is used to set the value of . This allows immediate learning in case of fixed deterministic rewards. This resetting-of- initial-conditions (RIC) approach seems to be consistent with human behavior in repeated binary choice experiments.

The Communists targeted and eventually took the Dachen Archipelago, and the other two smaller archipelagos from Nationalists: the Southern Muntjac Archipelago () and the Southern Deer Mountain Archipelago (). Prelude The Communists had already targeted Dachen Archipelago when they attacked Yijiangshan Islands, but the Communists were incapable of simultaneously taking both. When the Communists bombed Dachen Archipelago during the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands, it was mainly to prevent the Nationalist garrison of Dachen Archipelago from reinforcing Yijiangshan Islands. In fact, from 1 November 1954 to 4 November 1954, the Communist air force flew 49 sorties to bomb Dachen Archipelago, but none of the 721 bombs dropped hit their intended targets. On 10 November 1954, the Communist bombers flew 28 sorties and Communist fighters flew 46 sorties in support of the bombers to strike Nationalist warships in the Dachen Archipelago, but only resulted in minor damages of a mere five warships. The battle =Air raids= After the main battle of the Battle of Yijiangshan Islands had subsided, the Communists immediately turned their attentions to Dachen Archipelago before declaring the Yijiangshan Islands secured. On 19 January 1955, the first Communist bombing mission specifically targeting Dachen was carried out by combat-hardened aircrew with experience. Due to the previous two unsuccessful Communist bombing missions, the Nationalists believed that this third air raid would be equally inept and were not fully prepared. As a result, the infrastructures on the islands, especially those for communication, were severely damaged. The casualties were minimal, but the local Nationalist garrison was forced to use unencrypted radios to communicate with Taiwan and among themselves. Since the Communists used Nationalist equipment captured during the Chinese Civil War, they were able to intercept Nationalist communications. The second wave of attack also occurred on the same day on 19 January 1955. Though the local Nationalist garrison regrouped and set up more effective air defence, the effort was futile because the second wave of attack struck a target completely unexpected by the defenders: the reservoir, which was not considered a military target of any significance. The reservoir was completely destroyed and, without any fresh water supply readily available, it was nearly impossible to defend the archipelago. On 2 February 1955, the Communist air force bombed the Southern Deer Mountain Archipelago. =The Dachen Retreat= After much debate, the Nationalist government in the Republic of China controlling the Dachen and adjacent archipelagos finally agreed with the Americans to hold out until an evacuation could be carried out by the American Navy in February 1955 to Taiwan more than 200 miles to the south. The decision was made to withdraw on 5 February 1955, and the U.S. Seventh Fleet used 132 boats and 400 aircraft to move 14,500 civilians, 10,000 Republic of China servicemen, and 4,000 guerrilla fighters, along with 40,000 tons of military equipment and supplies from the island. After the evacuation, the last Flag of the Republic of China in Dachen was lowered by Chiang Ching-kuo, and the Zhejiang province government was abolished in the Republic of China as Dachen was their last stronghold in the province. =Last phases= After the retreat, Northern Muntjac Island () was the first to be taken by the People's Liberation Army on 8 February 1955, and by 12 February 1955, the entire Dachen Archipelago had fallen into the enemy hands. On 13 February 1955, the entire Southern Muntjac Archipelago was taken by the Communists. The Nationalists had left a single regiment to garrison the Southern Deer Mountain Archipelago to the south of Dachen Archipelago for a symbolic struggle, and the regiment held out until late February 1955. The local commander realized the struggle was futile and was unwilling to waste troops in the lost cause, and thus asked and received permission to withdraw. On 26 February 1955, the People's Liberation Army took the Southern Deer Mountain Archipelago and the battle concluded. Outcome For the Communists, the gaining of these archipelagos eliminated the Nationalist threat to the vital coastal shipping line, and the Nationalist bases to strike coastal regions, but as Chiang Kai-shek grudgingly allowed the archipelagos to fall to the Communists so that the other offshore island groups, Kinmen and Matsu, could be successfully defended, the result of the battle could therefore be considered a draw.

Some social scientists term it the Polish October Revolution, which, while less dramatic than the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, may have had an even deeper impact on the Eastern Bloc and on the Soviet Union's relationship to its satellite states in Central and Eastern Europe.Iv√°n T. Berend, Central and Eastern Europe, 1944‚Äì1993: Detour from the Periphery to the Periphery, Cambridge University Press, 1999, , Google Print, p.115-116 For the People's Republic of Poland, 1956 was a year of transition. The international situation significantly weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland; Polish communist leader Boles≈Çaw Bierut died in March; it had been three years since Stalin had died and his successor at the Soviet Union's helm, Nikita Khrushchev, denounced him in February. Protests by workers in June in Pozna≈Ñ had highlighted the people's dissatisfaction with their situation. In October, the events resulted in the rise in power of the reformers' faction, led by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka. After brief, but tense, negotiations, the Soviets gave permission for Gomu≈Çka to stay in control and made several other concessions resulting in greater autonomy for the Polish government. For Polish citizens this meant a temporary liberalization. Eventually though, hopes for full liberalization were proven false, as Gomu≈Çka's regime became more oppressive. Nonetheless, the era of Stalinism in Poland had ended. Backgrounds Gomu≈Çka's thaw was caused by several factors. The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the resulting de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. In the summer of 1955, 5th World Festival of Youth and Students was held in Warsaw, Poland. Designed to be a vast propaganda exercise, a meeting place for Eastern European communists and their comrades from Western Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. This event brought hundreds of thousands of Polish spectators to Warsaw for the five days, watching dancing, theater and other attractions. However, the real attractions for the Polish people were the foreigners, of whom many were from Western Europe and contrasted starkly with local Poles because they shared similar culture but were much richer and more open. Deeply stricken, many Poles realized that a decades' worth of anti-Western rhetoric was false. Poles, Germans, Hungarians, Czechs and others from the Communist bloc actively socialized with one another. With the more exotic visitors, Poles also socialized in private apartments all around the city. College students even held debating meetings with foreigners, many of whom turned out not to be communists. In February 1956, following 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev delivered the Secret Speech, titled On the Personality Cult and its Consequences, causing wide implications for the Soviet Union and other Communist countries as well. Development In Poland, in addition to criticism of the cult of personality, popular topics of debate centered on the right to steer a more independent course of \\"local, national socialism\\" instead of following the Soviet model in every detail. For example, many members of the Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) criticized Stalin's execution of older Polish Communists during the Great Purge.Reasons for the outbreak from the official city of Pozna≈Ñ website dedicated to 1956 events. Last accessed on 3 April 2007. Several other factors contributed to the destabilization of Poland. These included the widely publicized defection in 1953 of high-ranking Polish intelligence agent J√≥zef ≈öwiat≈Ço, resulting in the weakening of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland (Polish secret police). In addition, the unexpected death in Moscow in 1956 of Boles≈Çaw Bierut, the PZPR First Secretary (known as the \\"Stalin of Poland\\"),\\"Bierut, Boleslaw.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online.

Kemp-Welch, St. Martin's Press, New York, 1999, . The PZPR Secretariat decided that Khrushchev's speech should have wide circulation in Poland, a unique decision in the Eastern Bloc. Bierut's successors seized on Khrushchev's condemnation of Stalinist policy as a perfect opportunity to prove their reformist, democratic credentials and their willingness to break with the Stalinist legacy. In late March and early April, thousands of Party meetings were held all over Poland, with Politburo and Secretariat blessing. Tens of thousands took part in such meetings. The Secretariat's plan succeeded beyond what they expected. During this period, the political atmosphere in Poland shifted as questions were increasingly asked about taboo subjects like the Polish Communists' legitimacy, responsibility for Stalin's crimes, the arrest of the increasingly popular Gomu≈Çka, and issues in Soviet‚ÄìPolish relations, such as the continued Soviet military presence in Poland, the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, the Katyn massacre, and the Soviet failure to support the Warsaw Uprising. A new Party Congress was demanded, as was a greater role for the Sejm and a guarantee of personal liberties. Alarmed by the process, the Party Secretariat decided to withhold the speech from the general public. In June 1956, there was an insurrection in Pozna≈Ñ. The workers rioted to protest shortages of food and consumer goods, bad housing, decline in real income, trade relations with the Soviet Union and poor management of the economy.

People across the country criticized the security police and asked for the dissolution of the public security committee and the punishment of its guiltiest functionaries. Demands were made for the exposure of secret police collaborators, and suspected collaborators were frequently assaulted. In many localities, crowds gathered outside the secret police headquarters, shouted hostile slogans, and broke its windows. Public meetings, demonstrations, and street marches took place in hundreds of towns across Poland. The meetings were usually organized by local Party cells, local authorities, and trade unions. However, official organizers tended to lose control as political content exceeded their original agenda. Crowds often took radical action, in many cases resulting in unrest on the streets and clashes with police and other law-enforcement agencies. Street activity peaked during and immediately after the 19‚Äì21 October \\"VIII Plenum\\" meeting of the Central Committee of the PZPR, but continued until late in the year. A concurrent upsurge in religious and clerical sentiment took place. Hymns were sung, and the release of Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski and the reinstatement of suppressed bishops were demanded. Nationalism was the cement of mass mobilization and dominated public meetings, during which people sang the national anthem and other patriotic songs, demanded the return of the white eagle to the flag and traditional army uniforms, and attacked Poland's dependence on the Soviet Union and its military. They demanded the return of the eastern territories, an explanation for the Katyn massacre, and elimination of the Russian language from the educational curriculum. In the last ten days of October, monuments to the Red Army, despised by Poles, were attacked: red stars were pulled down from roofs of houses, factories and schools; red flags were destroyed; and portraits of Konstantin Rokossovsky, the military commander in charge of operations that drove the Nazi German forces from Poland, were defaced. Attempts were made to force entries into the homes of Soviet citizens, mostly in Lower Silesia, home to many Soviet troops. However, unlike the protesters in Hungary and Pozna≈Ñ, activists limited their political demands and behavior, which were not purely opposed to communist and the system. The communist authorities were not openly and unequivocally challenged, as they had been in June, and anticommunist slogans that had been prevalent in the June uprising, such as \\"We want free elections\\", \\"Down with Communist dictatorship\\", or \\"Down with the Party\\", were much less prevalent. Party committees were not attacked. Political change W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka In October Edward Ochab, the First Secretary of the Party and the Polish Prime Minister, proposed W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka election for the First Secretary of the Party during 8th Plenum meeting. Gomu≈Çka was a moderate who had been the First Secretary of the Party 1943‚Äì1948 and had been ousted and imprisoned in 1951 after \\"right-wing nationalist deviation\\" accusation by Stalinist hardliners' with Bierut. Gomu≈Çka proved to be acceptable to both factions of Polish communists: the reformers, who were arguing for liberalization of the system, and the hardliners, who realized that they needed to compromise. Gomu≈Çka insisted that he be given real power to implement reforms. One specific condition he set was that Soviet Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky, who had mobilized troops against the Pozna≈Ñ workers, be removed from the Polish Politburo and Defense Ministry, to which Ochab agreed. The majority of the Polish leadership, backed by both the army and the Internal Security Corps, brought Gomu≈Çka and several associates into the Politburo and designated Gomu≈Çka as First Secretary. Untouched by the scandals of Stalinism, Gomu≈Çka was acceptable to the Polish masses, but at first was viewed with much suspicion by Moscow. The Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. De-Stalinisation was underway in the Soviet Union as well, but the Soviet leadership did not view the democratic reform that the Polish public desired as an acceptable solution. In Moscow, the belief was that any liberalisation in one bloc country could lead to the destruction of communism and the ruin of Soviet influence in the region as a whole. The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well. Economically, the Soviet Union heavily invested in much of the Eastern Bloc and was striving for integration of its economies. The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland's main trading partner. The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself. Due to this integration, any reform, whether political or economic, in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other. Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically, the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic. The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets for such a long time that breaking away completely would prove disastrous. Thus, both countries held crucial power in different facets. Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically, and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy. Therefore, any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands, while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner.Dallin, Alexander. \\"The Soviet Stake in Eastern Europe.\\" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 317(1958): 138‚Äì145. A high-level delegation of the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland in an attempt to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership made it clear that the face of communism had to become more nationalized; no longer could the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing the cries of the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomu≈Çka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demandsPawe≈Ç Machcewicz, 1956 ‚Äì a european date and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomu≈Çka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomu≈Çka was confirmed in his new position. The leadership's stance contributed to the relatively moderate political dimension of social protest in October. Also crucial were the impacts of nationalism and nationalist emotions. They spurred social protest in June but dampened it in October, when the threat of Soviet invasion against Gomu≈Çka and his supporters transformed the social image of Polish communists. In June, they were still treated as the puppets and servants of alien, anti-Polish interests and excluded from the national community. In October, they became a part of the nation opposing Soviet domination. Gomu≈Çka was enthusiastically supported by the great majority of society, not primarily as a communist leader, but as a leader of a nation who, by resisting Soviet demands, embodied a national longing for independence and sovereignty. His name was chanted, along with anti-Soviet slogans, at thousands of meetings: \\"Go home Rokossovsky\\", \\"Down with the Russians,\\" \\"Long live Gomu≈Çka,\\" \\"We want a free Poland\\".Flora Lewis, A Case History of Hope; the Story of Poland's Peaceful Revolutions, Doubleday, 1958 While Gomu≈Çka's anti-Soviet image was exaggerated, it was justified in the popular imagination by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 and years of subsequent internment. Thus, Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly at the head of a national liberation movement. The enthusiastic public support offered to Gomu≈Çka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which incorporated mass nationalist, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland, it was absorbed within it. Aftermath Information about events in Poland reached the people of Hungary via Radio Free Europe's news and commentary services between 19 October and 22 October 1956. A student demonstration in Budapest in support of Gomu≈Çka, asking for similar reforms in Hungary, was one of the events that sparked the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.\\"United Nations report of the Special Committee on the problem of Hungary\\", Page 145, para 441. Last accessed on 11 April 2007 The events of the Hungarian November also helped distract the Soviets and ensure the success of the Polish October. Gomu≈Çka, in his public speeches, criticized the hardships of Stalinism and promised reforms to democratize the country; this was received with much enthusiasm by Polish society. By mid-November, Gomu≈Çka had secured substantive gains in his negotiations with the Soviets: the cancellation of Poland's existing debts, new preferential trade terms, abandonment of the unpopular Soviet-imposed collectivization of Polish agriculture, and permission to liberalize policy towards the Roman Catholic Church. In December, the status of Soviet forces in Poland, the Northern Group of Forces, was finally regulated. Miros≈Çaw Golon, P√≥≈Çnocna Grupa Wojsk Armii Radzieckiej w Polsce w latach 1945-1956.

In the aftermath of the October events, Rokossovsky and many other Soviet \\"advisers\\" left Poland, signaling that Moscow was willing to grant Polish communists slightly more independence. The Polish government rehabilitated many victims of the Stalinist era, and many political prisoners were set free. Among them was cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski.\\"Poland.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2007. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved on 7 April 2007 The Polish legislative election of 1957 was much more liberal than that of 1952 although still not considered free by Western standards.Richard F. Staar, Elections in Communist Poland, Midwest Journal of Political Science, Vol. 2, No. 2 (May 1958), pp. 200‚Äì218, JSTOR Gomu≈Çka, however, could not and did not want to reject communism or Soviet domination; he could only steer Poland towards increased independence and \\"Polish national communism\\". Because of these restricted ambitions, which were recognized by the Soviets, the limited Polish revolution succeeded where the radical Hungarian one did not. Norman Davies sums up the effect as a transformation of Poland from puppet state to client state; Raymond Pearson similarly states that Poland changed from a Soviet colony to a dominion. Gomulka's pledge to follow a \\"Polish road to socialism\\" more in harmony with national traditions and preferences caused many Poles to interpret the dramatic confrontation of 1956 as a sign that the end of the dictatorship was in sight. Initially very popular for his reforms, which were optimistically referred to at the time as \\"Gomu≈Çka's thaw\\", Gomu≈Çka gradually softened his opposition to Soviet pressures, and the late-1950s hopes for major political change in Poland were replaced with growing disillusionment in the 1960s. In the end, Gomu≈Çka failed in his goal to salvage communism--or socialism--in Poland. Society became more liberal (as seen, for instance, in the achievements of the Polish Film School and the creation of such controversial movies as Ashes and Diamonds), and a civil society started to develop, but half-hearted democratization was not enough to satisfy the Polish public. By the time of the March 1968 events, Gomu≈Çka's thaw would be long over, and increasing economic problems and popular discontent would end up removing Gomu≈Çka from power in 1970--ironically, in a situation similar to the protests that once had propelled him to power.Poland - The Historical Setting: Chapter 6: The Polish People's Republic. Polish Academic Information Center, University at Buffalo. Retrieved on 14 March 2007. Nonetheless, some social scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less dramatic than its Hungarian counterpart but one which may have had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iv√°n T. Berend claims that while the effects of the Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set the course for the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland. Janusz Korwin-Mikke, Polish right-wing politician known for his fierce criticism of Socialism and Communism, maintains that Poland ‚Äúregained independence‚Äù in 1956, and that it was the Gomu≈Çka‚Äôs thaw that ‚Äúrealistically marked the end of Communist era in Poland‚Äù, and not 1989 events.http://czasnahistorie.pl/janusz-korwin- mikke/korwin-mikke-koniec-prl-bis-czy-cos-wiecej-reformatorzy-z-pzpr- zjednoczyli-sie-przy-okraglym-stole-z-agentura-sb-i-wywiadu- wojskowego/https://www.salon24.pl/u/korwin-mikke/688970,konczymy-rok- podsumowujemy-dyskusje-o-sb-ckich-emeryturach References Further reading *Dallin, Alexander. \\"The Soviet Stake in Eastern Europe\\".

Typical concepts used in technology management are: * Technology strategy (a logic or role of technology in organization), * Technology forecasting (identification of possible relevant technologies for the organization, possibly through technology scouting), * Technology roadmap (mapping technologies to business and market needs), and * Technology project portfolio (a set of projects under development) and technology portfolio (a set of technologies in use). The role of the technology management function in an organization is to understand the value of certain technology for the organization. Continuous development of technology is valuable as long as there is a value for the customer and therefore the technology management function in an organization should be able to argue when to invest on technology development and when to withdraw.  Overview  Technology management can also be defined as the integrated planning, design, optimization, operation and control of technological products, processes and services, a better definition would be the management of the use of technology for human advantage. Technology Management was deemed an emerging field of study by the Department of Education and received a new Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) code in 2020. Technology Management education is defined as a program that prepares individuals to develop science, technical, and business skills required for management of people and systems in technology-based industries, government agencies, and non-profit organizations. Includes instruction in computer applications, general management principles, production and operations management, project management, quality control, safety and health issues, and statistics. 52.0216 2020 CIP Code Perhaps the most authoritative input to our understanding of technology is the diffusion of innovations theory developed in the first half of the twentieth century. It suggests that all innovations follow a similar diffusion pattern ‚Äì best known today in the form of an \\"s\\" curve though originally based upon the concept of a standard distribution of adopters. In broad terms the \\"s\\" curve suggests four phases of a technology life cycle ‚Äì emerging, growth, mature and aging. These four phases are coupled to increasing levels of acceptance of an innovation or, in our case a new technology. In recent times for many technologies an inverse curve ‚Äì which corresponds to a declining cost per unit ‚Äì has been postulated. This may not prove to be universally true though for information technology where much of the cost is in the initial phase it has been a reasonable expectation. The second major contribution to this area is the Carnegie Mellon Capability Maturity Model. This model proposes that a series of progressive capabilities can be quantified through a set of threshold tests. These tests determine repeatability, definition, management and optimization. The model suggests that any organization has to master one level before being able to proceed to the next. The third significant contribution comes from Gartner ‚Äì the research service, it is the Hype cycle, this suggests that our modern approach to marketing technology results in the technology being over hyped in the early stages of growth. Taken together, these fundamental concepts provide a foundation for formalizing the approach to managing technology. Mobile device management  Mobile device management (MDM) is the administrative area dealing with deploying, securing, monitoring, integrating and managing mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, in the workplace and other areas. The intent of MDM is to optimize the functionality and security of mobile devices within the enterprise, while simultaneously protecting the corporate network. MDM is usually implemented with the use of a third party product that has management features for particular vendors of mobile devices. Modern Mobile Device Management products supports tablets, Windows 10 and macOS computers. The practice of using MDM to control PC is also known as unified endpoint management.  Accreditation and certification  The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in technology management. An instructor or graduate of a technology management program may choose to become a Certified Technology Manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering production planning & control, safety, quality, and management/supervision. ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) for accrediting technology management programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the U.S. for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States.(2011) See also * Technology Policy * Technology forecasting * Innovation management * Industrial engineering * Engineering management * Dominant design  References  Category:Management by type ","title":"Technology management"},{"id":"10584449","title":"Li√©bana"},{"id":"10584490","text":"\\"She Can Rock It\\" is a song by the Power Station.

Early life and education George E. Tinker is the son of a Lutheran mother and an Osage father. Tinker identifies more with his father‚Äôs culture and spirituality than his mother‚Äôs Lutheran background. Tinker‚Äôs identification with his American Indian cultural and spiritual heritage parallels his academic career, which can be broadly described as a critique of Western intellectualism and economic, political, religious, and social systems. Tinker received his B.A. from New Mexico Highlands University, and a M.Div. from Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary. He earned his doctorate in Biblical studies at the Graduate Theological Union in 1983. Career Tinker is the Clifford Baldridge Professor of American Indian Cultures and Religious Traditions at the Iliff School of Theology in Denver, Colorado, where he has taught since 1985. He is an ordained Lutheran pastor of Living Waters Episcopal/Lutheran Indian Ministry in Denver. Tinker is a member of the Osage Nation, and is also on the leadership council of the American Indian Movement of Colorado and director of the Four Winds American Survival Project. He has also presented in forums such as the 2014 National Workshop on Christian Unity, held in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In his best known work, American Indian Liberation, Tinker argues that, \\"The intellectual and religious realms have been crucial to colonial political and economic domination of indigenous peoples.\\"Tinker, George E., American Indian Liberation: A Theology of Sovereignty, p.18, Orbis Books, Maryknoll, New York He believes that Native American Christians need to separate themselves from the colonial thinking of European settlers but draw from Native American spirituality and its emphases on space, nature, and community. He would develop this further in the co-authored book Native American Theology. Tinker's recent work examines the historical and institutional controversy and surrounding an atrocity where a book of Christian history that was bound in the skin of an Indigenous Man and gifted to Iliff School of Theology. Although the human skin was removed and given to American Indian Movement representatives in the 1970s, a non-disclosure agreement silenced the institutional role played by the school where the book was displayed for eighty years. With the support of Thomas Wolfe, the current president of the Iliff School, Tinker has worked to build awareness about the book and the lingering ways that institutions benefit from their participation in colonialism.

The Globe and Mail, March 11, 2015. Q launched in April 2007.https://www.assortednonsense.com/the-cbc-and-me/#The_Story_of_Q It was hosted by Jian Ghomeshi until October 2014. Shad was chosen by the CBC in March 2015 as Qs new permanent host. His official debut as host was April 20. The show was also re-branded as q at the same time. In August 2016, the CBC announced that Shad would be replaced as host by Tom Power, formerly the host of Radio 2 Morning, in the fall.\\"CBC's Q replacing Shad as host\\". CBC News, August 15, 2016. Power debuted as host on October 24, 2016. From late March to May 15, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 10 a.m. broadcast of the program was suspended in favour of an extended broadcast of the network's morning news program The Current; however, Power was heard on The Current as a contributor of arts stories during this period. New episodes of the program still aired in the evening repeat slot, and the program was temporarily added to the schedule of CBC Music, replacing that network's 7-8 p.m. hour of regular programming. Episodes The program airs live Monday to Friday at 10:00 a.m. (10:30 NT) for 90 minutes, and an abbreviated 60-minute edition is then repeated at 9 p.m. Due to lesser time restraints (such as less time lost to news breaks) the evening repeat is able to air all of the feature content from the 90-minute daytime edition, although some shorter interstitial segments may be edited out. Stations carrying the show in the United States also broadcast the one-hour edition. It is broadcast mostly from CBC's Toronto studios, although the show also sometimes airs special broadcasts from other Canadian cities. On Fridays, the show formerly aired for two hours, and included a theme called \\"Friday Live\\", where featured musicians are invited for an interview primarily as the opening segment with live performances throughout the program. History Former host Jian Ghomeshi in March 2009, during a live taping of Q Q first aired on April 16, 2007, replacing Freestyle in the network's afternoon programming block. It moved to its current time slot, replacing Sounds Like Canada, in fall 2008. The name was chosen by the staff of the show from a list they themselves had compiled. A test run of the show was made using the name Radar. Other possible names (some clearly tongue- in-cheek) included \\"State-of the-Arts in Canada\\", \\"Awesometown\\", \\"Afternoon Delight\\", \\"Smells like Canada\\", \\"Full Duplex Repeater\\", \\"Skybox Three\\" (the room in Toronto's Rogers Centre where much of the show was created), \\"Ghomer's Pile\\", or one even closer to Jian Ghomeshi, the show host of Iranian descent, \\"Royal Canadian Air Farsi\\". Names a little closer to the mark included Studio Q and The Cue.The Story of Q from assortednonsense.com According to Ghomeshi, \\"A couple of the ... suggestions came close\\", when the name 'Q' was brought up \\"there was a pause in the room and [the Q team] went 'Yes, that's it.' It felt like the right name. It's an enigmatic letter [they] hope will become associated with the show.\\" Beginning in 2013, a one-hour weekly spinoff series, Q The Music, was added to the CBC Music schedule, airing a selection of interviews and performances by musicians previously broadcast on the daily program. On April 15, 2015, the show changed its name to the lower case q. =2009 Thornton interview= On April 8, 2009, Billy Bob Thornton and his musical group The Boxmasters made an appearance on Q that was widely criticized and received international attention after Thornton was persistently unintelligible and discourteous to Ghomeshi. Thornton eventually explained he had \\"instructed\\" the show's producers to not ask questions about his movie career. Ghomeshi had mentioned Thornton's acting in the introduction. Thornton had also complained Canadian audiences were like \\"mashed potatoes without the gravy\\". The following night, opening for Willie Nelson at Toronto's Massey Hall, Thornton said mid-set he liked Canadians but not Ghomeshi, which was greeted with boos and catcalls. The Boxmasters did not continue the tour in Canada as, according to Thornton, some of the crew and band had the flu. Ghomeshi and comedian Alan Park made a mock follow-up interview promoting the 2009 Air Farce Live television special. The sketch has Ghomeshi asking Thornton (Alan Park) about his plans for New Years, leading to the actor responding similar answers to the April interview. The two continue to banter until they break character and laugh around. =Ghomeshi's dismissal= Ghomeshi was fired from the CBC in October 2014, amidst a mounting series of allegations that he had sexually assaulted a series of women, including former Q producer Kathryn Borel. After his departure, the program was hosted by a rotating series of guest hosts, including existing CBC staffers such as Brent Bambury, Piya Chattopadhyay, Tom Power, Allan Hawco and Talia Schlanger, and outside figures such as Wab Kinew,\\"CBC ponders new name for ‚ÄòQ‚Äô in light of Jian Ghomeshi scandal\\". CityNews, November 12, 2014. Rachel Giese, Damian Abraham, Candy Palmater, Shad, Daniel Richler and Sean Rameswaram. Many of the guest hosts were effectively auditioning for a place on the shortlist of potential new permanent hosts.\\"And then there was Shad: inside the search for the new host of Q\\". The Globe and Mail, March 13, 2015. During the transition process, the CBC faced controversy when it announced that it intended to remove all Ghomeshi-hosted segments of the program from its online archive of previously-broadcast content.\\"CBC Radio agrees to leave Q archives online after listener backlash\\". Canada.com, December 23, 2014. They ultimately reversed this decision in the face of public disapproval, allowing the content to remain accessible online for the standard two-year period applicable to all other CBC content, but reaffirming that no content hosted by Ghomeshi will be re-aired on terrestrial radio. Late in the guest- hosting phase, Measha Brueggergosman and Kevin Smith each hosted a single show as part of a \\"Thursday surprise\\" feature, in which the show would be turned over for one day to a guest host whose identity had not been announced in advance. =Shad era= Shad photographed with a gorilla while on a visit to Rwanda, 2006 The \\"final five\\" shortlist of host candidates comprised Shad, Palmater, Richler, Rameswaram and Power. Shad's selection was announced on March 10, 2015. His debut as host was on April 20, with a live broadcast from the CBC's Glenn Gould Studio. Producers indicated that under Shad, the program would increase its focus on music and would adopt a looser, less structured format.\\"Rapper Shad named new host of CBC's Q\\". Toronto Sun, March 11, 2015. Concurrently with Shad's debut as host, the program also unveiled new theme music composed by Canadian musician Bahamas. =Tom Power era= Shad was replaced with Tom Power in August 2016, as the program's ratings had declined significantly over the period when he hosted. Palmater returned as guest host of the show for the weeks between Shad's departure and Power's debut. Concurrently with Power taking over the host's chair, the show also debuted another new theme song, composed and performed by Ewan and Shamus Currie of The Sheepdogs through their side project BROS. Other regular contributors to the show include CBC Music's Raina Douris and Odario Williams, who appear as part of a weekly segment devoted to new album releases, and Jael Richardson as a book reviewer. Television versions Filmed footage of interviews and live musical performances from the radio program airs on CBC Television and YouTube.Q TV at YouTube The show was syndicated from September 2014 until September 2016 for weekend airings to commercial television stations in the United States through PPI (the former Program Partners), a major syndicator of Canadian programming into the American television market. Due to Ghomeshi's dismissal from the CBC mere weeks after its premiere, the PPI version of the show had its format shifted abruptly to feature a 'best-of' compilation of the week's interviews and musical performances (similar to some sports radio show television simulcasts) with the show's interim hosts instead with Ghomeshi's segments completely removed, rather than the intended format of replays of archival content with Ghomeshi throughout several years. The show was effectively relaunched in early May 2015 with Shad taking a greater role in the PPI version of the series.

The chapel was thereupon placed under interdict by the Archbishop of New Orleans, Joseph Francis Rummel. This lasted for two years before a priest, reportedly via subterfuge (promising to never again send a Black priest), obtained signatures from a number parishioners promising to accept whatever priest was sent to them. Abp Rummel approved the reopening of the chapel before eventually discovering the ruse, but wished to save face and not renege on the order. Fortunately for him, the chapel was destroyed by a hurricane soon after. He refused to allow it to be rebuilt.

Bellows are also used on enlargers. The bellows provides a flexible, dark extension between the film plane and the lens. In some cameras, the photographer can change the angle of the film plate with respect to the optical axis of the lens, providing alterations of perspective distortion and of the object plane of focus.

Johann Christian Lobe (May 30, 1797 ‚Äì July 27, 1881) was a German composer and music theorist. Born in Weimar, Lobe was either self-taught as a musician (Anon. 1885‚Äì92) or had music lessons from the age of seven (Brandt 2001). In 1810, he became violinist in the Weimar Court Orchestra (Anon. 1885‚Äì92), or else was a flautist and joined the Weimar orchestra in 1811 (Brandt 2001). He composed many musical works before 1819 (Brandt 2001), and debuted as a composer in 1821, with the opera Wittekind, which was followed by a number of others, including Die Flibustier (1830) and Die F√ºrstin von Granada (1833), as well as some orchestral works (Anon. 1885‚Äì92). Die F√ºrstin von Grenada was especially successful (Brandt 2001). Either in 1842 (Anon. 1885‚Äì92) or 1845 (Brandt 2001) he retired from his position in the Weimar orchestra, was appointed a professor and in 1846 moved to Leipzig, where he worked as a music-composition teacher and music critic (Anon. 1885‚Äì92; Brandt 2001).

He was a meteorologist by profession.  Early years  Lev Solomonovich Aronin played in eight USSR Chess Championships, which were the strongest tournaments in the world during his era, and placed as high as a tie for 2nd‚Äì4th places in 1950 at Moscow. He was the youngest of three brothers, with Gregory (1913‚Äì2007) being the eldest, and Efim (1915‚Äì1989) being the second. Gregory taught him chess at the age of 8, and he could recall that at the age of 14, Lev beat him and Efim simultaneously without looking at the boards while they were making the moves over the chessboards for Lev and themselves. Gregory later told: > He was lying on the couch at another room and shouted the moves to us, for > each board, and we were making them over the boards and shouting back our > respective moves. It was amazing. Both games lasted for no longer than > around 30 moves each, which is not trivial given both me and Efim were quite > strong chess players. =Early competitive results= Aronin lost a match quite badly in 1944, to the strong, experienced Master Alexander Konstantinopolsky, by +1‚àí6=5. In an All-USSR First Category tournament at Gorky, 1945, Aronin scored 5/15, for 14th place out of 16 players. However, he then achieved a very fine win in a tournament (likely a USSR Championship quarter-final) at Erevan 1945, scoring an unbeaten 12/15. He then scored 7¬Ω/15 in the Soviet Championship semifinal, Moscow 1945, tying for 8th‚Äì9th places. In a Candidate Masters' tournament at Kaunas, 1946, Aronin won clear first place with 11/14, losing only one game. This earned him the Soviet Master title, and marked a big improvement in his play in just two years.  Soviet Master  In 1946 at Tbilisi, in the USSR Championship semifinal, Aronin made an excellent tie for second place, with 11/17. This earned him a place in his first Soviet final, held in Leningrad 1947 (15th URS-ch), and he performed creditably in super-strong company with 7/19, in a tie for 17th‚Äì18th places. Aronin won the 1947 Championship of Moscow Region (Oblast) with an unbeaten score of 8¬Ω/10. He then tied for sixth place in the Moscow championship of 1947 with a score of 7¬Ω/14. He placed second in the Russian Championship at Kuibyshev with 7¬Ω/13, behind only Nikolay Novotelnov. Then, at Leningrad 1947, the Soviet qualifying semifinal for the next final, he tied for first place with Mark Taimanov, scoring 10¬Ω/15, and qualified for his second Soviet final. The next year saw the Soviet Championship (16th URS-ch) held in Moscow, and Aronin scored 6/18, for 18th position. Aronin again won the Championship of Moscow Region (Oblast) in 1948 with an unbeaten score of 11¬Ω/13. He played in the Russian Championship at Saratov 1948, tying for 5th‚Äì6th places, with a score of 8¬Ω/15. He had to return to qualifying for the next national championship, but came through the gauntlet of the semifinal, with a fine 11/16 in Moscow 1949, tying for 2nd‚Äì3rd places, to advance. The final (17th URS-ch) was also held in Moscow, and this marked Aronin's arrival at the elite level, as he posted a strong 10/19, good for a tie for 9th‚Äì10th places, and a 2636 performance rating, according to chessmetrics.com. This was his first Grandmaster-level result (assuming a GM result as 2600+).  Reaches the Soviet elite  Despite his solid finish in 1949, Aronin was not exempt into the next Soviet final. To qualify, he played the semifinal at Gorky 1950, which worked out much better than his 1945 visit there. He scored 10¬Ω/15, for clear first place. Aronin also played the Russian Championship at Gorky that same year; he tied for 2nd‚Äì4th places, with 7¬Ω/12, behind only Rashid Nezhmetdinov. Moving on to Moscow 1950 (18th URS-ch), this tournament marked the high point of his career, as he scored 11/17 for a tie of 2nd‚Äì4th places, behind only Paul Keres. He was exempt from qualifying the next year. Although not quite as strong the next year, Aronin scored 9/17 at Moscow 1951 (19th URS-ch) and a tie for 9th‚Äì10th places. Aronin had to go back to the semifinal stage to qualify for the next final, however, and he qualified successfully at Sochi 1951. The 20th URS-ch was held at Moscow 1952, and Aronin dropped a bit from previous championships, managing only 9/19, for 12th place. Aronin was awarded the International Master title in 1950 by FIDE, the World Chess Federation.  International chance denied  Very little about Aronin's chess can be found in English-language sources. However, GM David Bronstein, in his acclaimed 1995 book The Sorcerer's Apprentice (coauthored with Tom Furstenberg) is one writer who has something to say. Bronstein wrote that he had played several games with Aronin, and knew him quite well. Bronstein's first encounter with Aronin, In fact, Aronin did not play in the 1955 Soviet Championship final, referred to by Bronstein, with the game against Smyslov. Likely Bronstein means the 1951 Championship, in which Smyslov and Aronin both played. And for the 1952 qualification situation with Kotov, referred to by Bronstein, Aronin had finished with 9/17 in the 1951 Championship, the Soviet qualifying event for the 1952 Interzonal, while Kotov had 8/17 in that event. Several players who had finished ahead of Aronin in that 1951 event were otherwise exempt past the 1952 Interzonal stage: Botvinnik as World Champion, and Paul Keres, Smyslov, and Bronstein, based on their earlier strong performances from previous World Championship cycles. Taimanov, Efim Geller, Yuri Averbakh, and Tigran Petrosian all finished ahead of Aronin in the 1951 Soviet final, and those four played in the 1952 Interzonal, along with Kotov; all five Soviets also played well enough to move on from Stockholm to the 1953 Candidates' Tournament at Zurich.  Later tournament results  Aronin's next strong performance took place in the Soviet Team Championship, Riga 1954. There, he scored 6¬Ω/10. Then, at Leningrad 1956, he was again in form, with 11¬Ω/19, tying for first with Abraham Khasin, Alexander Tolush, Konstantin Klaman, and Boris Spassky. He went back to the semifinal stage for the 1957 Soviet final, and he qualified through with a fine 14/19 at the semifinal in Tbilisi 1957, second place behind Taimanov, and advanced to the final. Then, at the 1957 Soviet Championship in Moscow (24th URS-ch), Aronin scored 11/21 to tie for 10th‚Äì11th places. In an International tournament in Leningrad later in 1957, Aronin scored 12/19, good for a tie for third‚Äìfourth places, behind Spassky and Alexander Tolush, and tied with Taimanov. Aronin was selected for the Soviet team for the first European Team Championship, Vienna 1957, and scored 1¬Ω/3 on the second reserve board. The Soviets won team gold, and in an utterly dominant performance, captured individual gold medals on each of the top nine boards. In the Alekhine Memorial, Moscow 1959, Aronin had a minus score of 5/11, and tied for 7th‚Äì9th places. In the Moscow Championship of 1961, he tied for 3rd‚Äì5th places with 11/17. He played in an International tournament at Moscow 1961, and finished fourth, with 6¬Ω/11. He trailed only winners Evgeni Vasiukov and Vasily Smyslov, and third-placed Fri√∞rik √ìlafsson, while finishing ahead of several Grandmasters. For the next Soviet final, he had to qualify, and did so at Riga 1962. Then, in the 1962 Soviet Championship at Erevan (30th URS-ch), Aronin scored 10¬Ω/19. He had a poor tournament at the Moscow 1962 International, scoring just 5/15. He won the Moscow Championship in 1965. Unfortunately, his chess playing career was eventually cut short due to ongoing health problems. Legacy and style Aronin never got the chance to compete internationally, outside the Soviet Union, in an individual tournament. It is entirely possible that his career as a meteorologist worked against him in this respect; defections of several very strong Soviet players, including as Alexander Alekhine, Efim Bogolyubov, and Fedor Bohatirchuk to the West following the Soviet takeover in 1917 may have made the Soviet chess organization wary of allowing Aronin to travel outside the USSR with his important (and possibly secret) scientific knowledge. His only international chances came in a team event in 1957, and in a team match against Bulgaria that same year, where he played two games. In every Soviet tournament he played, he had to face a number of very strong compatriots. Stuck behind the incredibly deep Soviet vanguard, which in 1957 had 15 of the world's top 20 players, Aronin's chances to go abroad never came, since he was 37 by this time, and international opportunities were reserved for proven winners and younger players. Aronin's style tended to be positional in nature, with the tactics arising naturally out of the position rather than being forced, and he was one of the leading lights with the King's Indian Defence from the mid-1940s, as this defence became very popular. He was a fine theoretician who was dangerous for virtually everyone he met; during his career he scored wins over almost all the top Soviet players, excepting Mikhail Botvinnik and Vasily Smyslov. One of the mainline variations in the Orthodox King's Indian Defence is named the Aronin‚ÄìTaimanov Variation, in honour of him and of GM Mark Taimanov. The variation runs 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0-0 6.Be2 e5 7.0-0 Nc6 8.d5 Ne7 9.Ne1. Aronin died at the age of 62 in Moscow on October 4, 1982.

The first half of the memoir describes Nesaule‚Äôs experiences as a refugee when the Soviet army invaded Latvia; of the terrors of war and life in the displaced persons' camps in Germany; and her family's emigration to the United States in 1950. The second half of the memoir describes Nesaule‚Äôs experiences in the United States. Through Nesaule‚Äôs memoir, the reader becomes acquainted with the Latvian community in Indianapolis during the 1950s. The memoir also explores the experience of immigration as seen from Nesaule‚Äôs point of view: that of a teenage girl in the 1950s. By the end of the memoir, Nesaule is able to heal from the harmful experiences of war and exile, which affected her life at such a young age. Plot summary A Woman in Amber begins with Agate Nesaule as an adult. She is a successful professor of Women‚Äôs Studies and 20th century English Literature at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. Despite her outward professional success, Agate lives with an inner turmoil caused by her memories of war and perpetuated by her husband, Joe. Nesaule goes into therapy, depressed and unable to come to terms with the root cause of her depression. On the advice of her therapist Ingeborg, Agate learns she cannot begin to heal until she is able to tell her story: what happened to her and her family during World War II in Latvia and Germany at the hands of the invading Russian soldiers. She eventually admits to her therapist that she was in Germany after the war and that she was starving. From this revelation, she goes on to tell how she was prompted by her mother to beg from the Russian soldiers, in Russian, not Latvian, for food. Later in life, she mistakenly tells this same story to her husband, Joe. He mocks her and suggests that when she was forced to beg for food, she enjoyed it. Agate remembers that the Russians looked at her as if she were a goose singing. The shame of going hungry led her to believe she was not worth feeding. When Mongolian and Russian soldiers arrive, her father is forced to leave the family. The women and young girls are taken to a basement where the women are repeatedly raped. Agate is young enough to escape this, but her fifteen-year-old cousin, Astrida, must hide under straw and a blanket. Agate‚Äôs mother, Valda, is understandably terrified by the Russian occupation and the horrors that occur in the basement. The soldiers force the women and girls outside. Everyone believes they are to be executed. Valda tries to pull Agate with her to the front of the line of those to be shot. Valda says that if she and Agate are first, they will not have to see the others die. Agate does not wish to die; Agate resists. The struggle Agate has with her mother that day remains a constant tension between the two. Agate is unable to see Valda‚Äôs love for her in her wish to save her from witnessing executions. Later, the reader comes to see that Valda did care deeply for Agate and loved her very much; particularly in Valda‚Äôs description of her desire to prepare Agate for her wedding day, a preparation Valda was denied. Unfortunately for Valda and Agate, the trauma of war and their shared experiences left no time to reconcile before Valda‚Äôs death. But Agate is able to reconcile with her mother after the latter's death. Agate and her family eventually escape to Berlin where they are admitted to a Displaced Persons' camp. Here they receive food and shelter. The family moves many times during the next several years, going from camp to camp. Agate attends Latvian school while in the camps. At age twelve, Agate and her family leave the camps and emigrate to the United States. We learn of Agate's life in the United States and her parents' financial struggle. Agate must adapt to life rapidly in the United States. A quick learner, Agate teaches herself English in one summer by translating Margaret Mitchell‚Äôs Gone with the Wind. An excellent student, Agate receives scholarships to attend Indiana University. While there, she meets her future husband, Joe. Agate‚Äôs family disapproves of the marriage, and it increased the distance between Agate and her mother. During the next twenty years, Agate receives her doctorate degree, has a son named Boris, and becomes a successful professor at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. Constantly living with Joe‚Äôs put downs, harassments, and minimization of the trauma she endured in the war, Agate hides her feelings of depression and tries to carry on with her life. Though they are separated for much of their adult life, Agate and her sister, Beate, rejoin when Beate‚Äôs husband, Uldis, dies alone and penniless from alcohol poisoning. Despite living at a distance from the Latvian community in Indianapolis where her father remains active as a Lutheran minister, Agate retains a close tie to her Latvian heritage. When a friend asks what he may bring Agate from Latvia, she asks for some Latvian soil. Agate treasures an amber pendant, which her mother wore. John gives Agate a piece of amber set in gold. Because of his respectful and receptive listening, Agate tells John her story and finally finds acceptance. Major characters Agate ‚Äì Agate is the main character. The book includes Agate's experiences in the war, and her eventual emigration to the United States. Valda ‚Äì Agate‚Äôs mother. Throughout the book, Valda pines for Russia where she grew up. Valda is a teacher in Latvia. At age seventy, she receives her PhD in Comparative Literature from Indiana University. She has soil from Russia embedded in her foot from a wound in her childhood. Beate ‚Äì Agate‚Äôs older sister. Beate is very outgoing and popular. She suffers later in life, in part due to her husband's drinking. Joe- Agate‚Äôs first husband whom she meets at Indiana University. He makes fun of Agate's traumatic childhood. John ‚Äì the man Agate meets after she divorces Joe. John helps Agate come to terms with her experiences in the war. Ingeborg Casey ‚Äì the therapist who helps Agate heal. Major Themes Immigration ‚Äì The book highlights Agate‚Äôs experience of emigrating to America. We learn of the financial struggle her family faces when they arrive here and the burden they face in paying off their initial debt for housing. For many years, all members of the family work hard and do without. Agate writes about the living conditions and the dangerous neighborhoods the family had to live in. Agate‚Äôs mother, a skilled teacher in Latvia, had to work long hours as a dishwasher to support her family. Exile ‚Äì Valda is a Latvian who grew up in Russia. Once in Latvia, Valda and her young family are forced into exile again; they bury their most prized possessions in the dirt. After five years in Germany, the family emigrates to the United States. Education- The memoir highlights the importance Latvians place on education, which is referenced in the memoir as ‚Äúthe riches of the heart.\\" As a child, Agate feels second to her mother's interest in books. In the camps, Latvians organize schools to continue teaching the children in spite of the current situation. When the family is ready to leave the camps, their destination is either South America or America. Agate‚Äôs mother insists they go to the United States so that Agate and Beate can receive their education. Valada continues her education, receiving a PhD at 70. Comparing Trauma ‚Äì In Woman In Amber, Nesaule references Jerzy Kosinski‚Äôs book The Painted Bird, in several places. She compares her own experience with the experience described by Kosinski. Nesaule concludes what was faced by Kosinki was worse than the trauma she experienced. The concept of comparing trauma is also present in a Latvian community program in which the question of who suffers more in war is discussed. Is suffering greater in the men who are wounded or the women who are raped? Songs- Singing is important in Latvian culture. In the orphanage, the women join together to sing. Their singing has a hypnotic effect on the soldiers which keeps them from raping the women. Cultural Literacy- Cultural literacy is defined as being literate in a culture‚Äôs written material as well as being literate in the customs, traditions, and society of the culture. In the memoir, Agate becomes literate in American culture when she learns English and reads Gone with the Wind. From the books, movies, and people with whom she surrounds herself, she begins to learn the societal norms and expectations of her new culture. The theme of healing is explored, along with private and public rituals of healing. Since Agate does not have an opportunity in her public space for healing, she must turn to an outlet in her private space. In discussing literature, public space means any area in which you are in the public, for example, at work, school, or out with friends. The private space means the space that your thoughts occupy. In her public space as a student, wife, and professor, Agate is unable to deal with her trauma. So, she has private rituals of healing in an attempt to deal with the trauma. These private rituals are a way for her to control the panic she experiences in her nightmares. Ultimately they are unsuccessful and only deepen her depression. She receives healing in the public space when she is able to tell her story to Ingeborg and John. Tendency of the stronger members of society to prey on the weak- A Woman in Amber is full of instances describing characters in vulnerable positions at the mercy of those in power. The abuse of power Agate experiences in the war is seen in other circumstances throughout her life, even among those who are themselves victims. In the chapter describing the rapes that occur in the basement, Hilda, a woman who is raped repeatedly, is judged and isolated by the rest of the women in the basement. Although they too are victims of rape, they ease their own pain by ostracizing ‚Äúothering‚Äù Hilda. Here the women gain power by judging Hilda. When Joe meets Agate at Indiana University, he can tell she is vulnerable and needs his help to register for classes. It can be argued that it was Agate‚Äôs vulnerability that attracted Joe. Agate believed that if she stayed with Joe, he would save her if there were a war. =Reviews= From Library Journal: A woman in amber is one trapped and preserved in her past. Nesaule (literature and women's studies, Univ. of Wisconsin) tells a moving story to promote the reader's understanding and her own healing. As a child in Latvia, she endured the terror and dislocation of World War II at the hands of both Soviets and Germans, lived in a postwar refugee camp, and became an immigrant to the American Midwest, establishing a life there shaped by survivor's guilt and a sense of victimization. Integral to her life are family relationships, especially estrangement from her mother, stemming from the war years and the author's own unhappy marriage. In middle age, Nesaule at last comes to terms with her past, builds a new life, and offers her audience a well-written and insightful memoir. For subject collections and general readers., Rena Fowler, Humboldt State Univ., Arcata, Cal.Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc. From Latvians Online This paragraph was taken from an article written by Diana Kiesners: \\"Above all, no one must know what happened to the women in the basement at Lobethal. When the local Latvian center holds a debate to establish who suffered more in the war, men or women, it is a foregone conclusion that it is the men who suffered most. They have the statistics to prove it. The few women who disagree (Agate‚Äôs mother is one of them) are shouted down; what are their losses by comparison? \\"There are worse things than death,‚Äô they say, but the word ‚Äòrape‚Äô cannot be spoken. Otherwise they will be ostracized, blamed for their own tragedy. Agate puts up her hand to vote \\"with the winning side\\"\\".

He married, in 1944, Adelaide Cooper, who survived him with their daughter. After the war he managed the antiquarian books department of Charles Cubitt in Norwich. Four years later, in 1950, he established his own bookshop on Maddermarket in the city. He retired to Brundall in Norfolk where he continued his interests in local history, natural history, and sailing. From 1955 to 1998 he published a George Gently detective novel nearly every year. The majority are set in Norfolk in East Anglia.

Two more stories, 'The Burning Man' (adapted from the book 'Gently Where the Roads Go') and 'Bomber's Moon' (adapted from the book of the same name), were broadcast by the BBC in July 2008. All three were written by Peter Flannery who is credited with creating the series for television. The role of George Gently is played by Martin Shaw. A second series (with the title expanded to Inspector George Gently) was broadcast in 2009, a third in 2010, a fourth in 2011, a fifth in 2012, a sixth in 2014 and a seventh in 2015. The series differs markedly from the books, being set in Northumberland and Durham rather than in Norfolk, and with different characters (other than the eponymous Gently).

This is possible if the arguments to the function are known at compile time, and the function does not make any reference to or attempt to modify any global state (is a pure function). If the value of only some of the arguments are known, the compiler may still be able to perform some level of compile-time function execution (partial evaluation), possibly producing more optimized code than if no arguments were known. Examples The Lisp macro system is an early example of the use of compile-time evaluation of user-defined functions in the same language. The Metacode extension to C++ (Vandevoorde 2003) was an early experimental system to allow compile-time function evaluation (CTFE) and code injection as an improved syntax for C++ template metaprogramming. In earlier versions of C++, template metaprogramming is often used to compute values at compile time, such as: template struct Factorial { enum { value = N * Factorial::value }; }; template <> struct Factorial<0> { enum { value = 1 }; }; // Factorial<4>::value  24 // Factorial<0>::value  1 void Foo() { int x = Factorial<0>::value; //  1 int y = Factorial<4>::value; //  24 } Using compile-time function evaluation, code used to compute the factorial would be similar to what one would write for run-time evaluation e.g. using C++11 constexpr. #include constexpr int Factorial(int n) { return n ? (n * Factorial(n - 1)) : 1; } constexpr int f10 = Factorial(10); int main() { printf(\\"%d \\", f10); return 0; } In C++11, this technique is known as generalized constant expressions (\`constexpr\`). C++14 relaxes the constraints on constexpr ‚Äì allowing local declarations and use of conditionals and loops (the general restriction that all data required for the execution be available at compile-time remains). Here's an example of compile time function evaluation in C++14: // Iterative factorial at compile time. constexpr int Factorial(int n) { int result = 1; while (n > 1) { result *= n--; } return result; } int main() { constexpr int f4 = Factorial(4); // f4  24 } Here's an example of compile time function evaluation in the D programming language:D 2.0 language specification: Functions int factorial(int n) { if (n  0) return 1; return n * factorial(n - 1); } // computed at compile time enum y = factorial(0); //  1 enum x = factorial(4); //  24 This example specifies a valid D function called \\"factorial\\" which would typically be evaluated at run time. The use of \`enum\` tells the compiler that the initializer for the variables must be computed at compile time. Note that the arguments to the function must be able to be resolved at compile time as well.D 2.0 language specification: Attributes CTFE can be used to populate data structures at compile-time in a simple way (D version 2): int[] genFactorials(int n) { auto result = new int[n]; result[0] = 1; foreach (i; 1 .. n) result[i] = result[i - 1] * i; return result; } enum factorials = genFactorials(13); void main() {} // 'factorials' contains at compile-time: // [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5_040, 40_320, 362_880, 3_628_800, // 39_916_800, 479_001_600] CTFE can be used to generate strings which are then parsed and compiled as D code in D.

The highway connects the Braselton area with McCaysville at the Tennessee state line, via Gainesville and Dahlonega. Route description =Southern terminus to Gainesville= SR 60 begins at an intersection with SR 124 east of Braselton in Jackson County. It crosses over, but does not have an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85) very soon after. It heads northwest and crosses into Hall County. Just after the county line, the highway intersects SR 332 (Belmont Highway), and the two routes head concurrent to the northwest. In the unincorporated community of Belmont, they meet the northern terminus of SR 211 (Tanners Mill Road). In Candler, SR 332 departs to the west on Poplar Springs Road. SR 60 continues to the northwest and enters Gainesville. At Central Park, it has an interchange with I-985/US 23/SR 365 (Lanier Parkway). This interchange also marks the southern terminus of SR 53 Connector. Just after this interchange, SR 53 Connector/SR 60 pass the Lee Gilmer Memorial Airport and the eastern terminus of the Pearl Nix Parkway before intersecting with SR 369\\\\. At this intersection, SR 53 Connector departs to the northwest on John W. Morrow, Jr. Parkway, while SR 60/SR 369 head concurrent to the northeast for a few blocks. At the intersection with US 129 Business/SR 11, SR 369 departs to the northeast, while SR 60 heads northwest, concurrent with SR 11 Business. Near City Park, the two highways split and each immediately intersects SR 60 Connector (Oak Tree Drive). Then, SR 60 crosses over the northeastern portion of Lake Lanier and passes the Chattahoochee Golf Course. Then, it meets the southern terminus of SR 283 (Mt. Vernon Road) and the eastern terminus of SR 136 (Price Road) before crossing over another part of Lake Lanier. =North of Gainesville= Lumpkin County The road passes through Murrayville and crosses into the southern portion of Lumpkin County. Just northeast of the Chestatee River, it intersects US 19/SR 400 and SR 115 (Long Branch Road). At this intersection, SR 115 meets its southern terminus, and SR 400 meets its northern terminus. Southwest of here, US 19/SR 400 run concurrent toward Atlanta; west of here, US 19/SR 60 begin a concurrency toward Dahlonega. They curve to the northwest, entering town and bordering the western edge of the Achasta Golf Club. Just before they curve away from the golf course toward the main part of town, they cross over the Chestatee River. On the southeastern edge of the North Georgia College & State University, they intersect SR 9/SR 52 (Morrison Moore Parkway West), which join the concurrency. The four highways curve around the main part of town. At East Main Street, the southern terminus of US 19 Business/SR 52 Business intersect the concurrency. A short distance after this intersection, SR 52 departs to the east, while US 19/SR 9/SR 60 cross over Yahoola Creek on the Reverend Joseph Grizzle Bridge. The highways head to the north and meet the northern terminus of US 19 Business/SR 52 Business (North Grove Street) and begin passing through the North Georgia mountains. The concurrency enters the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest before SR 60 departs from the concurrency to the northwest. It becomes a very winding route and enters Union County. Then, it passes Woody Gap and Woody Lake and enters Suches. There, it meets the western terminus of SR 180 (Wolf Pen Gap Road). Just before leaving the county, SR 60 begins to parallel the Toccoa River. In Fannin County, it continues to parallel the river; the two are never more than apart. South-southeast of Margaret, SR 60 splits off and continues its northwesterly routing. In Morganton, it meets part of the former route of US 76\\\\. Northwest of town, it intersects US 76/SR 2/SR 515 (Appalachian Highway). The route continues to the northwest, through Mineral Bluff. In town, it meets the southern terminus of SR 60 Spur (Murphy Highway). A little while later, it curves to the west and parallels the Toccoa River for a second time. It continues to the west and enters McCaysville. The highway curves to the northwest to meet its northern terminus, an intersection with the northern terminus of SR 5 (Harpertown Road) at the Tennessee state line, on the northern edge of town. Here, the roadway continues as Tennessee State Route 68 (Toccoa Avenue). =National Highway System= The only portion of SR 60 that is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense, is from just south of the interchange with I-985/US 23/SR 365, in Gainesville, to the northern end of the US 19 concurrency, north-northeast of Dahlonega. History =1920s= The roadway that would eventually become SR 60 was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 9 from south-southwest of Dahlonega to north-northeast of the city. By the end of 1926, the portion of SR 9 south-southwest of the city had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". =1930s= By the middle of 1930, this segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Later that year, SR 86 was established from Blue Ridge northeast to the North Carolina state line west-northwest of Ivy Log. The portion of SR 9 north-northeast of Dahlonega had completed grading, but had no surface course. By the end of 1931, US 19 was shifted west onto SR 9. In January 1932, the portion north-northeast of Dahlonega had a completed semi hard surface. The entire length of SR 86 was under construction. The next month, the western terminus of SR 86 was shifted eastward to begin northwest of Morganton. By mid-1933, the portion of SR 86 from northwest of Morganton to Mineral Bluff had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\" surface. Later that year, the entire length of SR 86 had a completed semi hard surface. In 1936, the portion of US 19/SR 9 north-northeast of Dahlonega, and the entire length of SR 86, were under construction. At the beginning of 1937, SR 86 was extended southeast to US 19/SR 9 in Porter Springs. SR 136 was extended southeast into Gainesville. A few months later, SR 86's original segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Later that year, US 19/SR 9 northeast of Dahlonega had a completed hard surface. =1940s= In late 1940, all of SR 86 was redesignated as SR 60. About a year later, SR 115 was established from northwest of Gainesville to Murrayville. Nearly the entire Lumpkin County portion of SR 60 was under construction. There was also a segment of SR 60, from just southeast of the Lumpkin‚ÄìUnion county line to northwest of Morganton had completed grading, but not surfaced. In 1944, the segment of SR 60 from just east-southeast of the Lumpkin‚ÄìUnion county line had a completed hard surface. By the end of 1946, a southern branch of US 76 was designated on SR 60 from Porter Springs to Morganton. Between 1946 and 1948, this branch route was removed from SR 60\\\\. An unnumbered road was built from Murrayville to Dahlonega; it had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. SR 245 was designated from Mineral Bluff to McCaysville. Each terminus had a completed hard surface; the central part had a sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth surface. The next year, SR 136 in the northwest part of Gainesville, as well as the entire length of SR 245, was hard surfaced. The unnumbered road between Murrayville and Dahlonega was designated as SR 249. =1950s= By the middle of 1950, SR 136 from Gainesville to the SR 115 intersection, SR 115 from the SR 136 intersection to Murrayville, all of SR 249, and the entire Union County portion of SR 60 were hard surfaced. By 1952, the entire Lumpkin County portion of SR 60 was hard surfaced. In 1952, an unnumbered road was built from south-southeast of Gainesville into the city. The next year, the northern half of the Fannin County portion of the segment from Porter Springs to Morganton was hard surfaced. In 1954, the southern half was hard surfaced. The next year, the unnumbered road south-southeast of Gainesville was extended to SR 124 east of Braselton. By 1957, SR 60 was extended south-southwest on US 19/SR 9 to Dahlonega, then south-southeast to Gainesville, replacing all of SR 249 and parts of SR 115 and SR 136. Between 1957 and 1960, SR 60 was extended south-southeast to SR 124 east of Braselton. =1970s= In 1977, SR 60 from northwest of Morganton to the North Carolina state line was shifted westward, replacing all of SR 245\\\\. Its former path from Mineral Bluff to the state line was redesignated as SR 60 Spur. Major intersections Special routes =Connector route= State Route 60 Connector (SR 60 Connector) is a connector route that exists entirely within the downtown portion of Gainesville in the central part of Hall County. The entire road is known as Oak Tree Drive for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with the SR 60 mainline (Thompson Bridge Road). It heads northeast for three blocks. Then, it heads southeast for one more block and meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 11 Business (Riverside Drive). =Business route= =Spur route= State Route 60 Spur (SR 60 Spur) is a spur route that exists entirely within the north central part of Fannin County. It is known as Murphy Highway for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with the SR 60 mainline (Lakewood Highway) in Mineral Bluff. The highway travels northeast, through the North Georgia mountains and portions of the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest until it meets its eastern terminus, the North Carolina state line, where the roadway continues as North Carolina Highway 60 (NC 60), southwest of Culberson, North Carolina. The roadway that would eventually become SR 60 Spur was established in 1930 as SR 86 from Mineral Bluff northeast to the North Carolina state line west-northwest of Ivy Log. In January 1932, the entire length of SR 86 was under construction. The next year, the entire length of SR 86 had a completed semi hard surface.

Hiking Trails within the Wilderness Area San Gabriel Designated Wilderness Boundary at Smith Mountain Saddle. Hiking trails in the Designated Wilderness are built and maintained utilizing hand tools and materials which are strictly limited in terms of environmental impact. The use of chainsaws to remove trees that are down across trails is prohibited, requiring the use of crosscut saws, block-and-tackle chains and ropes to pull trees off of trails, griphoists, and other mechanical tools which do not produce noise or petroleum-based pollutants. In addition, wheeled tools and equipment are not permitted to be used in the Designated Wilderness, neither for trail maintenance nor for recreation, causing the wilderness to be classified for pedestrian and equestrian use only with mountain biking prohibited. Blasting to remove rock outcrops is prohibited, as is the use of fire-fighting tools like tractors, Phos-Chek air drops, Tovex Firebreak II explosives, and chainsaws to cut fire lines. Everything must be done by hand, even when fighting fires within the Designated Wilderness. The people who maintain hiking trails within the San Gabriel Designated Wilderness attempt to achieve a passable hiking experience within the wilderness that does not appear to be too greatly unnatural. To achieve such an effect, tree limbs and branches that must be cut back are finished with an effort to appear natural, bucked tree trunks that are removed from the trail are relocated so that they appear at a distance and do not look to have been cut by people, and even sawdust from crosscut saws will be collected and buried off of the trail.

It is now a National Historic Landmark owned by the Society of the First Parish, Concord, with important associations with the Battle of Lexington and Concord at the start of the American Revolution. Overview Information plaque from the front of the Tavern Wright's Tavern was built in 1747 by Ephraim Jones, who operated it until 1751. At the dawn of the American Revolution in April 1775, it was managed by Amos Wright, whose name it has borne ever since. On April 19, the day of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, when the courthouse bell announced the approach of Major Pitcairn's British troops, the Concord Minutemen assembled at Wright's Tavern. Later, after Pitcairn's arrival in the Concord square, British officers refreshed themselves in the tavern.Hudson, Alfred Sereno (1904). The History of Concord, Massachusetts, Vol. I, pp. 6-7. Concord, Massachusetts: The Erudite Press. The tavern also has earlier links to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress which met next door in October 1774, in the First Parish Church. With John Hancock as president and Benjamin Lincoln as secretary, the Congress consisted of 300 delegates from Massachusetts towns who passed measures ending tax payments to the Crown and organizing a militia force to defy King George III by arms if necessary. Wright's Tavern was used as a meeting place for committees of the Congress during the 5-day session. Since the Revolution the building has been put to many uses. Today the tavern is still in good condition with red clapboards and a double-hipped (monitor) roof above its two main stories. It currently serves as educational space for the Concord Museum and as the headquarters of East Side Studio Architects and Nashawtuc Architects.

This total makes it one of the deadliest known typhoons in history. Meteorological history 1922 Swatow Typhoon track A tropical depression located near the Caroline Islands was first spotted July 27. It moved slowly to the northwest, gradually intensifying. On July 31, it crossed northern Luzon, and entered the northernmost part of the South China Sea. It then intensified more and made landfall on the Chinese coast near the city of Swatow late on August 2 or early on August 3. It quickly dissipated inland. The minimum known central pressure of this typhoon is . At one point, the winds were estimated to have a velocity of 100 mph. Impact Due to the typhoon passing through a lightly inhabited part of the Philippines, no reports of significant impact were received. In Swatow in China, the typhoon caused a storm surge of at least 12 ft above normal. The rain was heavy, and left enough water to leave the land saturated for a few days. 933 Swatow was an unfortunate city, as around 5,000 people (out of a population of about 65,000) perished in the storm.

The area around the city had around another 50,000 casualties. The total death toll was above 60,000, and may have been higher than 100,000. The 50,000 to 100,000 deaths-100,000+ deaths caused by this typhoon make it one of the deadliest tropical cyclones in the western north Pacific Ocean.

It cost $250,000 to build and was hailed ‚Äúas one of the largest and most beautiful theaters in greater N.Y.‚Äù by a contemporary publication.

In 1977, the Harlem Community Development Corporation acquired the building. The Victoria has experienced numerous changes since its opening, the most radical being its conversion to a multi-screen movie theater; in 1987, five movie theaters were created from the large auditorium, mezzanine and stage areas. The theater closed as a cinema in 1989, though a 400-seat venue was left intact in the orchestra, at which the original Harlem company of Godspell, which drew major newspaper and television network broadcast coverage, ran for approximately a year in the 1996/97 season.First All-Black Version of Godspell Begins PreviewsGodspell Brings Uplift UptownNew Godspell Updates Show to 21st Century HarlemGodspell rocking the house at Harlem's Victoria TheatreOff-Bway Godspell Eyes Move With Jackson And/Or VereenHarlem Godspell Fighting Media Indifference Day by DayWith Empty Seats at Godspell, An Organizer Cries Bias In 2005 several proposals for redevelopment were made.Groups Vie to Reimagine Loew's Victoria Theater - Wired New York Forum Only two proposals call for reusing the theater's interior, which has angered some community leaders, according to the New York Times.The Real Deal - Take the A Train - to your Harlem hotel The new Victoria Theater project, developed by the Lam Group and Exact Capital, designed by architect Ariel Aufgang and interiors by AJC Design, began construction in April 2017 and is scheduled to open in the spring of 2019.

A unique example of Celtic church construction. It marks the location of the original monastic settlement founded by Benen, a disciple of St. Patrick, the national saint of Ireland. It dates from the 11th century, and has stood unaltered a thousand years. It is not a conventional church in the sense of its ability to hold a congregation. It is reasonably assumed to be the tomb-shrine of the saint. This ensured its survival when the adjacent round tower and medieval monastery were recycled to fortify the now-ruined Cromwellian coastal fortress nearby. The oratory is situated high on a ridge, which dominates the windward southeast sea approach to the main island port. Roofless and with unusually high squared gables it cuts a striking, almost oriental silhouette against the skyline, even though internally it measures a tiny 3.2 m x 2.1 m. It is formed from massive blocks of stone (a single slab forms a half of one side), and is bonded by mortar and very careful fitting. Its thick walls are pierced by a traveated (three beam) narrow north doorway with inclining jambs, and cut away lintel.

Flying flag of Amsterdam. The flag of Amsterdam is the official flag for Amsterdam, the capital city of the Netherlands. The current design of the flag depicts three Saint Andrew's Crosses and is based on the escutcheon in the coat of arms of Amsterdam. Design journalist Roman Mars declared it during a TED Talk in 2015 to be the most \\"badass\\" city flag in the world, as well as an example to others. He particularly praised the simplicity and popular appeal that led to its widespread use.Amsterdamse vlag is meest badass stadsvlag ter wereld (Dutch)  Meaning  The colours of the flag are derived primarily from the shield of Amsterdam's coat of arms. According to the city government, its origin could go back to the coat of arms of the Persijn family, which once owned a large tract of land in the capital. These colors, as well as the crosses, are to be seen in the flags of both Ouder- Amstel and Amstelveen. The popular legend that the three Saint Andrew's crosses were meant to ward off fire, floods and the black plague is unfounded as the use of three St. Andrews crosses by noble families in the area precedes the arrival of the Black Death in Europe. In the coats of arms of two other Dutch cities, Dordrecht and Delft, the middle stripe symbolises water. In regards to Amsterdam, this black strip becomes the River Amstel. This could be why other references state that the three crosses represent three fordable places in the river Amstel.

Before its official adoption there was also an unofficial use of a flag with the city's coat of arms in the middle of a red- white-black horizontal tricolor. Such a design was already in use in the 17th century, but in Amsterdam history, other designs in the colors red, black and white were also used. Sometimes the three St. Andrew crosses were placed in the white orbit of the red-white-blue Dutch national flag.

It embraces the values of compassion and service to others, reflecting the care and dedication provided to the wounded and sick. Approval for the Corps flag was granted on 7 February 1958. History =Foundation= The history of RAANC can be traced back to the formation of the Australian Army Nursing Service on 13 August 1898. At the time it was made up of one Lady Superintendent and 24 nurses. The service saw its first action in the Boer war, when the New South Wales and Victorian governments arranged for a detachment of nurses to deploy with their troops to Africa. Groups and individual nurses from Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland also served in the Anglo-Boer War. Due to the performance of the nurses in that conflict, an order was given in 1902 for the formation of the Australian Army Nursing Service under the control of the Federal Government. It is this order's promulgation, 1 July 1903, which is celebrated as RAANC Corps day. =First World War= 2,139 AANS female nurses served overseas in the World War I with 423 serving in Australia, together with 130 Australians who worked with Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service. 25 died on active service and 388 were decorated.http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/womeninaction/ =Second World War= In World War II, 3,477 women joined the AANS with 71 members losing their lives (23 in battle and 18 as a result of accident or illness). 38 became Prisoner of War. 137 decorations were awarded including two George Medals.

The French Armenian community is, by far, the largest in the European Union and the third largest in the world. Although the first Armenians settled in France in the Middle Ages, like most of the Armenian diaspora, the Armenian community in France was established by survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Others came through the second half of the 20th century, fleeing political and economic instability in the Middle Eastern countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and Iran) and, more recently, from Armenia. History The tomb of Leon V, the last Armenian king, at the Basilica of St Denis =Early history= Armenians have a long history of settlement in France. The first Armenians appeared in Francia in the Early Middle Ages. In 591, an Armenian bishop named Simon is recorded to have met Gregory of Tours in the city of Tours. Among other churches, the 9th century church of Germigny-des- Pr√©s‚Äîbuilt by Odo of Metz (possibly an Armenian)‚Äîis said by architecture historians to have an Armenian influence. The thirty-six letters of the Armenian alphabet found in a Latin inscription at the St. Martha Church in Tarascon show that Armenians lived there before the 13th century, when the last three characters of the Armenian alphabet were added.: \\"C'est du m√™me si√®cle que remonte l'alphabet mesrobien de trente-six lettres, grav√© sur une niche de l'√©glise Sainte-Marthe de Tarascon, sans doute par un p√®lerin arm√©nien qui se dirigeait vers Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle.\\" The statue of Jean Althen in Avignon The contacts between Armenians and the French became frequent during the Crusades. The Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, located on the north-eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, became of strategic importance to the crusaders en route to Palestine. Armenian kings Oshin and Leo IV are known to have given special trading privileges for the French. In the 14th century, the Hethumids were unable to retain power in Cilician Armenia and following the assassination of Leo IV in 1341, his Lusignan cousin became King of Armenia as Constantine II. The Lusignan kings were of French origin and ruled the country until 1375 when the last king, Leo V, was captured by the Mamluks and taken to Egypt. He was later released and transferred to France where he died in 1393 and was buried at the Basilica of St Denis, the burial place of the French monarchs. Since the 15th century, Armenians began migrating to France in small numbers. An Armenian inscription from this period survives on the Bourges Cathedral. In 1672, an Armenian named Pascal (Harut'iwn) opened the first coffee house in Paris. From 1672 to 1686, Voskan Yerevantsi operated a publishing house in Marseille. With the liberalization of the economy, the number of Armenians in France increased and reach 300‚Äì400 by 1680. Jean Althen (Hovhann√®s Althounian), a Persian-Armenian agronomist from Nakhchivan, is known to have introduced madder to southern France in the 1750s. A statue of him was erected in Avignon expressing the city's gratefulness to him. During his campaign in Egypt, Napoleon was presented an Armenian Mamluk named Roustam Raza. He became Napoleon's bodyguard and served him until 1814. Booklet of Papier d'Armenie In the 19th century, many young Armenian males (among them poet and political activist Nahapet Rusinian and architect Nigoƒüayos Balyan) moved to France for education. Papier d'Arm√©nie (\\"Armenian Paper\\"), a popular deodorizing paper, was created in the late 1880s by Auguste Ponsot. He visited Turkish Armenia and found out that the Armenians use benzoin resin and plant sap to disinfect their homes and churches. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, thousands of Armenians escaped persecution in their ancestral homeland that was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time. Events like the Hamidian massacres and the Adana massacre gave rise to greater Armenian emigration. By the eve of the First World War, around 4,000 Armenians lived in France. =World War I and the Armenian Genocide= By the 1916 French‚ÄìArmenian Agreement, the French Armenian Legion was formed out of Armenians from around the world, including many French Armenians, by negotiations between Boghos Nubar and French political and military authorities. The Legion took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Franco-Turkish War. As a result of the Allied victory in the First World War, tens of thousands of survivors of the Armenian Genocide found themselves living in the French-occupied part of the Ottoman Empire in Cilicia, and far more in the French Mandate territories of Syria and Lebanon, as the death camps of Deir ez-Zor were in Syria. In 1920, the French army under General Henri Gouraud ordered the French Armenian Legion to lay down their weapons and that the Armenian refugees should leave at once. He had formed a \\"peaceful, reconstructive policy\\" with the Turkish nationalists to pull French troops out of Cilicia, but all that ended up doing was allowing attacks against Armenian civilians to resume.Seventh Year of the War - 1920 Most Cilician Armenian fled alongside the French and were resettled in refugee camps in Alexandretta, Aleppo, the Beqaa Valley (e.g. Anjar) and Beirut. From there, entire families took the opportunity to flee to France. The influx of the Armenian Genocide survivors brought tens of thousands of Armenians to France. By the early 1920s, approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Armenians lived in France. According to another source 90,000 genocide survivors settled in France, more than half of whom were villagers. Most Armenians initially arrived in Marseille, thereafter many of them spread across France and settled in large cities, especially in Paris and the urban areas across the Paris‚ÄìMarseille railway, notably Lyon. In the Interwar period, the majority of Armenians in France were unskilled villagers that mostly worked in factories for low wages. Between 1922 and 1929 80% of Armenians in France were laborers. They earned 10-15% less than Frenchmen. In this period, a number of Turkish Armenian intellectuals moved to France, including Arshag Chobanian (1895), Komitas (1919, transferred to a hospital in Paris where he remained until his death), Levon Pashalian (1920), Shahan Shahnour (1923). =World War II and the Fourth Republic= Manouchian during the Second World War The Armenian community of France played an active role in the French Resistance. Poet and communist militant Missak Manouchian, the commander of the multiethnic Groupe Manouchian, became an important Resistance leader. Besides Arpen Lavitian, the other executed Armenian member, his group also included many Jews from across Europe. Poets K√©gham Atmadjian and Rouben Melik were other prominent participants in the Resistance. The Anti-Fascist Underground Patriotic Organization was commanded by Armenian officers. Resisters Alexander Kazarian and Bardukh Petrosian were awarded by the highest military orders of France by General Charles de Gaulle.Seven songs about Armenia, Gevorg Emin, Progress, 1981 - p. 37 Another Resistance fighter, Louise Aslanian, a famous writer and poetess, was a recruiter for the Francs- Tireurs et Partisans in a combat cell of the French Communist Party. She along with her husband Arpiar Aslanian worked in an underground publishing house and actively engaged in supplying fighters of the French Resistance with weapons. Louise opened the women's division of the French Resistance and was responsible for the Armenian Resistance in the Northern France. She and her husband were arrested on July 24, 1944, and were later killed in Nazi concentration camps. Henri Karayan, a member of the Manouchian Group, participated in illegal distribution of Humanit√© in Paris and was engaged in armed struggle until the Lib√©ration.Henri Karayan, un engagement pour la libert√© et l'universalisme, 2011 In 2012, 95-year-old Ars√®ne Tchakarian , the last survivor of the Manouchian resistance group who fought against occupying Nazi German forces during World War II, was decorated as Officer of the Legion of Honor by President Nicolas Sarkozy. Immediately after the Second World War, about 7,000 Armenians repatriated to Soviet Armenia. =Migration of Armenians from the Middle East= Thousands of new immigrants arrived in France from the Middle Eastern countries like Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Iran since the 1950s. These new immigrants mobilized the French Armenian community. By the 1980s around 300,000 Armenians lived in France. In 1983, the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia launched an attack at the Paris Orly airport, as part of its campaign for the recognition of and reparations for the Armenian Genocide. The explosion killed eight people and injured fifty-five. The campaign to pass the resolution condemning the Armenian Genocide at the European Council unleashed on June 19, 1987, at a Strasbourg demonstration. =Contemporary period = The devastating earthquake in Armenia on 7 December 1988 led to huge mobilization of the French Armenian community. Among others, Charles Aznavour established a charitable foundation in to help the victims of the earthquake. As the Institut national d'√©tudes d√©mographiques, France's national statistics agency, does not collect data on ethnicity there is no reliable information about the number of French people of Armenian ancestry. Various experts, media and organizations have estimated the number of French Armenians to be 250,000, 300,000, 400,000, 450,000, 500,000, 500,000-700,000, 750,000. As of 2005, there were 12,355 Armenian-born people residing in France. Culture =Language and education= SIL Ethnologue as of 2009 estimated that Armenian is spoken by around 70,000 people in France.Ethnologue (2009 edition), no longer represented in the 2015 edition. Most French Armenians speak Western Armenian, while a minority (recent Armenian immigrants from Armenia and Armenians from Iran) speak Eastern Armenian. Today, Armenian classes are organized in many localities with full bilingual kindergartens and primary schools near Paris and Marseille attended by several thousand children and youths. Armenian is currently a valid option counting toward the Baccalaureate, the French High School certificate. =Religion= St. John the Baptist Cathedral in Paris The majority of the Armenian French population is of the Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) faith and belong to the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin of the Armenian Apostolic Church. A minority of Armenians belongs to the Catholic faith and are adherents of the Armenian Catholic Church. An estimated 5,000 Armenian Evangelicals live in France. Each of the three Armenian Churches has its own organization in France. The Diocese of France the Armenian Apostolic Church under the spiritual guidance and jurisdiction of the Catholicos of All Armenians. The Diocese has its own Youth movement l'Association de la jeunesse de l‚ÄôEglise apostolique arm√©nienne de France, which has chapters in the various 26 parishes of the Diocese. The Eparchy of Sainte-Croix-de-Paris depending from the Armenian Catholic Church, and the Armenian Evangelical Churches Union of France, part of the Armenian Evangelical Church. =Institutions= The Armenian General Benevolent Union, one of the largest Armenian organizations in the world, headquartered in Paris between 1922 and 1940. The Armenian Social Aid Association, operating Armenian retirement homes, was founded before this period and is unique to France. National institutions, and first and foremost the Armenian Church of Paris founded in 1905, were very soon to co-exist in Paris, playing a fundamental role in defending and protecting the refugees. In the municipalities with a high concentration of Armenians, there are a lot of associations in a vast array of fields ranging from the cultural (e.g. Maison de la culture arm√©nienne de D√©cines in D√©cines, near Lyon or Radio AYP FM, in Paris), social (e.g. Maison des √©tudiants arm√©niens in Paris), sports (e.g. Union de la jeunesse arm√©nienne d'Alfortville and Union Sportive de la Jeunesse d'Origine Arm√©nienne de Valence football clubs), or more specific like the Association nationale des anciens combattants et r√©sistants arm√©niens.Liste des associations arm√©niennes de France , Netarm√©nie There are also umbrella organizations, the Forum des associations arm√©niennes de France, created in 1991,Diaspora en France - Les Associations, site de l'Association Culturelle Arm√©nienne de Marne-la-Vall√©e and the Conseil de coordination des organisations arm√©niennes de France, new name since 2001 of the ¬´ Comit√© du 24 avril ¬ª.Statuts du Conseil de coordination des organisations arm√©niennes de France, liste des organisations membres du Conseil de coordination des organisations arm√©niennes de France =Media= ;Press The first Armenian journal in France began publishing in 1855.

There are monuments dedicated to the genocide victims in several cities in France, including Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. The French Senate passed a bill in 2011 that criminalizes denial of acknowledged genocides, which includes both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide. The bill was submitted by the parliament in 2012.French Senate passes bill outlawing genocide denial, France 24, 23 January 2012.

He was twice briefly chief of state of the State of El Salvador, within the Federal Republic of Central America (1834-35 and 1840). Silva was born into a well-to-do family about 1804. In 1827 he received a doctorate in law. He was a deputy to the state legislature in 1828, and its secretary in 1829. In May 1829 he asked for a military judgment of the prisoners taken at the capitulation of Mejicanos, in the first phase of the Central American Civil War. In June 1829 he moved to Guatemala, as a commissioner of the legislature, charged along with P. Colom with personally delivering to General Francisco Moraz√°n, commander of the victorious revolutionary armies, the decree by which Moraz√°n was to remain in power until the establishment of new federal authorities. Silva was again a deputy to the Salvadoran Legislature in 1834, and became president of the Legislature in October. From October 14, 1834 to April 10, 1835 he governed El Salvador, as vice-head of state, after the Honduran Joaqu√≠n Escol√°n y Balibrera declined the appointment as head of state. He governed again in the same capacity from February 16, 1840 to April 5, 1840. In his second term he received his authority from General Moraz√°n, when the latter left to invade Guatemala. However, on April 5, 1840 he gave up his office to follow General Moraz√°n into exile, embarking on the brigantine Izalco from the port of La Libertad, La Libertad along with many other followers of Moraz√°n. The Municipal Council of San Salvador took over the executive authority of the state. The Federal Republic of Central America was formally dissolved in 1840. Licenciado Silva governed with honesty, and ended the seizure of property of opponents of the Liberals. He performed judicial functions and was president of the constituent congress of 1839. Silva remained in exile in Costa Rica and Panama for two years, returning to El Salvador in 1842. He returned as a private citizen, and lived many years dedicated to his profession as a lawyer. On January 9, 1850 he was named a Salvadoran delegate to the National Convention that was called to reorganize the Central American Union, be he declined the appointment (several times). He was also named a delegate by Honduras. In spite of his refusals, he attended the assembly in Le√≥n, Nicaragua. On January 9, 1851 he attended another session at Chinandega, where he was named secretary of the assembly. In 1853 he was elected a senator. By now he was recognized as one of the most outstanding jurists of the country. On June 22, 1854 he was named a member of the commission charged with editing the mercantile code. He was reelected senator from San Miguel, and elected president of the Senate from 1857 to 1858. On February 4, 1858 the executive authority designated Silva and Dr. Justo Abaunza as a commission charged with editing the civil code and making penal reforms. In 1862 Silva returned to the Senate and was again elected its president. At the end of this term he retired to private life because of illness. In 1872 he published the work Recuerdos al 15 de Septiembre (Memories of September 15), considered as his political testament.

Although the first dozen or so questions are meaningless, the rest are quite revealing, and reading the different characters' answers to the same question set shows their personalities. The inconsistencies in the series are explored. Contradictions such as the how the apartment building is different from the outside versus the inside: Every drawing of the outside shows each apartment consists of two windows ‚Äì a small window next to a large one on a veranda; yet, all internal drawings depict a single room with the large veranda window. Where did the small window go? The inconsistencies are never explained. The author merely acknowledges them, hinting that it's an inside joke.

It is also known as the white-collared kingfisher or mangrove kingfisher. It has a wide range extending from the Red Sea across southern Asia to Polynesia. A number of subspecies and subspecies groups have been split from this species including the Pacific kingfisher, the islet kingfisher, the Torresian kingfisher, the Mariana kingfisher, and the Melanesian kingfisher. Taxonomy The collared kingfisher was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1780. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle. This was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Alcedo chloris in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality is the island of Buru within Indonesia. The current genus Todiramphus was introduced by the French surgeon and naturalist Ren√© Lesson in 1827. The specific epithet chloris is modern Latin for 'green' or 'greenish'. =List of subspecies= There are numerous subspecies in the species‚Äô largely coastal and insular range from the Red Sea to Polynesia: Red Sea and Arabian coasts * T. c. abyssinicus (Pelzeln, 1856) ‚Äì southern Red Sea coasts of Somalia and Arabia * T. c. kalbaensis (Cowles, 1980) ‚Äì coasts of northeastern United Arab Emirates (Khawr Kalba) and northern Oman India and Indian Ocean * T. c. vidali (Sharpe, 1892) ‚Äì western India from Ratnagiri to Kerala. * T. c. davisoni (Sharpe, 1892) ‚Äì Andaman Islands and Coco Islands (in Bay of Bengal, south of Myanmar) * T. c. occipitalis (Blyth, 1846) ‚Äì Nicobar Islands South East Asia * T. c. humii (Sharpe, 1892) ‚Äì coasts of West Bengal eastwards to Burma (including the Mergui Archipelago), the Malay Peninsula, Tioman and north-eastern Sumatra. * T. c. armstrongi (Sharpe, 1892) ‚Äì interior of Burma and Thailand, Indochina and eastern China * T. c. laubmannianus (Grote, 1933) ‚Äì Sumatra (excluding northeast) and Borneo, including intervening islands. * T. c. chloropterus (Oberholser, 1919) ‚Äì islands off western Sumatra * T. c. azelus (Oberholser, 1919) ‚Äì Enggano (off southwestern Sumatra) * T. c. palmeri (Oberholser, 1919) ‚Äì Java, Bali, Bawean and Kangean Islands * T. c. collaris (Scopoli, 1786) ‚Äì Philippines, including Palawan and nearby islands.

Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA. It varies from blue to green above while the underparts can be white or buff. There is a white collar around the neck, giving the bird its name. Some races have a white or buff stripe over the eye while others have a white spot between the eye and bill. There may be a black stripe through the eye. The large bill is black with a pale yellow base to the lower mandible. Females tend to be greener than the males. Immature birds are duller than the adults with dark scaly markings on the neck and breast. It has a variety of calls which vary geographically. The most typical call is a loud, harsh and metallic \\"kee-kee-kee\\" repeated several times. Distribution and habitat It is most commonly found in coastal areas, particularly in mangrove swamps. It also inhabits farmland, open woodland, grassland and gardens. In some parts of its range, especially on islands, it can be seen further inland, ranging into forest or into mountain areas. Birds often perch conspicuously on wires, rocks or bare branches. T. c. humii at Sunderbans, West Bengal The subspecies that occurs furthest west in the Eurasian/African landmass is T. c. abyssinica of north-east Africa, which is found in patches of mangroves in Eritrea and has also been recorded from Sudan and Somalia. Further east in Arabia is the endangered race T. c. kalbaensis with a population of 55 pairs or fewer; these are almost entirely restricted to Khor Kalba in the United Arab Emirates, but breeding has also occurred recently at Khor Shinas in Oman. Further subspecies occur locally around the coasts of India and Bangladesh and on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In Southeast Asia and Indonesia the species is widespread and common, occurring far inland in some regions. Feeding An individual at Zuari River, Goa, India Small crabs and shrimps are the favoured food in coastal regions but a wide variety of other animals are eaten including insects (including beetles, cicadas, stick-insects, grasshoppers, moths and butterflies), spiders, earthworms, snails, frogs, lizards, small snakes, small fish, and sometimes small birds and mice. The collared kingfisher perches almost motionless for long periods waiting for prey. When it spots something it glides down to catch it and then flies back to the perch where larger items are pounded against the branch to subdue them. Any indigestible remains are regurgitated as pellets. Reproduction The nest is a hole, either a natural tree hole or a burrow excavated by the birds themselves in a rotten tree, arboreal termite nest or earth bank. They will also occupy old woodpecker holes. A clutch of usually two to five rounded, whitish eggs are laid directly on the floor of the burrow with no nest material used. Both parents take part in incubating the eggs and feeding the chicks. The young birds leave the nest about 44 days after hatching. Two broods are often raised in a year. Conservation status With a very wide distribution and common to abundant population, the collared kingfisher is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

The name is formed from two components in archaic Polish: * w√≥j (Slavic: voj), a root pertaining to war. It also forms words like wojownik (\\"warrior\\") and wojna (\\"war\\"). * ciech (from an earlier form, tech), meaning \\"joy\\". The resulting combination means \\"he who enjoys war\\" or \\"joyous warrior\\". Its Polish diminutive forms include Wojtek , Wojtu≈õ , Wojtas, Wojcio, Wojteczek, Wojcieszek, Wojtaszka, Wojtaszek, Wojan (noted already in 1136), Wojko, and variants noted as early as 1400, including Woytko, Woythko, and Voytko. The feminine form is Wojciecha (). Related names in South Slavic languages include Vojko, Vojislav, and Vojteh. The name has been rendered into German in several different variations, including: Woitke, Witke, Voitke, Voytke, Woytke, Vogtke, Woytegk, Woytek, Wogtke, Woetke, W√∂tke, and Wotke. It appears as Woyzeck in the play of that name by Georg B√ºchner. A variant form is Wozzeck, the result of confusion due to the similarity of the letters and in S√ºtterlin handwriting; this form is used as the name of the opera by Alban Berg, based on B√ºchner's play. The Germanic name Adalbert is sometimes associated with Wojciech, or Vojtech, but the two names are not linguistically related. Their components and meanings are completely different, but the names may have become associated as a result of the 10th-century St. Adalbert of Prague (born Vojtƒõch Slavn√≠k) having taken the name Adalbert at his confirmation.

The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy: An Ego State Therapy for Healing Adults with Childhood Trauma and Attachment Wounds. San Antonio: DNMS Institute. . It is designed to treat adults with psychological trauma wounds (such as those inflicted by verbal, physical, and sexual abuse) and with attachment wounds (such as those inflicted by parental rejection, neglect, and enmeshment). The DNMS is an ego state therapy based on the assumption that the degree to which developmental needs were not adequately met is the degree to which a client may be stuck in childhood. This model aims to identify ego states that are stuck in the past and help them get unstuck by remediating those unmet developmental needs. The processing starts with the DNMS therapist guiding a patient to mobilize three internal Resource ego states: a Nurturing Adult Self, a Protective Adult Self, and a Spiritual Core Self. The therapist then guides these three Resources to gently help wounded child ego states get unstuck from the past by meeting their unmet developmental needs, helping them process through painful emotions, and by establishing an emotional bond. The relationship wounded child parts have with these Resources is considered the primary agent for change. Alternating bilateral stimulation (made popular by EMDR therapy) is applied at key points in the protocol to enhance the process. The DNMS focuses special attention on healing maladaptive introjects (wounded ego states that mimic abusive, neglectful, or dysfunctional caregivers. The model assumes that these ego states cause the most trouble for clients, so helping them heal may result in a significant benefit‚Äîleading to a decrease in unwanted behaviors, beliefs, and emotions. Ego states / parts of self According to Daniel Siegel, a state of mind can become engrained when a positive event is experienced repeatedly; when a negative event is experienced repeatedly; or when a traumatic event is overwhelming.Siegel, D.J. (1999). The developing mind: Toward a neurobiology of interpersonal experience. New York: Guilford Press. . The DNMS assumes engrained states of mind can become sub- personalities, parts of self, or ego states with a point of view. Some parts form by reacting to others, while others form by introjecting others.Introjection Introjection is the unconscious internalization of another person's behaviors, ideas, values, or points of view.Berne, E. (1961). Transactional analysis in psychotherapy, a systematic individual and social psychiatry. New York: Grove Press. .Freud, S. (1923/1961). The ego and the id. In J Strachey (Ed. and Trans.), The standard edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud (Vol.19). London: Hogarth Press. (Original work published in 1923).Perls, F. S. (1973). The Gestalt approach and eyewitness to therapy. Science and Behavior Books, Inc. .Watkins, J. G., & Watkins, H. H. (1997). Ego states: Theory and therapy. New York: Norton. . An introject is an internal representation of another person. The DNMS assumes an introject can form when mirror neurons fire during significantly positive or negative relationship events. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that certain neural circuits get activated in a person who is carrying out an action, expressing an emotion, or experiencing a sensation, and in a person who is observing that person's action, emotion, or sensation.Gallese V., Fadiga L., Fogassi L., and Rizzolatti G. (1996). Action recognition in the premotor cortex. Brain 119: 593-609. Vittorio Gallese, one of the discoverers of mirror neurons, calls this shared activation. He believes shared activation of neural circuits leads to embodied simulation. Embodied simulation means that internal representations of the body states associated with the actions, emotions, and sensations of the observed are evoked in the observer, 'as if' he or she were doing a similar action or experiencing a similar emotion or sensation.Gallese V., Eagle M.E., and Migone P. (2007). Intentional attunement: Mirror neurons and the neural underpinnings of interpersonal relations. Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 55: 131-176. Gallese believes this process to be a basic functional mechanism of the brain, which engages automatically and unconsciously, not the result of a willed or conscious cognitive effort, not aimed at interpreting the intentions of others. This suggests that the formation of introjects of the significant people in our lives, is a biological reflex that‚Äîfor better or worse‚Äîwe have no control over. Parts of self can interact with each other like family members‚Äîfor example, cooperatively, antagonistically, or both. They can have competing agendas, which can lead to internal conflicts. The DNMS is an ego state therapy. Like other ego state therapies, it aims to help individual wounded ego states heal, and encourage cooperation and integration between ego states. (Other ego state therapies include psychosynthesis, Gestalt therapy, transactional analysis, Internal Family Systems Therapy, Voice Dialogue, and inner child psychotherapy.) =Healthy parts of self= Healthy parts of self form in response to positive, affirming relationships with role models who are loving and attuned. They live in the present; feel and manage the full range of emotions; hold positive beliefs about self and world; engage in appropriate, desirable behaviors; and have an adaptive point of view. Some healthy parts of self may be adaptive introjects, or internal representations of caring, supporting people. A DNMS therapist will help a patient mobilize healthy, internal, Resource ego states that can reparent wounded parts of self to help them heal. =Wounded parts of self= Wounded parts of self form in response to traumas; and to negative, wounding relationships with role models who are abusive, neglectful, rejecting, and enmeshing. They live in the past; are stuck in painful emotions; hold negative, irrational beliefs about self and world; engage in unwanted or inappropriate behaviors; and have a maladaptive point of view. The DNMS model presumes two categories of wounded ego states‚Äîreactive parts and maladaptive introjects. Reactive parts Reactive parts of self form in reaction to significantly wounding experiences. People are usually very aware of the problem behaviors, beliefs, or emotions of reactive parts. There are many types of reactive parts. Some hold raw emotions, like anxiety, terror, anger, sadness, grief, despair, shame, and hopelessness. Some hold reactions to specific traumatic experiences. Some cope with painful emotions with pain-avoidant behaviors like withdrawing, drinking, or overeating. Some cope with painful emotions with self-punishing behaviors like cutting, starving, or isolating. Some rebel with risky or self- destructive behaviors like drinking, smoking, or engaging in unprotected sex. Some try to manage hurtful people with strategic pleasing behaviors like complying or overachieving. Some try to prevent attacks from others by engaging in aggressive behaviors‚Äîputting up a fa√ßade of strength, intimidation, control, or power. And some try to control other parts of self with warnings, threats, commands, or admonitions intended to encourage behaviors that please others or discourage behaviors that might upset others. Maladaptive introjects A maladaptive introject is a part of self that forms when mirror neurons fire in the presence of a significant role model who is physically or emotionally wounding (such as an abusive or rejecting parent.) In the DNMS model a maladaptive introject is conceptualized as a part of self with an intrinsically good true nature that is unwillingly wearing a mask or costume that conveys the role model's wounding messages. The mask is the mirror neuron's engrained recording of a past wounding experience. When the mask is activated (or when the recording plays) the wounding message is directed to reactive parts who perceive the wounding experience from the past is still happening in the present. (The relationship between maladaptive introjects and reactive parts in the DNMS model is similar to the relationship between top dog and underdog parts in the Gestalt model.)Perls, F.S., Hefferline, R.F., & Goodman, P. (1951). Gestalt therapy: Excitement and growth in the human personality. New York: Dell. . Interventions The DNMS endeavors to get maladaptive introjects unstuck from the past. This is intended to stop the internal conflict generated between wounding introjects masks and wounded reactive parts. The processing starts with the Resource Development Protocol. This protocol strengthens a client's connection to three healthy parts of self‚Äîa Nurturing Adult Self, a Protective Adult Self, and a Spiritual Core Self. These Resources are based on real experiences a patient has had of nurturing and protecting a loved one, and peak spiritual experiences‚Äîso that patients understand their Resources are real parts of self, not just imaginary helpers. Next a series of steps are employed to identify a group of important maladaptive introjects connected by a common theme, such as rejection, abuse, or enmeshment. The steps include an Attachment Needs Ladders questionnaire, a Conference Room Protocol, and a Switching the Dominance Protocol. Once identified, these introjects are then invited to connect with the Resources. A DNMS therapist will guide the Resources to meet their developmental needs, process through their painful emotions, and strengthen an emotional bond. According to the DNMS model, these interactions with Resource parts of self will help introjects heal. As they heal, patients report unwanted behaviors, beliefs, and emotions diminish. Research Two DNMS case-study articles have been published in peer-reviewed journals. One is a case study about a patient with dissociative identity disorder.Schmidt, S.J. (2004) Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy: A new treatment approach applied to dissociative identity disorder. Journal of Trauma and Dissociation, 5(4), 55-78. The other is eight case studies representing the work of three DNMS therapists.Schmidt, S.J., & Hernandez, A. (2007). The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy: Eight case studies. Traumatology. 13:27-48. While these published case-studies tend to support the assertion that the DNMS is effective, they do not meet the criteria for empirical research. The DNMS has not yet been tested in controlled clinical trials and cannot be called an evidence-based therapy.

The species is endemic to eastern Australia. Etymology The specific name, mackayi, is in honor of Australian herpetologist Roy D. MacKay.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Anomalopus mackayi, pp. 164-165). Behaviour and habitat A. mackayi generally burrows in areas with black soil and few trees. Description A. mackayi generally grows to the size of about snout-vent length (SVL). It is similar to Anomalopus leuckartii but with distinctly didactyle (having two digits) hindlimbs, a central dark spot within each individual scale, and is yellow-green below with darker flecks (Cogger 2000). Reproduction Adult females of A. mackayi give birth to live young. Conservation status A. mackayi is listed as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List, and as Endangered under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992.

Literary career Pamela Brown was just 13 when she started writing her first book, The Swish of the Curtain, in 1938. A year later, when World War II broke out, she left Colchester County High School - a selective grammar school for girls, and went to live in Wales with her family. She continued with her writing however, sending chapters of the book to her friends back in Colchester, Essex, and finally finished the book when she was 16. The Swish of the Curtain tells the story of seven stage- struck children who form an amateur theatre company in a town called Fenchester, Brown's made-up name for her home town of Colchester. She herself was passionate about the theatre and, from an early age, put on plays with her friends. She went on to write several sequels to her first book, and other children‚Äôs novels. Her career as an actress and television producer provided her with much detail about early television and life in repertory. Stage career With her earnings from The Swish of the Curtain, Brown trained as an actress at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She worked on the professional stage as ‚ÄòMela Brown‚Äô, to avoid confusion with another actress of the same name.Pamela Brown (IV) Television career For some years, Pamela Brown produced children's programmes for BBC television.

The novel has been reprinted many timesThe Swish of the Curtain at Fantastic Fiction and has been adapted for television and radio. It was followed by four sequels. Plot summary It tells the story of seven young people in three different families who form an amateur theatrical group, the Blue Door Theatre Company. The children write, produce, direct and act in their own plays, each of them harnessing a particular talent. Nigel designs scenery, for example; Jeremy composes music; while Sandra makes costumes. During the course of the book, each of the young people realises a particular ambition. It is \\"Bulldog\\", who shines in comic roles, who realises his ambition to create the elusive \\"swish of the curtain\\". At the book's climax, the \\"Blue Doors\\" enter a drama contest which they have to win in order to be allowed to attend dramatic school to realise their dream of a career in the professional theatre.

For the steamboat captains, that wide range made it one of the toughest navigable rivers in British Columbia. Nevertheless, at least sixteen paddlewheel steamboats plied the Skeena River from the coast to Hazelton from 1864 to 1912. Pioneer sternwheelers The first sternwheeler to arrive on the Skeena River was the Union, which was owned and operated by Captain Tom Coffin. On her first trip up from Victoria in 1864 she carried four passengers and 20 tons of freight. However, Coffin soon realized that he was not able to ascend the Skeena without more preparation, and the trip was declared a failure. In 1865, the Collin's Overland Telegraph Company chartered the Union, and Captain Coffin gave the Skeena another try. The Union fought her way upstream for and could not ascend any further. The telegraph company then decided to build their own sternwheeler, the Mumford, and she left Victoria under Captain Coffin in July 1866. This time Coffin travelled upstream, a feat he repeated three times, successfully delivering of material for the telegraph line and 12,000 rations for its workers. Passengers during these pioneer journeys did not enjoy a luxurious or relaxing trip. They were often kept busy with bucksaws and axes, helping chop wood for the ravenous boiler. The Mumford left the Skeena in October and berthed in New Westminster. That was the end of her adventures, as the Collins Telegraph Company went defunct when the transatlantic cable was successfully laid. Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company and Robert Cunningham HBC Caledonia at Hazelton in 1901 When the Omineca Gold Rush began in 1869, it became profitable to attempt navigation on the Skeena again. The Omineca diggings could be easily reached from Hazelton, where a trail ran for , passing Fort Babine and Takla Lake. At first, canoes were used to ship the supplies from the coast. Captain William Moore was under contract with the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company (HBC) to perform this service, and Robert Cunningham traded as an independent. This was gruelling and perilous work, as well as slow and expensive. The HBC decided in 1889 to build a sternwheeler, the Caledonia, and hired Captain George Odin to be her pilot. She was launched on February 28, 1891, at New Westminster and made her first trip to Hazelton that May, taking nine days to make the trip. The Caledonia was considered a success and began serving not only the Skeena River, but also the northern coastal regions. Captain John Bonser was hired on to be her captain, and in 1895 the Caledonia was overhauled and lengthened at his request, making her more manoeuvrable. Hazelton lining through Kitselas Canyon Bonser named eleven of the canyons and rapids on the Skeena River, using the character of the obstacle as a guide. Among them were the Whirly Gig Rapids, Hornet‚Äôs Nest Rapids and the Devil‚Äôs Elbow Canyon, where the Skeena rushed directly towards a rock bluff before twisting off to the right. Despite these perils the Caledonia operated for seven seasons until the HBC replaced her with a new sternwheeler in 1898, also named the Caledonia. By this time, the Klondike Gold Rush was in full swing and there was more interest in the north than ever previously. Robert Cunningham had prospered during this period and now owned a cannery and a lumber mill. He decided that a sternwheeler would be a fine addition to his enterprises, and he bought the Monte Cristo and hired Captain Bonser away from the HBC to pilot it. The HBC built a second sternwheeler, the Strathcona, and were little concerned about Cunningham‚Äôs rival vessel. Then in 1900, Cunningham sent Bonser down to Victoria to design a sternwheeler. This would become the Hazelton, and under Bonser‚Äôs command she soon proved to be superior to the other boats on the Skeena. In her first season, she went to Hazelton thirteen times, making the trip upstream in forty hours and downstream in ten. Realizing that the Strathcona and the Caledonia could not compete, the HBC built a third sternwheeler, the Mount Royal and hired Captain Johnson as her pilot. On her launch date, April 9, 1902, she got hung up during her launch, and after two hours was freed, only to get caught up again. A bad launch was considered to be an ill omen and, in this case, was one that would be fulfilled. Sternwheeler race on the Skeena HBC Mount Royal in 1902 When the HBC's Mount Royal arrived at the Skeena, rivalry flared between her and the Robert Cunningham‚Äôs Hazelton almost immediately, with each captain trying to beat the other's times to Hazelton and back. The standing order from both companies was \\"beat the other boat.\\" Inevitably, this led to a side-by-side race, an old but dangerous tradition among sternwheelers. In the spring of 1904, both boats wanted to be the first one of the season to arrive in Hazelton. Captain Bonser started out in the Hazelton first, and while he was wooding-up upstream, he saw the Mount Royal with Johnson at the helm coming up from behind. Wooding-up was immediately ceased, and the Hazelton pulled into the stream as the Mount Royal approached, and they raced bow to bow. Slowly the Mount Royal gained on the Hazelton. Captain Bonser was having none of it, and he rammed the Mount Royal several times. Johnson lost control and the current carried her back downstream, bow first. Bonser wagged the Hazelton‚Äôs stern at the Mount Royal, tooted the whistle and continued triumphantly upstream. Furious, Johnson left the pilothouse unattended to retrieve a rifle and shot at the departing Hazelton. Afterwards, Johnson laid charges on Bonser claiming he deliberately rammed the Mount Royal. Bonser claimed in his defence that it was an accident. The Hazelton at Kitselas CanyonThe Federal Department of Marine investigated and decided that both captains were at fault, Bonser for ramming the Mount Royal, and Johnson for leaving the helm. The men were reprimanded and the case was closed. The HBC and Robert Cunningham came to a mutual decision that the rivalry was not profitable and an agreement was reached to end it. The HBC paid Robert Cunningham $2,500 to tie up his vessel, and they hauled his freight for free. Later, the HBC bought the Hazelton. These new arrangements between the HBC and Robert Cunningham left Captain Bonser without a vessel until 1906 when he took command of the Pheasant, a small sternwheeler that was the butt of many jokes and nicknamed the \\"Chicken\\" because it had to scratch so hard to get upstream. She was wrecked that autumn in the Redrock Canyon, the first loss of Bonser‚Äôs long career, although not his last. Bonser‚Äôs next boat was the Northwest, which was owned by the Northern British Columbia Transportation Company, who also had a hotel and store at Telkwa. Her main purpose was to deliver liquor from the coast to hotels along the Skeena. Tragedy of the HBC Mount Royal In 1907, Captain Johnson was still in charge of the Mount Royal. On the afternoon of July 6, he was returning from Hazelton and was steaming through the Kitselas Canyon, when disaster struck. A strong wind pushed her into a large rock formation named Ringbolt Island, wedging her crosswise against the current. She held while the passengers and crew scrambled to safety on the shore. Johnson assessed the situation and decided that the Mount Royal could be saved and with ten crewmen, he returned aboard. He had decided that the best way to deal with this problem was to use the capstan to winch the sternwheeler back over Ringboat Island. This proved to be a disastrous decision. The king post broke and rammed through the bottom of the Mount Royal, and she buckled as the current washed over her, then she rolled upside down and broke into pieces. Although Johnson survived, six of the crewmen drowned, including the first officer. One of the four survivors was rescued by George Little, who would later become the founder of the town of Terrace. George and a companion spotted the wrecked hull as the wreckage floated past the community of Kitselas. Curious, they paddled out to it and saw a hand waving at them from a hole in hull. The survivor was the Mount Royal‚Äôs chief engineer, Ben Maddigan, who was trapped in the bilge and filthy, but unhurt. After Little chopped him out, he commented that there must have been some air down there. The exhausted engineer replied, \\"I don‚Äôt know about air, but there was one hell of a lot of water!\\" Captain Johnson went on to pilot the new sternwheeler built to replace the Mount Royal, the HBC's Port Simpson. Two months after the Mount Royal was wrecked, another sternwheeler was lost on the Skeena. The Northwest, which would become Bonser‚Äôs second loss, hit a rock and sank. There was no loss of life, but she was carrying the winter liquor supply for the towns along the Skeena, and her loss still caused a bit of uproar. In response to this minor crisis, the HBC refitted the Caledonia, and she ran an emergency trip up the Skeena with the much desired supplies. Bonser then moved on to the upper Fraser River in 1909, where he piloted two sternwheelers before returning to the Skeena in 1911. Grand Trunk Pacific‚Äôs sternwheelers Skeena, Operator and Conveyor in 1910 The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway‚Äôs western terminus was at Prince Rupert, and rail construction began from there in 1908. The railway construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart built the Distributor and the Skeena and purchased the Omineca in 1908. The latter was wrecked later that summer near Port Essington, but her machinery was put in another sternwheeler, and she was rechristened under the same name in 1909. That same year Foley, Welch and Stewart launched two more steamers, the Operator and the Conveyor, which would be piloted by Captain Con Myers and Captain Jack Shannon, respectively. These five sternwheelers had their work cut out for them. The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton was one of the most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. Four of the company sternwheelers hauled material and supplies for construction, while a fifth, the Skeena, was used almost exclusively to supply food to the camps of the construction workers. Much of these supplies were provided by meatpacker Pat Burns, who had wisely anticipated this need and had a built slaughterhouse at Hazelton. Last sternwheeler Inlander at Kitselas Canyon in 1911 In 1910, the last sternwheeler built for work on the Skeena River was the Inlander. She was owned by residents and businessmen of the area and was piloted by Captain Joseph Bucey for that season of navigation. In 1911, Bucey left for the upper Fraser River where he would work on the sternwheeler BC Express until 1921. Captain John Bonser, now back from the upper Fraser, replaced Bucey on the Inlander and piloted her for the 1911 and 1912 seasons. Then, that August, the rail line was finished to Hazelton, a death knell for the Inlander. She left Hazelton for the final time on September 13, 1912, under Captain Bonser. When she reached Port Essington, the Inlander was pulled up onto ways and left to rot. Like the Inlander, Captain Bonser had also made his last trip. He died on December 26, 1913. End of an era Hazelton as clubhouse After 1912 the Skeena River was no longer used for river navigation by sternwheelers. The GTP boats, Operator and Conveyor, were dismantled; their machinery would be used in new sternwheelers that were built at T√™te Jaune Cache for east end construction. Their pilots, Captain Myers and Captain Shannon, would stay with them until 1914 when the line was finished. Skeena in 1913 The Distributor and the HBC Port Simpson were also dismantled and rebuilt and would later work together on the Mackenzie River. The HBC's Hazelton became the clubhouse for the Prince Rupert Yacht Club. The Skeena was purchased by Captain Seymour in 1914 and went on to work on the lower Fraser River. For eleven more years the devotion of her skipper-owner kept her plying the river past Surrey, Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Langley and Mission. But when Captain Seymour died in 1925 she lost her only advocate. She was sold and converted to a floating barge for an oil company. Thus ended the last of the Skeena River sternwheelers.

Rider Haggard, first published in 1921. It brought together his two most popular characters, Ayesha from She (to which it serves as a prequel), and Allan Quatermain from King Solomon's Mines. Umslopogaas from Nada the Lily also appears in the novel as a major character. Along with the other three novels in the series, She and Allan was adapted into the 1935 film She. It was republished by the Newcastle Publishing Company as the sixth volume of the Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library series in September 1975. Plot summary Wanting to learn if he can communicate with deceased loved ones, adventurer and trader Allan Quatermain seeks a meeting with the feared Zulu witch-doctor Zikali, who tells Allan to seek out a great white sorceress who rules a hidden kingdom far to the north, and he charges Allan to take a message to her. He also gives Allan a necklace with a strange amulet, carved in Zikali's own likeness. Zikali claims it has great magical powers that will protect Allan on his journey, but he must on no account take it off. Allan is initially scornful of Zikali's claims, and sets off for the coast, but a series of odd events force him to go north in spite of his own wishes. On the journey he encounters Umslopogaas, a fearsome Zulu warrior chieftain. Umslopogaas tells Allan that he has discovered that he is about to be deposed and murdered, so he decides to leave his village and accompany Allan on his quest. Allan is again sceptical, but a few days later Umslopogaas and his band of warriors meet up with Allan's party, and Umslopogaas cements their friendship when he saves Allan from being killed by a lion. Journeying into unknown country, they come to a remote settlement called \\"Strathmuir\\" run by a Scot, Robertson, a drunkard and former sea captain, who lives there with his beautiful daughter Inez. Her Portuguese mother had died years earlier and her father has now taken native wives and sired several children with them. A few days later, Robertson takes Allan on an expedition to hunt hippopotamus, but as they return they are intercepted by Allan's servant, Hans, who had stayed behind. He reports that, in their absence, Strathmuir has been attacked by a band of cannibal warriors from the north, who have killed and eaten many of the villagers (including Robertson's wives and children) and kidnapped Inez. Allan, Robertson and Umslopogaas set off in pursuit. At one point they catch up to the cannibals, and Allan and Hans almost succeed in freeing Inez, but her servant panics and alerts their captors, who escape. They track the cannibals through the treacherous swampland that surrounds the lost kingdom of K√¥r, and as they approach the great mountain the cannibals turn and attack Allan's group, but they are driven off by the arrival of Bilali, the servant of Ayesha, who tells that She has been expecting them, and that he is to bring them into her presence. Allan is summoned to meet Ayesha, who is camped among the ruins of the ancient city of K√¥r. Ayesha remains veiled, although she briefly reveals herself to him, but in spite of her allure, he manages to resist her power, and throughout the story he remains sceptical of her claims that she is immortal and has supernatural powers. Some days later Robertson disappears from the camp to seek out the rebel Armahagger who are holding Inez captive, hoping to rescue his daughter and, if possible, to kill their chief, the dreaded Rezu, who is also rumoured to be immortal. Allan and Hans learn that this rebel group are the descendants of an ancient sun-worshipping cult who perform human sacrifice, and that Inez will be married to Rezu and installed as Queen of all the Armahagger if they defeat Ayesha. Knowing that Rezu is preparing to attack and try to overthrow her, Ayesha seeks help from Allan and Umslopogaas in the coming battle, asking Allan to lead the army of K√¥r. He reluctantly agrees, but when Ayesha brings him before her generals, they at first refuse to accept him, until he displays the \\"Great Medicine\\", the amulet given to him by Zikali. Though outnumbered three-to-one, Allan draws up plans that he hopes will give Ayesha's army a tactical advantage, but he has little confidence in her Armahagger soldiers. As they advance, Hans scouts ahead; he discovers that Inez's unfortunate servant has already been eaten, and that the rebels have captured Robertson and intend to sacrifice him and eat him before his daughter's eyes. Soon after, a Zulu scout returns to warn that some of Ayesha's soldiers are spies for Rezu, and that the enemy having found out their plans have set an ambush just ahead. Allan quickly draws his men into a defensive square just before Rezu's forces attack; they hold their ground against the first two waves, but the square breaks under a third onslaught. Allan fears all is lost, but at that moment a glowing apparition of Ayesha appears in their midst, bearing a wand, and she moves forward towards Rezu's soldiers, who become paralysed as she advances. Heartened, the K√¥r soldiers surge forward, slaughtering most of Rezu's army. As they reach the enemy camp, they see Rezu kill the helpless Robertson with an axe. They now confront the fearsome Rezu himself, a huge, bearded giant seven feet tall; Allan fires two heavy-gauge bullets, which hit Rezu, but they have no effect, and they realise he is heavily armoured. Now Umslopogaas steps forward and challenges Rezu to single combat. A desperate struggle ensues, and although Umslopogaas carries an ancient axe rumoured to be the only weapon that can kill Rezu, he makes no impression against Rezu's heavy armour. Finally Umslopogaas employs a ruse ‚Äì he appears to flee, enabling him to reach higher ground, from which he makes a rapid run towards Rezu. Leaping into the air, he strikes Rezu down from behind with a mighty blow as he vaults over the giant's head. Ayesha's soldiers then surge forward and, before Allan can examine him, they hack Rezu's body to pieces. Allan and Hans now race to the tent where Inez is being held; she seems drugged or catatonic, and as they enter the handmaidens who guard her all commit suicide, and Inez is freed. The day after the battle, Allan and Hans watch from a distance as Ayesha addresses her surviving troops and punishes the captured traitors. As she speaks, a fierce storm blows up, and lightning flashes around Ayesha and the captives, but it leaves the faithful soldiers unharmed. When the storm clears, Ayesha has vanished, and when they move forward to examine the captives, they find them dead, although their bodies are quite unmarked. The next night Ayesha summons Allan to receive his reward. He balks at fulfilling his wish to see if his loved ones survive beyond the grave, but Ayesha takes control and her power paralyses him; he feels himself dying and his spirit moving into another realm. He sees visions of his family, but their spirits seem unaware of his presence; only the spirits of a faithful dog and an African woman whom he had loved seem aware of him and able to communicate with him. When he revives, Ayesha questions him but, despite his experience, he remains profoundly sceptical and he argues with Ayesha over what has transpired. Later that night Allan meets up with Umslopogaas, who tells him of his own experiences. By now Inez has fully recovered from her ordeal although, as Ayesha had predicted, she remembers nothing of her traumatic experience or her father's death. Allan and Umslopogaas have no desire to remain, so Ayesha arranges for the surviving members of the party to be escorted back to Strathmuir. We learn that Inez never recovers her memory of what had transpired, and she is never told the truth; she eventually retires to a convent. Umslopogaas returns to his people to face his destiny, and Allan returns to Zululand to deliver Ayesha's message to Zikali. Reception E. F. Bleiler lauded She and Allan, describing the novel as \\"an imaginative, entertaining adventure story.\\"  Sources   References  External links  Category:British fantasy novels Category:1921 British novels Category:1921 fantasy novels Category:Novels by H.

It was set up in 1936 and sent to provide logistical and tactical support to the Nationalist faction after the Spanish coup of July 1936 marked the onset of the Spanish Civil War. The corps and its Nazi German allies‚Äîthe Condor Legion‚Äîfought against the Spanish Republic and provided support for the Italian ground troops of the Corpo Truppe Volontarie. They served from August 1936 to the end of the conflict in March 1939. Their main base of operations was on Mallorca in the Balearic Islands.Air War in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39  History  At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Francisco Franco, the leader of the rebel armies in Spanish North Africa, had about 30,000 troops and Moroccan nationals under his command, along with some artillery units. In order to transfer his troops and equipment to mainland Spain, on 24 July 1936, Franco turned to the Italian consul in Tangiers and then directly to Major Luccardi, the military attache at the Italian consulate. Through them, Franco tried to convince Benito Mussolini to send twelve transport aircraft, twelve reconnaissance planes, ten fighter aircraft, 3000 aerial bombs, antiaircraft machine guns, and at least forty five transport ships. Mussolini was initially reluctant to send them, despite his sympathy for Franco, but, under pressure from his son-in-law Galeazzo Ciano, changed his mind on 25 July. Ciano had in the meantime met with representatives of the Spanish monarchy to arrange the transfer of about thirty fighter planes and other equipment, which would arrive on 2 August, sent by the French government. On 27 July, Mussolini ordered the under- secretary for the Regia Aeronautica, General Giuseppe Valle, to send 12 three- engined Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 bombers with crews and relevant specialists to Franco. These would form the first unit, initially known as Aviaci√≥n del Tercio,Enciclopedia Ilustrada de la Aviaci√≥n: Vol.3, pag. 682, Edit. Delta, Barcelona. 1982 and set out at dawn on 30 July from Cagliari‚ÄìElmas on Sardinia, where they had picked up three officials from the Scuola di Navigazione di Altura at Orbetello, the gerarca Ettore Muti, and Lieutenant Colonel Ruggero Bonomi. The aircraft crews and the specialists were all volunteers from 7th, 10th and 13th Stormo and were provided with civilian clothes and fake documents. All Italian insignia on the planes had been blotted out to avoid an international incident with pro-Republican European governments. Fake documents stated that the planes were being sold to the Spanish journalist Luis Bolin. Not all of the Italian planes sent to aid the rebel faction reached Morocco ‚Äì the plane commanded by Angelini crashed in the Mediterranean, Mattalia's crashed near Sa√Øda in French Morocco, and Lo Forte had to make an emergency landing near Berkane (also in French Morocco) and was seized by the local authorities. The nine survivors of the Moroccan crashes were provided with nationalist papers and transportation to the airport at Tetuan, from which, over the following days, they helped escort the transport ships Araujo, Ciudad de Alicante, and Ciudad de Ceuta, which together carried 4,000 men, four artillery batteries, two million cartridges, and 12 tons of other munitions to mainland Spain. Encouraged by the success of this first operation, Mussolini began sending a steady stream of munitions, personnel, and supplies under the name of Aviaci√≥n Legionaria, Aviazione Legionaria. = Bombing operations = Aerial bombardement of Barcelona, March 1938 Besides military targets, the Aviazione Legionaria carried out a great number of strategic bombings of cities in the Spanish Republican rear area, intended to terrify the civilian population into surrender. The most significant of these was the 1936 bombing of Madrid ordered by General Franco, in which the city's residential areas were subject to heavy bombardment ‚Äì with the exception of the upper class Salamanca district, which was assumed to contain many Nationalist supporters. Three Italian bombers attacked the Renteria bridge on the outskirts of Guernica, prior to the Condor Legion's bombing of Guernica itself on 26 April 1937, followed by an attack on Almeria. It would be in 1938 that Italian planes carried out most of their large-scale bombing operations, striking the cities of Barcelona, Alicante, Granollers, and Valencia, as well as the railway stations of Sant Vicen√ß de Calders in 1938 and X√†tiva in 1939. With a total of 728 raids on Spanish Mediterranean cities, the Aviazione Legionaria dropped 16,558 bombs and inflicted numerous casualties. On 12 May 1939, the last Italian aircrew embarked for Italy on the ship Duilio at Cadiz. By the end of the conflict the Aviazione Legionaria had logged a total of 135,265 hours' flying time on 5,318 operations, dropping 11,524 tons of bombs and destroying 943 enemy air units and 224 ships. Hundred and seventy-one Italian personnel had been killed and 192 wounded, with 74 fighters, eight bombers, two ground-attack planes, and two reconnaissance aircraft shot down or destroyed. The ratio of results to men and machines lost was positive, but also confirmed the Regia Aeronauticas commanders in their mistaken belief that biplanes and triplanes were still valid in modern combat. In fact the age of air warfare dominated by these aircraft was waning and it was becoming evident that radio needed to be mounted on all aircraft and that bomb-aiming needed to be done with special instruments rather than by sight Gianni Rocca, I Disperati: La tragedia dell'Aeronautica Italiana nella seconda guerra mondiale, These errors of judgement would prove decisive when Italy entered the Second World War in 1940.  Aircraft and units  Twelve Fiat CR.32 biplanes arrived in Melilla aboard transport ships on 14 August 1936 (405 would be sent to Franco by the end of the operation), and by the end of August the Cucaracha squadron was formed at C√°ceres with aircraft of that type. Initial dispatches of aircraft were followed by more numerous ones ‚Äì in March 1939, eleven new Fiat G.50 monoplane fighters were sent, to be based at Ascalona, though ultimately they never saw action. In addition to the aircraft, Italy provided a number of well-trained men, sending more than 6,000 in total ‚Äì 5,699 airmen and 312 civilians. Various types of bombers were sent to Franco's forces, including 55 three-engined Savoia-Marchetti SM.81s, 99 three-engined Savoia-Marchetti SM.79s, and 16 Fiat BR.20s. The units were made part of the 21st Stormo da Bombardamento Pesante and the 251st and 252nd Squadriglia Pipistrelli delle Baleari. The Cicognas went to 230th Squadriglia da bombardamento veloce in summer 1937, before being transferred to the 231st in 1938. The unit's recognition symbols were roundels placed on both sides of the wings and on the tail-rudder. The wing symbol was a completely black circle, later personalized with white symbols ranging from a simple cross to designs referring to the commanders of the Condor Legion and the Aviaci√≥n Nacional. The tail symbol was a simple black cross on a white field, which was subsequently adopted by the Spanish Air Force. Altogether, a total of 764 aircraft were sent: * 376 Fiat CR.32 * 12 Fiat G.50 * 13 Fiat BR.20 * 100 Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 * 84 Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 * 3 Savoia-Marchetti S.55 * 23 Breda Ba.65 * 6 Breda Ba.28 * 3 Macchi M.41 * 10 CANT Z.501 * 4 CANT Z.506 * 25 IMAM Ro.41 * 36 IMAM Ro.37 * 16 Caproni Ca.310 * 10 Caproni A.P.1 * 53 transport aircraft * 20 seaplanes * 10 troop carriers  See also  * Condor Legion * Spanish Republican Air Force  Footnotes   Bibliography   Category:Expatriate units and formations Category:Foreign volunteers in the Spanish Civil War Category:Francoist Spain Category:Italian Air Force Category:Military units and formations of Italy in the Spanish Civil War Category:Military units and formations established in 1936 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 ","title":"Aviazione Legionaria"},{"id":"10586154","text":"John Studd may refer to: * John Studd (gynaecologist) (born 1940), British gynaecologist academic and medical historian * Big John Studd (1948‚Äì1995), professional wrestler *John Edward Kynaston Studd 1858‚Äì1944), British cricketer, businessman and Lord Mayor of London ","title":"John Studd"},{"id":"10586190","text":"The following highways are numbered 662: Canada *Saskatchewan Highway 662 United States  * * ","title":"List of highways numbered 662"},{"id":"10586227","text":"Johann Bernhard Logier (1777‚Äì1846), German musician resident in Ireland Johann Bernhard Logier (9 February 1777 ‚Äì 27 July 1846) was a German composer, teacher, inventor, and publisher resident in Ireland for most of his life. Biography Logier was born in Kassel and was first taught music by his father, a violinist. He moved to the England in 1791 and joined the Duke of Abercorn's regimental band as a flutist, later becoming director. After moving to Ireland with the regiment in 1802, he was appointed organist in Westport and in 1808 became director of the band of the Kilkenny Militia. In 1809 he became the musical director of the Royal Hibernian Theatre, before opening a successful music shop at 17 Lower Sackville Street (today: O'Connell Street).Ad√®le Commins: \\"Logier, Johann Bernhard\\", in: The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland, ed. H. White & B. Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), p. 597‚Äì9. Except for a three-year stay in Berlin (1822‚Äì26), he spent the remainder of his life in Dublin, where he died in 1846. Logier invented the Chiroplast, a sliding frame meant as a pedagogical device to guide the hands and fingers while playing the piano, the intention being to improve and control the position of the hand and wrist. By staging public demonstrations of the mechanism and producing publications and studies to support his theories, the method became very popular within a short period of time. By having the system patented, he could earn licence fees from every teacher who used the method. \\"Chiroplast instruction centres\\" opened in Dublin, London, Paris, Berlin, Leipzig, and Dresden. The system had ardent followers and critics, with Kalkbrenner and Spohr among the more prominent followers. Green's music shop in London had sold 1,600 chiroplasts by 1824.Commins (2013), p. 597. He also developed his own teaching method, now called the Logier Method, which he published in his System der Musikwissenschaft (1827). In this method, several pupils are taught at a time, with technical instruction done together with instruction in principles of harmony. This lay the basis of group teaching in music. Music Logier's achievements as a composer have always been overshadowed by his successful inventions and educational methods, to the extent that many brief biographies don't mention his compositional activity at all. His work-list includes music for piano, flute, harp, bugle, and military bands. He also arranged popular and traditional songs for solo piano. One of Logier's largest compositions is the opera Brian Boroihme [sic!] (1810) on an Irish historical episode, which achieved some success and is an important work in the history of nationalism in Irish opera.Axel Klein: \\"Stage-Irish, or The National in Irish Opera 1780-1925\\", in: Opera Quarterly 21 (2005) 1, p. 27‚Äì67. He also wrote an ambitious concerto for piano and orchestra op. 13 (1816). For a performance of his Battle of Trafalgar (1810) he gathered seven military bands, and The Battle of Vittoria (1813) was performed by 150 instrumentalists.Commins (2013), p. 598.

Woods was named one of the ‚Äúmost influential harp forces of the twentieth century‚Äù by HarpColumn magazine. Biography A lifelong musician, Woods began playing pedal (concert) harp in college after walking into the harp room at the University of Redlands in Southern California and asking for lessons. She continued to study pedal harp after receiving her bachelor's degree, but upon discovering and purchasing a Celtic harp, dedicated her life to making Celtic harp music available to the public. Subsequent travels around the world as a soloist and ensemble performer cemented Woods‚Äô reputation as a formidable talent in the folk harp milieu. Woods won the prestigious All-Ireland Harp Championship in Buncrana, County Donegal in 1980, only the second American ever to have done so. She was invited back to Buncrana the following two summers to teach a harp course for local children, borrowing harps from all over Ireland so the children would learn to play the instrument which is the symbol of their country. Woods toured with Robin Williamson and His Merry Band in the 1970s and was featured on the group's three albums. Celtic harps were not readily available at the time, so Woods was often approached after concerts by people who were intrigued by her instrument, which she had purchased in Ireland. In response to their multiple requests, Woods started selling harps and also began developing collaborative relationships with several instrument makers, encouraging them to build harps, and providing feedback on technical issues and user-friendly features. Woods‚Äô relationship with harp makers, along with her work in bringing folk harp to a wider audience, led to her leadership role in the early days of the International Society of Folk Harpers and Craftsmen as the group‚Äôs first President. Noting a lack of repertoire and resources for the folk harp, Woods began writing and arranging music specifically for folk (or lever) harp in 1978. Woods‚Äô first book, Teach Yourself to Play the Folk Harp, is perhaps the best-known tutor for lever harp, and has been the introduction to harp playing for thousands of musicians. She has since published more than three dozen books and arrangements for the Celtic harp, encompassing a wide variety of musical styles from folk to classical to pop. Woods‚Äô initial foray into harp sales grew into a large mail-order catalog offering products and resources for harpists worldwide; her brick-and-mortar store, the Sylvia Woods Harp Center, opened in 1992 and is believed to be the largest harp store in the world, with between fifty and 100 harps on the floor at any given time. Recordings Woods‚Äô first solo recording was her original composition, The Harp of Brandiswhiere: A Suite for Celtic Harp, which has been acclaimed as an important contribution to contemporary harp literature. Through the instrumental music, Woods tells the story of the harp player Brandiswhiere, a legendary hero who saves the world with the music of his harp. The recording has won numerous awards including \\"Best Fantasy Album\\" by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror Films, and several Popular Music Awards by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). Several chapters of the American Harp Society have performed this suite as their major concert of the year. The Brandiswhiere suite has even been choreographed for dance productions in the U.S. and Europe. Wood‚Äôs two other solo recordings, Three Harps for Christmas, Volumes 1 and 2, feature traditional Christmas carols from all over the world. These recordings have been played extensively by radio stations all over the United States during the Christmas season. In addition to her solo albums, Woods has played on the recordings of many other prominent musicians such as Jimmy Messina, Al Stewart, Joemy Wilson, Kay Gardener, Aeoleus, Artie Traum & Pat Alger, and Caswell Carnahan. Performances Since 1980, Woods has toured as a solo performer, giving concerts throughout North America and Europe, as well as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. She has given numerous performances for the American Harp Society and the International Society of Folk Harpers and Craftsmen. She has taught harp workshops and master classes, and has judged numerous harp competitions, including the Guinness World Trophy for the Celtic Harp Competition in Lorient, France. To further promote the folk harp and her own music, Woods has appeared on many television and radio shows, including three appearances on the ever-popular radio broadcast A Prairie Home Companion, starring Garrison Keillor. Woods has been interviewed on dozens of radio stations throughout the U.S. and Great Britain, including by Studs Terkel on WFMT in Chicago. Many of Woods‚Äô concerts have been simulcast on radio stations across America. In January 2003 Woods performed with the legendary Irish band The Chieftains for their five California concerts. Woods has performed on the soundtracks of several major motion pictures, including Dead Poets Society, Prancer, and Only the Lonely, under the direction of Academy Award-winning composer Maurice Jarre. In addition, Woods has performed on soundtracks for several PBS and commercial television shows. A 1981 Los Angeles episode of Romper Room that featured Woods and her harp was nominated for an Emmy Award.

India. The Institute's mission is to carry out research on developmental issues from a multi-disciplinary point of view. This includes economics, energy and environmental policy. The institute offers Master of Philosophy and Ph.D. programmes in Development Studies and also a Master of Science programme in Economics. The institute has one of the largest Social Sciences libraries in Asia. History The institute was the brainchild of Prof. Jyoti Parikh and Prof. Kirit Parikh and was funded by the Reserve Bank of India. It was formally opened upon the occasion of the bank's golden jubilee in 1987. After its registration as an autonomous society on 14 November 1986 and as a public trust on 15 January 1987, then Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi inaugurated the campus at Goregaon, Mumbai on 28 December 1987. Subsequently, the Institute was recognized as a deemed university under Section 3 of the UGC Act. Starting as a purely research-oriented institution, the Institute quickly developed into a full-fledged teaching cum research organisation when in 1990 it launched a Ph.D. programme in the field of development studies under agreement with Bombay University. The objective of the Ph.D. programme is to produce analysts with diverse disciplinary background who can address developmental issues of policy. In 1995, accreditation for its own Ph.D. programme was obtained and a Masters programme was started to help meet the growing need of the country for more development economists. The mission to address development issues has been the driving force and motivation behind the growth of the Institute. IGIDR also has a full-fledged Masters of Science programme which draws applicants from all over India. This programme is limited to twenty-five participants at a time.  Management  Dr. Kirit S. Parikh was the first director of the Institute. Dr. Mahendra Dev is the current director of the Institute.

It aspires to gain insights into the process of development and alternative policy options and to further disseminate the knowledge acquired. The primary objectives of the Institute are : * To promote and conduct research on development from a broad inter-disciplinary perspective. * To promote co-operative endeavour and interaction between research scholars and institutions in India and abroad. * To undertake projects or activity which renders itself useful for the furtherance of development and social welfare. * To carry out training for advanced degrees viz. Master's and Doctorate award. Special emphasis will be laid on the following areas: * The comparative study of development and policy in different regions and countries. * The growing interdependence among nations in the world economy and its impact on development strategies and policy options. * The influence of international trading, financial and economic systems on countries. * The examination of energy, technology and environment problems in global setting. * The analytical foundations of the positions adopted by India and other developing countries in international forums and negotiations. * Economic and technological cooperation among developing countries and India's development experience and policies. * Planning techniques and methodology. * Issues in the choice of technology and social well being. * The role of innovation and diffusion of technology in development. * Resource utilisation and environment implications of technological alternatives. * Social, legal, organisational and institutional aspects of development. * The Institute shall also serve as a centre for promoting co-operative endeavour and interaction in research activities between Indian scholars and institutions as well as between Indian and foreign scholars and institutions  Campus  The Institute is located on a site on a hillside in Goregaon (East), 15 minutes by public bus from Mumbai's suburban Goregaon railway station and 20 minutes drive from Mumbai's national and international airports. The campus, whose architecture is inspired by the art in the Elephanta and Jogeshwari caves, includes office buildings for research and administrative staff, several seminar rooms, a 500-seat auditorium, a library, a computer centre, a cafeteria and a guest house where visiting scholars are accommodated. The students and staff of the Institute are provided accommodation on campus. There are also some recreational facilities which include a 20-metre swimming pool, a tennis court, an indoor badminton court, a table tennis room, a small jogging track, a fully equipped gym and a children's park at the Institute. The Institute also has an Alumni Association, which conducts an annual meet in the month of January.  Programs offered  = M.Sc. in Economics = The Masters in Economics is a two-year programme, which provides students with rigorous hands-on training in Economics, special emphasis on analytical and problem solving skills, and exposure to emerging national and international policy issues. This programme requires a Master's thesis. = M.Phil and Ph.D. = The M.Phil. programme is a two-year programme, designed for those who would like to acquire a certain level of analytical and applied skills but may not be keen on pursuing a Ph.D. degree. The Ph.D. programme is designed to create academic researchers as well as professionals who are capable of conducting policy analysis, relating to national and global economic and development issues, from a quantitative and inter-disciplinary perspective. While an interdisciplinary approach is encouraged, the programme lays somewhat larger emphasis on economics to provide an integrated framework within which various development issues can be addressed. Ph.D. students are expected to submit their dissertations within four years of joining the Institute. Both M.Phil. and Ph.D. programmes involve successful completion of course work as well as submission of a dissertation. = Visiting Scholars Programme = There is a programme for visiting scholars which is part of the Institute's outreach to other colleges and universities in India. The programme's scholarships enable up to five selected scholars to spend three months at a stretch at IGIDR to work on a research proposal that can be satisfactorily completed during their stay. = Post-Doctoral Fellowship = The Post-Doctoral Fellowship (PDF) Programme has been instituted in IGIDR as part of its outreach activities. Its objective is to support high quality research by scholars with a doctoral degree and an outstanding academic record. Up to three fellowships are available per year.

The amphitheatre seats 18,920Lakewood Amphitheatre (7,000 seated; 12,000 on the lawn). It was designed to offer a state-of-the- art musical experience for both music fans and artists. The venue was built specifically for popular music. Notable details The amphitheatre is located approximately 4 miles south of downtown Atlanta, at the Lakewood Fairgrounds. Phish, among others, have called the amphitheatre one of their favorite venues to play at, due to the quality of the acoustics rarely found at lower-level roofed amphitheatres. Linkin Park used their performance of \\"One Step Closer\\" from Projekt Revolution 2004 on their LPU 4 CD and also used their performance of \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" from Projekt Revolution 2007 on their LPU 7 CD. In 2008, the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre at Encore Park opened in Alpharetta, Georgia, an affluent suburb on the north side of Atlanta. This gave Metro Atlanta another premier outdoor venue along with Lakewood, Chastain Park Amphitheater in Buckhead/Sandy Springs and the Frederick Brown, Jr Amphitheater on the south side in Peachtree City.  History of name changes  The venue opened on 14 July 1989, as the Coca-Cola Lakewood Amphitheatre and retained that name until 1999, when the name was changed to Lakewood Amphitheatre. In 2001, the venue became known as HiFi Buys Amphitheatre. As of the 2008 season, the venue was once again known as Lakewood Amphitheatre, due to HiFi Buys filing for bankruptcy in 2007. The facility utilized a logo similar to the one used before the name-change to HiFi Buys Amphitheatre. In May 2009, a naming-rights agreement was formed with Aaron's, and the venue was called Aaron's Amphitheatre at Lakewood. In January 2016 the venue went back to its classic name of Lakewood Amphitheatre. In November 2017, Cellairis, a cell phone accessories company, signed naming rights to sponsor the venue and it officially became Cellairis Amphitheatre at Lakewood.

The combination of hand held cameras and high speed Tri-X film was transformative for photojournalism and for cinema.  Overview  Introduced around 1940 in sheets rated at ASA daylight 200 and tungsten 160, it was one of Kodak's first high-speed (for the time) black and white films. Tri-X was released in 35 mm and 120 formats in 1954. Currently it is available in two speeds, ISO 320/26¬∞ (320TXP) and 400/27¬∞ (400TX). Tri-X 400 is the more common of the two, available in 24- and 36-exposure rolls of 35 mm and rolls of 120 as well as 50 and 100 ft bulk rolls of 35 mm. Tri-X 320 is available in 4√ó5\\", 5√ó7\\", and 8√ó10\\" sheets. Tri-X 400 is usually rated at ISO 400 when processed in standard developers and remains among the fastest black and white films today. Push processing Tri-X to a higher \\"exposure index\\" of EI 800 in a standard developer yields very good results, while further pushing to EI 1600 requires more sophisticated processing. A popular method for pushing Tri-X film is using highly diluted developers with little or no agitation and extended development times. This method which is referred to as \\"stand\\" or \\"semi-stand\\" development, can allow the film to be pushed to speeds up to EI 3200 or 6400. In 2004 Kodak celebrated 50 years of Tri-X's introduction on November 1, 1954 in 35 and 120 formats. Tri-X panchromatic film was once one of the most popular films used by photojournalists and many amateurs. It was manufactured by Eastman Kodak in the U.S., Kodak Canada, and Kodak Ltd in the UK. Kodak data-sheets once recommended different processing times depending on where the film was manufactured. Its sales declined in the 1970s and 1980s due to the falling price and increasing popularity of color film. Since the advent of digital photography, Tri-X has all but fallen out of use in newspaper journalism, though it remains popular in documentary journalism. Tri-X has undergone a number of minor engineering changes during its long history. An early change in ASA (ISO) speed from 200 to 400, around 1960, was due to a change in the ASA standard rather than the film. In 2007, Tri-X was extensively re- engineered, receiving the new designation 400TX in place of TX or TX400, and became finer-grained. The amount of silver in the film stock was reduced. Tri-X also exists as a reversal film for the 16 mm and Super-8 cine film formats. The speed for tungsten lighting (3200 K) is ISO 160 and for daylight ISO 200 when processed as reversal. It can also be processed as a negative at a small loss of speed while the grain will be slightly increased.

All Shall Be Well (2011), p. 1: ‚ÄòAt the most simple level Christian universalism is the belief that God will (or, in the case of ‚Äúhopeful universalism,‚Äù might) redeem all people through the saving work of Christ.‚Äô The term Christian universalism was used in the 1820s by Russell Streeter of the Christian Intelligencer of Portland ‚Äì a descendant of Adams Streeter who had founded one of the first Universalist Churches on September 14, 1785.Russell Streeter Familiar conversations: in which the salvation of all mankind is ... ‚Äì Page 266 1835 \\"We now come to those distinguished men, MURRAY and WINCHESTER, who, as our oppo- sers would have people believe, were the inventors and first preachers of Christian Universalism.\\"not Russell Streeter.

Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine Of The Christian Church During Its First 500 Years. Boston and Chicago: Universalist Publishing House, 1899. Archive: Prevailing Tentmaker.org. Christians from a diversity of denominations and traditions believe in the tenets of Christian universalism, such as the reality of an afterlife without the possibility of eternal punishment in hell.Vincent, Ken R. (January/February 2006). \\"Where Have All the Universalists Gone?\\". The Universalist Herald. As a formal Christian denomination, Christian universalism originated in the late 18th century with the Universalist Church of America. There is currently no single denomination uniting Christian universalists, but a few denominations teach some of the principles of Christian universalism or are open to them. In 2007, the Christian Universalist Association was founded to serve as an ecumenical umbrella organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian universalism. Unitarian Universalism historically grew out of Christian universalism but is not an exclusively Christian denomination. It formed from a 1961 merger of two historically Christian denominations, the Universalist Church of America and the American Unitarian Association, both based in the United States. In the academic world, theologians such as Karl Barth and J√ºrgen Moltmann are typically held to have supported a theology of universal reconciliation.  Beliefs  In his Plain Guide to Universalism, the universalist Thomas Wittemore wrote, \\"The sentiment by which Universalists are distinguished, is this: that at last every individual of the human race shall become holy and happy. This does not comprise the whole of their faith, but, merely that feature of it which is peculiar to them and by which they are distinguished from the rest of the world.\\" The remaining central beliefs of Christian universalism are compatible with Christianity in general: *God is the loving Parent of all people, see Love of God. *Jesus Christ reveals the nature and character of God and is the spiritual leader of humankind, see New Covenant. *Humankind is created with an immortal soul which death does not end‚Äîor a mortal soul that shall be resurrected and/or preserved by God‚Äîand which God will not wholly destroy.: \\"The immortal soul is not meant, but the life. As though Jesus had said: 'Fear Not those who can only kill the body, but rather him, who if he chose could annihilate the whole being.'\\" *Sin has negative consequences for the sinner either in this life or the afterlife. In 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the Universalist Church of America, adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, belief in Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, that sinful actions have consequence, and universal reconciliation. The inclusion of theosis as a sixth point is found in the statement of faith adopted in 2007 by the Christian Universalist Association. In the context of Christian universalism, theosis‚Äî which can be translated as divinization or the process of being made more God- like‚Äîmeans to be made more Christ-like, or that all souls will ultimately be reconciled and conformed to the image of the glorified resurrected Christ. Views on Hell Christian Universalists disagree on whether or not Hell exists. However, they do agree that if it does, the punishment there is corrective and remedial, and does not last forever. Plain Guide to Universalism Chapter 2, Section III There are some Universalists who hold to punishment after death, nevertheless, we are glad to hail them as Universalists. They agree with us in our views of the great consummation, -- all punishment, in their view, is disciplinary, and they denounce punishment, either in this world or the next, having any other object, as cruel and unjust. =Purgatorial Hell and Patristic Universalism= Purgatorial Universalism was the belief of some of the early church fathers, especially Greek-speaking ones such as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Gregory of Nyssa. It asserts that the unsaved will undergo hell, but that hell is remedial (neither everlasting nor purely retributive) according to key scriptures and that after purification or conversion all will enter Heaven. Judaism teaches something similar ‚Äì hell is an intense experience of cleansing, more an expression of kindness than a punishment. Fourth-century Christian theologian and Bishop Diodorus of Tarsus wrote: \\"For the wicked there are punishments, not perpetual, however, lest the immortality prepared for them should be a disadvantage, but they are to be purified for a brief period according to the amount of malice in their works. They shall therefore suffer punishment for a short space, but immortal blessedness having no end awaits them‚Ä¶ the penalties to be inflicted for their many and grave sins are very far surpassed by the magnitude of the mercy to be shown to them.\\"J. W. Hanson, citing Assemani Bib. Orientalis, III, p. 324. Ilaria Ramelli, a scholar of the Early Patristic history writes, \\"In the minds of some, universal salvation is a heretical idea that was imported into Christianity from pagan philosophies by Origen\\" (c.185‚Äì253/4). Ramelli argues that this view is mistaken and that Christian theologians were the first people to proclaim that all will be saved and that their reasons for doing so were rooted in their faith in Christ. =Eternal Hell in Christian history= Christian Universalists assert that the doctrine of eternal Hell was not a part of Christ's teachings nor even the early church, and that it was added in.McMillen, Jacob \\"How & When The Idea of Eternal Torment Invaded Church Doctrine\\" The first clear mention of endless misery is to be found in a work from 155-165 CE by Tatian. Other early references to a Hell of infinite duration come from Latin church father Tertullian in the late 2nd and 3rd century.The Salvation Conspiracy: How Hell Became Eternal \\"The first person to write about Eternal Hell was the Latin North African Tertullian\\" According to Theologian Edward Beecher in the first four centuries there were six main theological schools and only one of them advocated the idea of eternal Hell.Edward Beecher, \\"HISTORY OF OPINIONS ON THE SCRIPTURAL DOCTRINE OF RETRIBUTION\\" \\"What, then, was the state of facts as to the leading theological schools of the Christian world, in the age of Origen, and some centuries after? It was, in brief, this: There were at least six theological schools in the Church at large. Of these six schools, one, and only one, was decidedly and earnestly in favor of the doctrine of future eternal punishment. One was in favor of the annihilation of the wicked. Two were in favor of the doctrine of universal restoration on the principles of Origen, and two in favor of universal restoration on the principles of Theodore of Mopsuestia.\\" Origins of the idea of Hell as eternal Christian universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word Œ±ŒπœéŒΩ (Lit. aion- an epoch of time), as giving rise to the idea of eternal Hell. Dr. Ken Vincent writes \\"When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, 'aion' became 'aeternam' which means 'eternal.\\" He also states that the first written record of the idea of an eternal Hell comes from Tertullian, who wrote in Latin. The second major source of the idea of Hell as eternal was the 4th-century theologian Augustine. According to author Steve Gregg, it was Tertullian's writings, plus Augustine's views and writings on eternal Hell which \\"overwhelmed\\" the other views of a temporary Hell. First Augustine's views of Hell were accepted in the early Latin Church, out of which rose the Roman Catholic church. Up until The Reformation Augustine's view of Hell as eternal was not questioned.Gregg, Steve. All You ever Wanted to Know about Hell p.130=131 Mistranslation of the Greek Word \\"Aion\\" About the word aion as having connotations of \\"eternal\\" or \\"temporal\\", the 19th century theologian Marvin Vincent wrote: > Aion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having > a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. Aristotle (peri ouranou, i. > 9,15) says: \\"The period which includes the whole time of one's life is > called the aeon of each one.\\" Hence it often means the life of a man, as in > Homer, where one's life (aion) is said to leave him or to consume away > (Iliad v. 685; Odyssey v. 160). It is not, however, limited to human life; > it signifies any period in the course of events, as the period or age before > Christ; the period of the millennium; the mythological period before the > beginnings of history. > The adjective aionios in like manner carries the idea of time. Neither the > noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of endless or > everlasting. They may acquire that sense by their connotation, as, on the > other hand, aidios, which means everlasting, has its meaning limited to a > given point of time in Jude 6.

Even when applied to God, we > are not forced to render aionios everlasting. Of course the life of God is > endless; but the question is whether, in describing God as aionios, it was > intended to describe the duration of his being, or whether some different > and larger idea was not contemplated. Arguments against the idea of eternal Hell Author Thomas Talbott states that if one believes in the idea of eternal Hell or that some souls will be destroyed, one must either let go of the idea that it is God's wish and desires to save all beings, or accept the idea that God wants to, but will not \\"successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter.\\"Talbott, Thomas, \\"Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = . \\"Theists who accept the traditional idea of everlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation from God, must either reject the idea that God wills or desires to save all humans and thus desires to reconcile them all to himself (see proposition (1) in section 1 above) or reject the idea that God will successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter \\" Author David Burnfield defends the postmortem view, that God continues to evangelize to people even after they die (1 Chron 16:34; Isa 9:2; Rom 8:35-39; Eph 4:8-9; 1 Pet 3:18-20; 4:6) The main problem with the traditional view ‚Äì and one that has never been satisfactorily addressed ‚Äì is how can one ‚Äúaccept Christ‚Äù if they have never heard of Christ, or were unable to understand the message for being too young or mentally handicapped, etc.  History  According to the New Schaff‚ÄìHerzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge (1912), over the first five hundred years of Christian history there are records of at least six theological schools: Four of these schools were Universalist (one each in Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea, and Edessa‚ÄìNisibis), one taught conditional immortality (in Ephesus), and the last taught eternal hell (in Carthage or Rome). The Universalist Church of America, originally called the Universalist General Convention, emerged in the late 18th century from a mixture of Anabaptists, Moravians, liberal Quakers, and people influenced by Pietist movements such as Methodism. Americans from these religious backgrounds gradually created a new denominational tradition of Christian Universalism during the 19th century. The Universalist Church of America grew to be the sixth largest denomination in the United States at its peak. John Murray, who is called the \\"Father of American Universalism,\\" was a disciple of the Welshman James Relly and promoted Relly's Universalist form of Methodism in America.\\"James Reilly\\" . UUA.org, \\"History: Early Modern\\". ChristianUniversalist.org. He was a central figure in the founding of the Universalist Church of America in 1793. He served as pastor of the Universalist Society of Boston and wrote many hymns. Another important figure in early American Christian Universalism was George de Benneville, a French Huguenot preacher and physician who was imprisoned for advocating Universalism and later emigrated to Pennsylvania where he continued preaching on the subject. De Benneville was noted for his friendly and respectful relationship with Native Americans and his pluralistic and multicultural view of spiritual truth which was well ahead of his time. One of his most significant accomplishments was helping to produce the Sauer Bible, the first German language Bible printed in America. In this Bible version, passages teaching universal reconciliation were marked in boldface. Other significant early modern Christian Universalist leaders include Elhanan Winchester, a Baptist preacher who wrote several books promoting the universal salvation of all souls after a period in purgatory, who founded the first Universalist church in Philadelphia, and founded a church that ministered to African American slaves in South Carolina;\\"Elhanan Winchester\\" . UUA.org, \\"Biographies: Elehan Winchester\\". TentMaker.org. Hosea Ballou, a Universalist preacher and writer in New England; and Hannah Whitall Smith, a writer and evangelist from a Quaker background who was active in the Holiness movement as well as the women's suffrage and temperance movements. A separate branch of Christian Universalism that arose in the early 20th century was the Primitive Baptist Universalists, also called \\"No-Hellers.\\" They were a group of Baptists in the central and southern Appalachian Mountain region of the United States that taught universal reconciliation and, like Hosea Ballou, embraced the \\"Ultra-Universalist\\" position that there is no literal hell beyond earth. The Unity School of Christianity, founded in 1889 by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, has taught some Universalist beliefs such as God's total goodness, the divine nature of human beings, and the rejection of the traditional Christian belief that God condemns people to hell. The Universalist Church of America gradually declined in the early to mid 20th century and merged with the American Unitarian Association in 1961, creating the modern-day Unitarian Universalist Association, which does not officially subscribe to exclusively Christian theology. Christian Universalism largely passed into obscurity for the next few decades with the end of the Universalist Church as a separate denomination. However, the Unitarian Universalist Christian Fellowship remains as an organization for Christians from the Unitarian Universalist tradition and liberal Christians interested in Unitarianism and Universalism. Some Christians from a Pentecostal background who were involved in the Latter Rain Movement of the 1940s and 1950s came to believe in the ideas of Christian Universalism on their own, separately from the Universalist Church tradition. They emphasized the teachings of universal reconciliation and theosis. These ideas were spread primarily through newsletters and traveling evangelists from the 1950s to 1980s, and were not typically identified by the term \\"Universalism.\\" The only significant organization representing these beliefs that emerged within the Charismatic tradition was the Home Missions Church, a loosely organized network of ministers and house churches founded in 1944. =Universal reconciliation and pre-modern Christianity= Yale Professor of Philosophy Keith DeRose points out that in the Christian Scriptures there are verses which point to universal reconciliation and verses which point to destruction or eternal punishment for some. If we look only to scripture, he argues that Universalism is not only based in scripture, but has a stronger scriptural backing than the position of destruction or eternal damnation. Like early Christians, he points to Purgatorial Hell, a temporary place of cleansing of sin that will be necessary for some as a way to reconcile these seeming differences.http://campuspress.yale.edu/keithderose/1129-2/#11  Modern types  There are three general types of Christian Universalism today ‚Äì Evangelical Universalism, Charismatic Universalism, and Liberal Christian Universalism ‚Äì which by themselves or in combination with one another describe the vast majority of currently existing and identifiable versions of Christian Universalist belief and practice. =Evangelical Universalism= The type of Christian Universalism that departs the least from orthodox or traditional Protestant Christian doctrine is Evangelical (Christian) Universalism, also called Biblical or Trinitarian Universalism. Evangelical Universalists hold to conservative positions on most theological or doctrinal issues except for the doctrine of hell, in which case they assert universal reconciliation instead of eternal torment.\\"Evangelical Universalism ‚Äì Oxymoron\\". JasonClark.church February 25, 2008. They tend to emphasize the substitutionary atonement of Jesus Christ for the sins of all humanity as the basis for their Universalism. In 2006 a mainstream evangelical writer, revealed as Robin Parry in 2009, under the pseudonym of \\"Gregory MacDonald\\" (taken from the names, Gregory of Nyssa and George MacDonald) released a book The Evangelical Universalist.MacDonald, Gregory (a pseudonym). The Evangelical Universalist. 2006. In 2008 this inspired the creation of a forum, featuring \\"Gregory MacDonald\\" and Thomas Talbott, to discuss Evangelical Universalism and related topics. Evangelical Universalists derive a large part of their beliefs from Evangelicalism and Reformed theology. Many of them come from an Evangelical Christian background, but they may or may not identify with this movement and seek to remain with it. Some Evangelical Universalists avoid using the word \\"Universalism\\" to describe their beliefs, perhaps because of the negative connotations of this word among conservative Christians. Alternative terms that are in use among Evangelical Universalists include the \\"Larger Hope\\" or \\"Blessed Hope\\" and the \\"Victorious Gospel.\\" =Charismatic Universalism= Some Christians with a background in the Charismatic movement or Pentecostalism have developed a version of Universalism which could be called Charismatic (Christian) Universalism. Charismatic Universalists usually do not call their theology \\"Universalism\\" but commonly refer to their specific beliefs by the terms \\"Reconciliation\\" (shorthand for universal reconciliation, the doctrine of apocatastasis) and \\"Sonship\\" (shorthand for \\"Manifest Sonship\\" which is a variant of the doctrine of theosis).\\"From The Candlestick to the Throne, Part 33, The Church in Ephesus\\" (section \\"I Will Remove Your Candlestick\\"). Author refers to \\"the teaching or doctrine of reconciliation, sonship and the kingdom\\". The term \\"Feast of Tabernacles\\" is used by some Charismatic Universalists as a term for their post-Pentecostal spiritual tradition, reflecting a symbolic interpretation of this Jewish festival as an entrance into a fuller knowledge and relationship with God and understanding of God's plan for humanity.\\"Chapter 7 The Feast of Tabernacles\\". gods-kingdom- ministries.org, and \\"Coming into Light prt 1\\". ToSeekTheLight blog. Charismatic Universalism is marked by its emphasis on theosis; the idea that the return of Christ is a body of perfected human beings who are the \\"Manifested Sons of God\\" instead of a literal return of the person of Jesus;See \\"ID69\\" and \\"ID349\\" . HearingtheTruthofGod.com. the idea that these Sons will reign on the earth and transform all other human beings from sin to perfection during an age that is coming soon (a version of millennialism);\\"ID269\\" HearingtheTruthofGod.com. and the absolute sovereignty of God, the nonexistence or severe limitation of human free will, and the inevitable triumph of God's plan of universal reconciliation.\\"Free Moral Agent-Eby\\", Tentmaker.org, and \\"ID116\\" . HearingTheTruthOfGod.com]. Some see similarities to the teachings of Jacob Arminius, a Dutch theologian who tried to modify John Calvin's teachings about predestination. Many Charismatic Universalists meet in house churches or do not belong to a church at all. Most of the evidence of Universalism existing as a school of thought within the Charismatic movement is found in a large number of internet-based ministries that are informally networked with one another. =Liberal Christian Universalism= Liberal Christian Universalists include some members of mainline Protestant denominations, some people influenced by the New Age and New Thought movements, some people in the emerging church movement, some Unitarian Universalists who continue to follow Jesus as their primary spiritual teacher, and some Christians from other religious backgrounds who may or may not attend church. Liberal Christian Universalism emphasizes the all-inclusive love of God and tends to be more open to finding truth and value in non-Christian spiritual traditions compared to the attitude of other forms of Christian Universalism, while remaining generally Christ-centered.Non- Christian. SaviorOfTheWOrld.net. Example of this view. In contrast to Evangelical Universalism, Liberal Christian Universalism views the Bible as an imperfect human document containing divine revelations, is not necessarily Trinitarian, and often downplays or rejects blood atonement theology in its view of the crucifixion of Jesus.See \\"Deity of Christ\\", \\"(section \\"Christian Universalism 'Endorsed' by Jesus Seminar\\" , and \\"Metaphysical Bible\\" , NewBeginningMinistries.com.

He is now a minister in the United Church of Christ, a liberal Christian denomination, but continues to believe in some ideas and practices of Pentecostal or Charismatic forms of Christianity.

Indian Hills Church. The Christian Universalist Association is putting forth a message which seeks common ground among all major contemporary types of Christian Universalism. =Modern proponents of Christian Universalism= The conversion of Bishop Carlton Pearson to a form of Universalism and his subsequent excommunication by the Joint College of African-American Pentecostal Bishops in 2004 caused Christian Universalism to gain increased media attention because of Pearson's popularity and celebrity status. In 2007, Eric Stetson and Kalen Fristad gathered a group of thirteen ministers and evangelists from several denominations to found the Christian Universalist Association, an interdenominational organization for churches, ministries, and individuals who believe in Christian Universalism. About the current state of Christian Universalism, they state: \\"Many Christian philosophers, theologians, writers, and scholars are coming to believe in a Universalist interpretation of Christianity. A rapidly growing number of books are being published on the subject of Christian Universalism. Hundreds of Christian Universalist websites have exploded across the internet over the past few years, run by people with a wide variety of religious backgrounds and viewpoints. It appears that Universalism is beginning to develop into one of the most significant ecumenical movements among Christians of our time.\\" =Disagreements= There are many religious issues on which Christian Universalists disagree with each other, depending on their theological background and denominational tradition. Some examples include: *A wide range of ways of understanding the Bible, such as Biblical inerrancy, Biblical infallibility, Biblical criticism and higher criticism, also various views of the Biblical canon and apocryphal texts. *Whether God's oneness is best described by the orthodox Christian concept of Trinity or in some other way, such as classical unitarianism, Socinianism, modalism, etc. *Whether Jesus Christ will literally return at some future time to consummate his reign on Earth (futurism and millennialism), or only returns metaphorically in the present or future, or whether these prophecies were fulfilled in ancient times and we now live during the Messianic Age (preterism). *The specific nature of the afterlife (literal versus metaphoric heaven and hell, purgatory, reincarnation, other ideas). *Whether the shed blood of Christ on the cross is a literal atonement for the sins of the world or whether this is metaphorical, and what the atonement accomplished ‚Äì Anselm of Canterbury's satisfaction (Roman Catholic view), John Calvin's penal substitution (Reformed, Methodist, Evangelical view), Hugo Grotius' moral government (Methodist, evangelical view), Gustaf Aulen's Christus Victor (Eastern Orthodox view, commonly held by Anabaptists), or Peter Abelard's moral influence (Roman Catholic but also modernist-liberal theological view), etc. *Whether non-Christians can be saved in Christ (inclusivism), or whether salvation occurs only after profession of belief in the Lordship of Jesus Christ (exclusivism). *Whether Christian Universalists should attend denominational churches in the hope of converting them, or should start their own new churches, or should leave the organized church entirely.\\"Should we Form Universalist\\" and \\"FAQ: Organization\\" offer two very different views on this subject.

It was founded in 1909 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The cathedral of the diocese is Holy Trinity Cathedral in Accra, Ghana. The Anglican Diocese of Accra (ADOA) is the oldest in the Internal Province of Ghana, and in terms of clergy and churches, is Ghana's largest diocese. The diocese is made up of over one hundred parishes, congregations and missions with over 120 clergy, both male and female. The diocese is organized under five clusters namely the Deanery, Accra East Archdeaconry, Accra West Archdeaconry, Accra North Archdeaconry, Accra North-East Archdeaconry and the Tema Archdeaconry. The Diocese was carved out of the Diocese of Equatorial Africa in 1909 after some two centuries of missionary work in the then Gold Coast. In response to that growth, and in consonance with the Anglican polity of \\"Synodically Governed and Episcopally led\\" the Diocese of Accra was created. The succession of Diocesan bishops have been Nathaniel Temple Hamlyn (1909‚Äì1910), Mowbray Stephen O'Rorke (1913‚Äì1923), John Orfeur Aglionby (1924‚Äì1951), John Charles Sydney Daly (1951‚Äì1955), Reginald Richard Roseveare (1956‚Äì1967).

Overview Though it was formally developed by Edmund Husserl (1859‚Äì1938), phenomenology can be understood as an outgrowth of the influential ideas of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Attempting to resolve some of the key intellectual debates of his era, Kant argued that Noumena (fundamentally unknowable things-in-themselves) must be distinguished from Phenomena (the world as it appears to the mind). Kant, commonly misconceived as arguing that humans cannot have direct access to reality, but only to the contents of their minds, argued rather that what is experienced in the mind is reality to us. Phenomenology grew out of this conception of phenomena, and studies the meaning of isolated phenomena as directly connected to our minds. According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, \\"Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied.\\" This may not be possible if observation is theory laden. Bracketing (or epoch√©) is a preliminary act in the phenomenological analysis, conceived by Husserl as the suspension of the trust in the objectivity of the world.Farina, Gabriella (2014). Some reflections on the phenomenological method. Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 7(2):50‚Äì62. It involves setting aside the question of the real existence of a contemplated object, as well as all other questions about the object's physical or objective nature; these questions are left to the natural sciences. For example, the act of seeing a horse qualifies as an experience, whether one sees the horse in person, in a dream, or in a hallucination. 'Bracketing' the horse suspends any judgement about the horse as noumenon, and instead analyses the phenomenon of the horse as constituted in intentional acts. Bracketing may also be understood in terms of the phenomenological activity it is supposed to make possible: the \\"unpacking\\" of phenomena, or, in other words, systematically peeling away their symbolic meanings like layers of an onion until only the thing itself as meant and experienced remains. Thus, one's subjective intending of the bracketed phenomenon is examined and analyzed in phenomenological purity.

It consists of a four-mile-long (6 km) sandy beachfront, dunes, and a maritime pitch pine forest. Five and a half miles of hiking trails through the dunes and forest are accessible from the beachfront. Crane Beach is open year-round, and is free to Ipswich residents with the purchase of a yearly beach parking sticker. Non-residents must pay a fee to enter ($30 on weekends during peak season for a car, as of July 2018). In the summer months there is a refreshment bar, and the restrooms, showers and changing facilities are open year-round. Crane Beach in August 2014 During low tide, it is often possible to wade out to sand bars, and during the warm months small boats often dock on these sand bars. Across the water, Plum Island and its sandy beaches are visible. Crane Beach was established in 1945 as a gift from Richard T. Crane Jr., son of Richard T. Crane, and his family. Along with Castle Hill and the Crane Wildlife Refuge, it is owned and maintained by The Trustees of Reservations. There is an annual celebration that takes place at the beach on June 16 (if the weather is sufficient) called Crane Beach Day. On this day, students from the Doyon and Winthrop Elementary Schools, as well as the Ipswich Middle School students, gather at the beach during the school day. The middle school students have the option to take part in a run that goes from the Ipswich Town Hall, to the beach. Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Crane, Jr. (previous owners of the Crane Estate) began a tradition of inviting all the Ipswich school children to the beach for a day in 1911 to celebrate their son, Cornelius‚Äô, 6th birthday. Ever since, the tradition of Crane Beach Day has been repeated. In 2011, the schools celebrated the 100th anniversary of the event. Several students, with birthdays closest to the day of the event, arrived at the beach by boat like they would when the tradition was started. There were people hired to impersonate the Crane family and greet people as they got to the beach, a replica of the old Ipswich Lighthouse, and even a special ice cream flavor dedicated to Cornelius (called ‚ÄúCornelius Crunch‚Äù). In addition, every student received a celebratory t-shirt to wear to the beach, featuring a picture of Cornelius on his 6th birthday. Crane Beach is an important nesting site for the threatened piping plover. The 2006 International Piping Plover Breeding Census estimated that only 3,884 plovers remained. According to the same 2006 census, Crane Beach was home to 19 breeding pairs and 40 total adults. The Greenhead fly is active in this area for a few weeks in July and early August.http://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g41626-d482304-r26130334-Crane_Beach- Ipswich_Massachusetts.html The Cape Ann Transportation Authority (CATA) provides summer weekend bus service on sunny days between the Ipswich MBTA train station and Crane Beach. The walk-on fee is $2 per person. In popular culture The 1968 movie The Thomas Crown Affair starring Steve McQueen features a scene where McQueen‚Äôs character drives a dune buggy across this beach. The beach scenes of 2019 version of the movie Little Women also were filmed on the property.

It was launched in London 2005 to cater for educational needs of the Africans (including the North Africans) and for people of African origin (e.g. the Caribbeans).About Awqaf Africa Establishment The Muslim Open College was founded while studying postgraduate degrees in Damascus early 1990s by founder of Awqaf Africa Sheikh Abu-Abdullah Adelabu (PhD Damas), a West African Muslim scholar and cleric of Nigerian origin who is the international organization's first al Amir (president).Biography of Sheikh Dr. Abu-Abdullah Adelabu He also lectures and supervises on dissertations and publications of his students and followers, including the African Muslim Portals such as EsinIslam.Com, Muxlima.com, and IslamAfrica.Com. Day-to-day activities and management of the College, its lectures, seminals, and administration are run mainly by volunteers and associates of Awqaf Africa in London, United Kingdom, Damascus, Syria, Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa.Origin of Awqaf Africa Objectives Like its umbrella organization Awqaf Africa, the Muslim Open College is an international organization which is incorporated in its structure with African Hajj and 'Umrah Commission and the African Union Muslim working to relieve human suffering amongst the Muslims of Africa - in particular and as a primary objective - and around the world - as necessary. It shares the same aims and objectives as Awqaf Africa, especially for Muslim societies where each national society effectuates programmes of Awqaf Africa. Relief, human dignity, and spiritual uplift remain main goals of the international body.[Delab International Magazine, London August 1999] Through education, Awqaf Africa's Open College seeks the causes of suffering, poverty, and Islamophobia and tries to eliminate them under the banner of Islamic teachings. Studies The Open College is also projected to provide, in particular, the African Muslims with studies and qualifications that enable them to serve themselves and their Muslim communities, offering them maximum flexibility, so that they can build a program of studies that fits both their personal and community needs and adapt accordingly. Awqaf Africa gives priority to those who serve or intend to serve the Muslim communities through teachings and preachings or administration and career development.Studying With Awqaf Africa Studies at Awqaf Africa Muslim Open College are free, especially for the Africans (including the North Africans) and for people of African Origins (e.g. the Caribbeans) in an effort to help people develop their spiritual uplifts, to become a teacher, to foster their career development for the Muslims, or to serve as a Da^'i, offering them a true learning experience, supporting them as they study their first course with Awqaf Africa and appealing they intend to serve the Muslims and their interests - appreciating that a prospect of studying with Awqaf Africa could be so exciting that students overlook the sacred needs to be devoted to the amiable values of Islam.Why Awqaf Africa The college coordinates a number of educational and training programmes for several Muslim portals including EsinIslam.com and IslamAfrica.com.

It is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 87 kDa and 13 transmembrane domains, which transports two sodium cations (Na+) for each iodide anion (I‚àí) into the cell. NIS mediated uptake of iodide into follicular cells of the thyroid gland is the first step in the synthesis of thyroid hormone. Iodine uptake Iodine uptake mediated by thyroid follicular cells from the blood plasma is the first step for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. This ingested iodine is bound to serum proteins, especially to albumins. The rest of the iodine which remains unlinked and free in bloodstream, is removed from the body through urine (the kidney is essential in the removal of iodine from extracellular space). Iodine uptake is a result of an active transport mechanism mediated by the NIS protein, which is found in the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells. As a result of this active transport, iodide concentration inside follicular cells of thyroid tissue is 20 to 50 times higher than in the plasma. The transport of iodide across the cell membrane is driven by the electrochemical gradient of sodium (the intracellular concentration of sodium is approximately 12 mM and extracellular concentration 140 mM). Once inside the follicular cells, the iodide diffuses to the apical membrane, where it is metabolically oxidized through the action of thyroid peroxidase to iodinium (I+) which in turn iodinates tyrosine residues of the thyroglobulin proteins in the follicle colloid. Thus, NIS is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Thyroid hormone synthesis, with the Na/I symporter seen at right. Apart from thyroid cells NIS can also be found, although less expressed, in other tissues such as the salivary glands, the gastric mucosa, the kidney, the placenta, the ovaries and the mammary glands during pregnancy and lactation. NIS expression in the mammary glands is quite a relevant fact since the regulation of iodide absorption and its presence in the breast milk is the main source of iodine for a newborn. Note that the regulation of NIS expression in thyroid is done by the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), whereas in breast is done by a combination of three molecules: prolactin, oxytocin and Œ≤-estradiol. Inhibition by Environmental Chemicals Some anions like perchlorate, pertechnetate and thiocyanate, can affect iodide capture by competitive inhibition because they can use the symporter when their concentration in plasma is high, even though they have less affinity for NIS than iodide has. Many plant cyanogenic glycosides, which are important pesticides, also act via inhibition of NIS in a large part of animal cells of herbivores and parasites and not in plant cells. Some evidence suggests that fluoride, such as that present in drinking water, may decrease cellular expression of the sodium/iodide symporter. Using a validated in vitro radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) assay, the Besides the traditionally known anions such as perchlorate, organic chemicals may also pose inhibition of iodide uptake via NIS.  Regulation in iodine uptake  The iodine transport mechanisms are closely submitted to the regulation of NIS expression. There are two kinds of regulation on NIS expression: positive and negative regulation. Positive regulation depends on TSH, which acts by transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms. On the other hand, negative regulation depends on the plasmatic concentrations of iodide. = Transcriptional regulation = At a transcriptional level, TSH regulates the thyroid's function through cAMP. TSH first binds to its receptors which are joined to G proteins, and then induces the activation of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which will raise the intracellular levels of cAMP. This can activate the CREB transcription factor (cAMP Response Element-Binding) that will bind to the CRE (cAMP Responsive Element). However, this might not occur and, instead, the increase in cAMP can be followed by PKA (Protein kinase A) activation and, as a result, the activation of the transcription factor Pax8 after phosphorylation. These two transcription factors influence the activity of NUE (NIS Upstream Enhancer), which is essential for initiating transcription of NIS. NUE's activity depends on 4 relevant sites which have been identified by mutational analysis. The transcriptional factor Pax8 binds in two of these sites. Pax8 mutations lead to a decrease in the transcriptional activity of NUE. Another binding-site is the CRE, where the CREB binds, taking part in NIS transcription. In contrast, growth factors such as IGF-1 and TGF-Œ≤ (which is induced by the BRAF-V600E oncogene) suppress NIS gene expression, not letting NIS localize in the membrane. = Posttranslational regulation = The TSH can also regulate the iodide uptake at a posttranslational level, since, if it's absent, the NIS can be resorted from the basolateral membrane of the cell in to the cytoplasm where it is no longer functional. Therefore, the iodide uptake is reduced.  Thyroid diseases  The lack of iodide transport inside follicular cells tends to cause goitres. There are some mutations in the NIS DNA that cause hypothyroidism and thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Moreover, antibodies anti-NIS have been found in thyroid autoimmune diseases. Using RT- PCR tests, it has been proved that there is no expression of NIS in cancer cells (which forms a thyroid carcinoma). Nevertheless, thanks to immunohistochemical techniques it is known that NIS is not functional in these cells, since it is mainly localized in the cytosol, and not in the basolateral membrane. There is also a connection between the V600E mutation of the BRAF oncogene and papillary thyroid cancer that cannot concentrate iodine into its follicular cells.  Use with radioiodine (131I)  The main goal for the treatment of non-thyroid carcinoma is the research of less aggressive procedures that could also provide less toxicity. One of these therapies is based on transferring NIS in cancer cells of different origin (breast, colon, prostate...) using adenoviruses or retroviruses (viral vectors). This genetic technique is called gene targeting. Once NIS is transferred in these cells, the patient is treated with radioiodine (131I), being the result a low cancer cell survival rate. Therefore, a lot is expected from these therapies.

Its objective was to ratify the new Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation between the United States and Japan, in addition to being Japan‚Äôs first diplomatic mission to the United States since the 1854 opening of Japan by Commodore Matthew Perry. Another significant facet of the mission was the shogunate‚Äôs dispatch of a Japanese warship, the Kanrin Maru, to accompany the delegation across the Pacific and thereby demonstrate the degree to which Japan had mastered Western navigation techniques and ship technologies barely six years after ending its isolation policy of nearly 250 years.The first naval training in Japan had been begun at the Nagasaki Naval Training Center in 1855. Background The three plenipotentiary members of the Japanese embassy: Muragaki Norimasa, Shinmi Masaoki, and Oguri Tadamasa. On January 19, 1860, the Kanrin Maru set sail from Uraga for San Francisco under the leadership of Captain Katsu Kaish≈´, with Nakahama \\"John\\" Manjiro as the official translator, carrying 96 Japanese men and an American officer, John M. Brooke on board. The overall head of the mission was Admiral (Êú®ÊùëÂñúÊØÖ), a high ranking Shogunate official. Fukuzawa Yukichi, the future educator and reformer, but then only a young man eager to see foreign lands, had volunteered his services as an assistant to Admiral Kimura.Bakumatsu‚ÄîMeiji Furushashin Ch≈ç Aiz≈çhan, p. 20Sekai wo Mita Bakumatsu-Ishin no Eiy≈´tachi, p.42 The Japanese embassy itself traveled aboard a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Powhatan, which the Kanrin Maru escorted - albeit taking a different route across the Pacific and arriving before the Powhatan. The Japanese embassy was formally composed of three men: Ambassador Shinmi Masaoki (Êñ∞Ë¶ãÊ≠£Ëàà), Vice- Ambassador Muragaki Norimasa (ÊùëÂû£ÁØÑÊ≠£), and Observer Oguri Tadamasa (Â∞èÊ†óÂø†È†Ü).Bakumatsu‚ÄîMeiji Furushashin Ch≈ç Aiz≈çhan, p. 21Sekai wo Mita Bakumatsu- Ishin no Eiy≈´tachi, pp.30-49 Destinations =San Francisco= Fukuzawa Yukichi with Theodora Alice in San Francisco, 1860. The Kanrin Maru reached San Francisco directly, but the Powhatan (and the embassy) made a stopover in Hawaii first. When it arrived in San Francisco, the delegation stayed for a month, and Fukuzawa had himself photographed with an American girl, a photo that has since become one of the most famous in Japanese history. Fukuzawa also acquired an English‚ÄìChinese Webster‚Äôs Dictionary, from which he began to study English seriously and prepare his own English‚ÄìJapanese dictionary.Bakumatsu‚ÄîMeiji Furushashin Ch≈ç Aiz≈çhan, p. 21 =Washington, D.C., New York, and the return= Reception at the White House President James Buchanan receiving the Embassy.

The studio was started with the Government of Karnataka holding 93 per cent of the share capital and the remaining 7 per cent by private shareholders. Over the several decades, the studio suffered losses, as new generation of film-makers and new techniques took over the industry.

Due to his larger than life image, the city virtually came to a halt as the news spread about the death. His death precipitated a citywide reaction comparable to the time he was kidnapped by Veerappan. Following the news of his death, Bangalore city saw violence by people claiming to be his fans. The Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy later claimed that the violence was instigated by vested political interests. An unofficial bandh (closure of all shops and other establishments) was announced. The state government declared a statewide holiday on 13 April as a mark of respect to the departed soul, who was also a recipient of Karnataka Ratna (pearl of Karnataka) award. Private firms and businesses all over the city and many parts of the state remained closed due to the holiday. The body was kept initially at Rajkumar's home in Sadashiva Nagar.

They were assimilated into the Maison du Roi and later formed the first company of the Garde du Corps du Roi (Royal Bodyguard). In 1450, King James II sent a company of 24 noble Scots under the command of Patrick de Spens, son of his custodian. This company takes the name of or . On 31 August 1490, this company, these of Patry Folcart, Thomas Haliday and a part of the company of Robin Petitloch became the first company of under the command of Guillaume Stuier (Stuart). At the beginning la compagnie √©cossaise des gardes du corps du roi included 100 (25 bodyguards and 75 ). Each bodyguard had four men-at-arms under his command, (a squire, an archer, a cranequinier and a servant), one of them acquired the name of . They were finally disbanded in 1830 at the abdication of Charles X. History Charles VII of France depicted as a magus and surrounded by his Scottish guards (left) =Overview= Scottish warriors were believed to have fought for Charlemagne and later in the Armies of Charles the Simple in 882. It is only after 1295, however, and the agreements that would become known as the Auld Alliance, that there is documentary evidence of French soldiery in Scotland or Scottish soldiery in France. From the outset of the Hundred Years War, there were Scottish companies officially fighting for Philip IV of France. At the Battle of Poitiers, the 1st Earl of Douglas and the future 3rd Earl of Douglas fought for John II, where the future 3rd Earl was captured along with many Scottish knights, notwithstanding the French king himself. In the 1360s there were Scotsmen to be found in the army of Bertrand du Guesclin. In the early 15th century France was split into Armagnac-Burgundian civil strife following the descent into madness of Charles VI. Henry V of England saw his opportunity and allied himself with John the Fearless and invaded. The Dauphin despairingly sought allies, and found them amongst the Scots and the Castilians. =La Grande Arm√©e √âcossaise= In 1418 Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany appointed his son, John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan, Chamberlain of Scotland to command the Scottish expeditionary force, the largest army that medieval Scotland had ever sent abroad. 7000-8000 men arrived at La Rochelle in October 1419 and made their way to Tours to greet the Dauphin. The first thing the future Charles VII did was to shower munificence upon the Scottish nobles. Buchan received Ch√¢tillon-sur-Indre, the Earl of Wigtoun received Dun- le-Roi, Sir John Stewart of Darnley received Concressault and Aubigny, and Thomas Seton the castle of Langeais. The Scottish leaders were persuaded to return to Scotland to recruit more troops. The Scottish leadership returned in 1420 with another 4000-5000 reinforcements. While their leaders were at home the Dauphin assigned the Scottish contingent throughout his armies and garrisons and picked a number, roughly one hundred of the best warriors, to be his personal body guard. The Scotsmen fought with distinction throughout France with a notable win at the Battle of Baug√© in 1421, where the Duke of Clarence was said to have been felled by Buchan's Mace. The Scots faced a calamity at the Battle of Verneuil in 1424, when they lost 6000 men. Although saddened by the loss of so many of his loyal Scotsmen, Charles VII continued to honour the survivors. The Scots had a further setback at the Battle of the Herrings in 1429. The Scottish Army in France fragmented into free companies (a headache for the French state), and also into Compagnies d'ordonnance within the French Army. =The Royal Bodyguard= Gardes √âcossaises from the time of Louis XIII. They wear the uniforms worn between the reigns of Charles VIII and Louis XIV. Standard of the \\"Scottish company\\", the 1st company of the royal Garde du Corps Uniform of the Scottish guards by 1757 The King kept about him his Garde √âcossaise. The Scottish Guards had likely protected him during the murder of John the Fearless at the bridge of Montereau, and rescued him from a fire in Gascony in 1442. Scottish Guards fell at the Battle of Montlh√©ry defending their King, Louis XI of France, in 1465. =Later history= The Garde √âcossaise survived until the end of the Bourbon monarchy as the senior or Scottish Company of the Gardes du Corps (Body Guards). There were four companies of Body Guards and a detachment of them accompanied the French King wherever he went, posted guards on his sleeping place and even escorted his food from kitchen to table.Rene Chartrand, page 14 Louis XIV's Army, During the reign of Francis I the garde were held up by blizzards near the Simplon Pass after a defeat at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. Some of the men reputedly settled there and their descendants became known as the \\"Lost Clan\\".Keay and Keay (1994) p. 639 From the 16th century onwards recruitment of the unit was primarily from Frenchmen and the Scottish element gradually died out. The name was retained as were certain words of command which had originated in Scots.Liliane and Fred Funcken, page 14 L'Uniforme et les Armes des Soldats de la Guerre en Dentelle, In 1632, the Earl of Enzie began to rebuild a Scottish regiment in France.David Stevenson, \\"Gordon, George, second marquess of Huntly (c. 1590‚Äì1649)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 accessed 19 Nov 2010 There is sometimes confusion as to which unit actually held the title of Garde √âcossaise, with several regiments in service often being conflated, especially those commanded by Sir John Hepburn, James Campbell, 1st Earl of Irvine (later commanded by Sir Robert Moray) and Colonel James Douglas.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), pp.65, 108, 154, 161, 172 As an example some works recording Scots in action have simply applied the Garde √âcossaise name, although referring to the Regiment de Douglas. By the reign of Louis XV the Scottish Company numbered 21 officers and 330 men in a mounted unit which last saw active service when they escorted Louis at the Battle of Lawfeld on 1 July 1747. On this and other occasions the Scottish Company carried claymores with steel basket guards instead of the swords of the other French heavy cavalry. They were distinguished from the other companies of the Body Guards by wearing white bandoleers garnished with silver lace.Rene Chartrand, page 5 Louis XV's Army - Cavalry and Dragoons, The Scottish Company provided a special detachment of 24 Gardes de la Manche (literally \\"Guards of the Sleeve\\") who stood in close attendance to the king during court ceremonies. The name indicated that they stood so close to the monarch as to be brushed by his sleeve. The Gardes de la Manche were distinguished by a heavily embroidered white and gold cassock which they wore over the blue and red and silver uniform of the Body Guard.Rene Chartrand, page 6 Louis XV's Army - Cavalry and Dragoons, =Final disbandment= All four companies of the Body Guard were formally disbanded in 1791, although the aristocratic personnel of the regiment had dispersed following the closure of Versailles as a royal palace in October 1789.Philip Mansel, page 129 \\"Pillars of Monarchy\\", They were re-established at the time of the First Bourbon Restoration under an ordinance dated 25 May 1814. Until their final dissolution in 1830 the Senior Company retained the title of \\"les fiers Ecossais\\" (the proud Scots).Liliane and Fred Funcken, page 10 L'Uniforme et les Armes des Soldats du XIX Siecle, =Notable Guardsmen= Monsieur Bergier, an Officer of the Scottish Guards (18th century) * Jean Stuart, earl Darnley, lord d'Aubigni and Concressault, killed in 1429 at Orl√©ans * Robert or Robin PetitLoch, s√©n√©chal des Lannes (1419‚Äì1461) * Christin Chamber knight (1425‚Äì1447) * Patris Folcart(1449‚Äì1461) * Patrick Neiven - Killed at Orl√©ans in 1429 * Thomas Haliday(1449‚Äì1461) * Patrick de Spens, Lord of Bohapple and Estignols, √©cuyer des √©curies du roi (1450‚Äì1485) * Guillaume Stuyers, Lord of Maulleon, √©cuyer des √©curies du roi (1461‚Äì1464) * Thomas Stuyers (1465‚Äì1472) * Robert Coningham (1475‚Äì1478), Lord of Cherveux and Villeneuve. * Jean de Coningham, bailly de Chartres, conseiller et chambellan du roi (1479‚Äì1492) * Berault Stewart or Stuart, Lord of Aubigny, conseiller et chambellan du roi, knight of the order of Saint- Michel (1492‚Äì1508) * , lord of St Quentin and Perrigny, brother in law of B.

The mall is the hub of the retail and commercial corridor along U.S. Highway 31 on the south side of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Area. As with several other central Indiana shopping centers, Greenwood Park Mall is owned and operated by Simon Property Group. Greenwood Park Mall has 149 stores. The mall's four anchors are Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Macy's (originally Lazarus), and Von Maur (originally Blocks, later Montgomery Ward). With of total retail area, Greenwood Park Mall is the fourth largest shopping mall in Indiana, after Castleton Square in Indianapolis, Glenbrook Square in Fort Wayne, and Southlake Mall in Merrillville. The mall is managed by Steve Kempe as of July 2016. There was also a JCPenney Home Store located near Macy's, which was a former Woolworth. There also used to be a Sears. Built on an site by Atkinson & Company at a cost of $25 million, the Greenwood Shopping Center opened in 1966. In 1977, Melvin Simon & Associates purchased the mall for an undisclosed amount of money, and in 1980, it was reopened as the Greenwood Park Mall following a renovation and expansion. By 1990, an average of 10 million shoppers a year (about 28,000 a day) were patronizing the Greenwood Park Mall. The interior walking space area, not including the leased retail spaces, encompasses a total of of area. It is currently the only mall in metropolitan Indianapolis to retain its Old Navy store, as the Lafayette Square, Washington Square, Circle Centre, Castleton Square, Speedway Supercenter and Glendale Mall locations have closed. Dick's Sporting Goods opened in 2005, taking a former Service Merchandise site. In 2003, Greenwood Park Mall underwent its first major renovation since becoming an enclosed shopping mall in 1980. This renovation eliminated many of the components of the park theme for which the mall was named. Live plants and trees, park-style benches, and outdoor-style lampposts around the interior of the mall were eliminated in favor of a more modern and upscale design. The plaza-style design of the food court was also eliminated in favor of a more open layout. In addition to interior changes, exterior entrances to the mall were also revamped at this time. By Spring 2004, work on the mall had been completed. Despite minor changes to the interior of the mall, Greenwood Park Mall currently maintains the appearance it received in the 2003 renovation. In 2007, the building formerly occupied by L.S. Ayres was demolished, and a lifestyle center was constructed on the site. This expansion increased gross leasable area by . The lifestyle center officially opened on November 8, 2007. On October 15, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide. In 2019, it was announced that a Dave and Buster's would be occupying the former JCPenney Home Store, which is set to open on October 15, 2020.

It usually lives in sandy areas with sparse vegetation and good ground cover. It can also live in open woodland and burrow into loose soil. Females of the species give birth to live young. It has at least one major subspecies, Chalcides bedriagai pistaciae. These skinks are active during day and dusk, and they are very timid. They reach about in total length and have five fingers on each foot. They prey on insects, spiders, slugs and woodlice. Etymology Both the specific name, bedriagai, and the common name, Bedriaga's skink, are in honor of Russian herpetologist Jacques von Bedriaga.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Chalcides bedriagai, p. 21). Description Bedriaga's skink resembles a scaled-down version of the ocellated skink (Chalcides ocellatus). It has a small head, an elongated cylindrical body and short limbs with five digits on each foot. It measures up to in length, at least half of which may be the fairly broad tail. Females are usually larger than males and in both sexes the tail may sometimes be broken off or in the process of regeneration. There are 24 to 28 scales around the mid-body. The colour is pale brown, yellowish-brown or grey with numerous small black-edged eyespots and usually a paler lateral line running along either side. Juveniles are a darker colour. Distribution and habitat Bedriaga's skink is endemic to Spain and Portugal. It is largely absent from northern Spain and its distribution is rather patchy elsewhere. It also occurs on the Mediterranean islands of the Islas del Mar Menor and the Isla de Nueva Tabarca and the Atlantic islands of Cies Islands, Pessegueiro Island, Ons Island and Islote de Sancti Petri. Its typical habitat is sandy heathland with scrubby vegetation or sandy areas with more dense vegetation. It also occurs in open woodland, clearings, scrubland areas and rocky hillside slopes up to an altitude of about above sea level. It can adapt to living in moderately degraded areas. Behaviour Bedriaga's skink is a diurnal species and feeds on a wide range of small invertebrates. It has secretive habits and likes to bask in the sun in well-hidden locations. When disturbed it seeks cover in dense undergrowth or under ground, and it can burrow very quickly through loose soil. At breeding time, males become territorial and often fight. Females may mate with more than one male and are viviparous. The gestation period is about eleven weeks after which one to six young are born. The newly emerged juveniles are about long. Status Major threats to this species, C. bedriagai, include modification of its habitat by increased afforestation or coastal development, and increases in the population of the wild boar (Sus scrofa) may have an impact. The population of this skink is believed to be in decline, especially in some island populations, and the IUCN has listed it as being \\"Near Threatened\\".

In 1840 he became an employee of the Russian-American Company and soon became the manager of the Okhotsk port. He deduced that the port was inconvenient for trade, as it was too far from the Lena River basin and advocated transfer of the Company port to Ayan. During his exploration Zavoyko discovered the estuary of the Amur River (the exploration was later continued by Gennady Nevelskoy, who proved that the Strait of Tartary was not a gulf, but indeed a strait, connected to Amur's estuary by Nevelskoy Strait). Zavoyko's reports about the potential importance of the river led to the 1846 expedition to study Amur and ultimately to the incorporation of the modern Primorsky Krai to Russia (see Amur Annexation). In 1850, he was appointed governor of Kamchatka and the commander of the port of Petropavlovsk. Under Zavoyko's governorship, Kamchatka expanded to include a wharf, foundry, and a new army barracks. Zavoyko also encouraged agricultural expansion, urging each household to sustain itself with potato farming. These efforts, however, did little to improve the region's low economic and cultural standards. In 1854, during the Crimean War, Zavoyko led the successful defence against the Siege of Petropavlovsk by the allied British-French troops commanded by Rear Admirals David Price and Auguste Febvrier Despointes. Zavoyko managed to repel the superior allied forces and even captured the British banner. In the winter of 1855, Zavoyko was in charge of the transfer the main Russian Pacific naval base from Petropavlovsk to the Amur estuary. The fleet managed to make its way through despite the frozen seas and the superior enemy fleet awaiting them near the Amur inflow. In two months sailors built the Nikolayevsk-on-Amur city that served as the base for the fleet. In 1856, Zavoyko returned to Saint Petersburg, where he served as the Naval General-Auditor. He was married to Juliana Wrangell and had 11 children: five sons and six daughters. Zavoyko died in 1898. One daughter, Ekaterina Vasilievna, married Vasily Grinevetsky the professor of engineering at the Imperial Moscow Technical School.

First issued in 1950, the landmark recording captured the premiere performance given by a big band in the famed concert venue. The event has been described as \\"the single most important jazz or popular music concert in history: jazz's 'coming out' party to the world of 'respectable' music.\\" Both critical and public reception of the performances was outstanding. The title, mastered from preserved acetates, was among jazz's first double albums, first live recordings, and first to sell over a million copies. One of the earliest records of Benny Goodman music issued on the new long-playing format, the concert recording was also sold in a set of nine 45 rpm records in 1950 by Columbia. The subsequent discovery of the aluminum studio masters made from the original recording resulted in several high-quality CD reissues beginning in 1998. Background In late 1937, Goodman's publicist, Wynn Nathanson, suggested that Goodman and his band should play Carnegie Hall in New York City. If such a concert were to take place, then Goodman would be the first jazz bandleader to perform at Carnegie Hall. \\"Benny Goodman was initially hesitant about the concert, fearing for the worst; however, when his film Hollywood Hotel opened to rave reviews and giant lines, he threw himself into the work. He gave up several dates and insisted on holding rehearsals inside Carnegie Hall to familiarize the band with the lively acoustics.\\" The concert was held on the evening of January 16, 1938. It sold out weeks in advance, with the capacity 2,760 seats going for a top price of US$2.75 a seat (). Concert The concert began with three contemporary numbers from the Goodman band‚Äî\\"Don't Be That Way\\", \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\", and \\"One O'Clock Jump\\". They then played a history of jazz, starting with a Dixieland quartet performing \\"Sensation Rag\\", originally recorded by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1918. Once again, the initial reaction of the audience, though polite, was tepid. Then came a jam session on \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" featuring members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington bands as guests. (The surprise of the session: Goodman handing a solo to Basie's guitarist Freddie Green, who was never a featured soloist but earned his reputation as the best rhythm guitarist in the genre‚Äîhe responded with a striking round of chord improvisations.) As the concert went on, things livened up. The Goodman band and quartet took over the stage and performed the numbers that had made them famous. Some later trio and quartet numbers were well received, and the vocal by Martha Tilton on \\"Loch Lomond\\" provoked five curtain calls and cries for an encore. The encore forced Goodman to make his only audience announcement for the night, stating that they had no encore prepared but that Martha would return shortly with another number.CD booklet. The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert. Sony reissue, 1992. By the time the band reached the climactic piece \\"Sing, Sing, Sing (With a Swing)\\", success was assured. This performance featured playing by the tenor saxophonist Babe Russin, the trumpeter Harry James, and Goodman, backed by the drummer Gene Krupa. When Goodman finished his solo, he unexpectedly gave a solo to the pianist, Jess Stacy. \\"At the Carnegie Hall concert, after the usual theatrics, Jess Stacy was allowed to solo and, given the venue, what followed was appropriate,\\" wrote David Rickert. \\"Used to just playing rhythm on the tune, he was unprepared for a turn in the spotlight, but what came out of his fingers was a graceful, impressionistic marvel with classical flourishes, yet still managed to swing. It was the best thing he ever did, and it's ironic that such a layered, nuanced performance came at the end of such a chaotic, bombastic tune.\\" Original recording(s) There is much confusion about how the live concert was recorded for posterity. At least three studios were involved in making a synchronized pair of acetates (at two, working together) and a set of aluminum masters (at the third). The acetates became the basis for the original 1950 double-LP album release. The higher quality metal masters were used for subsequent CD remasters. CD reissues based on the metal masters were released in 1998, 2002 and 2006. Reception The original 1950 long-playing double-album was very-highly received. As technology improved the material was re-released in digital format, with new versions produced both in the 1980s and 1990s. Bruce Eder, writing for AllMusic, generally praises the 1999 double-CD release, noting the compromise between clear reproduction of sonic detail and retaining surface noise from the source material. The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings includes the 1999 release in its \\"Core Collection,\\" in addition to giving it a four-star rating (of a possible four). Penguin authors Richard Cook and Brian Morton describe the release as \\"a model effort, masterminded by Phil Schaap, whose indomitable detective work finally tracked down the original acetates and gave us the music in the best sound we'll ever get; with powerful, even thrilling, ambience.\\" 1950 track listing 1999 Compact disc reissue track listing =Disc one= =Disc two= Disc one, track 1 and disc two, tracks 20‚Äì28 are edited from comments recorded by Benny Goodman in 1950 and pressed onto a 12\\" 78 rpm record that was sent to radio station DJs at the time of the original double-album release.

After a lackluster performance overseas, Pinkney returned to the United States and secured a roster spot on the summer league entry for the Portland Trail Blazers. He averaged 5.5 points, 3 rebounds and 2.8 assists during limited summer league minutes but did not make the team. The Washington Wizards signed Pinkney as an extra body for training camp but also cut him.

Structure Development thumb Hippocampal sulcus remnants seen on T2-weighted axial MRI image. During human fetal development, the hippocampal sulcus first appears at approximately 10 weeks of gestational age. At this stage it exists as a broad shallow fissure along the surface of the dentate gyrus. Gradually, the fissure deepens and shifts toward the cornu ammonis. After about 18 weeks, the walls of the fissure fold into each other and begin to fuse. By 30 weeks, the hippocampal sulcus is normally obliterated except for its most medial part, leaving a shallow surface indentation.Humphrey, Tryphena. \\"The development of the human hippocampal fissure\\".

The company is headquartered in Monterrey. History Multimedios was founded in 1940 when Jes√∫s Dionisio Gonz√°lez acquired Monterrey radio station XEX, where he had formerly worked, for 12,500 pesos. After World War II, the Mexican government requested the XEX callsign to build a national clear-channel station, and Gonz√°lez selected the XEAW call letters, which had formerly belonged to a station in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In the 1950s, the group became known as Organizaci√≥n Estrellas de Oro (\\"Gold Stars Organization\\"), which in the 1990s changed its name to Multimedios Estrellas de Oro and later Grupo Multimedios. Multimedios entered the television business in 1968 when it launched XHAW-TV channel 12 in Monterrey. Further expansion would come in the 1980s and 1990s when the federal government made available dozens of new radio and TV stations, leading to Multimedios establishing a broadcast presence in cities including Tijuana, Chihuahua, and Tampico. Media holdings =Radio= Multimedios owns 37 radio stations and operates another five. The station portfolio is primarily concentrated in northeastern Mexico, including 14 stations in Monterrey; through a combination of acquisitions, operating agreements and stations won in the IFT-4 auction of 2017, Multimedios has increased its presence in the state of Veracruz and in western and central Mexico. In addition, Multimedios owns three radio stations in Costa Rica, which it acquired in 2018 in its purchase of Grupo Latino de Radiodifusi√≥n from PRISA and Grupo Naci√≥n, and Top Radio 97.2 in Madrid. =Broadcast television= Multimedios entered the television business in 1968 when it launched XHAW-TV channel 12 in Monterrey. In the 1980s and 1990s, the television network expanded to a regional footprint centered on the states of Coahuila, Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. In the IFT-6 station auction of 2017, Multimedios obtained six additional concessions for television stations in Mexico City, Guadalajara, Puebla, Ciudad Ju√°rez, Durango and Monclova, representing a major expansion into central Mexico. On July 29, 2017, Multimedios launched a separate television channel in Costa Rica, on channel 44, through a licensing agreement with the Fundaci√≥n Internacional de las Am√©ricas. Additionally, Multimedios owns cable news channel Milenio Televisi√≥n, which shares resources with its Milenio newspaper. =Print= Jes√∫s Dionisio Gonz√°lez started the Diario de Monterrey newspaper in 1974. On January 1, 2000, the newspaper began publishing in Mexico City and became a national daily, renamed Milenio (Millennium). The company also publishes several magazines. =Out-of-home advertising= Grupo Pol is an out-of-home advertising company with a presence in Mexico and other Central American countries. Sports Multimedios entered the sports ownership realm with its acquisition of 50 percent of the Sultanes de Monterrey baseball team in February 2017, with the other half held by Mexican baseball legend Jos√© Maiz Garc√≠a. The company grew further in sports in 2018 by buying the Fuerza Regia of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional as well as four LNBP expansion franchises and by becoming a majority shareholder of the Bravos de Le√≥n baseball team, a move that allowed the club to play in 2019. Other holdings Other Multimedios holdings include real estate company Altea Desarrollos; three Spanish wineries, Lleiroso, Bodega de Sarr√≠a and Inversiones Vitivin√≠colas, with a combined output of 7.5 million bottles of wine a year; the Bosque M√°gico (Magic Forest) amusement park in Monterrey; In 2015, Comercializadora Jubileo, a Multimedios subsidiary previously dedicated to the creation of toys for amusement parks, obtained a contract with the state government worth 538 million pesos to build a water treatment plant. A new state government rescinded the contract in 2016. The Nuevo Le√≥n Attorney General's Office later claimed that Jubileo had been awarded the contract despite its lack of prior experience in water treatment and failure to meet bid requirements. Former holdings =Cable television= Multimedios previously owned 50 percent of Televisi√≥n Internacional, S.A. de C.V., which traded as Cablevisi√≥n Monterrey. Cablevisi√≥n provided cable and internet service to the Monterrey metropolitan area. In 2016, Multimedios sold its stake to the other 50-percent owner, Televisa, and Cablevisi√≥n Monterrey was subsumed into Izzi Telecom. =Movie theaters= The MMCinemas chain of movie theaters was sold in 2008 to Grupo M√©xico, which rebranded all of its units as Cinemex.

The station airs a Chinese language programming format. CHMB's studios are located on Commerce Parkway in Richmond, while its transmitters are located on Lulu Island in Richmond. CHMB and CJMR are the only stations in Canada which broadcast on 1320 AM. CHMB is owned and operated by Mainstream Broadcasting Corporation, a British Columbia media company owned and operated by Vancouver businessman James Ho. Mainstream began broadcasting in 1973 as Overseas Chinese Voice (OCV). In 1993, OCV programming was incorporated into the multicultural AM radio station of CHMB AM 1320, which broadcasts to Vancouver's multicultural community. CHMB broadcasts to Vancouver's Chinese-speaking community, and in 12 other languages: Portuguese, Brazilian, Filipino, Greek, Japanese, Tamil, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian and Swedish. History CHMB began as an English- language station that was called CHQM. It signed on the air on December 10, 1959, as an easy listening station under the ownership of Vancouver Broadcast Associates Ltd. with 10 kW of power. CHQM's sister station, CHQM-FM, first aired on August 10, 1960 as a simulcast of the AM station, airing 19 hours a day. CHQM and CHQM-FM went to 24-hour broadcasting on September 1, 1962. In November 1966, CHQM increased its transmission power to 50 kW. On August 23, 1969, corporate parent Vancouver Broadcast Associates changed its name to Q Broadcasting Ltd. Jack Stark, who had co-founded the company with Bill Bellman, became the sole owner in 1979. In September 1984, CHQM began airing the \\"Music of Your Life\\" format from 6 p.m. to midnight daily while retaining its main easy listening format for the balance of its broadcast day. On January 1, 1990, CHQM dropped its longtime easy listening format for an adult contemporary format and began using the on-air brand Lite 1320. CHQM and CHQM- FM were purchased by CHUM Limited on October 17 that year, but due to Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations of the time (which allowed ownership of only one AM and one FM station in the same market), CHUM had to sell either CHQM or its other Vancouver AM outlet, CFUN; CHUM chose to sell CHQM. On February 20, 1991, CHQM switched formats again to adult standards of the 1930s to the 1960s with the new station brand Q 1320. The station began airing Chinese-language programming on January 23, 1993, from 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily, then moved the start time for Chinese shows to 9 p.m. three weeks later. On December 14, 1993, the CRTC approved CHUM's sale of CHQM to Mainstream Broadcasting Corporation. On February 9, 1994 (on which the Chinese New Year fell that year), CHQM signed off for the final time at 9 p.m. with Bob Hope's \\"Thanks for the Memories\\" as the farewell song, and was replaced moments later by CHMB. Original station co-owner Jack Stark died on October 30, 2001, at age 83. Programming CHMB's programming is primarily Chinese (Overseas Chinese Voice) (Cantonese & Mandarin), aired from Monday to Friday, with some Brazilian, Danish, Filipino, Greek, Icelandic, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Tamil, Ukrainian and Vietnamese programming on weekends.

A musician‚Äôs musician, Chico Bennett started his career in his early teens when he attracted the attention of music legend Prince, who gave him his first production job at the age of 19. Since that first production, Chico has continued writing, producing and remixing hits. In 2000 Chico began developing music projects with w super DJ/Producer/Remixer Richard Vission. This proved to be such a great fit that the two soon formed a partnership. Among their other accomplishments, Bennett and Vission were nominated for a Grammy Award for Remixer Of The Year in 2001. That same year Chico began working with actress Hilary Duff (Lizzy McGuire). The actress had never recorded before but wanted to try her hand at it. Chico became a central player in Team Hilary and in the making of all her records and movie soundtrack work. In 2003, Bennett founded the music production company Zero 1 Entertainment, Inc and Snaptime Music Publishing to develop new artist projects. Through Zero 1 Entertainment, Bennett has developed new artists Stranger Days, J1, Brig Feltus, and Kodi Hill. Always the musical chameleon, Chico has since worked with R&B; Superstar Usher, Pop/Rock Princesses The Veronicas, Los Angeles Rap Artist Mann, and Mega Superstar Britney Spears to name a few. In 2008 launched the label Captive Libertine Recordings, Inc. with artist Brig Feltus. In early 2013 Chico Bennett and writing/production partner Richard Vission developed the pop group WTF (W3 The Future) who were signed to Young Money Records in the summer of 2013. Immediately following the WTF signing, Bennett and Vission, along with songwriter David ‚ÄúDQ‚Äù Quinones (Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúHalo‚Äù), collaborated on the development of hot new buzz artists My Crazy Girlfriend.

He received the American Geophysical Union's James B. Macelwane Medal in 1994. Vidale was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, studied physics and geology and obtained his Ph.D. from Caltech in 1987. He then held research positions at UC Santa Cruz and the USGS, until he joined UCLA in 1995. In 2006, he moved to Seattle to direct the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington. In 2014, he became a project leader for the UW's M9 project, launched with the goal of preparing the region for the anticipated Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. He was a Gutenberg Fellow at Caltech and a Gilbert Fellow of the USGS. Vidale is a Fellow of AGU and received AGU's Macelwane Medal. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He studied the relation of Earth tides and earthquakes - finding only the strongest tides noticeably effect the timing of earthquakes, earthquake swarms - finding they are a more general phenomenon than he previously suspected, the inner core - discovering high-frequency seismic waves scattered therein that offer a second line of evidence it is rotating about 0.2 degrees per year, the stronger than expected healing of fault zones after an earthquake, and various details of the seismic structure of the mantle. Vidale also contributed an improved method of ray tracing which relied on a finite-difference approximation of the eikonal equation and which has been used widely in both earthquake and reflection seismology.

It appeared in the February 1976 edition. Plot summary In the year 2005, the world's population of six billion is suffering from acute famine. The World Food Organization decides on desperate measures to decrease the population by a process of triage. They propose to do this by adding selective poisons to certain food shipments to grossly over-populated areas. They attempt to blackmail biochemist Dr. Aaron Rodman into cooperating with their scheme (threatening to withhold food rations from his daughter's family if he doesn't comply), proposing to utilise his development of LP - a lipoprotein which when incorporated into foods will cause random deaths. The scheme is planned but Rodman is unwilling to go along with it. At a meeting between him and senior government officials and members of the World Food Council, he provides as refreshment sandwiches laced with the LP, so that they will die at random, just as they had planned for so many others to die. He carefully matches the LP in the sandwiches (which he also eats) to his own metabolism, so that he will die quickly and not be guilty of involvement in the scheme.

It received mixed reviews and was a box office bomb grossing $10.5 million on a $20 million budget. Plot A couple of 1930s Great Depression- era convicts, Ned and Jim, jailed on never-specified charges and abused by a ruthless warden, are dragged along when a vicious killer named Bobby escapes the electric chair. The two end up in a small upstate New York town near the Canada‚ÄìUS border, where they are mistaken for a pair of priests expected at the local monastery. They want to flee but cannot, since misunderstandings and the warden's search party looking for Bobby make a trip across the bridge to Canada almost impossible. Ned and Jim continue to masquerade as priests, trusted and welcomed by Father Levesque. An opportunity presents itself in the form of a procession to the church's sister church across the border. Each priest participating has to bring along someone who needs help, so they decide on the deaf-mute daughter of Molly, a local laundress and prostitute.Amazon.com Bobby is killed by police during the procession. Ned saves Molly's daughter from drowning, after this event she is able to speak. Jim is befriended by a young monk and decides to stay in the monastery to actually become a priest. Ned takes Molly and her daughter to Canada.

Black, Robert De Niro and Sean Penn were \\"a bankable duo who Paramount would have been unconcerned about throwing a significant budget toward, produced by an impresario with proven hits at his back, written by a celebrated wordsmith and helmed by an acclaimed young director breaking into the studio system.\\" Screenwriter David Mamet, took the initial premise from the 1955 movie of the same name, but he created a new scenario. Though the story is set in upstate New York, it was filmed in Mission, British Columbia. The set design involved the creation of an entire riverside town, with a budget of CDN $2.5 million for the set alone being the largest for a film produced in Canada to that date. Reception The film gained mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes sampled 19 reviewers and judged 47% of the reviews to be positive, with an average score of 5. Roger Ebert liked the film, saying \\"Robert De Niro and Sean Penn have two of the best faces in the movies - screwed up, sideways faces with a lot of mischief in the eyes. We're No Angels is a movie made for those faces, and one of the pleasures of watching the film is to see them looking sidelong at each other as they try to figure a way out of the complicated mess they're in.\\" In a retrospective review (2019), critic John Hansen wrote \\"We‚Äôre No Angels was probably hurt by being unappealing on the surface to both religious and non- religious moviegoers, with both groups assuming the film isn‚Äôt for them. But it‚Äôs actually for anyone who enjoys a smartly crafted comedy.\\" =Box office= The film debuted at #8 at the United States box office. It was similarly unsuccessful on home video.

In this case the Court first set out the standard of review of \\"reasonableness simpliciter\\", which directs the court to only review decisions that are \\"not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination\\".para. 56 Background Southam Inc. purchased a number of small newspapers in the Vancouver region. The Competition Bureau investigated the purchase as a violation of the Competition Act. The Competition Tribunal held that Southam violated section 92 of the Competition Act and ordered the company to sell off one of the papers. The Tribunal found that the newspapers were not in the same market with regards to print advertising markets. There was a decrease of competition in real estate advertising and not the retail advertising market. Southam appealed under section 13 of the Act to the Federal Court of Appeal. The Federal Court of Appeal held that it owed no deference to the Tribunal's finding that the markets were not the same and so it substituted its own findings that the markets were the same. The Court refused to set aside the remedy that had been ordered. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the Tribunal warranted any deference by the reviewing court. Judgment Justice Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the appeal should be allowed but the remedy should stay. Iacobucci J. considered four factors to determine the standard of review from Pezim v. British Columbia (Superintendent of Brokers).[1994] 2 S.C.R. 557 There was a statutory right of appeal but no privative clause, so the first factor indicated less deference; however, the absence of a privative clause was not determinative. In his view, the issue was one of mixed fact and law that was based on the balancing of interests, so the courts should be reluctant to re-examine the evidence. Iacobucci considered the purpose of the Act, which he stated was to encourage and promote competition and equality among companies. In his view this purpose was more economic policy than law and so suggests greater deference. Finally, he considered the expertise of the Tribunal, which he considered to be the most important factor. He found the Tribunal had expertise in matters of economics and commerce which were critical in assessing the question before the Tribunal and this required the courts to defer to their skill and judgment. With this analysis in mind, Iacobucci devised a standard of review in between \\"correctness\\" and \\"patent unreasonableness\\". A standard of \\"reasonableness simpliciter\\" was said to apply to decisions that are \\"not supported by any reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing examination\\".

It is common in some locations and is usually found in sunny areas with dense vegetation (usually grass up to 40 cm of height) but can also be found in arid areas. They reach about 48 cm in length, out of which the tail constitutes more than half. Its body is long and snake-like, coloured usually between brown and olive and may have dark stripes on the back. Each of the highly reduced legs has three fingers. These skinks are active during daytime and prey mainly on insects. Females of the species give birth to live young. The population of this skink is slowly declining, but it has some tolerance to habitat modification. Description This skink superficially looks like a snake except for the possession of tiny limbs with three-toed feet, the middle toe of the hind foot being longer than the other two, a fact that differentiates it from the Western three-toed skink (Chalcides striatus). It has a small head and thick neck and grows to a length of about , more than half of which is tail. There are three different colour variants; Some animals are plain silvery-grey; some have four to six narrow lengthwise lines running along the body; some have these lines but additionally a pale longitudinal, lateral band. Distribution and habitat The Italian three-toed skink is native to Italy, where it is common south of the River Po, and including Sardinia, Elba and Sicily, and North Africa, where its range includes Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Its typical habitat is damp but sunny areas with dense low vegetation such as meadows, stream verges, marshes, grassy slopes and hedgerows. In upland areas it may inhabit drier, more arid areas with low scrub and degraded slopes. Its altitudinal range is from sea level to . Status The Italian three-toed skink is common in suitable habitats over much of its wide range. It is threatened by urbanization and the degradation of its habitat by coastal development, but it is tolerant of some degree of habitat modification. The IUCN has listed it as being of \\"Least Concern\\" because, although the population is probably declining, this is not at a fast enough rate to warrant listing it in a more threatened category.

Arch Rock is a geologic formation on Mackinac Island in Michigan. It is a natural limestone arch formed during the Nipissing post-glacial period, a period of high Lake Huron levels following the end of the Wisconsin glaciation. To this day Arch Rock stands on the Lake Huron shoreline above the water. Limestone breccia is not an ideal material for natural bridges, and this type of formation is quite rare in the North American Great Lakes region. The Native Americans saw Arch Rock as a place of numinous power, and told many stories and legends about it. Euro-Americans did not share many of the taboos of their Native predecessors, and treated Arch Rock as a curiosity to be admired. One early chronicler was Alexis de Tocqueville who wrote of the \\"Giant's Arch\\" \\"of extraordinary shape\\" during his visit in August, 1831.Pierson, George Wilson, Tocqueville in America, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1938, p. 301 Its presence was a major element in the decisions to create Mackinac National Park in 1875 and its successor, Mackinac Island State Park, in 1895. Arch Rock has been a part of the State Park ever since. Today Arch Rock is a focus of Mackinac Island tourism, and is seen by many visitors to the Island.

Stedman persuaded the owners of Britling Cafeteria, a Memphis, Tennessee-based restaurant that started a few years earlier, to build his restaurants. Shortly thereafter, Stedman was approached by a successful Memphis businessman named James Frederick \\"Fred\\" Smith, who was looking for a new investment since the Greyhound Corporation had bought a controlling interest in the Smith Motor Coach Company he founded 1931, and was renamed as the Dixie Greyhound Lines. (Smith was the father of Frederick Wallace Smith, who later founded FedEx.) In 1932, Smith became the president of the National Toddle House System, Inc. By the 1950s, Toddle House had more than 200 locations in almost 90 cities. In 1962, Toddle House was purchased by Dobbs Houses, a competitor that also operated Steak 'n Egg Kitchen, and the franchise was allowed to decline. In 1980, Carson Pirie Scott borrowed $108 million to buy Dobbs Houses. In January 1988, Carson Pirie Scott sold Steak 'n Egg Kitchen and Toddle House to Diversified Hospitality Group of Milford, Connecticut. The chain has since been liquidated.

It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Schering- Plough. Merck decided to not pursue regulatory approval for use in treatment- experienced patients because the drug did not meet primary efficacy endpoints in late stage trials. Clinical trials continue in patients previously untreated for HIV. HIV-1 background The mechanisms of a number of available anti-HIV drugs prevent either viral reverse transcriptase enzyme or protease enzyme, allowing the virus to enter the cell before these drugs take effect. However, CCR5 inhibitors such as vicriviroc, as well as other entry inhibitors of HIV-1, inhibit the initial stages of the virus life cycle. = HIV-1 entry = HIV binds to and fuses with the target T-cells or macrophages with the help of gp120 and gp41, the only two proteins that are currently known to be exhibited on the surface of the viral envelope. One molecule of each protein associates noncovalently with the other on the viral membrane, and three of these units aggregate to form the gp120/gp41 heterotrimer, which traps the gp41 in a conformationally metastable state. Membrane fusion begins with the binding of gp120 to CD4, a glycoprotein which is expressed on the surface of the target cell. Upon binding, gp120 undergoes a conformational change, which causes the formation of the coreceptor binding site on gp120. All strains of HIV-1 use one of two coreceptors: CCR5 or CXCR4; coreceptor specificity will be described below. Once gp120 binds to the coreceptor, gp41 undergoes a conformational change that releases it from its once-metastable position. This change causes the hydrophobic N-terminus of the gp41 protein, also known as the fusion domain, to insert into the host cell membrane and anchor the virus into place. The insertion of gp41 into the target cell causes a subtle rearrangement in the gp41 protein that brings together two trimeric coiled coils, HR1 and HR2, to form a six-helix bundle. The bundle allows the viral and cellular membranes to approximate and eventually fuse together, leading to the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the target cell. = Coreceptors and tropism = The two coreceptors involved in the entry of HIV-1, CCR5 and CXCR4, belong to the larger family of 7-transmembrane segment (7TM) G-protein coupled receptors. HIV-1 can thus be classified according to specificity for one coreceptor or the other. R5 virus, also known as M-tropic HIV-1, targets macrophages and uses CCR5 as the coreceptor. X4 virus, or T-tropic HIV-1, targets T-cells and uses CXCR4 as the coreceptor. Dual-tropic strains of HIV-1, which utilize both receptors, also exist. Selectivity for one coreceptor or the other is especially dependent upon the V3 loop, a highly variable and structurally flexible region of gp120 that is composed of approximately 35 amino acids. Tropism can be predicted through the 11/25 method, which looks for basic amino acids at positions 11 and 25 in the V3 loop and suggests the presence of an X4 virus. Coreceptor usage, however, can change throughout the course of infection. 90% of patients in early phases of HIV-1 infection have R5 virus. However, after five years of infection, about 50% of all patients have detectable amounts of X4 virus. Causes for this switch are currently unclear. However, viral changes from CCR5 to CXCR4 coreceptor usage have been associated with a faster rate of CD4+ T-cell loss, rapid viral progression, and an increased rate of development of AIDS and death. =CCR5-Œî32= A focus on the CCR5 co-receptor as a potential target for anti-HIV medications began in 1996 with the discovery of CCR5-Œî32, or CCR5 delta-32, a mutational variant of the CCR5 coding gene. The deletion of 32 base pairs in this gene results in nonfunctional CCR5 receptors. While the frequency of this mutation within Caucasian populations is 0.0808, people of African or Asian descent do not appear to possess this allele. Œî32 homozygotes, or individuals who possess two copies of the Œî32 variant, have no functional CCR5 receptors and are consequently highly resistant to HIV infection. Individuals who inherit one copy of Œî32 variant and one copy of the normal CCR5 gene are CCR5 heterozygotes. Œî32 heterozygotes are still susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but the progression of the disease is significantly delayed compared to those with two normal copies of the CCR5 gene. CCR5 antagonists have been developed which cause deformation in the CCR5 co-receptor, leading to the cell's failure to bind with the HIV gp120 protein.  SCH-C and vicriviroc  In 2001, Schering-Plough developed one of the first small molecule CCR5 antagonists, SCH-C or SCH 351125, which inhibited replication of a number of HIV-1 isolates that used CCR5 as a coreceptor for binding. However, SCH-C caused a modest but dose-dependent prolongation of the corrected cardiac QT interval (QTc), leading to examination of alternative compounds whose antiviral and pharmacokinetic properties exceeded those of first-generation compounds like SCH-C. Vicriviroc was discovered in high- throughput screening and structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis. When compared with SCH-C, vicriviroc consistently and more actively inhibits viral replication, binds with higher affinity to CCR5 than SCH-C, and possesses a lower affinity for the human ether-a-go-go-related gene transcript ion channel, which may suggest a lower risk of cardiac effects.  Method of action  Vicriviroc is a noncompetitive allosteric antagonist of CCR5. It is orally administered and, because it is effective at nanomolar concentrations, it can be administered once daily. Vicriviroc binds to a small hydrophobic pocket between the transmembrane helices near the extracellular surface of the CCR5 receptor. Binding to this pocket induces a conformational change of the extracellular segment of CCR5 and prevents binding of gp120 to the target cell, consequently preventing the virus from entering the target cell at all. Specific binding interactions between CCR5 and vicriviroc were first described in 2008. Specifically, the trifluoromethyl phenyl group of vicriviroc may interact strongly with I198 residue on the fifth transmembrane helix (TM5) of CCR5 through hydrophobic interactions. Additionally, electrostatic interactions may form between the positively charged tertiary nitrogen group of vicriviroc and the hydrophilic region provided by E238 residue on TM7 of CCR5. Other strong interactions predicted by the group include the Y108 residue on TM3 and Y251 on TM6. Clinical trials Currently, vicriviroc is undergoing critical trials. Vicriviroc demonstrated a significant decrease of HIV RNA in R5-infected subjects. The mean decline from baseline of HIV RNA achieved 1.5 log10 or greater in all treatment groups (10, 25, 50 mg, b.i.d.) in a 14-day monotherapy trial in HIV-infected adults. A phase II trial in treatment-na√Øve HIV-1 infected subjects was discontinued after the rate of virologic relapse in those subjects who were administered vicriviroc increased compared to control subjects; however, further investigations suggest that the administered dosage of vicriviroc may have been too low. A new Phase II trial of treatment-naive HIV-1 patients is currently underway. A 48-week phase II trial (ACTG5211) examining the safety and efficacy of 5, 10, and 15 mg doses of vicriviroc found that patients in the 10 mg and 15 mg vicriviroc treatment groups achieved a median decrease in viral load of 1.92 and 1.44 (log10 copies/mL) and a median increase in CD4 cell count of 130 and 96 (cell/uL) from baseline, respectively. More patients in the vicriviroc groups had undetectable virus at 48 weeks (HIV-1 RNA <400/<50 copies/ml) compared to those in the placebo group (57/37 percent and 43/27 percent vs. 14/11 percent, respectively). The results from a 48-week phase II trial (VICTOR-E1) examining administration of 20 or 30 mg dosages of vicriviroc in addition to > 3-drug optimized background therapy (OBT) regimen that included a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor were reported in February 2008. Investigators concluded that, ‚Äú‚ÄòVicriviroc 30 or 20 mg once daily plus ritonavir-containing OBT provided sustained viral suppression in treatment-experienced subjects and increased CD4 cell counts regardless of the number of active drugs in OBT.‚Äô\\" As of May 2008, two phase III trials (VICTOR-E3 and VICTOR E4) in treatment- experienced patients were initiated. The late stage clinical trials by did not meet their primary efficacy endpoints and Merck has decided as of January 2010 to not pursue regulatory approval for the drug. Concerns surrounding CCR5 antagonists Available clinical trial data suggest that a new method of combating HIV-1 may be found in CCR5 antagonists. Studies into vicriviroc are ongoing, and another CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc, is currently on the market. However, concerns have arisen regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists as anti- HIV treatments because such drugs may facilitate the emergence of resistant strains of HIV-1. Two possibilities for such resistance have been hypothesized: HIV-1 may evolve to use only CXCR4 as the coreceptor; or HIV-1 may mutate in such a way that it is still able to interact with CCR5, despite the presence of a receptor antagonist. In fact, maraviroc-resistant variants of HIV-1 have already been generated in vitro by mutating residues in the V3 loop of gp120.

They were introduced at the 1966 New York Toy Fair and put on the market soon after. Initially about 3 inches tall, they were tiny by doll standards. The sensation they created in the toy world caused other toy companies to produce their own tiny dolls. Mattel founder Elliot Handler oversaw the project. He told engineers and sculptors that he wanted the dolls to resemble little children in neighborhoods across America. Martha Armstrong-Hand, the famous doll sculptor at Mattel, made the first Kiddles in 1965. She explained that the first set of ten dolls in a premier series called \\"Liddle Kiddles\\" used only four different head molds (3 of which were sculpted by Martha and 1 sculpted by another artist) but had different hairstyles and face paint. ( Martha Armstrong-Hand also sculpted other Mattel dolls, such as Drowsy (1965), Baby First Step (1965) and Cheerful Tearful (1966). A fun accessory introduced in 1968 was the Liddle Kiddle Talking Town House, this had one of the famous Mattel talking voice units inside. When the \\"chatty-ring\\" was pulled you would hear one of 8 different phrases, such as \\"This is where the Liddle Kiddles live!\\" The voice unit was the very same one that had been introduced in 1960 inside Mattel's Chatty Cathy doll, and used in all other Mattel talking dolls and toys. The doll Kiddles were made of soft vinyl with painted facial features and rooted, brushable hair. The first, second, and third series (called \\"bigger bodies\\" by collectors) ranged from 2¬æ in to 3¬Ω in, while the Skediddle Kiddles were 4 in tall and had a special mechanism inside the body which allowed them to walk, wave, and ride vehicles with the push of a child's hand. The Kola and Kologne Kiddles were 2 in, and the mini Jewelry Kiddles were ‚Äì in. All the dolls were marked with \\"Mattel\\" or \\"MI\\", a date, and either \\"Japan\\", \\"Hong Kong\\" or \\"Taiwan\\" on the back of the shoulders or on the back of the head near the hairline. The smaller dolls were marked under their non- removable clothing. Most Kiddle accessories were also marked. Some were marked with the Mattel seal, and some were only marked with a number. The bigger bodies (the first ten dolls) were designed to resemble typical neighborhood children at play. The name Liddle Kiddles was actually taken from the words \\"little kid\\". Each of the first 24 dolls had detailed clothing and accessories that perfectly matched their theme and size. Wire skeletons inside the vinyl bodies enabled the dolls to be posed and re-posed realistically. The first series of 9 Liddle Kiddle dolls plus 1 special doll set available only through the Sears and Roebuck Christmas Catalog, were conceived in 1965 and released to toy shelves in 1966. The following year additional dolls were added to the Liddle Kiddle series, and the Storybook Kiddles series and Smaller Lucky Locket Kiddle series were introduced. The small 2-inch dolls, however, had no wires inside for posing and, unlike the first 10, and the new Storybook Kiddles, their clothes were not removable. The year after that, 1968, the last 6 additions to the Liddle Kiddles series were added, as well as 3 more Storybook Kiddles, and new Skediddle Kiddles that could walk, the very popular Kologne Kiddle series, and the itty bitty tiniest Kiddles of them all ‚Äì Jewelry Kiddles. Parents and children were delighted and intrigued by the ability of Mattel Designers to keep making the dolls smaller and yet maintain the use of real hair and clothes. Mattel also released a series of 4 2 inch tall kiddles dressed up in animal costumes and called Animiddles. Ride and Run Skediddle sets consisting of a Skediddle walking doll and specially designed riding toys they could also use were introduced to the Skediddle Kiddle series. 3 new Kiddle Kolognes were added. More Lucky Locket Kiddles were released in pretty new pastel locket colors. 1969 saw a new series of 2 inch sized Storybook Sweetheart Kiddles, portraying famous star crossed lovers, such as Romeo and Juliet, and Robin Hood and Maid Marion. Also that year Mattel introduced the Kozmic Kiddle series of 4 glow in the dark adorable aliens in groovy space ships, the Tea Party Kiddles portraying little girls dressing up as fancy ladies, each coming with a fancy child sized tea cup and saucer. The very popular Zoolery Kiddles were also released. These were 4 teensy animals about the size of the previous years Jewelry Kiddles that came in tiny cages that could be worn as Jewelry. There were additional Ride and Run Skediddles added to that series too! And Lucky Locket Kiddles were re- released in bright gold lockets that collectors refer to as \\"Gold Rush\\" lockets. A very busy year for Mattels Kiddle Doll Line! By the time 1970 rolled around there was a global oil crisis taking shape and plastics, and especially vinyl which is derived from petroleum based products, was getting harder and more expensive for toy companies to buy. Mattel still released some Kiddles that year, but drastic cuts would ultimately lead to restructuring of what doll lines would continue and Barbie and her family were the star performers of the doll lines. Kiddles were discontinued at this time. Many design concepts for new kiddles and several new series were killed and never made it to production. Mattel records from the time were painstakingly researched by Paris Langford for the creation of her Liddle Kiddles value guide released in 1996. In this amazing and extensive book Paris included original concept art and a section showing pictures of prototype dolls that actually were under way at the time that Mattel killed the line. Especially interesting were the new concepts for fresh Jewelry Kiddle series, some dressed as bumble bees or tiny mermaids. The Bigger Body dolls with wire skeletons had a series under way centered around Circus Performers. Many of these records have since been destroyed according to Mattel. Paris Langfords value guide now stands as one of the final records of these lost designs that never made it into production. Though the book is out of print, copies do surface on the secondary market and owning a copy enhances any Kiddle collection.

The females of the species give birth to live young. Conservation status The population of C. colosii is most likely slowly declining, but it is not under any major threat. The IUCN gives it Least Concern status because, although its range is less than 20,000 km2 (7,700 mi2), its habitat is extensive and is not severely threatened. Also, it is presumed to have a large population. Some possible threats to C. colosii include tourism and agricultural development. Geographic range C. colosii is found in Morocco, the Spanish exclaves Ceuta and Melilla, and the Spanish island Isla de Tierra (near Pe√±√≥n de Alhucemas), but is not very common in the western part of this range. Its general abundance is not well known, but it lives in semi-arid or sub-humid areas up to an altitude of .

Originally, of land was donated by Ethel Sturges Dummer for the creation of the state park in 1938. Another was donated by Commonwealth Edison in 1956, which again donated more land in 1989. The islands of Smith, Hoffman, Langham, and Willow are all located inside the park on the Kankakee River. History Before the arrival of Europeans, Native Americans occupied the Kankakee River valley in the area that is now the state park. This region was historically occupied by Illini and Miami Indians in the 1670s and 1680s. By 1685 the Miami were sufficiently numerous that the Kankakee River was called the River of the Miami. Kickapoo and Mascouten also frequented the river valley in the 18th century. By the 1770s, the Council of Three Fires‚Äîthe Chippewa, Ottawa and Potawatomi nations‚Äîdominated the area. The most extensive village was \\"Rock Village\\" or \\"Little Rock Village\\" inside the present-day park near the mouth of Rock Creek. In 1830 it was the site of the last great Indian Council. After 1832, the Potawatomi ceded all of their land along the Kankakee and Illinois rivers to the United States. Most Potawatomi left the area by the end of the decade, except for Chief Shaw-waw-nas-see, whose grave is commemorated by a boulder along the nature trail at Rock Creek. Noel Le Vasseur and other fur traders, including Hubbard Chabare and Francois Bourbonnais, traded with the Potawatomi along the Kankakee and Iroquois rivers in the 1820s. When the Potawatomi left the area in 1838, Le Vasseur persuaded a number of his fellow French Canadians to emigrate from Quebec to the Bourbonnais Township area. Because of his settlement efforts, he is called \\"the father of Kankakee.\\" The Kankakee & Iroquois Navigation Company - later known as the Kankakee Company - was chartered in 1847 to provide water power and a navigable waterway from the Illinois & Michigan Canal to Warner's Landing, along the site of the present- day Warner Bridge Road. The company failed shortly after the Wabash Railroad arrived in the 1880s. At the Chippewa Campground, hand-cut limestone pillars mark where a railway bridge was to have been built for the Decatur and State Line Railroad before financiers ran out of money. A major industry in the area in the 1890s was the Custer Bowery Amusement Park, which drew crowds from Chicago. The park was gone by the 1920s, and the river was a popular for summer cottages. In 1938 Chicago resident Ethel Sturges Dummer donated of land for a state park. Commonwealth Edison turned over another to the state in 1956. With the company's additional grants in 1989, the park now roughly totals .  Camping  There are camping facilities located inside the park. Potawatomi Campground, offers Class A amenities with 110 sites and two Rent-a- Cabins in a wooded setting. The Chippewa Campground, offers 105 sites with Class B electric and C facilities. Reservations are taken for Kankakee River Class A, B, and C campgrounds. All campsites share a picnic table and a camp grill. Camping is only allowed in the campgrounds. The Equestrian Campground off Illinois Route 113 is open only from April 1 through October 31.basis  Hiking  There are plenty of hiking trails throughout the park that go through different ecosystems and different park features. While some go along the Kankakee River, with places to sit along the river, others go into the forests or along Rock Creek, a tributary of the Kankakee River that cuts through the ground, creating a gorge with cliffs. The trails are very diverse. The site is very good for mushroom hunting. The park's trails stretch along both sides of the river. Hiking, biking and cross-country ski trails are on the river's north side. Horse and snowmobile trails can be found on the south. A route along Rock Creek lets hikers take in the beauty of limestone canyons and a waterfall. A bicycle trail begins at Davis Creek Area and travels of trails in the form of a linear trail along the river and a loop in the west end of the park. When there's snow cover of or more, the park is open from sunrise to sunset for snowmobiling. Directional signs for trails are posted and maps are available at the park office.  Horseback Riding  There is horseback riding at the park. A equestrian trail is located in the wildlife management area along Route 113 and is open April 1 through October 31.  Fishing  Fishing at Kankakee River State Park provides opportunities for anglers to access the Kankakee River or Rock Creek, a freestone-bottom tributary of the Kankakee River. Access to commonly targeted fish species, like bass or bluegill is available year round. Fishing by bait, spin fishing, and fly-fishing at Kankakee River State Park are popular methods. Twice a year, the Illinois DNR runs a trout stocking program, releasing fish in various lakes and ponds in the spring and fall. Prior to the official trout season opening day, a catch-and-release only period is offered to anglers looking to get an early access to the stocked trout.  Concessions  There is a concession stand at Rock Creek which operates on a seasonal basis. The store offers refreshments, ice, camping supplies, firewood, and bait.

Early life Erdenebaatar was the son of Khara Khula who was taishi (in modern Mongolian:—Ç–∞–π–∂, taij, meaning \\"nobleman\\") of the dominant Choros tribe and the leader of the allied Four Oirat, collectively known as \\"Dzungars.\\" After the death of his father in 1634, Erdeni Batur assumed his father's position and carried on his father's objective of unifying the Oirat tribes into a formal confederation with himself as the supreme military and political ruler. Upon becoming ruler of the Dzungars, Erdeni Batur sought to consolidate his position around the Tarbagatai Mountains, the land his people roamed. In so doing, Erdeni Batur led the Dzungars to several victorious military campaigns over the Kazakhs to his west. To the north in southern Siberia, Erdeni Batur gave Russia access to salt mines, thereby ending a 20-year conflict, in exchange for diplomatic and trade relations. The commercial ties, which remained intact throughout his rule, and the prosperity generated by such ties with Russian outposts further solidified Erdeni Batur's prestige and position among the Oirats and the leaders of the adjacent nations. Consolidation of power Within the Khanate, Erdenebaatar set out on an ambition campaign of empire building activities. For instance, he established a capital city called Kubakserai south of Lake Zaisan on the Imil River, near the modern city of Tacheng, and built monasteries throughout Dzungar territory. He also promoted Buddhism to his subjects, and encouraged them to resettle to the new capital and to engage in both agriculture and small-scale manufacturing, like masonry and metal crafting. Like his father, Erdenebaatar sought to build the Khanate's power and independence to be able to wage war against the Qing Dynasty of China for control over territory. His attempts to monopolize power among the Oirat tribes, however, was only partially successful. The dissension and skirmishes, for example, compelled G√ºshi Khan and his brother, Kundelung Ubasha, to move a substantial part of the Khoshut-Oirat tribe from the Lake Zaisan area to the area around Qinghai Lake - what the Chinese called Qinghai and the Tibetans called Amdo - in 1636, where they soon would establish the Khoshut Khanate and transform Tibet into a Qing protectorate. But the unity Erdeni Batur created among the remaining Oirat tribes, viz., Choros, D√∂rbet and Khoit tribes, further strengthened his power and his resolve to establish the Dzungar Khanate as the preeminent power in Central Asia. The Fifth Dalai Lama took note of the rising power and influence of the Dzungar Khanate and granted Erdeni Batur the title, \\"Khong Tayiji\\" (known in Chinese as Hong Taiji, or crown prince) for military support he provided G√ºshi Khan to topple the enemies of the Gelug sect. Moreover, by granting this title, the Fifth Dalai Lama had hoped to have another ally protecting and promoting his Gelug lineage above the others. Diplomacy with Mongols His increased stature and the wide recognition the Dzungar Khanate received as a great power among Central Asian nomads led Erdenebaatar to call for a pan-Mongolian alliance in 1640. The entente took place inside Dzungar territory at a place called Ulan Buraa, near the Tarbagatai Mountains on the border between what is now the Xinjiang province of China and Kyrgyzstan. The ruling princes of all Mongolian tribes were present at the entente, except for the Mongol tribes of Inner Mongolia, who recently joined the Qing. One of the purposes for the entente was to form a pan-Mongol coalition against all potential external enemies, such as the Kazakhs and the newly emerging Qing state. The second yet equally important purpose was to devise a method by which disputes could be resolved short of war. To that end, a legal code was drafted, establishing a system of rules that governed the daily activities of all Mongols from the Volga River in southeastern Russia to present-day eastern Mongolia. These set of laws are called the \\"Great Code of the Forty and the Four\\" (D√∂chin D√∂rben Hoyar un Ike Tsagaza) known as the Khalkha-Oirat Law. Decline and death The attempt to institute a pan-Mongol coalition, however, failed. The Khalkha Mongol princes were upset that Erdeni Batur assumed the leadership role, while they still claimed that, as the direct descendants of Genghis Khan, they were the rightful leaders of the Mongols. Basically, the Khalkha Mongol princes did not want to lose their sovereignty to someone who could not make that claim, even though their power and influence was in decline, while the fortunes of the Dzungar Khanate were rising. Nonetheless, Erdeni Batur did succeed in instituting a standard code of laws and in making Buddhism the official religion throughout the Mongol realm. After the entente, Erdenebaatar continued to consolidate his power, preparing the Dzungar Khanate for its attack upon the Qing for control over Central Asia. Upon his death in 1653, Erdeni Batur was succeeded by his third son, Sengge. References *Bawden, Charles R. The Modern History OF Mongolia, The Praeger Asia-Africa Series, Frederick A.

It was released in 2003 through Megan Tingley Books by Poppy.  Plot summary  The A-List follows the character of Anna Percy, who has been raised in New York City's Upper East Side. Anna has grown up living a life of privilege and many rules, which she somewhat jokingly refers to as \\"This is How We Do Things Big Book, East Coast WASP Edition\\". Anna moves out to Los Angeles with her father in the hopes of getting an internship in the entertainment industry as well as to reinvent herself in a new environment. While traveling to LA, Anna meets the handsome Ben Birnbaum, with whom she has an immediate connection. Ben chases away Anna's awful seatmate, Rick Resnick, and invites her to the wedding of A-lister Jackson Sharpe, which she accepts. Once Anna arrives in LA, she is upset that her father stood her up at the airport in order to indulge in marijuana, but Jonathan insists that he has changed and wants to have a better relationship with his daughter. Anna is not entirely convinced, because even though her father now wears jeans and appears more laid back, his new girlfriend Margaret Cunningham is a dead ringer for Anna's mother, Jane Percy. Later at the wedding, Anna meets Samantha \\"Sam Sharpe, the witty daughter of Jackson Sharpe who is insecure about her looks; Camilla \\"Cammie\\" Sheppard, the sexiest and most devious girl alive who is Ben's ex-girlfriend and wants him back; and Delia \\"Dee\\" Young, a spacey but sweet girl who secretly hooked up with Ben when she was on a college tour at Princeton. All of them are Ben's three closest female friends, who are all secretly in love with him. Ben and Anna try to pretend they've been dating at Princeton but Rick Resnick was also invited at the wedding and exposes how the two truly met. The three girls spend the rest of the night cutting down Anna or trying to steal Ben away from her, culminating in Cammie ripping Anna's dress. Sam gets soundly rejected, and goes to cry in the bathroom where Anna is freshening up. Sam apologizes for mistreating her and the two bond. Sam invites Anna to attend a Warner Brothers New Year's Eve bash after the wedding. A jealous Cammie attempts to break up Anna and Ben by convincing a big producer that Anna is a hooker so he will hit on her, but it backfires. After the party Cammie goes to her mother's grave to confess how much she really loves Ben and wants him back while Sam and a group of partiers goes to her father's house to get drunk, and Ben and Anna go to his father's boat to have sex. However, Anna changes her mind and admits to Ben that she is not ready. Ben appears to be understanding but he deserts Anna when she falls asleep. During a charity project with Sam, Cammie, Dee and their other friends, Anna gets food poisoning from an expired yogurt she'd eaten earlier in the day. Dee takes Anna home and while caring for Anna, Dee confesses that people look down on her because of her short stature and her spirituality. Dee also confesses that she believes that she's pregnant with Ben's baby, which shocks Anna and makes her wonder what kind of person Ben truly is. At the end of the book, Anna's internship has fallen through due to Margaret Cunningham leaving her company to start her own agency Apex so Anna is forced to enroll at Beverly Hills High. She has also broken up with Ben and refuses to take his calls but Sam and Dee show genuine interest in becoming friends with Anna, Cammie begins to feel threatened. Reception Critical reception for The A-List has been mixed. Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"fast-paced but uninspired\\", saying that \\"teens will get the thrill of seeing how the super- rich live, coupled with the heartening insight that money doesn't guarantee happiness\\".The A-List Kirkus Reviews The School Library Journal wrote that \\"Fans of the series will flock to this book, but they may be a tad disappointed with the replay.\\"The A-List School Library Journal References Category:2003 American novels Category:Novels set in Los Angeles ","title":"The A-List (novel)"},{"id":"10587567","text":"Peter Stamm (Geneva, 2012) Peter Stamm (born 18 January 1963 in M√ºnsterlingen) is a Swiss writer.

Both have finely wrought detail on them. The scene is lit by ambient light from the right. Bracket for a shelf or hanging items A bracket is an architectural element: a structural or decorative member. It can be made of wood, stone, plaster, metal, or other media. It projects from a wall, usually to carry weight and sometimes to \\"...strengthen an angle\\". A corbel or console are types of brackets.Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0). Oxford University Press; 2009 In mechanical engineering a bracket is any intermediate component for fixing one part to another, usually larger, part. What makes a bracket a bracket is that it is intermediate between the two and fixes the one to the other. Brackets vary widely in shape, but a prototypical bracket is the L-shaped metal piece that attaches a shelf (the smaller component) to a wall (the larger component): its vertical arm is fixed to one (usually large) element, and its horizontal arm protrudes outwards and holds another (usually small) element. This shelf bracket is effectively the same as the architectural bracket: a vertical arm mounted on the wall, and a horizontal arm projecting outwards for another element to be attached on top of it or below it. To enable the outstretched arm to support a greater weight, a bracket will often have a third arm running diagonally between the horizontal and vertical arms, or the bracket may be a solid triangle. By extension almost any object that performs this function of attaching one part to another (usually larger) component is also called a bracket, even though it may not be obviously L-shaped. Common examples that are often not really L-shaped at all but attach a smaller component to a larger and are still called brackets are the components that attach a bicycle lamp to a bicycle, and the rings that attach pipes to walls. Uses Brackets are used in traditional timber framing, including the support of a jettied floor which can be carved. Magdalene Street, Cambridge, England. Sixteenth century Brackets can support many architectural items, including a wall, balcony, parapets, eaves, the spring of an arch, beams, pergola roof, window box, or a shelf. The term is also used to describe a shelf designed to hold a statue. In adjustable shelving systems, the bracket may be in two parts, with the load-bearing horizontal support fitting into a wall-mounted slotted vertical metal strip. Brackets also are an element in the systems used to mount modern facade cladding systems onto the outside of contemporary buildings, as well as interior panels. ;Architectural sculptures Brackets are often in the form of architectural sculptures with reliefs of objects and scrolls. Depending on their material, decorated ones can be carved, cast, or molded. They can be of cast stone or resin-foam materials with faux finishes for use on new buildings in historic revival styles of architecture. Some brackets and corbels are only ornamental, and serve no actual supporting purpose.

In the 2006 census, 7,035 people claimed affiliation to the iwi. However, most members now live outside the traditional areas of the iwi. History =Early history= Ruanui is acknowledged as the eponymous ancestor of the iwi. He was the son of Uenuku-puanake and TƒÅneroroa. Uenuku came from the TƒÅkitimu canoe (although this is contested among Matauranga Maori historians), while TƒÅneroroa was the daughter of Turi, who came to New Zealand on the Aotea canoe. Turi originally landed in Aotea Harbour, but eventually settled along the PƒÅtea River. Over time, Ruanui‚Äôs descendants spread across south Taranaki. =Musket Wars= NgƒÅti Ruanui was heavily involved in tribal wars during the 19th century. In 1816, the iwi was invaded from the north by Nga Puhi warriors carrying muskets. Over the next few decades, Ngati Ruanui would come under attack by NgƒÅti Toa, NgƒÅti WhƒÅtua and the Waikato tribes. NgƒÅti Ruanui had no defence against the invaders armed with muskets, and many NgƒÅti Ruanui people were captured as slaves. Others were simply displaced by continuing warfare. =Early social development= Even amidst tribal warfare, NgƒÅti Ruanui managed to build a successful society. Agriculture provided a stable economy. NgƒÅti Ruanui workers were employed as labourers in New Plymouth. Education and Christianity were eagerly embraced. =New Zealand Wars= NgƒÅti Ruanui were wary of European settlers and their desire for more land. In 1860, when Te ƒÄti Awa engaged in battle with the British Crown, NgƒÅti Ruanui sent fighters to support them. In retaliation, in 1865 and 1866 Crown troops invaded south Taranaki, destroying fortifications and villages. In 1868, notable resistance was provided by the tribal leader Tƒ´tokowaru against Crown troops approaching from the south. Amongst New Plymouth settlers the iwi was known as 'Ngati Ruin-Ruin Us' for the effectiveness of their attacks.James Belich, The New Zealand Wars and the Victorian Interpretation of Racial Conflict But within a few years, NgƒÅti Ruanui had lost most of its land, displacing more MƒÅori from their traditional lands. NgƒÅti Ruanui today =Deed of Settlement= In 1996, the Waitangi Tribunal determined that the Crown had acted unfairly in its conflict with NgƒÅti Ruanui. A settlement between the New Zealand Government and NgƒÅti Ruanui was reached in 2001, which was passed into law in 2003. In summary: *The New Zealand Government issued a formal apology to NgƒÅti Ruanui for the actions of Crown troops during the Taranaki Wars, and for subsequent land confiscation *The Government acknowledged cultural association of NgƒÅti Ruanui with geographical areas in Taranaki, and will consult with the iwi regarding relevant uses within designated areas *Four areas of significance to NgƒÅti Ruanui, totalling approximately 10 hectares, were returned to the iwi. =Administration= Te R≈´nanga o NgƒÅti Ruanui is the governing body of the iwi.

De Geer introduced the Walloon method to Sweden. Oregrounds iron was a grade of iron that was regarded as the best grade available in 18th century England. The term was derived from the small Swedish city of √ñregrund, the port from which the bar iron was shipped. It was produced using the Walloon process. Oregrounds iron is the equivalent of the Swedish vallonj√§rn, which literally translates as Walloon iron. The Swedish name derives from the iron being produced by the Walloon version of the finery forge process, the Walloon processAwty, Brian G. 'The Development and Dissemination of the Walloon Method of Ironworking' in Technology and Culture - Volume 48, Number 4, October 2007, pp. 783-803 The Development and Dissemination of the Walloon Method of Ironworking as opposed to the German method, which was more common in Sweden. Actually, the term is more specialised, as all the Swedish Walloon forges made iron from ore ultimately derived from the Dannemora mine. It was made in about 20 forges mainly in Uppland. Many of the ironworks were founded by Louis de Geer and other Dutch entrepreneurs who set up ironworks in Sweden in the 1610s and 1620s, with blast furnaces and finery forges. Most of the early forgemen were also from Wallonia.HUGUENOTS-WALLOONS-EUROPE-L Archives Origins in Wallonia The technique was developed in Wallonia in present-day Belgium during the Middle Ages. The Walloon method Awty, Brian G. 'The Development and Dissemination of the Walloon Method of Ironworking' Technology and Culture Volume 48, Number 4, October 2007, pp. 783-803 consisted of making pig iron in a blast furnace, followed by refining it in a finery forge. The process was devised in the Li√®ge region, and spreadAllan H.

King, 'The Cartel in Oregrounds Iron: trading relationships in the raw material for steel' Journal of Industrial History 6(1) (2003), 25-48.

In Britain, the iron was known by these 'marks', and the quality of each brand was well-known to the buyers in London, Sheffield, Birmingham and elsewhere. It was divided into two grades: * 'First oregrounds' came from √ñsterby ('double bullet'), Leufsta (now L√∂vsta - hoop L), and √Ökerby (PL crown). Later Gimo joined them. * 'Second oregrounds' came from the other forges, including Forsmark, Harg, Vattholma, and Ullfors. Its special property was its purity. The manganese content of the Dannemora ore caused impurities, which would otherwise have remained in the iron, to react preferentially with the manganese and to be carried off into the slag. This level of purity meant that the iron was particularly suitable for conversion to steel by being re- carburized, using the cementation process. This made it particularly suitable for making steel, oregrounds iron was an indispensable raw material for metal manufactures, particularly the Sheffield cutlery industry. Substantial quantities were also (until about 1808) bought for use by the British Navy. This and other uses absorbed substantially the whole output of the industry. The trade in oregrounds iron was controlled from the 1730s to the 1850s by a cartel of merchants, of whom the longest enduring members were the Sykes family of Hull. Other participants were resident in (or controlling imports through) London and Bristol. These merchants advanced money to Swedish exporting houses, which in turn advanced it to the ironmasters, thus buying up the output of the forges several years in advance. References *K. C.

The network is the primary affiliate of the Seven Network in the areas it serves. History =Origins= The Southern Cross brand was first used in 1982 by a small network of three stations in regional Victoria. The then Victorian Broadcasting Network comprised GLV-8 Gippsland, BCV-8 Bendigo, and STV-8 Mildura. GLV was the first regional television station in the country, launched on 9 December 1961. BCV-8 launched in the same year, on 23 December, while STV followed four years later, on 27 November 1965. GLV-10 moved to VHF-8 in 1980, when Melbourne commercial station ATV-0 moved to VHF-10 The network rebranded in 1982 as Southern Cross TV8, but later changed its name in 1989 to the Southern Cross Network. Soon after this, STV-8 left the network after it was bought by businessman Alan Bond, and eventually sold on to ENT Limited (owners of Television Victoria and Tas TV). This network began as a \\"cherry picking\\" network, taking programs from all three metropolitan commercial networks at the time. At aggregation, it became an affiliate of Network Ten. =1960s to the 1970s= Tasmanian television station TNT-9 commenced broadcasting at 5:57 pm on 26 May 1962. Fred Archer was the first person to appear on the station, during its first five hours of transmission. On the opening night the station was officially inaugurated by Lord Rowallan, the Governor of Tasmania. The Mickey Mouse Club was the first programme to be broadcast, and advertisements included: Abbott's cordial, Hydro, Launceston Bank for Savings, Peters Ice Cream, Hicks Atkinson and the Saturday Evening Express. GTS/BKN began transmissions as a solus commercial television service by Spencer Gulf Telecasters in the upper Spencer Gulf in 1968, with Port Lincoln and Broken Hill commencing in 1970 and 1974 respectively. =1980s to the 1990s= TNT-9‚Äôs customised Nine Network logo before Southern Cross acquired it On 13 May 1989, TNT-9 was sold by ENT Ltd. to Southern Cross Broadcasting and was integrated into the Southern Cross network. Tasmania was aggregated on 30 April 1994, albeit with only two stations ‚Äì Southern Cross became a dual Seven and Ten affiliate, while TAS TV took programming from the Nine Network. Both stations commenced statewide transmission from this time. Remote Central and Eastern Australia were the final areas to be aggregated ‚Äì one of the largest geographical licence areas, taking in parts of the Northern Territory, western Queensland, and other areas in which terrestrial television signals cannot be received. Stations broadcast to this area mainly through satellite or re-transmission stations. Imparja Television, based in Alice Springs, became a dual Nine and Ten affiliate, while Seven Central became a Seven affiliate. =2000s and 2010s= Southern Cross Broadcasting purchased Spencer Gulf Telecasters in April 2002. In 2002, Southern Cross Broadcasting and WIN Corporation joined forces to create Tasmanian Digital Television, which launched in late 2003. TDT was a sole Network Ten affiliate. Southern Cross operates the transmission of the station. In 2003, Seven Darwin and Seven Central were purchased by Southern Cross Broadcasting, retaining their sole Seven Network affiliation. On 31 December 2003, Network Ten programming was broadcast for the first time to the Upper Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill broadcast areas via SGS/SCN. In May 2005, the service was integrated into the Southern Cross network. On 3 December 2004, presentation was centralised to Southern Cross Broadcasting's play-out centre in Canberra. In May 2005, the service in Darwin was integrated into the Southern Cross network, losing its generic Seven on-air presentation. This coincided with Southern Cross Darwin commencing dual affiliations with both Seven Network and Network Ten programming. In 2007, a joint venture station owned by Southern Cross Broadcasting and PBL Media, the owners of NTD-8 Darwin, was announced. The station, named Darwin Digital Television, began broadcasting on 28 April 2008. It is a digital-only Network Ten affiliate, similar to other digital only joint venture channels introduced in Australia. On 3 July 2007 Southern Cross Television's parent company, Southern Cross Broadcasting, recommended Macquarie Media Group's offer of A$1.35 billion, for a takeover of the corporation. On 5 November 2007, the network was officially purchased by the Macquarie Media Group. In early 2009, Southern Cross Tasmania dropped all of its remaining Network Ten programming, except for AFL telecasts, as it has gradually dropped other programming since 2004 when TDT was launched, which broadcast all Network Ten programming. It is now affiliated only with Seven and broadcasts all of its programming. On 14 March 2017, a HD simulcast was announced for launch on 22 March 2017, specifically for the Tasmanian station. From 1 July 2018, all local branding was phased out on all of the company's Seven-affiliated stations in favour of a generic Seven Network branding. Though news services offered by Southern Cross were also scheduled to be rebranded as Seven News on this date, the rebrand has been delayed until further notice, citing concerns from Seven about using their news brand but not under their editorial control. On 3 December 2018, the Tasmanian station's news bulletin changed its title to Nightly News, followed on 14 January 2019 by GTS/BKN's bulletin. News As the following stations are affiliate broadcasters of the Seven Network the following Seven News national programs are aired on these stations: * Seven Early News * Sunrise (Weekdays) & Weekend Sunrise * Seven Morning News * Seven News at 4 (Seven Afternoon News) * Seven News at 5 * Sunday Night For regional news, TNT in Tasmania have their daily bulletins produced from the station's Launceston studios, while the local news bulletins on GTS/BKN serving the Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill areas, as well as shared news summaries broadcast on ITQ/QQQ serving remote areas and TND in Darwin, have their programs produced from Southern Cross Austereo's studio in Hobart. Programming =Local programming= Although, in the past, various birthday specials, telethons and locally produced TV shows have been aired. Quiz Quest (children's game show), The Saturday Night Show (variety), Down The Line (morning talk/local events), Targa Tasmania (annually), The Saturday Morning Fun Show (kids), Tasmanian New Faces (talent), Launceston Cup (OB) and so on. Hook, Line and Sinker Hook, Line and Sinker is a fishing show hosted by former news journalists Andrew Hart and Nick Duigan. Renovation Relief Renovation Relief is a DIY program hosted by famous wood-chopper David Foster in which he and a team of people from sponsors (i.e. Gunns) renovate a house, most commonly for people who have done something for the community or have disabled children. Renovation Relief is not airing at this time. Targa Tasmania For the two weeks in which Targa Tasmania runs, each night Andrew Hart and Nick Duigan share the events of the day in Targa Torque, this usually airs at around 10.30 pm. Holiday at Home Holiday at Home is a lifestyle programme which promotes places to stay at and things to do in Tasmania. Discover Tasmania This show was produced by Southern Cross but was hosted by Seven Network personalities Ed Halmagyi and Tim Campbell and a mention was made about the Seven Network broadcast centre model in the village of Lower Crackpot in the Tasmazia maze complex. It is similar to Holiday at Home except featured more famous attractions and was arguably better quality television. The second season saw Tim Campbell being replaced by Jack Campbell as host because Tim Campbell had moved to the Nine Network. Homes of Tasmania Homes of Tasmania is screened each year showcasing the year's award-winning homes. It is hosted by Nick Duigan and Andrew Hart, like Hook Line and Sinker. Going Bush This was the third show hosted by Nick Duigan and Andrew Hart. It was a five-part series screening on Sunday mornings and later afternoons, about Tasmanian bushland and related topics, and co-produced with Forestry Tasmania. There have been two seasons. Burnie Ten ‚Äì Ten Week Challenge For the ten weeks leading up to the Burnie Ten Mark Connelly trains a group of people in a program sponsored by Southern Cross. Each week there are updates given during ad- breaks. In the early years of the programme, people who took part were well known in Tasmania. However, in 2006 a Launceston family were trained to run the event. =Locally= Southern Cross Community Connect A service provided to the community to promote community based events. The Scope A service that informs the viewer what is on in the area. AFL NT Live Coverage Seven Darwin broadcasts live coverage of the AFL NT season on sister channel 7TWO on weekends. Availability Southern Cross-owned Seven affiliates are available in standard definition digital format. The network is available primarily through free-to-air terrestrial transmitters, with satellite transmissions available in Remote Central and Eastern Australia. The network's owned-and-operated stations include, TNT Tasmania, TND Darwin, GTS Spencer Gulf, BKN Broken Hill, ITQ Mount Isa, and QQQ Central Australia. =High definition= Southern Cross HD's logo Southern Cross launched a high definition simulcast of its main channel via TNT Tasmania in June 2009 on digital channel 60, following a period of looped HD test broadcasts. TND Darwin also provided a high definition simulcast of its main channel, on digital channel 70. Both services were replaced by 7mate on each station's respective HD channel when it launched in all Southern Cross areas on 24 October 2010; the launch of 7mate was delayed due to technical difficulties and the use of HD for coverage of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. In March 2017, Southern Cross announced that it would be launching a high definition simulcast of its main channel, Southern Cross HD in Tasmania on digital channel 60, in time for the first match of the 2017 AFL season later that month. Although SCHD launched in Tasmania on 22 March 2017 (whilst downgrading 7mate to standard definition on digital channel 63), it only began broadcasting Channel 7 programming in native high definition from 19 June 2018. On 26 November 2018, the HD service launched in Darwin.https://www.facebook.com/Nortechcommunications/photos/a.715647841870152/1617606795007581/?type=3 Logos Southern Cross's first networked logo produced and used across its regional stations, featured a blue rounded square with the Southern Cross constellation in white. This logo was used on TNT and GLV/BCV until 1993, when GLV/BCV adopted an original logo. TNT retained the logo until 2000, when a new logo was introduced featuring an orange Tasmanian tiger above the word Southern Cross. In 2005, a new logo was produced and used across the network, this time to a blue and red star. This logo has been used since, and was launched concurrently with similarly designed logos across Southern Cross's television assets. The Seven Network brand has partially appeared through the later years and the stations were fully rebranded to a full generic network branding on 1 July 2018.

Originally it was used in drilling soldiers. Each soldier stepped on the point just vacated by the foot of the soldier in front of him. Thus the soldiers stayed in position to form close files. Lockstep marching was a characteristic trait of American prisons of the 19th century.\\"The Oxford History of the Prison: The Practice of Punishment in Western Society\\", Oxford University Press, USA; Hardcover (November 1995) ; Reprint edition (October 27, 1997) \\"Inmates formed in single file, right hand on the shoulder of the man in front, left hand on the side; the convicts then stepped off in unison, raising the right foot high and shuffling with the left.\\"Harvey R.

In the Auburn Prison, John Cray developed the following form of the lockstep, as part of the penal system that has become known as the Auburn system, developed in the 1820s: \\"The lockstep was a method of walking where each man walked with his arms locked under the man's arms in front of him\\". This system was devised to keep prisoners under control during mass marches of several hundred prisoners from work places to mess, to cells, several times a day. Also, the inmates in lockstep were often required to alternate which side they were looking toward, to preclude communication.\\"Both Sides of the Wall: Auburn and Its Prison\\", The Citizen, April 10, 2003 on Pages D8, D9, and D15 The Auburn system, including its lockstep, was also adopted in Canada.\\"History of Parole in Canada\\" In some prisons, the inmates were divided into categories, with some of them walking in an ordinary military step, while lockstep was applied to others as a form of punishment. In Nazi Germany, members of the Hitler Youth were also made to march in lockstep.[Life and Death in the Third Reich, p. 99, Peter Fritsche] Along with striped robes and enforced silence, the prison lockstep was criticized as dehumanizing until it was abolished by the early 1900s.It was abolished gradually, by separate acts in different places: *Sing Sing: The prison lockstep was abolished in 1900 by the order of the Superintendent of State Prisons Cornelius Collins -- '\\"Sent up the river\\" - A History of the Sing Sing Correction Facility', DOCS Today, March 1998 *New Jersey: \\"During Mr. Osborne's tenure as warden of the New Jersey prison he abolished the lockstep,...\\" *Illinois: (1898-1903) \\"Changes to prisoner treatment also occurred during this period. The congregate movement of prisoners, the lockstep, was abolished,..\\" *Nevada: Raymond T.

Jonas, like most early Jews, settled in downtown Cincinnati. Jonas wrote letters describing the opportunities that existed in the Ohio River valley. This convinced other Jews to join him including two younger brothers. In 1821, Morris Moses and Jonas, two of Cincinnati's then six Jews, purchased a lot from Nicholas Longworth for $75.00, to found the Old Jewish Cemetery. By 1824 there were enough Jewish residents to fulfill the requirement of ten adult males so that regular religious services could be held, and the first Jewish congregation beyond the Allegheny Mountains was established.

The Galena- Platteville Aquifer's spring water in the area travels south from Platteville and Glenwood, Wisconsin through layers of rocks into northern Illinois. Native Americans inhabited the region prior to European settlement and they kept the trees burnt off the stone bluffs to keep their roots from splitting the rock.

Taft said the statue was inspired by the Sac leader Black Hawk, although it is not a likeness of the chief. Though never publicized at the time of construction, when funds were exhausted the park's namesake, Frank Lowden had stepped in to ensure the completion of Black Hawk was financially possible. The statue is deteriorating and has been wrapped for protection in the 2010 decade. Raising funds for the restoration and agreement on how to proceed with repairs are both at issue.

In 2017, he was accused of sexually abusing a four-year-old girl.David Usborne, \\"Florida's not-so-coy pastor is just the latest in a plague of fallen preachers\\", The Independent, 13 April 2014 His media ministry, which includes radio, television, and digital media, was subsequently terminated.  Biography  Coy was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, on November 27, 1955. At 21 years old, Coy got a job at Capitol Records in Detroit. \\"I was living the life of sex, drugs, and rock n roll, literally,\\" he said. Coy abused drugs and alcohol, and after multiple traffic tickets (some for driving under the influence), he lost his license. Soon after, at 24 years old, a band manager reported Coy offered drugs to a band member. Coy moved to Las Vegas and got a job in property management. He later became an entertainment director at a casino with an \\"All-Girl Revue.\\" This, according to Coy, \\"is another way of saying I ran a strip club.\\" Until 1981, Coy continued to live a life of sex and drugs. On the day after Christmas, his brother Jim (who had recently married and \\"got religion\\") let him crash in his living room after a wild party. Jim gave Bob a pillow, blanket, and Bible. Bob threw the Bible at Jim and said \\"Will you shut up with your Jesus stuff?\\" The Bible still on the floor, Jim and his wife went to bed. Bob says he couldn't sleep because the Bible was \\"calling out to him.\\" He opened it to the Gospel of John and began reading; when he got to verse 3:16, he began to weep uncontrollably. Jim and his wife entered the room and Jim announced: \\"God just woke me up and told me I'm supposed to pray for you.\\" Soon afterward, Coy quit his job at the casino and began working as an associate pastor at Calvary Chapel Las Vegas. In 1985, Coy and his wife Diane moved to South Florida, founding Calvary Chapel - Fort Lauderdale.  Resignation and scandals  In April 2014, Bob Coy resigned as the Senior Pastor and President of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale after admitting committing adultery and being addicted to pornography. Coy spent a year in Chattanooga, Tennessee in that city's Calvary Chapel to undergo a \\"restoration process\\", while the church board appointed Doug Sauder to take Coy's position as Senior Pastor. The Coys later divorced. He then went on to work as a consultant at The Funky Biscuit in Boca Raton, Florida. In November 2017 they terminated the relationship as a result of the child abuse allegations published in The Miami New Times. In November 2017, Coy was accused of molesting a child, beginning when she was four years old and continuing into her teenage years. Coy was fired from his consulting job at a South Florida nightclub, The Funky Biscuit.

Dietary factors are recognized as having a significant effect on the risk of cancers, with different dietary elements both increasing and reducing risk. Diet and obesity may be related to up to 30-35% of cancer deaths, while physical inactivity appears to be related to 7% risk of cancer occurrence. One review in 2011 suggested that total caloric intake influences cancer incidence and possibly progression. While many dietary recommendations have been proposed to reduce the risk of cancer, few have significant supporting scientific evidence. Obesity and drinking alcohol have been correlated with the incidence and progression of some cancers. Lowering the drinking of beverages sweetened with sugar is recommended as a measure to address obesity. A diet low in fruits and vegetables and high in red meat has been implicated but not confirmed, and the effect may be small for well-nourished people who maintain a healthy weight. Some specific foods are linked to specific cancers. Studies have linked eating red or processed meat to an increased risk of breast cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer, which may be partially explained by the presence of carcinogens in foods cooked at high temperatures. Aflatoxin B1, a frequent food contaminant, increases risk of liver cancer, while drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk. Betel nut chewing causes oral cancer. Stomach cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet. Immigrant communities tend to develop the risk of their new country, often within one generation, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer. Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention typically include weight management and eating \\"mainly vegetables, fruit, whole grains and fish, and a reduced intake of red meat, animal fat, and refined sugar.\\"  Types of diet  = Restrictive diets = A number of diets and diet-based regimes are claimed to be useful against cancer. Popular types of \\"anti-cancer\\" diets include the Breuss diet, Gerson therapy, the Budwig protocol and the macrobiotic diet. None of these diets has been found to be effective, and some of them have been found to be harmful. = Dietary patterns = Nutritional epidemiologists use multivariate statistics, such as principal components analysis and factor analysis, to measure how patterns of dietary behavior influence the risk of developing cancer. (The most well- studied dietary pattern is the mediterranean diet.) Based on their dietary pattern score, epidemiologists categorize people into quantiles. To estimate the influence of dietary behavior on risk of cancer, they measure the association between quantiles and the distribution of cancer prevalence (in case-control studies) and cancer incidence (in longitudinal studies). They usually include other variables in their statistical model to account for the other differences between people with and without cancer (confounders). For breast cancer, there is a replicated trend for women with a more \\"prudent or healthy\\" diet, i.e. higher in fruits and vegetables, to have a lower risk of cancer. A \\"drinker dietary pattern\\" is also associated with higher breast cancer risk, while the association is inconsistent between a more westernized diet and elevated risk of breast cancer. Pickled foods are linked with cancer.  Dietary components  =Alcohol= Alcohol is associated with an increased risk of a number of cancers. 3.6% of all cancer cases and 3.5% of cancer deaths worldwide are attributable to drinking of alcohol. Breast cancer in women is linked with alcohol intake. Alcohol also increases the risk of cancers of the mouth, esophagus, pharynx and larynx, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, stomach and ovaries. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (Centre International de Recherche sur le Cancer) of the World Health Organization has classified alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen. Its evaluation states, \\"There is sufficient evidence for the carcinogenicity of alcoholic beverages in humans. ‚Ä¶Alcoholic beverages are carcinogenic to humans (Group 1).\\" =Processed and red meat= On October 26, 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization reported that eating processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) or red meat was linked to some cancers. = Fiber, fruits and vegetables = The evidence on the effect of dietary fiber on the risk of colon cancer is mixed with some types of evidence showing a benefit and others not. While eating fruit and vegetables has a benefit, it has less benefit on reducing cancer than once thought. Soy is rich in phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogens have weak estrogenic effects, but are naturally occurring compounds. Olsen, N, \\"Cancer and Food\\" BetterHealth.vic.gov.au A 2014 study found fruit but not vegetables protected against upper gastrointestinal tract cancer. While fruit, vegetable and fiber protected against colorectal cancer and fiber protected against liver cancer. = Flavonoids = Flavonoids (specifically flavonoids such as the catechins) are \\"the most common group of polyphenolic compounds in the human diet and are found ubiquitously in plants.\\" While some studies have suggested flavonoids may have a role in cancer prevention, others have been inconclusive or suggested they may be harmful. =Mushrooms= According to Cancer Research UK, \\"there is currently no evidence that any type of mushroom or mushroom extract can prevent or cure cancer\\", although research into some species continues. =Other= *According to the American Cancer Society, there is no conclusive evidence for an anticancer effect of consuming soy products. *Green tea consumption has no effect on cancer risk. *A 2016 meta-analysis showed that women and men who drank coffee had a lower risk of liver cancer. An umbrella review of meta-analyses found that coffee was associated with a lower risk of liver and endometrial cancer. *A 2014 systematic review found, \\"no firm evidence that vitamin D supplementation affects cancer occurrence in predominantly elderly community-dwelling women.\\" Mechanisms of action =Methionine metabolism= The methionine metabolism pathway. DHF, dihydrofolate; dSAM, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine; hCys, homocysteine; ME, methyl group; MetTR-1-P, 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate; MT, methyltransferase; MTA, methylthioadenosine; MTHF, methylenetetrahydrofolate; SAH, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; SUB, substrate. Although numerous cellular mechanisms are involved in food intake, many investigations over the past decades have pointed out defects in the methionine metabolic pathway as cause of carcinogenesis. For instance, deficiencies of the main dietary sources of methyl donors, methionine and choline, lead to the formation of liver cancer in rodents. Methionine is an essential amino acid that must be provided by dietary intake of proteins or methyl donors (choline and betaine found in beef, eggs and some vegetables). Assimilated methionine is transformed in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is a key metabolite for polyamine synthesis, e.g. spermidine, and cysteine formation (see the figure on the right). Methionine breakdown products are also recycled back into methionine by homocysteine remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). Vitamins B6, B12, folic acid and choline are essential cofactors for these reactions. SAM is the substrate for methylation reactions catalyzed by DNA, RNA and protein methyltransferases. Growth factor (GF) and steroid/retinoid activation of PRMT4. The products of these reactions are methylated DNA, RNA or proteins and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes. Therefore, SAM:SAH ratio directly regulates cellular methylation, whereas levels of vitamins B6, B12, folic acid and choline regulates indirectly the methylation state via the methionine metabolism cycle. A near ubiquitous feature of cancer is a maladaption of the methionine metabolic pathway in response to genetic or environmental conditions resulting in depletion of SAM and/or SAM-dependent methylation. Whether it is deficiency in enzymes such as methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, methionine-dependency of cancer cells, high levels of polyamine synthesis in cancer, or induction of cancer through a diet deprived of extrinsic methyl donors or enhanced in methylation inhibitors, tumor formation is strongly correlated with a decrease in levels of SAM in mice, rats and humans. According to a 2012 review, the effect of methionine restriction on cancer has yet to be studied directly in humans and \\"there is still insufficient knowledge to give reliable nutritional advice\\". Scientific Communications Media plays a large role in the science communication aspect of nutrition[9]. In 1996, on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs talk show, a guest claimed that processed meat from the USA could cause BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Oprah‚Äôs show was later sued by Texas beef farmers that claimed her show led to the drop in beef prices The science communication surrounding nutrition can be unreliable due to the fact there isn‚Äôt enough research that can give a valid conclusion to if certain foods cause cancer or notO'connor, Anahad, \\"More Evidence That Nutrition Studies Don't Always Add Up.‚Äù The New York Times.\\". This gives an opportunity for publishers to put misleading headlines like ‚ÄúHigher Carbohydrate Intake is Associated with Higher Risk of Total Mortality‚ÄùO'connor, Anahad, \\"More Evidence That Nutrition Studies Don't Always Add Up.‚Äù The New York Times.\\". Studies show that national TV broadcasts spend more time covering cancer related news stories than local TV stations. Additionally, local stations spend a significantly smaller amount of time talking about how one can prevent cancer. This is due to time and budget constraints rather than lack of interestLee, C; Long, M; Slater, M; Song,W.,\\"Comparing Local TV News with National TV News in Cancer Coverage: An Exploratory Content Analysis.‚Äù NCBI.nlm.nih.gov. The marketing of foods also plays a big role in food being linked to cancer as various companies and brands advertise their unhealthy food and drink causing people to develop brand loyalty.

The show usually consisted of an interview with the star of the game from the winning team, along with game highlights and scores of other games from that day. Sometimes two players were featured. As years went by and Kiner's workload decreased, the show was on less frequently, usually following home games on free television. Kiner developed a reputation for occasionally incorrectly stating the names of players being interviewed or in highlights. The show's theme music was Flag of Victory Polka, written by Alvino Rey under the name Ira Ironstrings. The show's name came from the close-in left field seats in Forbes Field where Kiner deposited many home runs during his Hall of Fame career as a Pirate slugger. They were originally known as \\"Greenberg's Gardens\\" for Kiner's precursor and mentor Hank Greenberg, but earned their new name after Greenberg's retirement and Kiner's meteoric rise to stardom. It measured 340 feet to left field. The temporary fence was removed in the 1950s to restore it to the original 365 feet.

The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of kidney failure in pets. Initially, the recalls were associated with the consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated corn gluten was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply. By the end of March, veterinary organizations reported more than 100 pet deaths among nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, with one online database self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of several thousand cats and dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part because there is no centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States, as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). As a result, many sources speculate the actual number of affected pets may never be known, and experts are concerned that the actual death toll could potentially reach into the thousands. Overall, several major companies have recalled more than 5300 pet food products, with most of the recalls coming from Menu Foods. The contamination was caused by melamine in the affected foods. The Chinese company behind the contaminated wheat gluten has initially denied any involvement in the contamination, but is cooperating with Chinese and American investigators. In the United States, there has been extensive media coverage of the recall. There has been widespread public outrage and calls for government regulation of pet foods, which had previously been self-regulated by pet food manufacturers. The United States Senate held an oversight hearing on the matter by 12 April. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing at least $42 million from the recall, even without taking into account reduced sales. The several waves of recalls, many issued late on Friday evenings possibly to avoid media coverage, and the events have caused distrust in some consumers. Reports of widespread and possibly intentional adulteration of Chinese animal feed with melamine have raised the issue of melamine contamination in the human food supply, both in China and abroad. On 27 April, the U.S. FDA subjected all vegetable proteins imported from China, intended for human or animal consumption, to detention without physical examination, including: wheat gluten, rice gluten, rice protein, rice protein concentrate, corn gluten, corn gluten meal, corn byproducts, soy protein, soy gluten, proteins (includes amino acids and protein hydrosylates), and mung bean protein. In a teleconference with reporters on 1 May, officials from the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture said between 2.5 and 3 million people in the United States had consumed chickens that had consumed feed containing contaminated vegetable protein from China. Current research has focused on the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in causing kidney failure. Reports that cyanuric acid may be an independently and potentially widely used adulterant in China have heightened concerns for both pet and human health. As of 7 May, United States food safety officials stated: \\"There is very low risk to human health from consuming meat from hogs and chickens known to have been fed animal feed supplemented with pet food scraps that contained melamine and melamine-related compounds\\" Recall history The first recalls were announced by Menu Foods late on Friday, 16 March 2007, for cat and dog food products in the United States. In the ensuing months, many additional recalls were announced by Menu and other companies as the recall expanded throughout North America and to Europe and South Africa. Menu Foods acknowledged receiving the first complaints of sick pets on 20 February 2007, and initiated the recall following unexpected deaths after a regularly scheduled internal \\"taste test\\". The recalls are related to contaminated vegetable proteins, imported from China in 2006 and early 2007, used as pet food ingredients. The process of identifying and accounting for the source of the contamination and how the contaminant causes sickness is ongoing. Affected brands :Note: The following list may not be complete. Please refer to the external links section for more resources. Pet food is a US$38 billion industry. The majority of recalled foods have come from a single company, Menu Foods of Streetsville, Ontario. Menu Foods' recalled products alone represent nearly 100 brands of cat and dog food, and as of 11 April, are the only brands known to have caused sickness in animals. Below is an overview of affected brands, as provided by the FDA and the companies: *Menu Foods: Over 50 brands of dog food, and over 40 brands of cat food. Almost all of the foods are wet foods, specifically the 'cuts and gravy' varieties. As a precautionary measure, Menu Foods also recalled all brands of food with wheat gluten in them even though the source of the gluten was not the same as the source behind the contaminated findings. *Sunshine Mills: Around 20 brands of dry dog biscuit *Nestl√© Purina PetCare: All sizes and varieties of Alpo \\"Prime Cuts in Gravy\\" *Del Monte: More than a dozen brands of dry, or jerky-type, cat and dog snacks and/or morsels *Hill's Pet Nutrition: Science Diet Savory Cuts and a single dry cat food product, \\"Prescription Diet m/d Feline\\" *Royal Canin Canada: Medi-Cal Feline Dissolution formula (canned) *Royal Canin United States: Eight varieties of Sensible Choice, three varieties of Veterinary Diet, six varieties of Kasco dog and one variety of Kasco cat food *Natural Balance Pet Foods: Venison and Brown Rice canned and bagged dog foods, Venison and Brown Rice dog treats, Venison and Green Pea dry cat food, Chicken Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz, Lamb Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz, Beef Formula Canned Dog Food 13 oz, and Ocean Fish Formula Canned Cat Food *The Blue Buffalo Company: Spa Select Kitten dry food, all canned and biscuit products *SmartPak: LiveSmart Weight Management Chicken and Brown Rice Dog Food *Chenango Valley Pet Foods: Doctors Foster & Smith Chicken and Brown Rice Formula Adult Lite Cat and Dog Foods; Doctors Foster & Smith Lamb and Brown Rice Formula Adult Dog Food; Lick Your Chops Lamb Meal, Rice and Egg Cat Food; Shop Rite Redi-Mixt Dog Food; SHEP chunk-style dog food; 8 in 1 Ferret Ultra- Blend Advanced nutrition Diet; Health Diet Cat Food Chicken and Rice Dinner; Evolve Kitten Formula; bulk Lamb and Brown Rice Formula Dog Food; and bulk Chicken and Brown Rice Formula Adult Lite Dog Food *Kirkland Signature: Super Premium Canned Food, item # 38436, best-by dates of \\"Aug. 21 08\\" to \\"15 April of 09\\" *Diamond Pet Foods: Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Kitten Formula 5.5 oz. cans, Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Puppy Formula 13 oz. cans, Diamond Lamb & Rice Formula for Dogs 13 oz. cans and Nutra Nuggets Lamb Meal and Rice Formula dry dog food The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) maintains a combined list of all recalled pet food varieties. Impact on pets =Numbers of affected animals= By the end of March, veterinary organizations reported more than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, and experts expected the death toll to number in the thousands, with one online database already self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of 11 April. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of approximately 8500 animal deaths, including at least 1950 cats and 2200 dogs who have died after eating contaminated food, but have only confirmed 14 cases, in part because there is no centralized government database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). For this reason, many sources speculate the full extent of the pet deaths and sicknesses caused by the contamination may never be known. In October, the results of the \\"AAVLD survey of pet food-induced nephrotoxicity in North America, April to June 2007,\\" were reported, indicating 347 of 486 cases voluntarily reported by 6 June 2007 had met the diagnostic criteria, with most of the cases reported from the United States, but also including cases of 20 dogs and 7 cats reported from Canada.The cases involved 235 cats and 112 dogs, with 61 percent of the cats and 74 percent of the dogs having died. Dr. Barbara Powers, AAVLD president and director of the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, said the survey probably found only a percentage of the actual cases. She also said the mortality rate is not likely to be representative of all cases, because survey respondents had more information to submit for animals that had died. A number of dogs were also reported affected in Australia, with four in Melbourne and a few more in Sydney. No legal action or repercussions have as yet occurred regarding these cases. Dr. Powers elaborated further: ‚ÄúBut there absolutely could be more deaths from the tainted pet food.... This survey didn‚Äôt catch all the deaths that happened. In order to be counted in our survey, you had to meet certain criteria.... If someone had a pet that died and they buried it in their back[yard], they weren‚Äôt eligible for our survey. We had to have confirmed exposure to the recalled pet food, proof of toxicity, and clinical signs of kidney failure. So this is only a percentage of the deaths that are out there. There‚Äôs no way to guess how many pets were affected.‚Äù In a potentially related incident in China, on 22 February 2006, Xinhua reported at least 38 cats dying shortly after being fed with Xiduoyu, a brand of a \\"Tianjin-based cat food manufacturer\\". A veterinarian referred to in the story said \\"test results from Beijing Animal Hospital showed the dead cats had suffered from kidney exhaustion and that the sick ones have kidney damage.\\" Suspicions at that time focused on lead poisoning though Gu Junhua, a chief engineer from China's \\"national feedstuff quality check centre under the Ministry of Agriculture\\", was reported as saying: \\"But at present, he said it was difficult to draw any conclusions because the country has not drafted any food safety criteria for pets in terms of the quality and quantity of each element of the ingredients.\\" No mention of melamine was made. =Symptoms= Pet owners were advised to monitor their animals for the following signs of possible kidney failure that may be associated with the unknown toxicant: loss of appetite, lethargy, depression, vomiting, diarrhea, sudden changes in water consumption, and changes in the frequency or amount of urination. It was advised that pets exhibiting these symptoms should be taken for veterinary care as soon as possible, even if the animal did not eat any of the recalled pet food, as these signs may be indicative of other illnesses. Ultrasounds of animals who have eaten the contaminated food in most cases show cortical echogenicity, perirenal fluid and pyelectasia. One of the largest veterinary hospital chains in the U.S., Banfield, has released statistics on the recent rates of pet kidney failure. Banfield's veterinarians treat an estimated 6 percent of the nation's cats and dogs, and their findings provide \\"the most authoritative picture of the harm done by the tainted cat and dog food,\\" according to the FDA. Based on analysis of data collected by more than 600 hospitals and clinics in 43 states, out of every 10,000 cats and dogs seen in Banfield clinics, three developed kidney failure during the time pet food contaminated with melamine was on the market. They reported 284 more cases of kidney failure in cats than the expected \\"background rate,\\" corresponding to a 30 percent increase. During that period, the Banfield vets saw 100,000 cats. According to Hugh Lewis, who analyzed the results for Banfield, extrapolating to the United States cat population may mean \\"several hundred cats a week across the country\\" were affected. No similar statistically significant increase was seen among dogs, suggesting the contamination was more toxic to cats. =Prevention of illness in pets= As of 4 May, the FDA advised: \\"If your pet food is not listed [as recalled on its website], the pet food is not affected by the recall and you can continue to feed it to your pets; however, if your pet exhibits a sudden onset of symptoms including loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, stop feeding the pet food and contact your veterinarian.\\" The growing number of recalls has motivated at least one well-known animal protection organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) to recommend \\"until this crisis is resolved ... pets be fed products containing U. S.-sourced protein supplements only.\\" =Food shortages in pet shelters= Many nonprofit pet shelters rely on donated foods to feed the animals and remain financially stable, but due to the wide use of wheat gluten and other contaminated ingredients in many wet pet foods and the large portion of foods represented in the recall, many pet shelters have had to discard foods despite the financial burden of doing so. Search for the cause of the illnesses Unable to locate the source of the kidney failure exhibited by test subjects that consumed some of their wet food products, Menu Foods sent food samples to Cornell University between 13 March and 15 March for chemical analysis. They too, were not immediately able to pinpoint the cause of the sicknesses, so they sent samples to the New York State Food Laboratory, a part of the federally funded Food Emergency Response Network. = Initial efforts focus on aminopterin = On 23 March, the New York State Food Laboratory reported that aminopterin was found in samples sent to them by Cornell. Michigan State University also investigated the source of the kidney failure and made available to researchers and veterinarians pictures and photographs of affected animal kidneys \\"demonstrating acute tubular necrosis in the kidney with intratubular crystals.\\" Aminopterin was widely described in news reports as a \\"rat poison\\", though that assertion may be based upon a hypothetical use listed in the 1951 patent application and not upon the actual use of the chemical. Aminopterin is illegal in China, and neither Cornell University nor the FDA could replicate the New York lab's results. On 27 March, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the symptoms described in affected animals are not \\"fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin.\\" = Later findings change focus to melamine = Sometime in mid-March, an \\"unnamed pet food company\\" reported to Cornell they had discovered an industrial chemical used in plastics manufacture, melamine, in internal testing of wheat gluten samples. By 21 March, it became clear the common factor was in the wheat gluten used to thicken the gravy in the \\"cuts and gravy\\" style wet foods. By 27 March, Cornell had confirmed the presence of melamine in the originally recalled pet foods, the wheat gluten used in their manufacture, the cells of the dead pets, and in the urine samples from dead and sick pets. On 30 March, both Cornell and the FDA announced the presence of melamine had been confirmed. The chemical was found in the suspected wheat gluten in raw concentrations as high as 6.6%. Stephen Sundlof, the FDA's chief veterinarian said, \\"There was a sizable amount of melamine. You could see crystals in the wheat gluten.\\" In addition to wheat gluten, products containing rice protein have also been contaminated with melamine. Natural Balance Pet Foods recalled two products on 16 April due to kidney damage associated with melamine contamination despite the products not containing wheat gluten. Melamine has also been implicated in corn gluten in South Africa. Despite the presence of the industrial chemical in both the food and in the animals, the FDA has made it clear they are still in the middle of an extensive investigation, and \\"not yet fully certain that melamine is the causative agent.\\" = Melamine and cyanuric acid in pet sickness = C3H6N6 -- 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine. Prior animal studies have shown ingestion of melamine may lead to kidney stones, cancer or reproductive damage.MSDSOSHA Figures - Chemical sampling information One 1945 study suggested the chemical increased urine output when fed to dogs in large amounts. The chemical is known to have a very low toxicity in rodents. The U.S. FDA knows of no studies of melamine involving felines and, if melamine is responsible, the increased sensitivity of cats is a mystery to officials. One hypothesis is the poisoned cat foods might have higher concentrations of melamine than the dog foods. Melamine can be detected in blood or urine tests. Stephen Sundlof, director of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, says \\"Melamine is not very toxic as a chemical, so we're wondering why we are seeing the kinds of serious conditions, especially the kidney failure, that we're seeing in cats and dogs... We are focusing on the melamine right now because we believe that, even if melamine is not the causative agent, it is somehow associated with the causative agent, so it serves as a marker\\". Even at the highest observed concentrations found in wheat gluten, the melamine exposure is much smaller than the rat and mouse doses for which effects were seen. Instead, the FDA has suggested a second contaminant may be responsible for the ill effects and melamine, as the most easily identifiable contaminant, may serve as a biomarker, or indicator, for contaminated wheat gluten. According to the FDA, \\"the association between melamine in the kidneys and urine of cats that died and melamine in the food they consumed is undeniable. Additionally, melamine is an ingredient that should not be in pet food at any level.\\" However, Richard Goldstein of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine has stated that \\"There appears to be other things in there, other than melamine, but identifying what they are is a long process.\\" Melamine (green) and cyanuric acid(red) easily form hydrogen bonds (blue dotted lines) with each other Researchers have focused on the role of melamine and related compounds in causing kidney failure. Beginning on 19 April, researchers reportedly had ruled out aminopterin contamination and had found a \\"spoke-like crystal\\" in contaminated wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate and the tissues and urine of affected animals. (It was previously known that melamine and cyanuric acid can form networks of hydrogen bonds, creating a tile-like planar structure through molecular self-assembly.)E.E. Simanek, X. Li, I.S. Choi, G.M. Whitesides, \\"Cyanuric Acid and Melamine: A Platform for the Construction of Soluble Aggregates and Crystalline Materials\\", Comprehensive supramolecular chemistry, J.L. Atwood ed., New York:Pergamon, Vol.9, 495 (1996). The crystal has been said to serve as a biomarker for contamination and is approximately 30% melamine. The remainder has been identified as cyanuric acid, ammelide and ammeline, with crystals recovered from urine reported to be approximately 70% cyanuric acid. While some researchers have theorized the three latter chemicals might have been formed as the animals metabolized the melamine, or as byproducts of bacterial metabolism (cyanuric acid is a known intermediate byproduct of bacterial metabolism of melamine), their presence in the crystals found in contaminated protein itself, combined with media reports of widespread adulteration with both melamine and cyanuric acid in China, has focused research efforts on their combined effects in animals. Neither melamine nor cyanuric acid, a chemical commonly used in pool chlorination, have been thought to be particularly toxic by themselves. The current hypothesis is, although these contaminants are not very toxic individually, their potency appears to be increased when they are present together. On 27 April, researchers from the University of Guelph, in Ontario announced they had created crystals chemically similar to the ones found in contaminated animals by combining melamine and cyanuric acid in the laboratory under pH conditions similar to those in animal kidneys. In light of these findings, on 1 May, the American Veterinary Medical Association noted in a press release the \\"extremely insoluble\\" crystals formed in animal kidneys are suspected of blocking kidney function. On 7 May, however, Barbara Powers, president of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and a professor of veterinary diagnostics at Colorado State University cautioned \\"There's something more going on than just the mechanical blockage. Because you wouldn't see so much necrosis (cell death) and inflammation.‚Äù On 2 May, in further inquiry into the source of the cyanuric acid in the contaminated ingredients and the toxic effects of the chemical combination, Richard Goldstein of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, in response to reports the contaminant might be \\"melamine scrap\\" left over from processing coal into melamine, hypothesized: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible the other stuff they were left with was the bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, leftover melamine and possibly cyanuric acid. I think it‚Äôs this melamine with other compounds that is toxic.‚Äù The composition of the crystals analyzed in contaminated pet food ingredients is similar to the composition of a waste product produced in cyanuric acid production.SM Lahalih, M Absi-Halabi, \\"Recovery of solids from melamine waste effluents and their conversion to useful products\\", Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, vol.28, 500-504 (1989). On 8 May 2007, the International Herald Tribune reported three Chinese chemical makers have said animal feed producers often purchase, or seek to purchase, the chemical, cyanuric acid, from their factories to blend into animal feed to give the false appearance of a higher level of protein, suggesting another potentially dangerous way that melamine and cyanuric acid might combine in protein products. A toxicology study conducted at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine after the recalls concluded the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in diet does lead to acute kidney injury in cats. Wilson Rumbeiha, an associate professor in MSU's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health, commenting on results from a survey commissioned by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and designed and implemented by MSU toxicologists which was also presented at the AAVLD's October 2007 meeting, said: \\"Unfortunately, these [melamine cyanurate] crystals don‚Äôt dissolve easily. They go away slowly, if at all, so there is the potential for chronic toxicity.‚Äù Alternative pet food sources Some pet owners have become concerned over the safety of all processed pet foods, and have chosen to forgo store-bought prepared pet foods in favor of preparing food from ingredients at home. The popularity of books on home preparation of pet foods has rocketed on Amazon.com. Some veterinarians have pointed out that animal diets are difficult to maintain in terms of nutritional appropriateness and safety, and are best served by store-bought preparations, an assertion disputed by some practitioners of home-made animal foods. Industry and government response American and Chinese authorities investigated the source of the contamination linked to pet deaths, and Chinese authorities closed down Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company and Binzhou Futian Biology Technology Co. Ltd., the two companies linked to the contaminated products. Litigation Many owners of pets stricken after consuming Menu Foods' product have considered filing lawsuits against the company, but are encountering difficulties with the valuation of the deceased pets. While many pet owners consider their pets to be a \\"part of the family,\\" lost pets have traditionally been treated as property, with the potential liability limited to the retail value of the animal. Some states define the monetary value of a pet for litigation or insurance purposes. Other states have allowed suits for punitive damages and emotional distress suffered in the loss of a pet. After word of the recall and reports of animal deaths began to spread, Menu Foods was served with several individual lawsuits over the deaths of affected pets. On 20 March, after the death of her cat, a woman in Chicago, Illinois sued Menu Foods for negligence in delaying the recall.http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070320/pet_food_recall.html?.v=1 The same day, lawyers for a Knoxville, Tennessee woman filed suit in Federal Court against Menu Foods for $25 million and hoping to attain class action status, citing negligence in testing the food prior to distribution. As individual lawsuits were filed across the nation, an Ontario, Oregon family filed a class-action lawsuit against Menu Foods, citing emotional damage and economic loss. The lawyers filing the federal lawsuit noted Washington state, which has jurisdiction, had a history of favorable consumer protection precedents in prior pet-related lawsuits, but finding a set value for the lost pets may be difficult. On 23 March, Menu Foods said they will reimburse pet owners who can trace their pets' illnesses to the company's products. One estimate is that the cost to owners of treating sickened pets is between $2 million and $20 million. By 5 April, the 20 March Chicago lawsuit expanded to federal class- action status, with over 200 plaintiffs seeking punitive damages for emotional distress. The plaintiffs have specifically accused Menu Foods of fraud, claiming the company may have known of a problem as early as December. Menu Foods faces 90 class-action lawsuits as a result of the contamination. U.S. District Court Judge Hillman has ordered Menu Foods to have no contact with plaintiffs unless their attorneys are involved in the discussion, after lawyers from six firms representing pet owners claimed the company illegally attempted to contact their clients directly. Hillman has said \\"It seems to me that Menu Foods is out to do whatever Menu Foods wants to do in a way that could adversely impact the rights\\" of the plaintiffs. Suspected related outbreak in 2004 A 2004 outbreak involving pet foods sickened more than 6,000 dogs and a lesser number of cats in Asia. Kidney failure in the animals was linked to foods manufactured in Thailand by Mars, Inc. Veterinarians in Asia initially blamed the 2004 problems on fungal toxins, but pathology tests conducted in 2007 found melamine and cyanuric acid present in renal tissue from both outbreaks. According to pathologists: \\"These results indicate that the pet food‚Äìassociated kidney failure outbreaks in 2004 and 2007 share identical clinical, histologic, and toxicologic findings, providing compelling evidence that they share the same causation.\\" See also *2007 Chinese export recalls *2008 baby milk scandal *China compulsory certification *Chinese protein export contamination *Pet insurance References External links *FDA Food Recall Page *FDA Recall FAQ *Oregon Veterinary Medical Association (OVMA) Pet Food Contamination Page - News & developments updated regularly *American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Pet Pood Recall Page *Menu Foods Recall Page *Itchmo - Pet News - A comprehensive resource of recall news updated daily *C-SPAN Video of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the recall. *ASPCA Pet Food Recall Resource Center FAQ and recall list, brought to you by the experts at the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. *Map tracing the spread of contaminated ingredients. * Possibility of cross-contamination to \\"safe\\" pet foods\\". *Pet Super Store Dog Food Recall Page Category:Pet foods Category:Food recalls Category:Scandals in China Category:Economic history of the People's Republic of China Category:Adulteration Category:Food safety scandals Category:2007 animal deaths Category:2007 in China Category:2007 health disasters Category:2007 scandals ","title":"2007 pet food recalls"},{"id":"10588177","text":"Ends is a collection of science fiction stories and poems by American writer Gordon R.

Founded in 1791, it is among the oldest museums in the United States. Several other institutions have merged over time to become today's Albany Institute. The earliest were learned societies devoted to the natural sciences, and for a time it was the state legislature's informal advisory body on agriculture. Robert R. Livingston was the first president. Joseph Henry delivered his first paper on electromagnetism to the Institute. Its collections of animal, vegetable and mineral specimens from state surveys eventually became the foundations of the New York State Museum. Later in the century it became more focused on the humanities, and eventually merged with the Albany Historical and Art Society. It has had its present name since 1926. Over the course of the 20th century it has become more firmly established as a regional art museum. The institute's three-building complex includes the late 19th-century Rice Building, the only freestanding Beaux-Arts mansion in the city, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and donated to the institute by one of its former benefactors. Its main building is a 1920s Classical Revival structure designed by local architect Marcus T. Reynolds. A more modern glass structure connects the two. The original two buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. At the beginning of the 21st century, the institute completed an extensive renovation in which the entrance building was constructed and new climate-controlled storage space for the collections was built. Buildings and grounds The institute occupies the 1‚Öî-acre () parcel of Dove Street between Washington and Elk Street. It is surrounded by buildings mostly of a similar scale and vintage, some of which are also listed on the National Register. Facing it across Dove Street is the University Club of Albany, itself a complex of brick buildings dominated by a Colonial Revival main building by local architect Albert Fuller that complements the institute's. Across Washington are some smaller commercial buildings. On the southwest corner of the intersection is another Fuller brick Classical Revival building, the former Harmanus Bleecker Library. A block to the east is the large New York State Department of Education Building, and the park behind the New York State Capitol, a National Historic Landmark that also contributes to the Lafayette Park Historic District. The Alfred E. Smith State Office Building, a contributing property to the Center Square/Hudson‚ÄìPark Historic District south of Washington, towers over the block from the southeast where it faces the capitol. A block to the west is the Washington Avenue Armory, with the Italianate Walter Merchant House across the street from it. North of the institute, across Elk, is a large parking lot with the small Sheridan Park beyond. The Rice Building sits on the southwest corner of the institute lot, on the intersection of Washington and Dove. To its east is a small lawn with mature trees and a walkway from the connecting building to the street, and a modern sculpture. A low metal railing on a stepped stone base sets off the property from Washington. In the middle of it is a tall modern stone entryway with two pillars of blocks similar to those on the Rice Building supporting a modern steel and glass hood. The larger main building occupies the northeast corner, with a large parking lot in the northwest. Between the two is a modern hyphen of large stone blocks with steel and glass on both sides. alt=A light orange brick building with a stone and glass section connecting it to a yellow brick building, the rear of the building in the lede image. A tower rises in the distance over the structure, and there is a parking lot in front with a yellow Volkswagen New Beetle. The main building is a two-story brick structure with quoins and a limestone belt course and Renaissance Revival cornice. A hipped roof with green metal cladding and a flat central tower is above. On the south side, the main entrance is located in a projecting octagonal pavilion. There are a few large 18- and 24-pane windows. An auditorium wing protrudes from the first floor. Inside the building a large main hallway, with exhibit halls on either side, runs from the foyer at the main entrance to a large hall in the north just south of the auditorium wing. Double staircases from the foyer go to the second floor, which has a similar plan but without access to the auditorium wing. Some entrances are decorated with Doric columns, but otherwise the walls are plain sheetrock. Four bays by three, the Rice Building sits on a raised stone foundation supporting golden Roman brick walls with quoined corners topped by a flat roof. A slightly lower three-by- three-bay wing extends from the north facade. The east elevation has a balustraded porch on the three northern bays serving what is now the main entrance; the original main entry on the opposite side has been bricked in. There are rectangular windows in the exposed basement wall. The first floor has round segmental-arched French windows with plain transoms; there are only three on the east elevation and the middle bay of the south is blind on all stories. In front they have a decorative ironwork railing; at their tops a molded stone course runs around the building. The second story has double one- over-one double-hung sash windows everywhere except the middle two bays of the east side where they are single. They have plain stone sills and splayed-brick lintels with each splaying multiple bricks long. Another continuous stone belt course serves as the baseline for the attic windows; one-over-one like the ones below but shorter. A decorative stone carving replaces the corner quoins above the course. Above the windows the roofline is marked by an elaborate cornice with egg-and-dart molding and brackets holding up a wide overhanging eave. A parapet encloses the entire roof. The north wing has a similar treatment to the main block but is more restrained. It lacks the upper belt course and corner carvings. In its place is a plain stone frieze. The roof cornice is narrower and unbracketed, with only denticulated stone below. Inside many of the original finishes remain. They include salons with decorative wall art, carved mahogany fireplace mantels and the library's built-in bookcases. A stairway with iron balustrade goes up to the third floor. The marble in the bathroom is also original. History From its beginnings as a learned society that advised the state legislature on how to improve agricultural production, the Institute has evolved into a regional art museum. Twice in the 19th century it went into serious decline, revived by a change in direction. In the later 20th century it finally found a permanent direction and its own home. alt=An oil portrait of a clean-shaven older man, seated, wearing a black robe and white neck ruff =1791‚Äì1823: Society for the Promotion of the Useful Arts= The Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Arts and Manufactures, the earliest predecessor organization to today's AIHA, was established in New York City in 1791 as a learned society. At that time the city was both state and national capital, and the Society served as an informal advisor to the state legislature, which later funded it, on ways to improve the state's economy, primarily the agricultural sector, and better the lives of its citizens. Among the 72 founders who met in Federal Hall, 25 had served in the legislature and every sitting member of that body was considered an honorary member of the Society. Robert R. Livingston, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was chosen as the Society's first president. Other early members of note included John Jay, first Chief Justice of the United States and a future governor of the state, and George Clinton, another later governor who would eventually become Vice President. When Albany was permanently designated as the state capital in 1796, the Society moved with it. It met in the former City Hall at first. In 1804, as its original charter expired, it was renamed the Society for the Promotion of the Useful Arts. Livingston continued to serve as president. Ten years later, it established a Fine Arts Committee. Among its members were architect Philip Hooker and painter Ezra Ames. Its first act was to commission from Ames a portrait of Livingston, who had died in 1813. It was the institute's first arts accession. In 1819, New York became the first state to establish a government agency devoted to agriculture when the legislature created the Board of Agriculture. The state no longer needed the Society, and withdrew its funding. Many of the founding members had grown older or, like Livingston, died, and the Society became less active. =1823‚Äì1850: Albany Institute= It was rejuvenated by a merger with the Albany Lyceum of Natural History, a year after that organization was founded in 1823 with Stephen Van Rensselaer, a former lieutenant governor then serving in Congress. The members of the Lyceum were younger, and focused on the natural sciences, especially geology and mineralogy, paleontology, and astronomy. In accordance with the first three fields, it had devoted itself to preserving mineral and botanical specimens collected on state surveys. The merged organization became known as the Albany Institute, with a membership of over a hundred. At its meetings over the next few years many scholarly papers were presented in advance of their eventual publication. In 1829 Joseph Henry, curator of the Institute's natural-history department, delivered his first paper on electromagnetism, an area in which he went on to make significant contributions. By the following year the Institute's libraries had almost doubled in size when Governor DeWitt Clinton willed most of his books to it. Henry left in 1832 to teach at Princeton; later he would become the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. His departure did not affect the Albany Institute, which recorded over a thousand members the next year. For other reasons, this would nonetheless be a peak year for the Institute as it was in the early 19th century. Between 1834 and 1837, attendance declined at meetings due to the excessive output of the Institute's chief meteorologist, Matthew Henry Webster, who took enthusiastically to the duty of coordinating the state weather surveys for the Board of Regents. He presented many papers on the subject, sometimes three at a single meeting, and attendees became increasingly bored and stopped attending. Financial problems resulting from the Panic of 1837 limited the Institute's publications. During this time it continued to collect scientific specimens, accumulating more than 15,000, and started the state Natural History Survey, both activities that led to the establishment of the New York State Museum. Van Rensselaer's death in 1839 was another setback for the Institute. Its functions were also duplicated by newer institutions, particularly colleges and universities such as Union College and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, that had been established in the Albany area. Throughout the 1840s it remained dormant. alt=A partially completed black-and- white illustration of a seated old man in academic robes =1851‚Äì1899: Albany Historical and Art Society= The Institute was again revived in 1851, when the new American Association for the Advancement of Science held its third annual meeting at the Albany Academy. As had happened before, the addition of members changed the nature of the organization, making it a learned society interested in many areas besides the natural sciences. John V. L. Pruyn, a Congressman and officer of the New York Central Railroad, became president in 1857 and reoriented the society toward the public rather than the interests of its members. Ten years later, in 1867, the Institute donated its science and natural-history collections to the state Cabinet of Natural History, a predecessor of the state museum. Later it would donate its geological collection. Celebrations of the city's bicentennial in 1886 included an exhibit at the Albany Academy of historical relics and art from the private collections of many socially prominent Albany families. The Albany Historical and Art Society (AHAS) was established afterward to maintain the collection and find a permanent home for it. Its membership approached nearly 1,200. By 1897 AHAS had raised enough money to buy a State Street building, on which it built an addition to house all its works. The following year it absorbed the collection of the Albany Gallery of Fine Art, which had been opened in 1846 and closed within a decade due to declining subscriptions. James McDougal Hart had worked there before beginning his artistic career. The gallery's holdings had been kept in trust by the city's Young Men's Association ever since. =1900‚Äì1947: Albany Institute for History & Art= In 1900, the AHAS and the Albany Institute merged, becoming the Albany Institute and Historical and Art Society. Local judge William Learned Shaw became the combined organization's first president. Four years later it bought the property on which the main building stands. In 1907 the cornerstone of the Fuller & Pitcher Company's Renaissance Revival building was laid, and the building was completed the following year. Mayor Charles Henry Gaus described it as \\"the capstone of educational development in our city\\". Its first exhibit, in 1909, was devoted to the tricentennial of Henry Hudson's exploration of the river named after him and the centennial of Robert Fulton's inaugural steamboat voyage up it.

Around it in a circle are the words \\"Federal Art Project\\" and, below, in smaller type, \\"Works Progress Administration\\". The rest of the text says \\"Art Exhibition by Artists of the Federal Art Project Works Progress Administration, Sept. 20 to 27, Albany Institute of History and Art\\". To clear more space for exhibits, the institute donated some of its books a block away to the newly built Harmanus Bleecker Library in 1924. The newspaper and pamphlet collections were donated to the state museum shortyl afterwards. Two years later, it shortened its name to the \\"more symmetrical\\" Albany Institute of History & Art.\\" This coincided with the beginning of an effort to make the collections more accessible to the public. Those outreach programs, such as tours, school trips and performances, continued through the Great Depression of the next decade, helping establish the institute as a regional museum. It started the Print Club of Albany, bringing nationally known printmakers to the city for lectures and demonstrations, and hosted an exhibit of contemporary regional art in honor of the 250th anniversary of the city charter in 1936. The latter event led to a continuing commitment in that area. As the next decade dawned and war began, John Davis Hatch came from the Art Institute of Seattle to take over as AIHA director. He began a series of exhibits of major regional artists. One devoted to Thomas Cole was the first major 20th-century retrospective of his work. In 1945, \\"The Negro Artist Comes of Age\\", featured the work of 45 African American artists and drew national attention after it went to the Brooklyn Museum. Behind the scenes, Hatch began the process of modernizing the museum's record-keeping to harmonize with the systems in use at other museums. =1948‚Äìpresent: Emergence as a regional art museum= Hatch's assistant Robert Wheeler took over in 1948. He instituted a policy that new acquisitions be from the region or have some connection to it. With that in place, he created special exhibitions devoted to regional work and renovated the galleries. In 1956 he was in turn succeeded by Janet McFarlane, who was at the time one of only seven women serving as a museum director in the U.S. Five years later, the museum's Women's Council, which has since become a major fundraiser and source of volunteers, was founded. A year after curator Norman Rice began a 20-year tenure as director in 1967, the Rice family donated their old house on the corner, expanded sympathetically in 1940, to the museum. It renovated the 1895 Beaux-Arts home designed by Richard Morris Hunt, architect of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and several mansions in Newport, Rhode Island, in the style of a 15th-century Italian palazzo for use both as offices and gallery space. As director, Rice would head an acquisition effort that grew the special collections to over a million items before he stepped down in 1986. Christine Miles took over from him after having directed the Fraunces Tavern museum in Lower Manhattan. Three years later, AIHA held its first Museum Ball and Contemporary Art Auction to raise money for a new Contemporary Collections Fund. The acquisitions it made possible have more than doubled the museum's collections in that area. That year the museum also began a decade-long project to document and better catalog its holdings in order to make them more accessible for researchers as well as the public, part of Miles' effort to position the museum for the upcoming century. In 1990 the City Neighbors project, designed to promote understanding of the people of Albany, produced its first exhibit, a collection devoted to the black experience in the city. The museum facilities needed to be redesigned, and in 1994 a local architect, Solomon + Bauer, was commissioned for the work. The following year the museum's trustees voted to raise $10 million, later increased to $12.5 million, toward the effort. Sculptor George Rickey donated one of his works, Etoile Variation V, to be permanently installed in the entrance atrium. The money was raised via public and private grants and the museum closed in 1999, moving to temporary quarters on State Street. It reopened in 2001. Collection AIHA has over 20,000 objects in its permanent collections, including 1600 paintings, 1100 drawings, 4000 prints, 600 sculptures, 500 pieces of furniture, 1200 ceramics, 4000 pieces of clothing and accessories, and 5450 other historical artifacts. Its library collections house 140,000 printed volumes and 85,000 photographs. To supplement its permanent exhibits, the institute hosts a number of traveling exhibitions yearly. alt=An oil painting showing a ruined stone tower on high ground in the foreground.

Life and career  Rasky was born in Toronto into a Jewish family, where he completed studies at Oakwood Collegiate Institute and then University College. He participated in CBC Television's first four years writing and producing CBC Newsmagazine (1952‚Äì1955). He also produced a documentary for the 1961 debut evening of CTV Television Network. He earned more than 200 awards during his career in which his films numbered more than 400. In the late 1950s Rasky moved to New York where he was hired by towering figures in the broadcasting world such as Murrow and Cronkite. After learning the tricks of the trade Rasky became a freelance director and began to travel around the world documenting every inch of his journey. Throughout the 1960s Harry made films on Castro, Che Guevera, Lady Bird Johnson, Eleanor Roosevelt, The Nobel Prize Winners in 1964 (which included Martin Luther King Jr.) and many more individuals. He also made two wildly different docudramas entitled \\"Hall of Kings\\" - for which he won an Emmy ‚Äì and \\"Upon This Rock\\" which starred Orson Welles. His films were called \\"Raskymentaries\\" by the New York Times and Los Angeles Times and noted for their poetry of the screen. After making a film in Vietnam entitled Operation Sea War, Rasky decided that politics was not his area of interest. He decided to dedicate his filmmaking career to documenting the world's greatest creators. By the early 1970s Harry returned to his native Toronto when the CBC offered him a simple arrangement: \\"make one film a year for us on whatever you want.\\" Throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s, Harry came into contact, once again, with the most interesting people alive in the world. He made films on Leonard Cohen, Marc Chagall (nominated for an Oscar), Henry Moore, Baryshnikov, Teresa Stratas, Will and Ariel Durant, Christopher Plummer, Yousef Karsh, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller. He also made sweeping epic films that covered a variety of issues including \\"The War Against the Indians\\" and \\"The Spies That Never Were.\\" Rasky died in hospital of heart failure on 9 April 2007 while recovering from a hip fracture sustained at his home.

A noted child prodigy of the 18th century, he published eleven works and authored a great quantity of unpublished manuscripts.  Life  Baratier's early education was most carefully conducted by his father, Fran√ßois Baratier, a Huguenot minister at the French Church of Schwabach. His progress was so rapid that by the time he was five years of age he could speak French, Latin and Dutch with ease, and read Greek fluently. He then studied Hebrew, and in three years was able to translate the Hebrew Bible into Latin or French. He collected materials for a dictionary of rare and difficult Hebrew words, with critical and philological observations; and when he was about eleven years old translated from the Hebrew Tudela‚Äôs Itinerarium. At 14, he was admitted master of arts at Halle, and received into the Royal Academy at Berlin, while working on a method to calculate longitude at sea. The last years of his short life he devoted to the study of history of the Jewish people and antiquities, did translations, and had collected materials for histories of the Thirty Years' War and of Antitrinitarianism, and for an inquiry concerning Egyptian antiquities.

It is a fictional account of the story of Otto Witte, who allegedly spent five days pretending to be the King of Albania. The title is a quotation from Shakespeare's King Lear, Act IV scene 6, wherein the insane King, crowned with weeds, makes futile assertions of his now usurped power. Plot The book centers around Otto of Schlepsig, a circus performer and tightrope walker, who is surprised to learn that he's an almost dead-ringer for Prince Halim Eddin, recently invited to become king the newly independent country of Shqiperi. Fed up with his life in the circus, Otto, and his friend, the sword swallower Max of Witte, get some uniforms and set out to take the Prince's place as King of Shqiperi. Setting The book takes place in a fictional version of the Balkans, between the First Balkan War and the Second Balkan War. All the countries mentioned there have real world analogues (i.e.: Hassocki Empire = Ottoman Empire, Lokris = Greece, Shqiperi = Albania). Magic is predominant in the land and fills the same roles technology does in our world. It is also worth noting that the names given to the analogous countries all have some basis in reality. For instance Shqiperi is the Albanian name for Albania, Poland is named after Gda≈Ñsk, a city in northern Poland, the United States is Vespucciland after Amerigo Vespucci, Greece is named after the ancient region of Locris, etc. The politics of the world are almost the same as our own, as well, right down to having analogues of Catholic Christianity, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Islam.

Maisel batted and threw right-handed. He also played minor league baseball for 12 seasons and was a manager in the minor leagues from 1925 to 1927. Early years Maisel was born in Catonsville, Maryland, in 1892. Baseball player He began his professional baseball career in 1912 playing for the Harrisburg Senators of the Tri-State League and the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. Maisel in 1919 as a member of the Portland Beavers. On September 16, 1912, Maisel was drafted by the St. Louis Browns from Harrisburg. He appeared in 11 games for the Browns in 1913, making his major league debut on May 1, 1913, at age 21. Maisel managed only three hits in 18 at bats with the Browns for a .167 batting average. Maisel spent the 1914 and 1915 seasons playing for the Scranton Miners of the New York State League. He compiled a .316 batting average for Scranton in 1915. In 1916, Maisel was acquired by the Detroit Tigers and became a backup third baseman to Ossie Vitt. At the start of the 1916 season, Baseball Magazine wrote: \\"Maisel won universal praise for his speed, but his normal hitting gait is not strong enough at the present time to beat out such a clever performer as Oscar Vitt.\\" Maisel appeared in only eight games for Detroit and had no hits in five at bats. During the 1916 season, the Tigers released Maisel to the Montreal Royals of the International League. He compiled a .296 batting average in 115 games for the Royals. In October 1916, the Tigers sold Maisel to the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League. He compiled a .308 batting average in 169 games for the Seals during the 1917 season. During the 1919 and 1920 seasons, Maisel played for the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast League. He compiled a career-high .323 batting average in 1920. At the end of the 1920 season, a dispute arose as to whether the San Francisco or Portland club held the rights to Maisel. Maisel's strong performance at Portland earned Maisel a third opportunity to play in the major leagues. He spent the 1921 and 1922 seasons with the Chicago Cubs. He had the best major league season in 1921. He was the Cubs' starting center fielder and compiled the fourth best fielding percentage (.978) among all National League outfielders.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is the largest denomination of the movement, and it currently applies the terms to the members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In the past, it has also been applied to the Presiding Patriarch of the church and the Assistant President of the Church. Other sects and denominations of the movement also use these terms. Origin of the phrase The phrase \\"prophet, seer, and revelator\\" is derived from a number of revelations Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said he received. The first revelation Smith said he received after the organization of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830, declared that \\"there shall be a record kept among you; and in it [Smith] shalt be called a seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ\\".Doctrine and Covenants 21:1. In 1835, Smith further clarified the role of the President of the Church, \\"to preside over the whole church, and ... to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet\\".Doctrine and Covenants 107:91‚Äì92. In 1841, Smith recorded a revelation that again restated these roles: \\"I give unto you my servant Joseph to be a presiding elder over all my church, to be a translator, a revelator, a seer, and prophet.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 124:125. In 1836, at the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, approximately one year after Smith organized the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he instructed that the members of the First Presidency and the apostles should also be accepted by the church as prophets, seers, and revelators: > I made a short address, and called upon the several quorums, and all the > congregation of Saints, to acknowledge the Presidency as Prophets and Seers > and uphold them by their prayers. ... I then called upon the quorums and > congregation of Saints, to acknowledge the Twelve, who were present, as > Prophets, Seers, Revelators, and special witnesses to all the nations of the > earth holding the keys of the kingdom, to unlock it, or cause it to be done > among them, and uphold them by their prayers.Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts > (ed.) 1902), History of the Church, 2:417 (March 27, 1836). Later, Smith further confirmed that people other than the President of the Church may hold these titles. For example, in 1841, a revelation described the role of Smith's brother Hyrum Smith as Assistant President of the Church: \\"And from this time forth I appoint unto him that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph\\".Doctrine and Covenants 124:94. Meanings of the terms The words prophet, seer, and revelator have separate and distinct meanings within the Latter Day Saint movement. LDS Church apostle John A. Widtsoe described the meanings of the terms and the differences between them:John A. Widtsoe, (1960). Evidences and Reconciliations, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 256‚Äì58. > A prophet is a teacher. That is the essential meaning of the word. He > teaches the body of truth, the gospel, revealed by the Lord to man; and > under inspiration explains it to the understanding of the people. He is an > expounder of truth. Moreover, he shows that the way to human happiness is > through obedience to God's law. He calls to repentance those who wander away > from the truth. He becomes a warrior for the consummation of the Lord‚Äôs > purposes with respect to the human family. The purpose of his life is to > uphold the Lord's plan of salvation. All this he does by close communion > with the Lord, until he is \\"full of power by the spirit of the Lord.\\" (Micah > ; see also D&C; 20:26; 34:10; 43:16) The teacher must learn before he can > teach. Therefore in ancient and modern times there have been schools of the > prophets, in which the mysteries of the kingdom have been taught to men who > would go out to teach the gospel and to fight the battles of the Lord. These > \\"prophets\\" need not be called to an office; they go out as teachers of > truth, always and everywhere. A prophet also receives revelations from the > Lord. These may be explanations of truths already received, or new truths > not formerly possessed by man. Such revelations are always confined to the > official position held. The lower will not receive revelations for the > higher office. In the course of time the word \\"prophet\\" has come to mean, > perhaps chiefly, a man who receives revelations, and directions from the > Lord. The principal business of a prophet has mistakenly been thought to > foretell coming events, to utter prophecies, which is only one of the > several prophetic functions. In the sense that a prophet is a man who > receives revelations from the Lord, the titles \\"seer and revelator\\" merely > amplify the larger and inclusive meaning of the title \\"prophet.\\" Clearly, > however, there is much wisdom in the specific statement of the functions of > the prophet as seer and revelator, as is done in the conferences of the > Church. A seer is one who sees with spiritual eyes. He perceives the meaning > of that which seems obscure to others; therefore he is an interpreter and > clarifier of eternal truth. He foresees the future from the past and the > present. This he does by the power of the Lord operating through him > directly, or indirectly with the aid of divine instruments such as the Urim > and Thummim. In short, he is one who sees, who walks in the Lord's light > with open eyes. (Book of Mormon, Mosiah 8:15-17) A revelator makes known, > with the Lord's help, something before unknown. It may be new or forgotten > truth, or a new or forgotten application of known truth to man‚Äôs need. > Always, the revelator deals with truth, certain truth (D&C; 100:11) and > always it comes with the divine stamp of approval. Revelation may be > received in various ways, but it always presupposes that the revelator has > so lived and conducted himself as to be in tune or harmony with the divine > spirit of revelation, the spirit of truth, and therefore capable of > receiving divine messages. In summary: A prophet is a teacher of known > truth; a seer is a perceiver of hidden truth, a revelator is a bearer of new > truth. In the widest sense, the one most commonly used, the title 'prophet' > includes the other titles and makes of the prophet, a teacher, perceiver, > and bearer of truth. Current usage within the LDS Church At the biannual general conference of the LDS Church, the name of the President of the Church is presented to the members as \\"prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\\".See, e.g., \\"The Sustaining of Church Officers\\", April 2015 General Conference. Members are invited to sustain the president in these roles, and the signalling for any in opposition is also allowed. Additionally, the counselors in the First Presidency and the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are sustained by the membership as \\"prophets, seers, and revelators\\". Until October 1979, the Presiding Patriarch of the church was also sustained as a \\"prophet, seer, and revelator\\".See, e.g., \\"The Sustaining of Church Officers\\", Ensign, May 1979, p. 20; compare with \\"The Sustaining of Church Officers\\", Ensign, November 1979, p. 18. Apostles who are not members of the Quorum of the Twelve or the First Presidency and other general authorities, (e.g., members of the Quorums of the Seventy and Presiding Bishopric) are not sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators. The procedure of sustaining is repeated in local congregations of the LDS Church several times per year at stake, district, ward, or branch conferences. These procedures are mandated by the theology of the LDS Church, which dictates governance by the \\"common consent\\" of the membership, wherein no one serves on the local or general level unless he or she has been formally sustained by individual congregations or the Church as a whole.See Doctrine and Covenants 20:65.

They were highly influential bishops of the early church who played pivotal roles in shaping Christian theology. In Eastern Christianity they are also known as the Three Great Hierarchs and Ecumenical Teachers, while in Roman Catholicism the three are honored as Doctors of the Church. The three are venerated as saints in Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Anglicanism, and other Christian churches. Origins of the term Icon of the Three Hierarchs: Basil the Great (left), John Chrysostom (center) and Gregory the Theologian (right)‚Äîfrom Lipie, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland. Disputes raged in 11th century Constantinople about which of the three hierarchs was the greatest. Some argued that Basil was superior to the other two because of his explanations of Christian faith and monastic example. Supporters of John Chrysostom countered that the \\"Golden Mouthed\\" () archbishop of Constantinople was unmatched in both eloquence and in bringing sinners to repentance. A third group insisted that Basil's close friend, Gregory the Theologian, was preferred to the others due to the majesty, purity, and profundity of his homilies and his defense of the faith from the Arian heresy. All three have separate feast days in January: Basil on January 1, Gregory on January 25, and Chrysostom on January 27. The Eastern Churches teach that the three hierarchs appeared together in a vision to St. John Mauropous, bishop of Euchaita, in the year 1084, and said that they were equal before God: \\"There are no divisions among us, and no opposition to one another.\\" As a result, a January 30 feast day commemorating all three in common was instituted around 1100 under the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos.Parry (1999), pp. 491‚Äì492.

The station strictly serves as a two-platform train halt for the Seremban Line KTM Komuter train service. Design The station, as are virtually all small train halts along the Komuter lines, is situated along a double tracked right-of-way. Due to its use as a connection from the KLIA, as well as colleges a distance away, the station receives a substantially large number of passengers throughout its operational hours. Initially consisting of a small station building with one operational ticket counter and two ticket vending machines, and covered platforms, the station has since undergone significant improvements in 2005 and 2006 to support more passengers. Interchange The station is notable as a link to Sepang, where the Sepang International Circuit and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) are situated. For the former, tents and additional ticket counters are usually prepared in anticipation of an increased influx of passengers during the Malaysian leg of the Formula One tournament. Prior to the completion of the Express Rail Link (ERL), the Nilai station was the only connecting railway station to the KLIA. KLIA-bound bus services, which typically take up to an hour to reach the airport from Nilai or vice versa, are provided for passengers. Travel to the airport from KL Sentral via Nilai is still cheaper than via ERL services, although much slower. Buses were previously stationed directly in front of the train station before a proper bus depot was completed down the road.

It is modeled after the first lure created by founder Lauri Rapala, in Finland in 1936. That protptype was made of cork wrapped in tinfoil and covered in melted film negatives as a cheap alternative to lacquer. Today, the original floater is made in seven different sizes and fourteen different colors. It can be found in many anglers' tackle boxes, and is the best-selling lure Rapala makes, and possibly best-selling in the world. The lure, when retrieved, swims with an action that mimics that of a wounded baitfish. It was designed this way by Lauri Rapala, because of his observations as a boy and young man of the behaviors of minnows and fish in lakes near his home in Finland, where he noticed that in a school of minnows, an injured minnow swimming with an odd wobble made it the target of a larger fish looking for a meal. After seeing this, he crafted this lure, with the help of some of his friends, originally to help him catch more fish without having to constantly rebait the thousands of hooks he had used to catch pike and perch. But his lures, being quite good at catching fish compared to conventional methods of the time, made its way around the world, increasing in popularity, so that the whole Rapala family had to help with creating these lures. Lauri's sons learned to make the lures, and became so skilled that one of his sons, Ensio, won a national craftsmanship award for his lure. The same son also invented a machine to help mass production of this lure.

King County decision. Subsequent legislation has made an SRDP the equivalent of marriage under state law. As a result of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the state, from June 30, 2014, SRDP will be available only when at least one of the partners is sixty-two years of age or older. History of Washington Domestic Partnerships =Beginnings= In its Andersen v. King County decision, the Washington Supreme Court noted the Legislature was free to revisit any law it had previously enacted. Lacking sufficient votes to change the marriage laws, the Legislature worked to pass a domestic partnership law. After much debate, lawmakers approved a bill on April 10, 2007. conferring eleven of the rights of marriage to same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples (when at least one of the individuals is over the age of 62). Governor Christine Gregoire signed the bill April 21, 2007, and the law took effect on July 22, 2007. The first partnerships were registered July 23, 2007, the first business day after the law's effective date. More than 100 couples registered on the first day -- some showing up as early as 4 a.m. =Expansion= Similar to California's incremental approach with its domestic partnership laws, the Washington Legislature has expanded the scope of partnerships. On March 4, 2008, lawmakers approved adding over 170 rights and responsibilities to domestic partnerships. The bill was signed by Governor Gregoire on March 12, 2008. Washington domestic partners do not need to re-register to take advantage of the new benefits. Because of the significant changes in 2008, the Secretary of State's office mailed a letter to the last known address of each SRDP informing them of the changes. The new law became effective on June 12, 2008. Lawmakers backing the domestic partnership legislation have been open in stating that their ultimate intent is to expand marriage laws to include same-sex couples and that they see the creation and expansion of domestic partnerships as steps toward that goal. To that end, civil marriage equality bills have been introduced to encourage discussion. 2009 =\\"Everything but marriage\\"= Again like California, lawmakers continued to extend the rights and responsibilities of domestic partners. Legislation introduced on January 28, 2009 intended to provide \\"everything but marriage\\" to domestic partners. Senate Bill 5688 would amend many state laws and place domestic partnership on an equal footing with civil marriage. Despite the attempts to provide equal benefits to domestic partners, the law does not change Washington's restriction against same-sex marriages. \\"Although we view this as an improvement that provides real and concrete protections to same-sex partners, it‚Äôs an inadequate substitute for marriage,\\" said Representative Jamie Pedersen, the House sponsor of the bill. The legislation cleared the Senate on March 10, 2009 and the House on April 15, 2009. Governor Gregoire signed it into law on May 18, 2009. =Referendum 71= The legislation was meant to come into force on July 26, 2009, but Referendum 71 was filed seeking to overturn the expansion. At the last possible moment, opponents submitted enough signatures to postpone the law and force a popular vote on the new law. Groups such as Equal Rights Washington and Washington Families Standing Together urged voters to uphold the law providing for domestic partnerships, while Protect Marriage Washington was the main group in opposition. Washington's voters approved the law 53.15% to 46.85% -- this marked the first time in the United States that voters had approved a statewide ballot measure that extended LGBT relationship rights. The law went into effect the day the election was certified, December 3, 2009. 2012 Senate Bill 6239 was introduced on January 16, 2012, and amended RCW 26 \\"Domestic relations.\\" In addition to legalizing same-sex marriage this modifies RCW 26.60 \\"State registered domestic partnerships\\" to convert any undissolved same-sex domestic partnership that does not involve at least one member aged 62 years or older into a marriage on June 30, 2014. SB 6239 passed the Senate by a vote of 28-21 on February 1, 2012. HB 2516 passed the House of Representatives on February 8 by a vote of 55-43. Governor Christine Gregoire signed the engrossed bill into law on February 13. The law was scheduled to take effect in June 2012, but was challenged by Referendum 74. Voters approved that referendum legalizing same-sex marriage on November 6, 2012. The law also provides that Washington's registered domestic partnerships will convert automatically to marriages on June 30, 2014, if not dissolved before that date. Under RCW 26.60.100 (4), the marriage celebration or automatic conversion from domestic partnership to marriage is deemed as legally effective on the date of the original domestic partnership registration: \\"For purposes of determining the legal rights and responsibilities involving individuals who had previously had a state registered domestic partnership and have been issued a marriage license or are deemed married under the provisions of this section, the date of the original state registered domestic partnership is the legal date of the marriage.\\" Rights and responsibilities =Original laws= After 2008's expanded domestic partnership law took effect, some of the domestic partner's benefits and responsibilities include: *Visitation, health care decision-making, and information-access rights *Inheritance and administration rights *Burial, disposition, organ donation, autopsy, and wrongful death claim rights *A domestic partner has testimonial privileges in court *Community property and dissolution laws apply *Domestic partners may sue on behalf of the community *Domestic violence statutes apply *Certain property transfers between partners are not taxed *State veterans benefits apply *Appointed and elected officials‚Äô partners subjected to same laws as married officials‚Äô spouses =Post- Referendum 71= Under state law, domestic partners shall be treated the same as married spouses. Some of the more notable changes include: *Use of sick leave to care for a domestic partner *Rights to injured partners‚Äô wages and benefits and unpaid wages upon death of a partner *Access to unemployment, disability insurance, and workers‚Äô compensation coverage *Access to insurance continuance rights after the death of a domestic partner *Rights related to adoption, child custody and child support *Business succession rights Registration Domestic partnerships are issued by the Secretary of State's Corporations Division in Olympia. Couples can register in person or by mail. Couples wishing to enter into an SRDP are required to fill out an application, have it notarized, and pay the filing fee. Once the application is received, the Secretary of State's office will issue a certificate and a wallet card for each individual. Registrations are public records -- information can be searched on the Secretary of State's domestic partnership page. Because an SRDP may be less familiar than marriage to some, the wallet cards or online verification can be used to prove a partner's relationship, especially during an emergency.

He was also Count of Burgundy (as Otto II) from 1208 to 1231, by his marriage to Countess Beatrice II, and Margrave of Istria and Carniola from 1228 until his death. Life He was born about 1180 the eldest son of Duke Berthold of Merania and his wife Agnes of Rochlitz. On the death of his father in 1204, he succeeded him as Duke of Merania, while the margravial titles in Istria and Carniola were inherited by his younger brother Henry II. On 21 June 1208, Otto married Beatrice II, Countess of Burgundy of House Hohenstaufen, daughter of late Count Otto I of Burgundy. At the wedding ceremony in Bamberg, the Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia was murdered, whereafter Otto approached his Welf rival Otto IV. However, the position of the Andechs dynasty was significantly weakened. Otto's brother Henry II was accused of having been involved in Philip's assassination and his estates were seized by Duke Ludwig I of Bavaria. Otto assumed the rule in the County of Burgundy, which was contested by the local Counts of Auxonne and in the long-time struggle, Otto even had to give the Burgundian lands in pawn to Count Theobald IV of Champagne. In 1217 Otto had joined the Babenberg duke Leopold VI of Austria and his brother-in-law King Andrew II of Hungary in the Fifth Crusade. In 1222, a dispute arose with Gerard I de Rougemont, the Archbishop of Besan√ßon over the building of a castle which violated a vow taken by his predecessor, Otto I of Burgundy (d.1200). When Otto failed to raze the castle or give an explanation for his actions, the archiepiscopal court excommunicated him and placed his lands under interdict. He immediately turned to his brother Ekbert, Bishop of Bamberg for help in Bamberg. On 20 October 1223, Otto issued five charters consisting of lavish donations to religious communities. In 1228 he inherited the Marches of Istria and Carniola, which his brother Henry II had regained shortly before. On Beatrice's death in 1231, he ceased to be Count and was succeeded by his son as Otto III. On his own death in 1234, he was further succeeded by his son as Otto II, Duke of Merania. Marriage and children Otto firstly married Beatrice of Hohenstaufen and produced the following children with her: *Otto III of Merania, (c. 1226 ‚Äì 19 June 1248), succeeded his mother as Count of Burgundy (as Otto III) in 1231, and his father as Duke of Merania as well as Margrave of Istria and Carniola in 1234.

The store traded 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, offering an extensive range of traditional supermarket grocery items-together with fresh fruit, vegetables and hot bbq chickens. The store was popular with the growing student and yuppy community in the district. The business concept was franchised in 1987. In 1995, NightOwl was floated on the stock exchange and was bought out by Retail Services Limited in 1996. RSL is a diversified holdings group mainly based in the retail sector, this helped take NightOwl nationwide The NightOwl business was purchased by David Hodge in September 2001. The companies Senior Management was changed and the business was re- aligned with a new focus being placed upon growth. Store livery was modernised, multiple-site franchisees were encouraged within the business and investment in training was increased. Taking up the Chair of the 'Australasian Association of Convenience Stores' (AACS) for 2003 and 2004, NightOwl increased its profile within the industry and played host to regular AACS functions within Queensland. In 2007, the Franchise business was sold to Adam Adams and his company Think Convenience. Adam and his wife Katrina are also the owners of six NightOwl stores in Cairns and North Queensland. As part of a strategy to increase growth dynamically, Think Convenience has re-introduced the company store method of expansion used extensively by Retail Services and discontinued by David Hodge. In order to facilitate the development of new regions and states, company-owned and operated stores were established. In regions like Townsville in Queensland, this has ensured new growth where initially franchisees were not available. Once established in this new area, NightOwl can then encourage franchising using company stores as examples of the business system.

Retrieved on May 18, 2019. Compare to the Zoning map of and Land use map of (which indicates hospitals) Torrance, California. Harbor-UCLA is not in the Torrance city limits. Harbor‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center is funded by the County of Los Angeles, and serves as the Level I Trauma Center for the South Bay area. History A medical facility was originally opened on the site in 1943 as the U.S. Army's Port of Embarkation Hospital, which was a receiving point for the wounded returned from the Pacific theater during World War II. Situated on a tract of , it had an administration building and a large number of barracks wards arranged under the cottage system. In February 1946, the county purchased the facility from the Federal Government in order to decentralize the activities of the Los Angeles County General Hospital, one of the largest institutions of its kind in the world, and founded a branch hospital to serve the Harbor and Long Beach. The Los Angeles County Harbor General Hospital began its affiliation with UCLA School of Medicine in 1951. Construction of the present eight-story hospital building was completed in 1962 on the easterly portion of the grounds, at Carson Street and Vermont Avenue, replacing a number of the wooden barracks and cottages comprising Harbor General. Affiliation with the UCLA School of Dentistry was established in 1972. In 1978, the name of the hospital was changed to Los Angeles County Harbor‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center in order to draw attention to its working relationship with the UCLA School of Medicine. The Harbor‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center campus is home to The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation, an independent, not-for-profit research institute. Originally known as the Harbor-UCLA Research and Education Institute (REI), then as The Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute (LA BioMed), The Lundquist Institute has been conducting biomedical research, training young scientists and providing community services, such as one of California‚Äôs largest and most comprehensive Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Programs. In Popular Culture The main eight-story hospital building became known the world over as the fictional \\"Rampart General Hospital\\" in the popular 1972 to 1977 television series, Emergency!. The emergency receiving area as seen in the television series was completely remodeled in the 2000s, and no longer appears as it did in the show.

Innovations Pioneering research in many fields such as reproductive endocrinology, genetics, infectious diseases, trauma and respiratory medicine has brought worldwide attention to the Harbor-UCLA campus. Among the major milestones are: * In 1984, Harbor-UCLA was the first institution in the world to achieve successful pregnancies using the technique of ovum transfer. The research team was directed by Dr. John Buster that performed history's first embryo transfer from one woman to another resulting in a live birth and led to the announcement on February 3, 1984. In the procedure, an embryo that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby. This scientific breakthrough established standards and became an agent of change for women suffering from the afflictions of infertility and for women who did not want to pass on genetic disorders to their children. Donor embryo transfer has given women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will contain their husband's genetic makeup. Although donor embryo transfer as practiced today has evolved from the original non-surgical method, it now accounts for approximately 5% of in vitro fertilization recorded births. This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human oocyte and embryo donation, a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years. Building upon Dr. Buster's groundbreaking research and since the initial birth announcement in 1984, well over 47,000 live births resulting from donor embryo transfer have been and continue to be recorded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States to infertile women, who otherwise would not have had children by any other existing method. * The discovery by A.F. Parlow, PhD, of the molecular structure of the human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone. The Parlow Pituitary Hormone and Antisera Laboratory produces highly purified pituitary components which are used in research and therapy around the world. One of the hormones produced, human growth hormone, is used to prevent severe growth retardation in thousands of children around the world. * Dr. Delbert Fisher was the first to comprehensively characterize the ontogenesis of fetal thyroid development. He went on to conceptualize and then develop a simple, highly effective newborn screening test for congenital hypothyroidism, including developing the micro assay methods that made it possible to screen on a national scale. * Internationally renowned genetics research to help treat and prevent short stature, led by Dr. David Rimoin. He was responsible for early work on disorders of growth hormone metabolism, for expanding the knowledge of dwarfism and developing the $2.2 million Skeletal Dysplasia Center at Harbor-UCLA. * Dr. J. Michael Criley's cardiac research into improved cardiac resuscitation techniques and better training of emergency paramedics, leading to the country's first hospital-based paramedic training program. * A major discovery in defining the basic biochemical defect in a skin disease, known as x-linked ichthyosis. Dr. Larry Shapiro's discovery that this was a hereditary disease was a significant breakthrough and led to improved treatment strategies. * Dr. Michael Kaback's advances in developing and improving screening for Tay‚ÄìSachs disease, an inherited, fatal disorder. Harbor-UCLA has become the headquarters for the California and international screening programs for the disease. * Definitive studies of lung surfactant have resulted in saving the lives of thousands of premature infants who would have died because of immature lungs. * The establishment of the UCLA Center for Vaccine Research. Work at the center has contributed to the licensure of several new vaccines and to the establishment of new national recommendations for childhood immunizations. These new vaccines have protected millions of newborns, children and adults from diseases such as meningitis, whooping cough and pneumonia. * The development of scintimammography to detect breast cancer without invasive biopsies, is one of the many imaging procedures developed at Harbor-UCLA. * A detachable balloon catheter, an artificial elbow, and an implant for use in maxillofacial surgery, are among the many devices developed here. * The receipt of a $1 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts to redesign how patient care is delivered. Harbor-UCLA was one of 20 hospitals nationwide‚Äîand the only one on the West Coast‚Äîto be awarded the grant. As a result, culture shifts occurred which emphasize leadership, community and the development of interdisciplinary collaboration. The grant also provided seed money and resources to assist with individual and group development.

Geography North Buffalo is a suburb which stretches from the City's border with Kenmore, New York to several neighborhoods to the south with Delaware Park forming the southern border. At its western boundary is Elmwood Avenue. The eastern border is Main Street. The topography of North Buffalo is flat. Cornelius Creek once flowed through North Buffalo, along a path roughly following Hertel Avenue. Cornelius Creek is now one of the many buried creeks in Buffalo, and is incorporated into the city's storm sewer system. The suburban area within the city of Buffalo is serviced by the NFTA buses on Delaware Avenue (No. 25), Colvin Avenue (No. 11), Hertel Avenue (No. 23), Elmwood Avenue (No. 20), Main Street (No. 8), Kenmore Avenue (No.5), and Amherst Street (No. 32). Culture North Buffalo is heavily populated with Italian-Americans, as evidenced by the Hertel Avenue strip which has many Italian restaurants, bakeries, and stores. This area along Hertel Avenue is now locally known as Little Italy. Many Italians in North Buffalo migrated from the West Side in the 1970s and 1980s, when Puerto Ricans first began to settle in traditionally Italian-American neighborhoods west of Richmond Avenue. The Italian Village Festival, now called the Italian Heritage Festival, moved from Connecticut Street on the West Side to Hertel Avenue in North Buffalo in 1988. From the 1950s until the late 1970s, North Buffalo was the historic center of Buffalo's Jewish community. Jews first settled in North Buffalo in the 1920s, with Jewish developers building a sizable number of single-family houses and two-flats in the North Park/Hertel Avenue area. The growth of the neighborhood's Jewish population rapidly accelerated in the 1950s, when urban renewal in the Lower East Side, and racial transition exacerbated by blockbusting in the Hamlin Park neighborhood, displaced the formerly large Jewish population of those communities. Although the majority of Jews in the Buffalo area now live in suburban Amherst and Williamsville, many remain in North Buffalo; particularly secular and Orthodox Jews. The neighborhood is home to several Orthodox synagogues and schools,jewish virtual library and institutions such as the Schvitz.Mary Kunz Goldman tales from bathhouse Because of its pedestrian-oriented environment; proximity to downtown Buffalo, the University at Buffalo, and suburban office parks; and high-quality 1920s-era housing stock, North Buffalo is experiencing an influx of young professional homebuyers. Notable events For many years, North Buffalo held the annual Italian Heritage and Food Festival along Hertel Avenue. Traditionally held in July, it was held August 1‚Äì4 in 2013. It is considered to be among the five largest street festivals in the United States. As of 2017, the Italian Heritage and Food Festival has been moved to the Buffalo Outer Harbor.www.buffaloitalianfestival.com .

Nephew and successor of Hugh III, he was a minor upon his succession and was under the tutelage of his mother Eleanor. He was born at Castel Genovese (modern Castelsardo) in 1377 to Eleanor and Brancaleone Doria, a Genoese nobleman. In 1382, Eleanor was residing in Genoa, where she made a pact with the Doge Nicol√≤ Guarco that loaned him 4,000 florins and promised Frederick in marriage to the doge's daughter Bianchina.

A Union Army force marched into Confederate-held lands in Chicot County, Arkansas. The ensuing battle resulted mainly in a stalemate, each side achieving its goals. The Confederate troops succeeded in delaying the Federal forces' advance into the South, while dealing more casualties to the opposing army than they themselves received. Likewise, the Union troops succeeded in advancing toward their goal, Lake Village. The battle General Joseph A. Mower Map of Old River Lake Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The Confederate objective was to delay the Federal advance. Although they had no real hope of defeating the Federal forces in a major battle, by using small scale skirmishing techniques, they were able to slowly inflict casualties on the Union Army. Using these skirmishing techniques, the Confederates attempted to delay the Union advance toward Lake Village. In early June, Brigadier General Joseph Mower received orders from Maj. Gen. Andrew J. Smith to show, through a forceful demonstration, the Federals' intentions toward Lake Village. During the evening and morning of June 5 and 6, Mower positioned his troops in the standard marching formation and proceeded to march on Lake Village. They were soon confronted by Confederate soldiers who would fire a few shots and retreat to cover. Later, these retreating soldiers ended up in General Colton Greene's encampment where his main force was located. Along with Greene's troops and accompanying artillery, the Confederates attempted to delay the Federal advance. then they ended the battle and withdrew to Parker's Landing. The Union troops advanced to Lake Village, camped there overnight, and the next day rejoined the flotilla on the Mississippi River at Columbia. Although the Confederates had been able to delay the Federal forces, the U.S. troops still made it to their objective.

It is one of the primary healthcare delivery systems in the north San Fernando Valley, especially the area's large indigent population. Olive View is also the closest county hospital serving the Antelope Valley after High Desert Hospital was converted to an urgent care clinic in 2003. Overview The 377-bed replacement facility built on the old Sylmar site was opened on May 8, 1987. Olive View incorporated UCLA in its name, becoming Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center in 1992. In May 1997, Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center became a part of ValleyCare, which maintains responsibility for the care of the medically indigent, low income, uninsured residents of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys. Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center has an affiliation with the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, offering residency programs in major specialty areas as well as providing an on-campus School of Nursing. It is also a rotation site for medical students at UCLA. History The hospital was founded on October 27, 1920, as a tuberculosis (TB) sanatorium to relieve overcrowding at County General Hospital, and when it was no longer needed for TB treatment, the facilities became an acute care hospital in 1970. In 1962, Olive View Hospital performed the first open heart surgery successfully in the San Fernando Valley, and one of the first in Southern California. The hospital was known as Olive View Hospital before it became affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles's School of Medicine in 1970. Olive View Hospital became Olive View Medical Center, a teaching hospital and a new 888-bed hospital was dedicated in December 1970. The hospital was severely damaged six weeks after it opened during the 6.5‚Äì6.7 1971 San Fernando earthquake (February 9, 1971), which caused the collapse of the four stairwell wings, as well as the parking structure. The first floor columns of the five- story main structure nearly failed as well, shifting the entire building 18 inches off center to the north, which nearly brought down the entire structure. The building was damaged beyond repair, and demolished by implosion on May 31, 1973. For the next sixteen years, Olive View served its patients through an interim facility at MidValley in Van Nuys. On March 9, 1975, Department of Health Services Security Officer Murray F. Olsen was killed in the line of duty on the grounds of Olive View Medical Center. Olsen observed a suspect crash his truck through the gates of the medical center and race onto the hospital grounds. Pursuing the suspect in his county patrol car, he made a vehicle stop and confronted the suspect, Steven Vyeda of Watsonville, CA. Responding LAPD officers found Officer Olson deceased on the ground next to his vehicle; he had been stabbed and then shot with his own weapon. His official cause of death was \\"contusion of spinal cord, gunshot wound to face, multiple stab wounds\\" per the Coroner's report. The suspect was shot and killed by police later that day. The rebuilt Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center was opened in 1987. In June 1992, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved postgraduate physicians from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to work at Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center. Physicians can now receive training not available at Cedars-Sinai. Olive View‚ÄìUCLA Medical Center in Sylmar is provided with three additional doctors at a cost to the county of $9,000 a month. The 2008 Sayre Fire caused damage to several outbuildings, and led to an evacuation of the intensive care patients from the hospital.  In popular culture  Before the 1973 demolition, the hospital served as a filming location, where it played itself in a 1973 episode of the Emergency! television show. It also served as the set for a nuclear war-damaged then- futuristic jail facility in the TV series Mission Impossible in the seventh- season episode \\"Two Thousand\\". The current facility was used in scenes for the 1987 film Over the Top starring Sylvester Stallone.

The development, planned by Southwood Properties, the development subsidiary of the St. Joe Paper Company, was controversial,James Russell, Miami Herald, St. Joe Finds the Old Ways Work Best, June 15, 1989, p. 1C and was canceled in 1989 after the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) required 40% affordable housing.Florida Trend, St. Joe Scraps Another Big Deal, June 1, 1990 A new plan for the same project, now being developed by St. Joe/Arvida, was approved by the city in 1999David Twiddy, Tallahassee Democrat, Tallahassee, Fla., Planned Community Signed into Reality, May 14, 1999 and later by the DCA. SouthWood is a part of the Capital Region Community Development District which is a local, special purpose government entity authorized by Chapter 190 of the Florida Statutes as amended, and created by the Florida Land and Water Adjudacatory Commission as an alternative method of planning, acquiring, operating and maintaining community-wide improvements in planned communities. A CDD provides the \\"solution\\" to Florida‚Äôs need to provide valuable community infrastructure generated by growth, ultimately without overburdening other governments and their taxpaying residents. Community Development Districts represent a major advancement in Florida‚Äôs effort to manage its growth effectively and efficiently. This allows a developer to establish higher construction standards, meanwhile providing a long-term solution to the operation and maintenance of the community‚Äôs facilities. The Capital Region Community Development District is organized similar to other local governments in Florida, in that the legislative body is composed of a five-member board known as the Board of Supervisors. The Board establishes the policy of the District in accordance with Florida law. The Board, by law, must hire a District Administrator and District Counsel. Staff members operate utilizing the same formalities as a County Administrator and County Attorney. The Board, through review of advertised Requests for Qualifications, ranks and selects a District Engineer to perform the engineering needs of the District. District Administration staff and the District Attorney administer the operations of the District and implement the Board‚Äôs policies and contracts. The current supervisors include four community residents and one developer appointee.

(doing business as Fox Racing) is an American extreme sports, primarily motocross, lifestyle clothing brand founded in 1974. Fox is a privately held company run by the founder and his sons, Geoff and Peter Fox, and is owned by private equity company Altamont Capital Partners. The sportswear Fox designs, develops, and distributes is sold worldwide. History The early histories of Fox Racing and Fox Racing Shox were intertwined. Fox Racing Shox is a brand of offroad racing suspension components founded by Geoff Fox's brother, Bob Fox. Fox Racing Shox was originally under the corporate umbrella of Moto-X Fox. In 1977 Bob's division split out as a separate company called Fox Factory, Inc. Fox Head, Inc. headquarters are in Irvine, California, with additional offices in Barcelona, Spain and Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Fox built its business by developing clothing for motocross. Through sponsoring and working closely with riders such as Ricky Carmichael, James Stewart, Damon Bradshaw, Rick Johnson, Mark Barnett, Doug Henry, Jeremy McGrath and Steve Lamson, the company has researched and developed race clothing that provides riders with protection, performance and freedom of movement. They also used to make and develop racing engines for Yamaha. Fox Racing first opened for business in February 1974, when Geoff Fox, a Ph.D. who taught physics at the Santa Clara University, launched Moto-X Fox, a distribution business for European motocross parts and accessories in a building in Campbell, California. Within two years, Moto-X Fox was manufacturing suspension and engine components for racers looking for an on-track advantage. In the spring of 1977, Geoff was determined to show the American motocross public that his products were superior to those of the competition. He created his own privately owned professional motocross team, Team Moto-X Fox. Going up against the Japanese factory teams, Team Moto-X Fox riders became the top non-factory riders in the series, finishing fifth, sixth and seventh in the highly competitive AMA 125 cc National Championship series. During the series, Team Moto-X Fox riders wore bright red, green and orange race outfits. Handmade by Fox, the clothing became a hit with the fans and interested enthusiasts started calling the Fox shop in Campbell enquiring about its availability. In 1980, Fox rider Mark Barnett won the company's first National Championship, and two years later, Brad Lackey won Fox 's (and the United States') first Motocross World Championship. In the ensuing two- plus decades, Fox-sponsored riders have won over forty National Motocross and Super cross Championships. In 2006 Fox rider Ricky Carmichael won the AMA Supercross Championship, while longtime Fox rider James Stewart won the FIM World Supercross Championship. In July 2006, Fox Racing decided to change its corporate name to Fox Head, Inc.http://www.allbusiness.com/north- america/united-states-california-metro-areas/4076039-1.html The move was complete by the fall of that year. Fox decided such a change would help the brand further penetrate sporting venues aside from motocross, such as mountain bike, wake boarding, surfing; as well as expand into other products. Peter Fox was named CEO in 2008, with Greg Fox remaining on the board of directors. Peter Fox subsequently left the company, but rejoined when Fox Head was acquired by Altamont Capital Partners in 2014, leaving the founder and his son in charge of the company. Retail and distribution A Fox Head store at the Hayuelos Mall in Bogot√°, Colombia Fox products are sold worldwide with distributors and partners in over 50 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, Per√∫, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States and Mexico. Fox Teams Fox recruits people for Fox Teams from a number of sports, including motocross, BMX, surfing, mountain biking and wakeboarding.

Inmates of the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex, 442 U.S. 1 (1979), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that when state law requires the state to grant parole whenever a prisoner satisfies certain conditions, due process requires the state to allow the prisoner to present evidence in support of his request for parole and to furnish a written explanation of the reasons why his request has been denied.  Background  Nebraska had both mandatory and discretionary parole. Mandatory parole meant that the prisoner must be released when he had served the full length of his sentence, less any good time credits. Discretionary parole meant that a prisoner who satisfied the state's criteria for being a good candidate for early release would be released in the discretion of the state's Board of Parole. Under Nebraska's discretionary parole system, all prisoners were reviewed each year regardless of whether they were yet eligible for parole. At this initial hearing, the Board examined the prisoner's entire preconfinement and postconfinement record and considered any statements or letters the prisoner presented on his own behalf. If the Board determined at this initial hearing that the prisoner was not suitable for parole, then parole was denied and the prisoner was informed as to the Board's reasons for denying parole. If, however, the Board determined at the initial hearing that the prisoner was suitable for parole, then it scheduled a final parole hearing. At this final parole hearing, the prisoner was permitted to present evidence on his behalf and to be represented by private counsel of his choice. He was not, however, permitted to cross-examine witnesses or hear any evidence presented against him. The hearing was recorded. If the Board denied parole at this final hearing, the prisoner was furnished with a written explanation within 30 days. Nebraska prisoners brought suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983, arguing that the Board's procedures denied them due process. The federal district court in Nebraska and the Eighth Circuit agreed. The Eighth Circuit held that, in order to satisfy due process, the State had to adhere to the following procedures: # Provide a full formal hearing for each inmate eligible for parole; # Notify the prisoner in advance of the hearing and notify him of the factors that the Board may use to reach its decision; # Allow the prisoner to appear in person before the Board and present evidence; # Maintain a record of the proceedings that is \\"capable of being reduced to writing\\"; # Furnish the prisoner with a full written explanation of the facts on which the Board relied and the reasons for the Board's decision to deny parole. The Supreme Court agreed to review the Eighth Circuit's requirements to determine whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment required them.  Opinion of the Court  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects against the deprivation of liberty interests at the hands of the state. In order to trigger due process protection, the liberty interest in question must be more than merely abstract or theoretical; it must be something to which a person has a \\"legitimate claim of entitlement\\". No prisoner has a liberty interest in being released before his sentence expires, because the trial and appeals processes have ensured that the state has lawfully deprived the person of his interest in being free from confinement. A state may create a parole system for its prisoners, but it is not required to do so. Parole exists as an adjunct to the penological goals of rehabilitation and deterrence. Like the prison system itself, the parole regime is created and managed by the executive branch, which has no obligation to make error-free determinations in executing the laws. In Morrisey v. Brewer, , the Court held that due process imposed certain standards on the decision to revoke parole. The Nebraska inmates in this case argued on the basis of Morrisey that due process likewise required certain standards to govern the decision to grant parole. The Court disagreed, because it saw a material difference between the decision to take away freedom already granted and the decision to free someone before their legitimate expectation of release ripens. \\"The parole release decision is more subtle and depends on an amalgam of elements, some of which are factual but many of which are purely subjective appraisals by the Board members based on their experience with the difficult and sensitive task of evaluating the advisability of parole release\\". Because the decision to grant parole depends on such subjective factors, and ultimately derives from the mere hope that the Board will grant parole, the Court held that there was no per se liberty interest in being granted parole. However, the particular statute creating Nebraska's parole system used mandatory language, and the prisoners argued that this mandatory language gave rise to a protected liberty interest in parole: > Whenever the Board of Parole considers the release of a committed offender > who is eligible for release on parole, it shall order his release unless it > is of the opinion that his release should be deferred because: # There is a > substantial risk that he will not conform to the conditions of parole; # His > release would depreciate the seriousness of his crime or promote disrespect > for the law; # His release would have a substantially adverse effect on > institutional discipline; or # His continued correctional treatment, medical > care, or vocational or other training in the facility would substantially > enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later > date. Although this statute did use the word \\"shall\\", the Court did not interpret it to mean that a decision that takes into account these criteria should for that reason alone embody the full protections of an adversarial hearing. The Court ruled that the prisoner's opportunity to make a statement on his own behalf minimized the risk of error and thus satisfied due process because the Board had before it the prisoner's entire file. Due process did not require the Board to articulate the specific evidence on which it had relied, because this would tend to make the hearings more adversarial in nature. The fact that the Board communicated the reasons for its denial, couching its explanation in terms of guidance for the prisoner's future growth, was sufficient. \\"The Nebraska procedure affords an opportunity to be heard, and when parole is denied it informs the inmate in what respects he falls short of qualifying for parole; this affords the process that is due under these circumstances. The Constitution does not require more.\\" = Concurring opinion = Justice Powell believed that there was a liberty interest in being released on parole that stemmed from the Due Process Clause, independent of the statutory language used to create an individual state's parole system. Powell rejected the distinction the majority made between a hoped-for release and a previously granted release. \\"When a State adopts a parole standard that applies general standards of eligibility, prisoners justifiably expect that parole will be granted fairly and according to law whenever those standards are met.\\" This expectation, in turn, was the source of the liberty interest Powell believed was protected by the Due Process Clause. Powell also believed that there was no significant prejudice to the state in notifying the prisoner in advance about the evidence to be used at the hearing, so as to allow the prisoner to prepare his statement. = Dissenting opinion = Justice Marshall also believed that the Due Process Clause gave rise to a liberty interest in being released on parole, and rejected the majority's distinction between release and revocation. That difference was not constitutionally significant, Marshall argued, because the Court had recognized a liberty interest in future freedom in other contexts. Marshall observed that the Court's prior decisions never had held that the process due a person upon a deprivation of liberty depended on the extent to which subjective determinations were involved. Finally, parole was such an integral part of the criminal sentencing scheme that it was difficult for Marshall to imagine that there was not an abstract liberty interest in parole. Marshall also argued that the majority did not correctly applied the three-part test in Mathews v. Eldridge, . The Court focused solely on the risk of an erroneous deprivation, without looking at the other two Mathews prongs--the nature of the interest at stake and the burden on the government that a marginal increase in procedural protections entails. \\"Certainly the interest in being released from incarceration is of sufficient magnitude to have some bearing on the process due.\\" Moreover, the Court did not even focus on the risk of error that the Nebraska procedure actually entailed, with the result that its analysis of the effect on that risk additional procedures would have was necessarily skewed as well. Finally, due process also required that the procedures appear fair as well as actually be fair. The Court had ignored this aspect of the due process analysis as well. Although Marshall agreed that a formal hearing was not required, he did believe that fairness required the Board to notify the inmates sufficiently far in advance to allow them to prepare their cases and retain counsel if they so desire. Marshall also believed that fundamental fairness required the Board to state the evidence on which it had relied in denying parole. This requirement would focus the Board more carefully on the statutory criteria and promote a more careful consideration of the evidence, while at the same time affording the inmates to contest factual inaccuracies in the record. The marginal increased burden on the Board was slight in comparison to the increased fairness these features would provide.

The monastic tradition spread from Gaul to the British Isles shortly thereafter. L√©rins was famous for training priests, and a number of its monks became bishops. Benedict Biscop, abbot of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, spent two years there. He later founded St Peter's monastery at Monkwearmouth in Northumbria. As Christianity spread into Ireland and parts of Great Britain during the late 4th and 5th centuries, monastic communities emerged in places such as Iona, Lindisfarne and Kildare. Several early Irish monks were noted for being missionaries, traveling into Great Britain and continental Europe. History The Roman, and therefore Saxon conception of ecclesiastical government was territorial and diocesan. The Celtic conception was tribal and monastic. In the British Isles in the 5th century, the earliest monastic communities in Ireland, Wales and Strathclyde followed a different, distinctly Celtic model. It seems clear that the first Celtic monasteries were merely settlements where the Christians lived together ‚Äî priests and laity, men, women, and children alike ‚Äî as a kind of religious clan. At a later period actual monasteries both of monks and nuns were formed, and later still the eremitical life came into vogue. The early Celtic monasteries were like small villages, where the people were taught everything from farming to religion, with the idea in mind that eventually a group would split off, move a few miles away and establish another monastery. In this way, the Celtic way of life, and the Celtic Church propagated its way across Ireland and eventually to Western Britain and Scotland. Irish monks spread Christianity into Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland. St. Ninian established a monastery at Whithorn in Scotland about 400 AD, and he was followed by St. Columba (Iona), and St. Aidan, who founded a monastery at Lindisfarne in Northumbria. Columban wandering monks became missionaries. Founding saints were almost invariably lesser members of local dynasties, and their successors were often chosen from among their kin.Baring-Gould, Sabine. The Lives of the Saints, London. John C. Nimmo, 1897, p. 38 Ultan, abbot-bishop of Arbraccan, was a disciple and kinsman of Decl√°n of Ardmore, who made him bishop of Ardbraccan.MacCormack, Katherine. The Book of Saint Ultan, Candle Press, Dublin, 1920 The Insular observance, at first so distinctive, gradually lost its special character and fell into line with that of other countries; but, by that time, Celtic monasticism had passed its zenith and its influence had declined.Huddleston, Gilbert. \\"Western Monasticism.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10.

On his return, he stopped to visit Martin of Tours, who sent masons with him on his homeward journey. These masons built a church of stone, on the shore. Shortly thereafter (397), upon learning of Saint Martin's death, Ninian dedicated the church to him. Ninian went on to convert the southern Picts to Christianity. There is strong modern scholarly consensus that Ninian and Finnian of Movilla are the same person, whose actual name was \\"Uinniau\\". Yorke, Barbara (2007), The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain, 600‚Äì800, Religion, Politics and Society in Britain (ed. Keith Robbins), Harlow: Pearson Education Limited, The small stone church, known as the \\"Candida Casa\\" (\\"shining white house\\"), was Scotland's first Christian building. Archaeological excavations have suggested that Whithorn was primarily a commercial settlement, whose residents were Christian, and that a more likely location for Ninian's church might have been Kirkmadrine, across the bay. It appears that Rosnat was a double monastery with a separate house for women.McCavery, Trevor. Newtown: A History of Newtownards, White Row Publications 2013, p. 21 At Whithorn, many monks were trained who later went into the missionary field to become famous apostles of Ireland and Alba, even as far north as the misty Orkney and Shetland Islands. Saint √âogan, founder of the monastery of Ardstraw, was an Irishman who lived in the sixth century AD and was said to have been taken by pirates to Britain. On obtaining his freedom, he went to study at Candida Casa. Enda of Aran first studied with Ailbe of Emly, and then went to the Candida Casa. Enda founded the first monastery in the Aran Islands. =Other monastic foundations= About 528, Cadoc is said to have built a stone monastery probably at Kilmadock, which was named for him, north-west of Stirling.The New Statistical Account of Scotland, Perth, Vol. X, 1845, p. 1224; Doune Historical Notes, Forth Naturalist and Historian, Moray S.

In 565 Saint Kenneth joined Columba in Scotland and then went on to found a monastery in Fife. Kingarth monastery on the Isle of Bute is associated with saints Cathan and his nephew Bl√°√°n, who studied under Kenneth. A contemporary of Columba, Moluag, is described in The Matryrology of √ìengus, as \\"The Clear and Brilliant, The Sun of Lismore in Alba\\". He was ordained by Comgall of Bangor, who may have been a kinsman. Around 562, he and twelve companions embarked on a \\"white martyrdom\\", forsaking their homeland to establish a monastery on the island of Lismore in Scotland. Lismore became an important center of Celtic Christianity. M√°el Ruba, grand-nephew of Comgall of Bangor, (whose father was Pictish), founded Applecross Abbey in 672 in what was then Pictish territory.Toke, Leslie. \\"St. Maelrubha.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9.

According to Adomn√°n, Donn√°n of Eigg was martyred with a number of monks at his monastery at Kildonnan. Shortly before his death in 651, Aidan of Lindisfarne founded Melrose Abbey on the River Tweed, as a daughter house of his own establishment.\\"Melrose Abbey\\", BBC Cuthbert entered Melrose under Abbot Eata. He studied under Prior Boisil. The sick would come from far distances to Boisil, who was skilled in the healing properties of various herbs and the nearby mineral springs.

In the 6th century, Dubricius/Dyfrig, who was born in Herefordshire, of a Welsh mother, founded a monastery at Hentland and then one at Moccas.Butler, Rev. Alban, The Lives of the Saints, Volume XI, 1866 The earliest monastic site in the United Kingdom appears to have been at Beckery, near Glastonbury. Excavations conducted in 2016, revealed what archaeologists say is a monastic cemetery dating to the 5th century. The monastery, consisting of a few wattle and daub buildings, was situated on an island surrounded by wetlands. =Augustinian mission= By the time the Roman Empire recalled its legions from the province of Britannia in 410, parts of the island had already been settled by pagan Germanic tribes who, appear to have taken control of Kent and other coastal regions no longer defended by the Roman Empire. In the late 6th century Pope Gregory I sent a group of missionaries to Kent to convert √Üthelberht, King of Kent, whose wife, Bertha of Kent, was a Frankish princess and Christian. Soon after his arrival, Augustine founded the monastery of Saints Peter and Paul on land donated by the king. Later, it was renamed St Augustine's Abbey.Blair Church in Anglo- Saxon Society pp. 61‚Äì62 Probably the earliest monastery established in England for women was Saint Peter's Abbey in Folkestone, having been traditionally founded in 630 by Eanswith, the daughter of King Eadbald of Kent, the son of √Üthelberht of Kent. The spread of Christianity in the north of Britain gained ground when Edwin of Northumbria married √Üthelburg, a daughter of √Üthelbert, and agreed to allow her to continue to worship as a Christian. The missionary Paulinus of York accompanied √Üthelburg north. After Edwin's death in the Battle of Hatfield Chase, his immediate successors reverted to paganism,* His widowed queen √Üthelburg fled, with members of her family, to her brother, King Eadbald of Kent. √Üthelburh founded Lyminge Abbey about four miles northwest of Folkestone on the south coast of Kent. After Paulinus left Northumbria with Queen √Üthelburg, his assistant James the Deacon remained and continued his missionary efforts, primarily in the Kingdom of Lindsey. James, was a trained singing master in the Roman and Kentish style, and taught many people plainsong or Gregorian chant in the Roman manner.\\"James the Deacon\\". The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England. (Michael Lapidge, James Blair et el.,eds.) Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing. 2001, p. 258. Among those who went to Kent was Edwin's niece, Hild, who had been baptized by Paulinus. Some time later, her sister, Hereswith became a nun at Chelles Abbey in Gaul, but Hild returned north with some companions, and was trained in Celtic monasticism by Aidan of Lindisfarne, part of the Hiberno-Scottish mission to northern Britain. The double monastery of Hartlepool Abbey, a walled enclosure of simple wooden huts surrounding a church had been founded in 640 by Hieu, an Irish recluse in Northumbria. In 649, Aidan sent Hieu to establish a monastery at Healaugh near Tadcaster,Lapidge, Michael and Gneuss, Helmut. Learning and Literature in Anglo-Saxon England: Studies Presented to Peter Clemoes on the Occasion of His Sixty-fifth Birthday (Cambridge University Press, 1985) p. 8 and named Hild abbess at Hartlepool. Around 657, Aidan asked her to found an monastery at Streoneshalh. Hild served as abbess of both monasteries, but resided at Streaneshalch. In 670, Eadbald's granddaughter, Domne Eafe, founded the double monastery of St. Mildred's Abbey at Minster-in-Thanet.Alston, George Cyprian. \\"The Benedictine Order.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

He then travelled to East Anglia with his brothers, Foillan and Ultan, during the early 630s shortly before St Aidan founded his monastery on Holy Island. Around 633, King Sigeberht received them and endowed a monastery, which they established at Cnobheresburg on the site of an old, stone-built, Roman shore- fort near the sea.B. Colgrave and R. A. B.

Cedd was from Northumbria and had been brought up on the island of Lindisfarne by Aidan. He practiced the Celtic Rite, which had a strong emphasis on personal asceticism. He was appointed bishop to the Kingdom of Essex and founded monasteries at TilaburgSaunders, A., \\"Chapel- Hospital-Blockhouse?\\", Panorama, The Journal of the Thurrock Local History Society, Volume 13, 1970 and in 653 at Ithancester. Cedd and his brothers regarded Lastingham as their monastic base, providing intellectual and spiritual support, and a place of retreat. While on his missionary journeys Cedd delegated the daily oversight of Lastingham to others. Cedd died at Lastingham on 26 October 664,Powicke, F. Maurice and E. B. Fryde.

Its school was a primary learning center of Sub-Roman Britain, but was situated on the Glamorgan Plain exposed to hostile incursions from Irish pirates, and to Viking raids. The course of studies at Llaniltyd (and this also applies to the other monasteries) included Latin, Greek, rhetoric, philosophy, theology, and mathematics.

The monastery was destroyed in about 613 by the Anglo-Saxon king √Üthelfrith of Northumbria after he defeated the Welsh armies at the Battle of Chester; a number of the monks then transferred to Bardsey Island. Before the battle, monks from the monastery had fasted for three days and then climbed a hill to witness the fight and pray for the success of the Welsh; they were massacred on the orders of √Üthelfrith.

These he divided the community into three companies; one, who were unlearned, worked the farm; the second, around the monastery; the third, which was made up of the learned, devoted their time to study and apostolic labours, and numbered upwards of 365.

In 563, Columba left Ireland and settled with the Gaels of D√°l Riata, founding an abbey on Iona, which became one of the oldest Christian religious centers in Western Europe. His reputation as a holy man led to his role as a diplomat among the tribes. He is said by Bede and Adamn√°n to have ministered to the Gaels of D√°l Riata and converted the northern Pictish kingdoms. In addition to founding several churches in the Hebrides, he worked to turn his monastery at Iona into a school for missionaries. The Abbey became a dominant religious, educational, and political institution in the region for centuries.Edmonds, Columba. \\"St. Columba.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 12 January 2020 Around 634, Aidan, a monk of Iona was sent to Northumbria and founded a priory on Lindisfarne.

Alban, \\"St. Comgall, Abbot in Ireland\\", Lives of the Saints, Vol.V, 1866 At Bangor only one meal was allowed, and that not until evening. Food was scant and plain.

Fasting was frequent and prolonged.\\"History of Bangor Abbey\\", Parish of Bangor Abbey Around 585 set sail for the continent with twelve companions and established Luxeuil Abbey on the site of a former Gallo-Roman settlement. The rule that observed at Luxeuil derived from Celtic monastic traditions. His severity and the inflexible rule he had established may have contributed to friction with the Burgundian court. He left Gaul, and in 611 established Mehrerau Abbey with a second monastery for nuns nearby. In 614, he established Bobbio Abbey on land donated by the Lombard king Agilulf.

Rule of Columbanus The Rule of Saint Columbanus embodied the customs of Bangor Abbey and other Irish monasteries. In the first chapter, Columbanus introduces the great principle of his Rule: obedience, absolute and unreserved. One manifestation of this obedience was hard labour designed to subdue the flesh, exercise the will in daily self-denial, and set an example of industry in cultivation of the soil. Columbanus presents mortification as an essential element in the lives of monks, who are instructed to defeat pride by obeying without murmuring and hesitation.\\" Columbanus' Rule regarding diet was very strict. Monks were to eat a limited diet of beans, vegetables, flour mixed with water and small bread of a loaf, taken in the evenings.O'Hara, Alexander. (2018). Jonas of Bobbio and the Legacy of Columbanus.

Truro: Dean & Chapter; p. 105 Benedictine monasticism  In 516, Benedict of Nursia wrote a Rule for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot. Benedict adapted earlier monastic traditions to his own time. Jerome Thiesen O.S.B., cites as influences: the writings of St. Pachomius, St. Basil the Great, St. Augustine, John Cassian, and most especially the Rule of the Master, an anonymous rule written two or three decades before Benedict's. Use of the Columban Rule was widespread in congregations in Francia established either by Columbanus himself or his followers. At the same time the Rule of St. Benedict spread northward from southern Italy. By 640 both rules had been in long use at Bobbio.\\"Codice diplomatico del monastero di S. Colombano di Bobbio I\\", Fonti per la storia d‚ÄôItalia, (C. Cipolla,ed.)52 (Rome 1918) ¬ßXIII 104‚Äì12. Abbot Waldebert of Luxeuil combined portions of both for the rule he drew up for the nuns of Faremoutiers Abbey. Donatus of Besancon combined elements from the Rule of Benedict, the Rule of Caesarius of Arles and Columbanus' Rule for the monastery his mother founded.Diem, Albrecht.\\"New ideas expressed in old words: the Regula Donati on female monastic life and monastic spirituality\\", in: Viator 43:1 (2012), pp. 1‚Äì38. The Rule of Saint Columbanus was approved of by the Fourth Council of M√¢con in 627, but it was superseded at the close of the century by the Rule of Saint Benedict. For several centuries in some of the greater monasteries the two rules were observed conjointly. From the 7th century important monasteries following the Benedictine Rule were established in the north of England, at Hexham, at Whitby, and at Wearmouth and Jarrow in County Durham. =The Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Monkwearmouth‚ÄìJarrow= Benedict Biscop was a young noble at the court of Oswiu of Berenicia. In 653, at the age of twenty- five, he made his first pilgrimage to Rome to pray at the tombs of SS. Peter and Paul. Twelve years later, he returned to Rome, and on his return stopped at L√©rins Abbey and became a Benedictine monk, taking the \\"Benedict\\". In 669, while again in Rome, he was assigned to accompany the new Archbishop of Canterbury Theodore of Tarsus to England as interpreter. Theodore named Biscop abbot of SS. Peter and Paul's, in Canterbury. In 674 Biscop founded St Peter's Abbey at Wearmouth on land given by King Ecgfrith of Northumbria.\\"History\\", St. Peters, Wearmouth-Jarrow He traveled to Francia to bring back stonemasons and glassworkers to construct a monastery in the Pre-Romanesque style. It was one of the first stone buildings in Northumbria since the Roman period.\\"History of St. Paul's Jarrow\\", English Heritage The king was so pleased that seven years later, he donated additional land for the Abbey of St. Paul of Tarsus seven miles away at Jarrow. Biscop staffed Jarrow with monks from Monkwearmouth, and asked Ceolfrith to serve as abbot. One of those who relocated from Monkwearmouth was Ceolfrith's student Bede. Biscop envisioned the abbeys as a double monastery and Ceolfrith eventually became abbot overseeing both locations. St. Peter's had a stained glassworks near the River Wear. Craft and industrial activity (such as metal- and glass-working) were carried out at St. Paul's near the River Tyne. The Abbey Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Monkwearmouth‚ÄìJarrow had an extensive library of books collected by Biscop during his trips to the continent. Ceolfrith added to the collection. The scriptorium developed a faster script in order to keep up with demand from across Europe for copies of its scholarly output. Physic gardens (700AD), which were gardens of medicinal or healing herb, were placed in squares surrounded by monastic cloisters. Later, these gardens added culinary herbs and orchards of unusual fruits and nuts trees.

Glider pilots use GNSS Flight Recorders to log GNSS data verifying their arrival at turn points in gliding competitions, and for information to aid en route decision making for cross-country soaring. *Boats and ships can use GNSS to navigate all of the world's lakes, seas and oceans. Maritime GNSS units include functions useful on water, such as \\"man overboard\\" (MOB) functions that allow instantly marking the location where a person has fallen overboard, which simplifies rescue efforts. GNSS may be connected to the ships self-steering gear and Chartplotters using the NMEA 0183 interface. GNSS can also improve the security of shipping traffic by enabling AIS. A GPS unit showing basic way point and tracking information which is typically required for outdoor sport and recreational use *Heavy equipment can use GNSS in construction, mining and precision agriculture. The blades and buckets of construction equipment are controlled automatically in GNSS-based machine guidance systems. Agricultural equipment may use GNSS to steer automatically, or as a visual aid displayed on a screen for the driver. This is useful for controlled traffic and row crop operations and when spraying. Harvesters with yield monitors can also use GNSS to create a yield map of the paddock being harvested. *Cyclists often use GNSS in racing and touring. GNSS navigation allows cyclists to plot their course in advance and follow this course, which may include quieter, narrower streets, without having to stop frequently to refer to separate maps. GNSS receivers designed specifically for cycling may include sophisticated 'street-aware' mapping features, or may be oriented towards recording the progress of the cyclist along the route. This data can be reviewed after the ride to inform the rider's training or competition planning, or uploaded to online services which allow riders to view and compare each other's rides. *Hikers, climbers, and even ordinary pedestrians in urban or rural environments can use GNSS to determine their position, with or without reference to separate maps. In isolated areas, the ability of GNSS to provide a precise position can greatly enhance the chances of rescue when climbers or hikers are disabled or lost (if they have a means of communication with rescue workers). *GNSS equipment for the visually impaired is available. *Spacecraft are beginning to use GNSS as a navigational tool. The addition of a GNSS receiver to a spacecraft allows precise orbit determination without ground tracking. This, in turn, enables autonomous spacecraft navigation, formation flying, and autonomous rendezvous. The use of GNSS in MEO, GEO, HEO, and highly elliptical orbits is feasible only if the receiver can acquire and track the much weaker (15 - 20 dB) GNSS side-lobe signals. This design constraint, and the radiation environment found in space, prevents the use of COTS receivers. It is easier for Low earth orbit satellites to use GNSS. One such constellation operated by Orbcomm uses GPS receivers on all satellites., Orbcomm China has performed some experiments using cheap COTS single-frequency GPS receivers installed on Yaogan-30 (YG30; LEO) series and Fengyun-3C (FY3C; SSO) satellites with favorable results; using multiple systems at once helps with the polar orbits of FY3C by allowing more GNSS satellites to be visible.  Surveying and mapping  *Mapping and geographic information systems (GIS) ‚Äî Most mapping grade GNSS receivers use the carrier wave data from only the L1 frequency, but have a precise crystal oscillator which reduces errors related to receiver clock jitter. This allows positioning errors on the order of one meter or less in real-time, with a differential GNSS signal received using a separate radio receiver. By storing the carrier phase measurements and differentially post-processing the data, positioning errors on the order of 10 centimeters are possible with these receivers. **Several projects, including OpenStreetMap and TierraWiki, allow users to create maps collaboratively, much like a wiki, using consumer-grade GPS receivers. *Geophysics and geology ‚Äî High precision measurements of crustal strain can be made with differential GNSS by finding the relative displacement between GNSS sensors. Multiple stations situated around an actively deforming area (such as a volcano or fault zone) can be used to find strain and ground movement. These measurements can then be used to interpret the cause of the deformation, such as a dike or sill beneath the surface of an active volcano. *Archaeology ‚Äî As archaeologists excavate a site, they generally make a three-dimensional map of the site, detailing where each artifact is found. *Surveying ‚Äî Survey-Grade GNSS receivers can be used to position survey markers, buildings, and road construction. These units use the signal from both the L1 and L2 GPS frequencies. Even though the L2 code data are encrypted, the signal's carrier wave enables correction of some ionospheric errors. These dual-frequency GPS receivers typically cost US$10,000 or more, but can have positioning errors on the order of one centimetre or less when used in carrier phase differential GPS mode. *Survey- grade GNSS receiver industry include a relatively small number of major players who specialize in the design of complex dual-frequency GNSS receivers capable of precise tracking of carrier phases for all or most of available signals in order to bring the accuracy of relative positioning down to cm- level values required by these applications. The most known companies are Javad, Leica, NovAtel, Septentrio, Topcon and Trimble.  Other uses  * Military precision-guided munitions ‚Äì Many types of munitions, including JDAM bombs, Excalibur 155 mm artillery shell, use GNSS to guide them to their target. * Precise time reference ‚Äì Many systems that must be accurately synchronized use GNSS as a source of accurate time. GNSS can be used as a reference clock for time code generators or Network Time Protocol (NTP) time servers. Sensors (for seismology or other monitoring application) can use GNSS as a precise time source. Time-division multiple access (TDMA) communications networks often rely on this precise timing to synchronize RF generating equipment, network equipment, and multiplexers. * Mobile satellite communications ‚Äì Satellite communications systems use a directional antenna (usually a \\"dish\\") pointed at a satellite. The antenna on a moving ship or train, for example, must be pointed based on its current location. Modern antenna controllers usually incorporate a GNSS receiver to provide this information. * Emergency and location-based services ‚Äì GNSS functionality can be used by emergency services to locate cell phones. The ability to locate a mobile phone is required in the United States by E911 emergency services legislation. However, such a system is not in place everywhere. GNSS is less dependent on the telecommunications network topology than radiolocation for compatible phones. Assisted GPS reduces the power requirements of the mobile phone and increases the accuracy of the location. A phone's geographic location may also be used to provide location-based services, including advertising or other location-specific information. ** Location-based games ‚Äì The availability of hand-held GNSS receivers has led to games such as geocaching, which involves using a hand-held GNSS unit to travel to a specific longitude and latitude to search for objects hidden by other geocachers. This popular activity often includes walking or hiking to natural locations. Geodashing is an outdoor sport using waypoints. ** Marketing ‚Äì Some market research companies have combined GIS systems and survey-based research to help companies to decide where to open new branches and to target their advertising according to the usage patterns of roads and the socio-demographic attributes of residential zones. *Aircraft passengers ‚Äì Most airlines allow passenger use of GNSS units on their flights, except during landing and take-off, when other electronic devices are also restricted. Even though consumer GNSS receivers have a minimal risk of interference, a few airlines disallow use of hand-held receivers during flight. Other airlines integrate aircraft tracking into the seat-back television entertainment system, available to all passengers even during takeoff and landing.Joe Mehaffey. Is it Safe to use a handheld GPS Receiver on a Commercial Aircraft?. Accessed May 15, 2006. *Heading information ‚Äì The GNSS can be used to determine heading information, even though it was not designed for this purpose. A \\"GNSS compass\\" uses a pair of antennas separated by about 50 cm to detect the phase difference in the carrier signal from a particular GNSS satellite.JLR-10 GPS Compass. Accessed January 6, 2007. Given the positions of the satellite, the position of the antenna, and the phase difference, the orientation of the two antennas can be computed. More expensive GNSS compass systems use three antennas in a triangle to get three separate readings with respect to each satellite. A GNSS compass is not subject to magnetic declination as a magnetic compass is and does not need to be reset periodically like a gyrocompass. It is, however, subject to multipath effects. * GPS tracking systems use GNSS to determine the location of a vehicle, person, pet or freight, and to record the position at regular intervals in order to create a log of movements. The data can be stored inside the unit or sent to a remote computer by radio or cellular modem. Some systems allow the location to be viewed in real time on the Internet with a web browser. ** Monitoring the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders, using a GPS anklet as a condition of parole. Law-enforcement officials can review the daily movements of offenders for a cost of only $5 or $10 per day. Real-time, or instant, tracking is considered too costly for GPS tracking of criminals.GPS FAQ. * Geo-fences can enable or disable devices based on their location. * GNSS road pricing systems charge of road users using data from GNSS sensors inside vehicles. Advocates argue that road pricing using GNSS permits a number of policies such as tolling by distance on urban roads and can be used for many other applications in parking, insurance and vehicle emissions. Critics argue that GNSS could lead to an invasion of people‚Äôs privacy. * Weather prediction ‚Äì Measurement of atmospheric bending of GNSS satellite signals by specialized GNSS receivers in orbital satellites can be used to determine atmospheric conditions such as air density, temperature, moisture and electron density. Such information from a set of six micro- satellites, launched in April 2006, called the Constellation of Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate COSMIC has been proven to improve the accuracy of weather prediction models. * Photographic geocoding ‚Äì Combining GNSS position data with photographs taken with a (typically digital) camera allows to view the photographs on a mapmap or to look up the locations where they were taken in a gazetteer. It is possible to automatically annotate the photographs with the location they depict by integrating a GNSS device into the camera so that co-ordinates are embedded into photographs as Exif metadata. Alternatively, the timestamps of pictures can be correlated with a GNSS track log.Diomidis Spinellis. Position-annotated photographs: A geotemporal web.

In IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo, ICME 2005, pages 390‚Äì393, 2005. () * Skydiving ‚Äì Most commercial drop zones use a GNSS to aid the pilot to \\"spot\\" the plane to the correct position to allow all skydivers on the load to be able to fly their canopies back to the landing area. *Wireless networking ‚Äì A technique of mapping and uploading the exact or accurate location of a wireless network is called wardriving. It uses signal-strength data from the wireless adapter and GPS to identify the location. Kismet for Linux is a widely used wardriving program. *Wreck diving ‚Äì A popular variant of scuba diving is known as wreck diving. In order to locate the desired shipwreck on the bottom of the ocean floor, GPS is used to navigate to the approximate location, and then the shipwreck is found using an echosounder. * Social networking ‚Äì A growing number of companies are marketing cellular phones equipped with GPS technology, offering the ability to pinpoint friends on custom created maps, along with alerts that inform the user when the party is within a programmed range. Not only do many of these phones offer social- networking functions, they offer standard GPS navigation features such as audible voice commands for in-vehicle GPS navigation.  References  :6.

It is by the author Hans Peter Richter. Friedrich was first printed in 1961.https://archive.org/details/friedrich00rich/page/n5/mode/2up Plot Overview Friedrich Schneider is a young Jewish boy growing up in an apartment house in Germany, with the narrator as his neighbour and friend. The story starts in 1925 and finishes in 1942 when the narrator is 17. Though the story is told by his non-Jewish friend (Hans Peter Richter or the narrator), Friedrich is the protagonist. We can assume he is Hans Peter Richter. The narrator tells of the persecution of the Jews through Friedrich's eyes. Friedrich is forced to switch to a Jewish school and is thrown out of swimming pools and movie theaters. An angry mob goes to his house and kills his mother (see Pogrom). His father gets fired and has an emotional breakdown. Friedrich finds a girlfriend, Helga, whom he likes, but soon he must stop seeing her, or she will be sent to a concentration camp. Friedrich and his father are forced to do whatever they can to make money to survive. Friedrich helps his father hide a rabbi in their house, but soon Friedrich's father and the rabbi are arrested, and Herr Schneider was probably sent to a concentration camp. Friedrich, who was not home when the police came, now must live in hiding. During an air raid, Friedrich begs to be allowed into the air raid shelter but is kicked out by the air-raid warden, Herr Resch, who was also their landlord. After the raid, the narrator, his family, Herr Resch, and his wife return to the house. They notice Friedrich on the stoop, apparently unconscious. Herr Resch decides to get rid of him by kicking him, and they realise that Friedrich is dead, killed by shrapnel (not specified). Resch then remarks that Friedrich has died a better death than was expected. = Setting the Scene (1925) = The novel begins with the introduction of a garden gnome named Polycarp. The narrator talks about how he and Friedrich never met: their parents lived in a different apartment building, which was owned by a man named Herr Johann Resch. At first, the Schneiders and the narrator's family were more and dangerous where he can not have in his life because he is dealing with so much already acquaintances, but with the births of the narrator and Friedrich a week apart, they become better friends. The Schneiders' religion is not revealed in this chapter, though it is assumed they are Christian because of how well-off they are. The narrator's father is unemployed, and the birth of the narrator puts a financial strain on his family. However, the narrator is still well received and feels welcomed in his home. = Potato Pancakes (1929) = One day when Friedrich and the narrator are four years old, Friedrich stays with the narrator's family while his mother attends to some business at City Hall. At first, the narrator is reluctant to share his toys with Friedrich and blocks the way to his room, but Friedrich doesn't seem to mind. He takes out a cuckoo whistle and begins blowing into it, and the narrator is fascinated by it. Friedrich gives him the whistle, and the narrator allows Friedrich to play with his toys. They later help the narrator's mother to make potato pancakes, and eventually, both children fight for the first pancake. When Friedrich drops the pancake, they decided to share and eat it from the ground. Because of the mess, the mother allows them to take a bath together, an activity both enjoy very much. This becomes the foundation of their friendship. = Snow (1929) = With the arrival of winter, snow is everywhere, so deep only the tip of Polycarp, Herr Resch's garden gnome, shows above the mounds. Spotting Friedrich and his mother out playing in the snow, the narrator urges his mother to hurry and take him outside. However, his mother is busy with her work, and when she has finally completed it, she goes out with the narrator to play in the snow. = Grandfather (1930) = Hans's grandfather comes to visit and learns of Han's interactions with the Jewish Friedrich. Han's grandfather forbids Hans from playing with Friedrich anymore, although nobody listens. = Friday Evening (1930) = Hans sits in on the majority of a traditional Friday night Jewish tradition (the Sabbath) after playing with Friedrich all day. He gets to see how the Jewish people worship and what they do at the Sabbath dinner. Hans leaves politely shortly after Hans' Mother comes home. = School Begins (1931) = On the first day of school, shortly after school lets out, Hans and Friedrich's families both have a day out at the amusement park. However, since Hans and his family are poor, they are helpless to Schneider's generosity, which makes them feel even poorer. When Hans' father finally jumps at the chance to buy them all photos and licorice, the family has to go without lunch. = The Way to School (1933) = Friedrich and Hans see a doctors' sign with \\"Jew\\" scrawled over it, they go to tell the doctor, but he already knows. They see a crowd of people outside a shop, so they push through and see a man with a swastika on his arm and a sign stating \\"don't buy from Jews\\" blocking the door. An old lady pushes past the man saying she wants to buy from the shop and everyone stares at her. = The Jungvolk (1933) = Hans and Friedrich attend a Hitler Youth camp. The leader explains why the Jews are Germany's enemy. While every other youth can repeat this mantra with no problem, Friedrich finds it hard to repeat. This is the first time Friedrich discovers Hitler's hatred for Jews. He is devastated. He runs out, and Hans is left watching. = The Ball (1933) = Hans and Friedrich were playing with a ball when Hans accidentally threw it into a shopkeeper's window, breaking it. A crowd gathers around. The woman accuses Friedrich of breaking her shop window and trying to steal and insulted him for being a Jew. Hans immediately confessed to breaking her window and denied that Friedrich was trying to steal. The woman disbelieved him. Someone had called the police, and the woman explained the attempted 'burglary' of her shop, while Hans defended Friedrich. Then, Herr Schneider came and the woman explained the situation to him, leaving out her insinuation about Jews. Herr Schneider agreed to pay her for the damage, if the police let Friedrich free. = Conversation On The Stairs (1933) = Herr Resch confronts Herr Schneider on the house's stairwell and asks them to leave, calling Hans' Father to bear witness. Hans' father denied. Herr Schneider reminds Herr Resch of the tenant's agreement, but Herr Resch doesn't care. Herr Schneider begs for time to find another apartment. = Herr Schneider (1933) = Herr Schneider loses his job because he is a Jew. = The Hearing (1933) = Herr Resch sues Herr Schneider and tries to make him to move out of the apartment. In the court, the attorney of Herr Resch reveals that Herr Schneider is a Jew. However, Herr Schneider also reveals that he lived in Herr Resch's house for ten years and Herr Resch did not find anything wrong with that until a short time ago. In the end, Herr Schneider is allowed to continue staying in the house. At this point, Friedrich suddenly cries out. The judge calls Friedrich up and assured him that he will see that justice is done.  Reception  The novel won the Batchelder Award in 1972.

Biography Born in Guelph, Ontario, Somerville grew up in a musical family in the nearby farming village of Rockwood, 50 miles west of Toronto. In 1947, at the age of 14, he moved to Toronto with his parents and brother Marc, where he entered Central Tech to study architecture and building construction. He changed the focus of his studies to radio, and in 1952, at the age of 19, secured a position at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in the engineering department as a radio operator while concurrently studying voice with Dr. Ernesto Vinci at the University of Toronto‚Äôs Royal Conservatory of Music. =Years with the Diamonds= Formation of the Diamonds In the hallway of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during the fall of 1953, Somerville met by chance an unnamed quartet (Stan Fisher, Ted Kowalski, Phil Levitt and Bill Reed) and soon became their vocal coach. Later that year when Fisher opted for college, Dave became the group‚Äôs lead singer. That quartet became The Diamonds. Prominence On August 1, 1955, the group tied for first place on Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts in New York City. In February 1956 with the recommendation of Cleveland‚Äôs genius DJ, Dr. Bill Randle, they signed a long-term contract with Mercury Records. Somerville performed eight years with The Diamonds, singing lead on all sixteen of their Billboard chart selections, peaking with the song \\"Little Darlin';\\" for eight weeks, this selection remained at #2 on the charts, becoming the third best selling single record of 1957. Multiple appearances on American Bandstand, The Perry Como Show, and The Steve Allen Show increased Dave's visibility. In August 1961, he left The Diamonds. =Career after the Diamonds= The 1960s, including the \\"David Troy\\" years After leaving the Diamonds, Somerville married Judy Corns of Evansville, Indiana, and began a six-year solo career as a folk artist, using the stage name David Troy. During this period, Somerville also studied acting, with Leonard Nimoy as his teacher, and made numerous guest- starring appearances, often credited as \\"David Troy\\", on various television programs. Around this time, he became one of the clients of the William Morris Agency, which has since merged with the Endeavor Talent Agency to become the present-day William Morris-Endeavor agency. As such, he did extensive voice- over work and was heard in hundreds of radio, television and cable advertisements. In 1967, Dave joined The Four Preps as a replacement for Ed Cobb, the original bass singer. In 1969, he and Bruce Belland, the Four Preps's original lead singer, concentrated on a folk/comedy act as the duo of Belland & Somerville. As such, they appeared in concert with Henry Mancini and Johnny Mathis and were regulars on The Tim Conway Show, a CBS-TV prime-time comedy series. As songwriters, Bruce and Dave co-wrote \\"The Troublemaker,\\" which became the title track of two Willie Nelson albums; and the duo sang in a later roster of the Four Preps with Jim Pike of The Lettermen. 1970s and 1980s In 1972, Somerville formed the group WW Fancy, which also included Keith Barbour and Gail Jensen as members. In the late 1980s, he again sang with original members of The Diamonds and also returned to The Four Preps with Bruce Belland, Ed Cobb and Jim Yester of The Association. In 1972, Somerville sang background vocals along with The Blossoms in B. J. Thomas' version of \\"Rock and Roll Lullaby\\". Somerville's song \\"The (Ballad of the) Unknown Stuntman,\\" jointly written and composed with Jensen, inspired Glen Larson, who had been the Four Preps's original baritone vocalist, to create the central characters and develop the core format of The Fall Guy, starring Lee Majors, for 20th Century Fox Television, which became a highly successful television series for ABC-TV. With additional lyrics which Larson wrote for it, \\"The Unknown Stuntman\\" became the theme for The Fall Guy. Somerville's own home in the Hollywood Hills was used as the set for the home of Majors' character, Colt Seavers. 1990s and beyond His first children's album was titled The Cosmic Adventures of Diamond Dave. It contained many original songs and characters and received critical acclaim in the U.S. and Canada. The Diamonds have been honored and inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame, The Doo Wop Hall of Fame, The Rockabilly Hall of Fame and are recipients of Canada's Juno Award. Somerville's last stage show, On The 1957 Rock & Roll Greyhound Bus, was based on rock and roll‚Äôs first major tour. In it, he told road stories and sang the songs of such pioneer jukebox giants as Buddy Holly & The Crickets, Fats Domino, The Everly Brothers, and Chuck Berry. Family In 1967, Somerville's only child from his marriage to Corns, David Orlando Somerville, was born. Death Somerville died of pancreatic cancer in Santa Barbara, California on July 14, 2015 at the age of 81.

When the Kingdom of Portugal came under the rule of King Philip II of Spain (Philip I of Portugal), in 1580, the Portuguese had just finished building a large galleon named S√£o Martinho. She was known by Castilians as San Mart√≠n. At the time of forming the Spanish Armada, S√£o Martinho was found to be the best of the fleet and was chosen as the flagship of the Armada commander-in-chief, Duke of Medina Sidonia. S√£o Martinho had an overall length of about 180 feet with a beam of about 40 feet. She carried 48 heavy guns on two enclosed gun decks, plus multiple smaller weapons. According to a painting by Hendrik Cornelisz Vroom, National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, S√£o Martinho had three masts, two square-rigged masts and a lateen mizzen-mast. She was shown with a stern gallery and with the long beakhead characteristic of a galleon. The foremast was set forward of the forecastle. The S√£o Martinho and his squad played a crucial role in defending the armada throughout the English Channel. An example was the fighting of July 31 to August 2, 1588, from the English coast to Calais, such as the rescue ordered by Medina Sidonia of the galleon S√£o Jo√£o, commanded by Juan Martinez de Recalde, that after repairs and trying to join the formation, was intercepted and faced alone 12 English galleons and race galleons. In the process, the S√£o Martinho fought, virtually isolated, for one hour, 15 English galleons. Howard, however, opted to kept some distance, preventing further approach and giving up the fight in duels of gunfire from both sides. \\"The Armada\\" by Garrett Mattinglyn - Mariner Books; Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2005 S√£o Martinho had suffered already heavy damage in the battle of Gravelines in July 1588 when a group of English ships led by Sir Francis Drake in bore down upon her. With the assistance of the galleon S√£o Mateus she escaped the attack and led the Armada back to Spain through a ferocious storm, where she had to be towed into port at Santander. Because of a storm, S√£o Martinho had to take refuge at Laredo, where Medina Sidonia found the galleass Napolitana and other ships in harbor. The ship was full of sick crew and was itself in sad condition.

Its mission is to build and maintain roads and bridges and administer mass transit services. By state law, the SCDOT's function and purpose is the systematic planning, construction, maintenance, and operation of the state highway system and the development of a statewide mass transit system that is consistent with the needs and desires of the public. The SCDOT also coordinates all state and federal programs relating to highways. The goal of the SCDOT is to provide adequate, safe, and efficient transportation services for the movement of people and goods. History The South Carolina Department of Transportation is still familiarly known as the Highway Department, which is what the agency was called until May 13, 1977 when an act of the South Carolina General Assembly reformed the agency as the Department of Highways and Public Transportation (SCDHPT). The current name, the Department of Transportation, was established in the State Government Restructuring Act of 1993. This act split functions of the SCDHPT to establish the SCDOT and the Department of Public Safety. The roots of the state agency trace back to the establishment of a five-member highway commission in 1917. Prior to 1917, county governments were entirely responsible for building and maintaining roads. The Federal Aid Road Act of 1916 and the promise of federal money to build highways served as the impetus for the creation of the commission. However, the commission lacked \\"the authority to designate roads to be improved with federal funds and the power to supervise directly the work being done\\".Hammond, p. 47. Organization =Commission and Secretary= The SCDOT is a department of the state government in the executive branch that reports to a cabinet secretary and a seven-member commission. The Governor appoints one member of the commission and the Secretary of Transportation, who is a member of the Governor's cabinet. The current secretary is Christy A. Hall.scdot.org The other six commissioners each represent a district. The commission districts coincide with the congressional districts of South Carolina. The commissioner is appointed for a term of four years by legislative delegation for that district, that is, the members of the General Assembly that represent voters in that district. The chairman is selected from among all seven members by a vote of the commission. The secretary hires the division heads, who are known as Deputy Secretaries. =Divisions of the SCDOT= The SCDOT has at least three divisions: Engineering, Intermodal Planning, and Finance and Procurement. The SCDOT is a centralized government agency. Planning, design, procurement, finance, and human resource functions all operate from the central office, or headquarters, in the state capitol of Columbia. The headquarters building is named for Silas N. Pearman, a former state highway engineer and chief commissioner of the agency. Intermodal Planning Division The Intermodal Planning Division comprises the Department of Planning and the Office of Public Transit. The latter oversees and supports the development of a mass transit system and administers the state and federal aid mass transit program. Engineering Division The Engineering division is the largest part of the agency. The Deputy Secretary for this division is traditionally known as the State Highway Engineer. The current Deputy Secretary is Leland Colvin.Leland Colvin This position is generally recognized as the second-ranking person in the agency. Finance and Procurement Division The Division of Finance and Procurement is responsible for the federal aid reimbursements and other financial matters of the agency. Engineering Districts The SCDOT field offices are divided into seven districts headed by a District Engineering Administrator. The engineering district lines do not follow the same lines as the commission districts. Each District has responsibility for the maintenance, construction, traffic, and equipment (mechanical) operations within its boundaries. A district will oversee six to eight counties. District offices are located in Columbia (District #1), Greenwood (#2), Greenville (#3), Chester, (#4), Florence (#5), Charleston (#6), Orangeburg (#7).

Around 350 BCE, Aristotle and other philosophers of the time attempted to explain the aerodynamics of avian flight. Even after the discovery of the ancestral bird Archaeopteryx over 150 years ago, debates still persist regarding the evolution of flight. There are three leading hypotheses pertaining to avian flight: Pouncing Proavis model, Cursorial model, and Arboreal model. In March 2018, scientists reported that Archaeopteryx was likely capable of flight, but in a manner substantially different from that of modern birds. Flight characteristics For flight to occur in Aves, four physical forces (thrust and drag, lift and weight) must be favorably combined. In order for birds to balance these forces, certain physical characteristics are required. Asymmetrical wings, found on all flying birds with the exception of hummingbirds, help in the production of thrust and lift. Anything that moves through the air produces drag due to friction. The aerodynamic body of a bird can reduce drag, but when stopping or slowing down a bird will use its tail and feet to increase drag. Weight is the largest obstacle birds must overcome in order to fly. An animal can more easily attain flight by reducing its absolute weight. Birds evolved from other theropod dinosaurs that had already gone through a phase of size reduction during the Middle Jurassic, combined with rapid evolutionary changes. Flying birds during their evolution further reduced relative weight through several characteristics such as the loss of teeth, gonadal hypertrophy, and fusion of bones. Teeth were replaced by a lightweight bill made of keratin, the food being processed by the bird's gizzard. Other advanced physical characteristics evolved for flight are a keel for the attachment of flight muscles and an enlarged cerebellum for fine motor coordination. These were gradual changes, though, and not strict conditions for flight: the first birds had teeth, at best a small keel and relatively unfused bones. Pneumatic bone, that is hollow or filled with air sacs, has often been seen as an adaptation reducing weight, but it was already present in non-flying dinosaurs, and birds on average do not have a lighter skeleton than mammals of the same size. The same is true for the furcula, a bone which enhances skeletal bracing for the stresses of flight. The mechanics of an avian's wings involve a complex interworking of forces, particularly at the shoulder where most of the wings' motions take place. These functions depend on a precise balance of forces from the muscles, ligaments, and articular cartilages as well as inertial, gravitational, and aerodynamic loads on the wing. Birds have two main muscles in their wing that are responsible for flight: the pectoralis and the supracoracoideus. The pectoralis is the largest muscle in the wing and is the primary depressor and pronator of the wing. The supracoracoideus is the second largest and is the primary elevator and supinator. In addition, there are distal wing muscles that assist the bird in flight. Prior to their existence on birds, feathers were present on the bodies of many dinosaur species. Through natural selection, feathers became more common among the animals as their wings developed over the course of tens of millions of years. The smooth surface of feathers on a bird's body helps to reduce friction while in flight. The tail, also consisting of feathers, helps the bird to maneuver and glide. Hypotheses =Pouncing Proavis model= A theory of a pouncing proavis was first proposed by Garner, Taylor, and Thomas in 1999: > We propose that birds evolved from predators that specialized in ambush from > elevated sites, using their raptorial hindlimbs in a leaping attack. > Drag‚Äìbased, and later lift-based, mechanisms evolved under selection for > improved control of body position and locomotion during the aerial part of > the attack. Selection for enhanced lift-based control led to improved lift > coefficients, incidentally turning a pounce into a swoop as lift production > increased. Selection for greater swooping range would finally lead to the > origin of true flight. The authors believed that this theory had four main virtues: *It predicts the observed sequence of character acquisition in avian evolution. *It predicts an Archaeopteryx-like animal, with a skeleton more or less identical to terrestrial theropods, with few adaptations to flapping, but very advanced aerodynamic asymmetrical feathers. *It explains that primitive pouncers (perhaps like Microraptor) could coexist with more advanced fliers (like Confuciusornis or Sapeornis) since they did not compete for flying niches. *It explains that the evolution of elongated rachis-bearing feathers began with simple forms that produced a benefit by increasing drag. Later, more refined feather shapes could begin to also provide lift. =Cursorial model= A cursorial, or \\"running\\" model was originally proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston in 1879. This theory states that \\"flight evolved in running bipeds through a series of short jumps\\". As the length of the jumps extended, the wings were used not only for thrust but also for stability, and eventually eliminated the gliding intermediate. This theory was modified in the 1970s by John Ostrom to describe the use of wings as an insect-foraging mechanism which then evolved into a wing stroke. Research was conducted by comparing the amount of energy expended by each hunting method with the amount of food gathered. The potential hunting volume doubles by running and jumping. To gather the same volume of food, Archaeopteryx would expend less energy by running and jumping than by running alone. Therefore, the cost/benefit ratio would be more favorable for this model. Due to Archaeopteryx's long and erect leg, supporters of this model say the species was a terrestrial bird. This characteristic allows for more strength and stability in the hindlimbs. Thrust produced by the wings coupled with propulsion in the legs generates the minimum velocity required to achieve flight. This wing motion is thought to have evolved from asymmetrical propulsion flapping motion. Thus, through these mechanisms, Archaeopteryx was able to achieve flight from the ground up. Although the evidence in favor of this model is scientifically plausible, the evidence against it is substantial. For instance, a cursorial flight model would be energetically less favorable when compared to the alternative hypotheses. In order to achieve liftoff, Archaeopteryx would have to run faster than modern birds by a factor of three, due to its weight. Furthermore, the mass of Archaeopteryx versus the distance needed for minimum velocity to obtain liftoff speed is proportional, therefore, as mass increases, the energy required for takeoff increases. Other research has shown that the physics involved in cursorial flight would not make this a likely answer to the origin of avian flight. Once flight speed is obtained and Archaeopteryx is in the air, drag would cause the velocity to instantaneously decrease; balance could not be maintained due to this immediate reduction in velocity. Hence, Archaeopteryx would have a very short and ineffective flight. In contrast to Ostrom's theory regarding flight as a hunting mechanism, physics again does not support this model. In order to effectively trap insects with the wings, Archaeopteryx would require a mechanism such as holes in the wings to reduce air resistance. Without this mechanism, the cost/benefit ratio would not be feasible. The decrease in efficiency when looking at the cursorial model is caused by the flapping stroke needed to achieve flight. This stroke motion needs both wings to move in a symmetrical motion, or together. This is opposed to an asymmetrical motion like that in humans' arms while running. The symmetrical motion would be costly in the cursorial model because it would be difficult while running on the ground, compared to the arboreal model where it is natural for an animal to move both arms together when falling. There is also a large fitness reduction between the two extremes of asymmetrical and symmetrical flapping motion so the theropods would have evolved to one of the extremes. =Wing-assisted incline running= The WAIR hypothesis, a version of the \\"cursorial model\\" of the evolution of avian flight, in which birds' wings originated from forelimb modifications that provided downforce, enabling the proto-birds to run up extremely steep slopes such as the trunks of trees, was prompted by observation of young chukar chicks, and proposes that wings developed their aerodynamic functions as a result of the need to run quickly up very steep slopes such as tree trunks, for example to escape from predators. Note that in this scenario birds need downforce to give their feet increased grip. Summarized in It has been argued that early birds, including Archaeopteryx, lacked the shoulder mechanism by which modern birds' wings produce swift, powerful upstrokes; since the downforce on which WAIR depends is generated by upstrokes, it seems that early birds were incapable of WAIR. However, a study that found lift generated from wings to be the primary factor for successfully accelerating a body toward a substrate during WAIR indicated the onset of flight ability was constrained by neuromuscular control or power output rather than by external wing morphology itself and that partially developed wings not yet capable of flight could indeed provide useful lift during WAIR. Additionally, examination of the work and power requirements for extant bird pectoralis contractile behavior during WAIR at different angles of substrate incline demonstrated incremental increases in these requirements, both as WAIR angles increased and in the transition from WAIR to flapping flight. This provides a model for an evolutionary transition from terrestrial to aerial locomotion as transitional forms incrementally adapted to meet the work and power requirements to scale steeper and steeper inclines using WAIR and the incremental increases from WAIR to flight. Birds use wing-assisted inclined running from the day they hatch to increase locomotion. This can also be said for birds or feathered theropods whose wing muscles cannot generate enough force to fly, and shows how this behavior could have evolved to help these theropods then eventually led to flight. The progression from wing- assisted incline running to flight can be seen in the growth of birds, from when they are hatchlings to fully grown. They begin with wing-assisted incline running and slowly alter their wing strokes for flight as they grow and are able to make enough force. These transitional stages that lead to flight are both physical and behavioral. The transitions over a hatchling's life can be correlated with the evolution of flight on a macro scale. If protobirds are compared to hatchlings their physical traits such as wing size and behavior may have been similar. Flapping flight is limited by the size and muscle force of a wing. Even while using the correct model of arboreal or cursorial, protobirds' wings were not able to sustain flight, but they did most likely gain the behaviors needed for the arboreal or cursorial model like today's birds do when hatched. There are similar steps between the two. Wing-assisted incline running can also produce a useful lift in babies but is very small compared to that of juveniles and adult birds. This lift was found responsible for body acceleration when going up an incline and leads to flight as the bird grows. =Arboreal model= This model was originally proposed in 1880 by Othniel C. Marsh. The theory states Archaeopteryx was a reptilian bird that soared from tree to tree. After the leap, Archaeopteryx would then use its wings as a balancing mechanism. According to this model, Archaeopteryx developed a gliding method to conserve energy. Even though an arboreal Archaeopteryx exerts energy climbing the tree, it is able to achieve higher velocities and cover greater distances during the gliding phase, which conserves more energy in the long run than a cursorial bipedal runner. Conserving energy during the gliding phase makes this a more energy-efficient model. Therefore, the benefits gained by gliding outweigh the energy used in climbing the tree. A modern behavior model to compare against would be that of the flying squirrel. In addition to energy conservation, arboreality is generally associated positively with survival, at least in mammals. The evolutionary path between arboreality and flight has been proposed through a number of hypotheses. Dudley and Yanoviak proposed that animals that live in trees generally end up high enough that a fall, purposeful or otherwise, would generate enough speed for aerodynamic forces to have an effect on the body. Many animals, even those which do not fly, demonstrate the ability to right themselves and face the ground ventrally, then exhibiting behaviors that act against aerodynamic forces to slow their rate of descent in a process known as parachuting. Arboreal animals that were forced by predators or simply fell from trees that exhibited these kinds of behaviors would have been in a better position to eventually evolve capabilities that were more akin to flight as we know them today. Researchers in support of this model have suggested that Archaeopteryx possessed skeletal features similar to those of modern birds. The first such feature to be noted was the supposed similarity between the foot of Archaeopteryx and that of modern perching birds. The hallux, or modified of the first digit of the foot, was long thought to have pointed posterior to the remaining digits, as in perching birds. Therefore, researchers once concluded that Archaeopteryx used the hallux as a balancing mechanism on tree limbs. However, study of the Thermopolis specimen of Archeopteryx, which has the most complete foot of any known, showed that the hallux was not in fact reversed, limiting the creature's ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. Another skeletal feature that is similar in Archaeopteryx and modern birds is the curvature of the claws. Archaeopteryx possessed the same claw curvature of the foot to that of perching birds. However, the claw curvature of the hand in Archaeopteryx was similar to that in basal birds. Based upon the comparisons of modern birds to Archaeopteryx, perching characteristics were present, signifying an arboreal habitat. The ability for takeoff and flight was originally thought to require a supracoracoideus pulley system (SC). This system consists of a tendon joining the humerus and coracoid bones, allowing rotation of the humerus during the upstroke. However, this system is lacking in Archaeopteryx. Based on experiments performed by M. Sy in 1936, it was proven that the SC pulley system was not required for flight from an elevated position but was necessary for cursorial takeoff.

Recca was born the second son of ≈åka, the leader of the Hokage ninja clan that existed over 400 years ago. Recca's older half-brother, Kurei, was supposed to be the heir to the leadership because he was the eldest and was born with the ability to control fire, but Recca also exhibited the same abilities as an infant, and is declared the true heir of the Hokage leadership. In an attempt to save him during the slaughter of the Hokage ninja clan, his mother (Kager≈ç) used a forbidden technique that opened a portal that would transport him into the future, where the Flame of Recca storyline begins. :Recca's flame power is derived from eight Flame Dragons named Saiha, Nadare, Homura, Setsuna, Madoka, Rui, Kokuu, and Resshin. Recca's powers were apparently so strong that they had to be sealed with a wrist guard. In the end, the eighth dragon Resshin (actually Recca's father ≈åka) reveals that Recca's flame has no original form (something every Flame Master's flame is supposed to have, such as ≈åka's and Kurei's phoenix flame), thus Recca is the true cursed child, fated to end the Hokage. ≈åka reveals that if Recca becomes the ninth dragon, he would become \\"a stupid, useless dragon with no ability whatsoever, a waste of space inside Kurei\\". After the destruction of the Tendo Jigoku, every remaining madogu disintegrated to naught, as well as Recca and Kurei's flame powers. :His appearance varies slightly between the anime and manga, as in the manga, his hair has a red highlight and bright blue eyes, and in the anime his hair is a dull blue highlight and his eyes are a similar color. ;: :Yanagi is a teenage girl gifted with the innate ability to heal any kind of physical injury, and Recca immediately offers to serve her as her loyal ninja after seeing her compassion when she healed a severely injured puppy in a local park (in the anime series, she heals Recca after a pile of metal pipes collapsed on top of him). She is the prime objective of the series' main antagonist, K≈çran Mori, as he believes that her healing powers will help him attain eternal life. :In the manga, it is revealed that she is the reincarnation of Sakura-hime (Princess Sakura), the daughter of Oyakata and princess of Sawaki clan, who lived over 400 years before the series' actual storyline. ;: , Caitlynne Medrek (English; young F≈´ko) :F≈´ko, a tomboyish teenage girl, is Recca's childhood friend who has always aspired to defeat him in battle so that he would serve her as her ninja.

For this reason, she decides to accept the aid of Kager≈ç, who offers to lend her a powerful mad≈çgu that controls wind called in order to enable her to defeat Recca. In actuality, Kager≈ç implanted a stone in the F≈´jin that allowed her to brainwash F≈´ko, but Recca manages to defeat F≈´ko and destroy the sphere. F≈´ko ends up being friends with both Yanagi and Recca after the incident, and she also keeps the F≈´jin and wields it throughout the rest of the series. :F≈´ko is often described as tomboyish by other characters, and is often laughed at or teased when she shows or says something sensitive or feminine. F≈´ko greatly respects human life, and hates those who take it for granted. This characteristic is shown on several occasions, the first being when one of her opponents, Fujimaru, states that he would do anything and kill anyone - even women and children - to achieve victory. :F≈´ko's character design varies in the adaptations of the series. While she has brown hair and green eyes in the manga and both of the Flame of Recca video games, she has red violet hair and blue eyes in the anime series. ;: :Domon is Recca's schoolmate who is known for his prowess in physical strength and in fighting (he is referred to as by other students that he has defeated in fights). Like F≈´ko, has always wanted to defeat Recca, and the reason behind this is that F≈´ko told him that he could only challenge her if he manages to defeat Recca. He is unable to defeat Recca despite his numerous attempts, and he eventually aids the latter in defeating and rescuing F≈´ko when she is brainwashed by Kage H≈çshi. Afterward, both he and F≈´ko join forces with Recca and remain allied with him throughout the rest of the series. Domon wields the , a madogu which enhances his physical strength. Later in the series, he also wields the ), a super-sharp snapping claw on an extendable chain, and the , which transmutes his entire body into a living iron golem for brief periods. :Domon is depicted as someone who is physically strong, but intellectually inept. Another of his assets is his strong will-power, which is recognized even by one of the series' antagonists, Kurei, after Domon manages to thwart Noroi's efforts to erase his memories due to his will-power. It is openly shown that Domon is interested in F≈´ko romantically, although he is prone to getting attracted to other women as well. ;: , Mayumi Asano (Japanese: young Tokiya) :Tokiya is a second year student at Nashikiri High School, and he wields the mad≈çgu , a sword that utilizes water to create its blade and is capable of creating and controlling all three states of water (liquid, solid and gas). He is often referred to as by his last name, though his companions have made up nicknames for him, such as \\"Mi-chan\\" or \\"Mƒ´-b≈ç\\". Despite the difference in his age in the anime and manga,In the manga, Tokiya 16 years old (shown in Volume 12, Chapter 116); the same age as the series' main protagonist and their comrades. However, the booklet accompanying the anime series' second official soundtrack lists his age as 17. Tokiya wanted to take Yanagi from Recca because she looks exactly like his sister, Mifuyu Mikagami, who was murdered in front of his eyes when he was young. He uses the Hy≈çmon Ken style which was developed specifically for the Ensui and the Hy≈çma En (a madogu that also controls water, but focuses more on water in its solid form). Tokiya joins forces with Recca in attempting to rescue Yanagi from Mori K≈çran's mansion, and he continues to be part of their team throughout the rest of the series. :Tokiya in both the anime and manga is initially portrayed as callous and aloof; often insulting his teammates' abilities and intelligence. He is protective of Yanagi, who closely resembles late sister, and he is shown to be interested in her romantically in the manga. Other characters have often praise Tokiya for his intellect and composure during battle, with some going as far as to say that he might be the strongest Hokage member when it comes to normal battles. Another characteristic of his that makes him stand out among his teammates is the fact that he is more ruthless and cruel than the rest, a fact recognized by both Kurei and Mikoto, who both act as antagonists throughout most of the manga. :Certain characteristics in Tokiya's personality and appearance are different in the anime series as opposed to the manga and games. His hair is light blue in the manga and games, and brown in the anime series. In the booklet accompanying the Flame of Recca Original Soundtrack Vol. 2 CD, his age is listed as 17, while the filler page in the manga states that he is 16 years of age. Apart from these differences, Tokiya's character development in the anime is not as obvious as it is in the manga, wherein he becomes more open to emotions other than his desire for vengeance towards the end of the series. Tokiya attributes this change to his encounter with Kai, a fellow Hy≈çmon Ken practitioner, and his friends. ;: :Kaoru was once a member of Kurei's Uruha, but later, he becomes a member of Recca's team in the Ura But≈ç Satsujin. He wields the , a puzzle-like weapon that has five different forms. In the manga, the weapon also has a mysterious sixth form: \\"Mu\\" (Nothing). :Little is known of his early life, but given that in a manga flashback Kaoru was seen attempting to commit suicide, it can be assumed he was a lonely child until he met Kurei. Kaoru is the youngest member of Hokage, and as such, his personality reflects his age. Even in battle, Kaoru is playful, and sometimes has a tendency to toy with his opponents as if the battle were a game. :In the manga and video game, Koganei has blue hair and blue eyes. He wears a white T-shirt with a vest over it, as well as shorts and sneakers. He wears different sorts of street clothes throughout the rest of the manga. Under a bandanna he wears tied around his right wrist is a suicide scar. In the anime, he has brown hair and eyes, he wears a necklace with the similar color to Kogun Anki, and an attire similar to the manga and game. ;: :Kage H≈çshi, whose real name is , is the first antagonist of the series, and is later revealed to be Recca's mother. She possesses the mad≈çgu , which allows her to teleport through shadows, show people the past, and perform acts of scrying. Later in the series she is also seen wielding a and the madogu . She performed a technique called Jik≈´ry≈´ri (a technique which allows the user to travel or send another person to a different time) to save the infant Recca from being killed along with the rest of the Hokage clan. The technique, however curses the user with immortality. Antagonists ;: :KureiIn volume 8 of the manga, Kurei's name is romanized as \\"Cray\\" in the title page for chapter 068. is Recca's older half brother. He was born in 1571 (four years prior to Recca's birth), and is the firstborn son of Flame Master ≈åka and his mistress Reina. He was initially recognized as the next leader of the Hokage clan due to his innate flame powers, but the Hokage elders label him as a cursed child when his younger half-brother, Recca Hanabishi, also exhibits the same powers. Kurei was supposed to be killed in order to save the clan, but due to Kager≈ç's intervention, Kurei and his mother are exiled instead. Kurei then eventually attempts to kill Recca, and ends up imprisoned for his crime. He eventually escapes the prison when it is destroyed during Oda Nobunaga's raid on the Hokage village, and he jumps into the time portal Kager≈ç opened in order to save Recca by sending him into the future. :Kurei is then found and adopted by Tsukino Mori, the wife of one of the series' main antagonists, K≈çran Mori. K≈çran raises Kurei to become a \\"machine\\", repeatedly telling him that he does not need human emotions and that he should just throw them away. Upon seeing how much Kurei loved his mother, K≈çran has her transferred to a different house and keeps her under house arrest. When Kurei ends up falling in love with Kurenai, K≈çran Mori's adopted daughter, K≈çran has her killed. This causes Kurei to despise his adoptive father, but since K≈çran is holding his mother hostage, he obeys K≈çran's orders. :Kurei is the leader of the Uruha, a group of skilled warriors hired to serve K≈çran Mori and to assist Kurei in missions that K≈çran orders him to undertake. :Like his father and his half-brother, Kurei has the innate power to produce and manipulate fire. The main form of his flame is the , and is shown to be of a different color compared to Recca's (Kurei's flames are purple in the anime series and a different shade of red in the Flame of Recca video games). Kurei has the ability to absorb souls into his flame, and use them to produce humanoid flames that fight for him and obey his commands. The first time Kurei absorbed a soul into his flame was when he absorbed Kurenai's soul right after K≈çran killed her. The second instance of this was when he absorbed the soul of a loyal member of the Uruha named Jisho (this is not shown in neither the anime nor the video games). His power is not limited to absorbing just one soul at a time, as shown by his absorption of several souls after an opponent slaughters many men in the latter part of the manga. :Kurei is also capable of executing non-flame based techniques such as Wakemi, a technique that allows him to produce multiple, solid duplicates of himself that possess his powers and skills. In the last part of the manga, he is shown to be able to use the Jikury≈´ri, a technique that allows its user to open a portal in time. ;: :Mori is the main antagonist of the series with a resemblance to Frankenstein's monster. He is Kurei's adoptive father, and he trained Kurei to suppress his emotions and become his killing machine. He is extremely rich, and longs for eternal life so he can fully enjoy all his money. He sets up advanced cloning labs and wants to get his hands on Yanagi because he believes that her healing powers can help him achieve eternal life. In the manga, he eventually finds out about and obtains the mad≈çgu Tend≈ç Jigoku, which is said to be able to grant its wielder eternal life. ; : Renge is a clone produced in Mori's lab using Kurei's and Kurenai's genes. Her personality is of a naive little girl, and thus she follows Mori K≈çran's orders without question because she sees him as her \\"papa.\\" Among all the clones they created, Renge is the only one considered to be successful because she is the only clone that developed flame powers. She is eventually defeated and humiliated by Kurei, terrifying her and making her run to Mori for protection. Mori, who had then fused with the Tend≈ç Jigoku, betrays her and kills her through allowing the Tend≈ç Jigoku to devour her in order to absorb her flame powers. She only appears in the manga and the Flame of Recca video games. =Uruha= The Uruha is a group of composed of skilled warriors hired to protect and assist Kurei in his missions. The Uruha is divided into several smaller groups, and some of them are more loyal to and/or exclusively serve Mori K≈çran while the others remain loyal to Kurei. ; : : Mokuren is a sadistic and perverted man who was once partners with Koganei and wields the mad≈çgu Kodama, which allows him to control plants. Mokuren enjoys torturing people, especially women. After being defeated by Recca at Mori's mansion, he developed a strong hatred for him. Genjuro healed Mokuren and made him more powerful by implanting the Kodama within him using psychic surgery. Mokuren eventually becomes part of the Uruha Maboroshƒ´, and is defeated by Tokiya during the Ura But≈ç Satsujin. He has a relationship with Mikoto, but he betrays her love because of his intense hatred for Recca. ; : : Ganko's first doll animated by the mad≈çgu Kata Kugutsu, who bears a strong resemblance to her mother. When F≈´ko fought her in Kurei's mansion, she is thought to be a real person while Ganko pretended to be a doll (using the alias Primera). In the manga, F≈´ko salvages the doll from the Mori mansion's rubble and brings it to her home (where Ganko resides), and Reiran is reanimated. ; : : A giant who uses the mad≈çgu Sekich≈´, which grants him the power to control stones. After being initially defeated by Domon, Kurei decapitates him and presents his head to the Hokage. He is also the younger brother of Ga≈ç, who eventually seeks revenge for his brother's death. In the anime, he is a 200-year-old being whose perfectly capable of speech. ; , , : : Three are low-leveled Uruha fighters who attacked the Hokage during their visit to Kager≈ç's house. Each uses a mad≈çgu derived from their own names (the Kuchibashi-≈å, the Oni no Tsume and the Hizanu, respectively). They are said to be incapable of utilizing 10% of their mad≈çgu's powers, and are defeated by the Hokage. After their defeat, F≈´ko and Domon take their mad≈çgu and learn how to use them. They make a final appearance in the final arc of the manga, wherein they act as the bodyguards of Tsukino Mori. ; : A manga-only character, J-Keeper is a gigantic armored warrior initially believed to be a member of the J≈´shinshu who fights with a giant mace. He killed Magensha on orders from Kurei, and later attacked Koganei and Saicho. When Joker intervened, he suggested a team-up only to betray and critically injure Saicho. Joker then easily stopped one of J-Keeper's attacks and cut him to pieces, saying J-Keeper is nothing more than a placeholder for the real member of the J≈´shinshu: Joker himself. Uruha J≈´shinshu The J≈´shinshu is composed of the ten strongest warriors in the Uruha. Most of the members of the J≈´shinshu competed in the Ura But≈ç Satsujin as captains of different subdivisions of the Uruha. Kurei's team, Uruha Kurenai (Uruha Scarlet), consists of four members of the J≈´shinshu, and they were the undisputed champions of the Ura But≈ç Satsujin for three years. Uruha Maboroshii (Uruha Illusion) ; : : Captain of Uruha Maboroshii and wields a mad≈çgu called Mugen, which allows him to shrink objects by affecting its cellular structure. Genjuro has the innate ability to do psychic surgery and is also a master of illusion techniques such as the wakemi. In the anime, he is killed by Neon after being defeated by Recca. In the manga, Neon kills one of his illusions and Genjuro escapes; eventually allying himself with K≈çran Mori and helping Mori complete his cloning experiments which results the creation of Aoi and Renge. Genjuro is put in charge in one of the fortresses of SODOM City, in which he encounters Neon again. He overwhelms her with his robots at first, but panics when he sees Domon Ishijima ally himself with Neon and her sisters. While Genjuro attempts to retreat, Neon catches up with him and kills him for good using Jisho's mad≈çgu. ; : : Men≈ç is a young girl whose father served as one of Genjuro's lab assistants. Genjuro believed that her hair was of superior quality, making her the perfect candidate for infusion with the Shikigami, a mad≈çgu that controls hair. Her father opposed the plan, but Genjuro uses his mad≈çgu to shrink him and use him as a hostage to make Men≈ç allow the surgery. After Recca defeats her and rescues her father, she eventually befriends Yanagi and seems to understand Joker. ; : Shiju is an experimental result of Genjuro's twisted experiments that is labeled a chimera, and eats all the opponents he defeats. He is defeated by Koganei. Uruha Kurogane (Uruha Iron) ; : Captain of Uruha Kurogane and wields a set of mad≈çgu called Jis≈çto. The Jis≈çto are actually two swords that represent the North and South directions, and are of opposite magnetic fields. Jisho is killed by Uruha Ma's leader, Magensha, during the third round of the tournament. In the manga, Kurei absorbs Jisho's soul using his flame, and can summon him as a flame spirit similar to Kurenai. Jisho is one of the three J≈´shinshu who are most loyal to Kurei, the other two being Raiha and Neon; all three of them swore their loyalty to him by writing their name in blood on a piece of paper that Raiha carries with him. Uruha Oto (Uruha Sound) ; : : Neon is the captain of Uruha Oto. She and her sisters/teammates Miki and Aki were taken in by Kurei as maids when they had nowhere else to go, and it is because of the kindness he showed (and his devotion to Kurei) that Neon pledges her allegiance to him. She kills \\"Genjuro\\" after Uruha Maboroshƒ´ lost to the Hokage, only to encounter him again at the latter part of the manga. Neon has the innate ability to create force fields. She wields the mad≈çgu Fuky≈ç Waon, an orb that manipulates sound waves which she utilized with her flute, but the orb was destroyed by Mikagami. In the later part of the manga, she returns to the Ura But≈ç Satsujin arena's ruins to claim Jisho's Jis≈çto. ; : :Miki is Neon's younger sister, who also serves as her usual partner during battle. Miki's forte is her speed, and uses the mad≈çgu Idaten to enhance it. Although she is flirtatious, she is completely devoted to her sister. She also uses the mad≈çgu Yamabiko, which deflects any sound waves. This mad≈çgu is the core of her teamwork with Neon. ; : : Aki is Neon's youngest sister, and uses the mad≈çgu Kotodama to conjure illusions through her spoken words. After being defeated by Domon and coming to more friendly terms with the Hokage, Aki gives Recca her mad≈çgu. Recca breaks it in an attempt to remove Kager≈ç's curse. When she accompanies Neon to SODOM, she fights with just a blade attached to her hand. Uruha Rai (Uruha Thunder) ; : : The only member. He is the descendant of certain Hokage ninjas who ran away during the war that ultimately destroyed the Hokage clan, and the reason why he is fiercely loyal to Kurei is because he believes that it is the only way he can repay the cowardice that his ancestors showed. He usually uses a ninja sword and shurikens to fight, but he also wields Raijin; the evil counterpart of F≈´jin that can manipulate electricity. He often saves F≈´ko from traps and gives her advice, but he eventually battles her and is defeated. Uruha Ma (Uruha Devil) ; : : Magensha is the captain of Uruha Ma. While he appears to be 'immortal' such that any form of attack cannot harm him, his real body is in fact located in another dimension while a false version of himself that he controls does battle for him. He wields the mad≈çgu H≈çumashin, which uses human heads and souls as bullets and fires them with immense force. He can also create wormholes using his other mad≈çgu, Jigenkai Gyoku. The mask being worn by his false self is merely an extension of the Jigenkai Gyoku, as the real one is with Magensha in another dimension. Magensha was defeated by Domon Ishijima after deflecting two attacks from the H≈çumashin. Kurei eventually has him killed. ; : : Gashakura is the co-captain of Uruha Ma and Magensha's younger brother. He wields a large morning star and the mad≈çgu Magagumo, which acts as both armor and a weapon. He possesses a great sense of honor and respects his brother despite being fully aware of his atrocities. He befriends the Hokage after being defeated fair and square by F≈´ko. Later in the manga, he (along with Kashamaru and Tsukishiro) infiltrates SODOM to aid the Hokage in the final battle. ; : : Kashamaru is a ninja whose mad≈çgu, the Nisebi, allows him to mimic a flame master's powers to a certain extent. He is defeated when Rui decides to lend Recca her powers. ; : : Tsukishiro is a narcisstic fighter who considers himself to be beautiful and dislikes having his face damaged. He has the tendency to make an entrance wrapped up like a mummy, in reference to H.G. Wells' novella The Invisible Man. His mad≈çgu include Kaigetsu, a crescent boomerang; and Oboro, a cape that renders him invisible. He is defeated by Koganei.  Uruha Kurenai (Uruha Scarlet) Uruha Kurenai is composed of its captain, Kurei, and four other members of the J≈´shinshu. ;: : Joker is a mysterious man who wields the Taishaku Kaiten. In his dealings with the Hokage, he primarily drops hints about their opponents and their own powers while keeping them in the dark regarding his true intent and nature. It is only during the final round of the Ura But≈ç Satsujin that the Hokage Team finds out that Joker is part of the Uruha J≈´shinshu, and is a member of Uruha Kurenai. He initially gets involved with the Uruha through attempting to fight Jisho, one of the members of the J≈´shinshu, and saying that he intended to kill all the members of the Uruha. He fights Jisho continuously for two days, and then meets Kurei only to reveal that he wanted to join the Uruha in the first place. Kurei then offers him a spot in the J≈´shinshu, and Joker joins on two conditions: that he can live the way he wants and can leave whenever he wants to, and for him to be allowed to be informal since it 'pains him to be respectful'. He is also known for having a Kansai accent. :Using the mad≈çgu Taishaku Kaiten, Joker can manipulate gravity within a fixed radius. Taishaku Kaiten can also be used to increase or decrease the weight of objects by manipulating its mass. He can also move swiftly by reducing the effects of gravity on himself. The power to create a blackhole is said to be his weapon's ultimate power. Only Koganei, using his mad≈çgu's (K≈çgon Anki's) final form, manages to defeat Joker in battle. Later in the manga, Joker's fight with Kadotsu causes both of them to get sucked into a blackhole. :Joker's appearance varies within the manga series. He appears with long, black hair worn in braids in the Ura But≈ç Satsujin and when he helped Recca Hanabishi and his comrades reach the Sealed Lands, but appears with long, blonde hair during the latter part of the manga. Joker also appears as a playable character in the Flame of Recca: Final Burning PlayStation 2 game, but can only be unlocked through using the Konami code. :It is heavily implied that the character Nanashi from Anzai's anime/manga MAR (Marchen Awakens Romance) is Joker. ; : : Noroi wields the mad≈çgu Bakuju, which actually has a mind of its own and eradicates a human's memories and consciousness in order to possess his/her body. When the body he currently possesses starts weakening, the Bakuju looks for a younger, stronger body to be its new host. After Noroi is overpowered by Domon Ishijima, the Bakuju tries to possess Domon, but his strong will overcomes Bakuju's power. ; : : Mikoto uses a number of mad≈çgu throughout the series: the three large puppet mad≈çgu (Mikoto, Shirahige, and ≈åtobide), Dokumashin (a set of sharp claws that contain a combination of all the most lethal poisons in the world) and the Gedokugan (the antidote for the Dokumashin). She's noted to be cruel and ruthless, or a 'female version of Mokuren'. In the manga, she has a romantic relationship with Mokuren. She later appears in both the Sealed Lands and SODOM City arcs. ; : : Kai wields the weapon Hy≈çma En, which can manipulate ice and is the evil counterpart of Tokiya Mikagami's Ensui. In the manga, the Hy≈çma En has a mind of its own and constantly demands to be fed blood. Kai studied Hy≈çmon Ken under Ky≈çza Meguri, who also trained Mikagami. Through constantly comparing him to his senpai Mikagami by saying that Mikagami is \\"gold\\" and he is \\"stone\\", Ky≈çza Meguri instilled within Kai a sense of anger and revenge in order to show Mikagami how futile living his life only for revenge is. Kai battles against Mikagami in the final round of the tournament and manages to defeat him, fulfilling his desire to be the best Hy≈çmon Ken master and in order to avenge his broken pride. After telling Mikagami not to live a life of revenge the way he himself did and that it was Ky≈çza Meguri who killed Mifuyu, Kai stabs himself with the Hy≈çma En to feed its thirst and allows himself to fall into the pit below the arena. : In the anime, Kai is supposedly the first Hy≈çmon Ken successor, but is discarded soon after Ky≈çza Meguri noticed Mikagami's potential. He also says that Ky≈çza Meguri killed Mifuyu, but adds that Ky≈çza Meguri's reason for doing so is because he believed that revenge would drive Mikagami to train harder (he says nothing about Ky≈çza Meguri's motives in the manga). After his battle with Mikagami, he does not stab himself with the Hy≈çma En, but he still allows himself to fall into the pit. Kurei shows respect for him by telling Mikoto not to speak ill of him after his victory/death.  Other J≈´shinshu  ; : : The master of Hy≈çmon Ken, and teacher of both Kai and Tokiya Mikagami. Ky≈çza Meguri is also the second-in-command in Kurei's J≈´shinshu, although he barely takes part in the organization since he was forced to join. :\\"Ky≈çza Meguri\\" is just a title that is passed on from a Hy≈çmon Ken master to his successor, and this Ky≈çza Meguri happens to be Tokiya's grandfather. When his son (Tokiya's father) died, Ky≈çza Meguri decided to pass the tradition on to his grandson. Mifuyu, Tokiya's older sister, refused to allow her younger brother to be exposed to violence, and volunteers to be Ky≈çza Meguri's student instead. : Ky≈çza Meguri blames himself entirely for Mifuyu's death, because he was the one who had forced her to take up Hy≈çmon Ken and inherit the Ensui. In his battle against Tokiya, Tokiya convinces him before he dies that she has surely forgiven him for what had happened. =Uruha Hokage (Uruha Shadow)= The Uruha Hokage is composed of Kurei, Raiha, Neon, and Joker. It was formed after the Ura But≈ç Satsujin in order to go after and battle Mori K≈çran. = Ura Uruha = Ura Uruha is a new Uruha group formed by Mori K≈çran to spy on Kurei whenever he acts suspicious. After Mori disbanded Kurei's Uruha, the Ura Uruha became core of Uruha. Its initial members are ex-J≈´shinshu members Genjuro, Rasen, Mikoto and Ky≈çza Meguri, as well as the former Uruha Mokuren. It also recruited many new fighters. Since this group appears after the tournament, they do not appear in the anime, but they appear in the Flame of Recca FINAL BURNING PlayStation 2 game and the Flame of Recca GBA game. ; : Rasen is a J≈´shinshu who does not appear until after the Ura But≈ç Satsujin, and by then he is serving under Mori K≈çran as a member of the Ura Uruha. He wields the mad≈çgu K≈çkai Gyoku, which can erase anything at the expense of something of equal value belonging to its wielder. Because of his usage of K≈çkai Gy≈çku, Rasen has lost his feelings, his mother, and his voice. He also loses his blood when he erases the flame balls produced by Nadare during his battle against Recca. Rasen mentions that he is searching for the moment wherein he would be erased as punishment for erasing his mother, but Recca defeats him and tells him to live on and to stop using the K≈çkai Gyoku. : Rasen uses the K≈çkai Gyoku one last time in an attempt to erase Kager≈ç's curse, and even though he managed to do so, the mad≈çgu itself was destroyed because of the curse's power. The destruction of the mad≈çgu caused Rasen to regain his feelings and his voice, and he is shown speaking in the last volume of the manga. ; : Kirin is Rasen's partner who uses two mad≈çgu; the H≈çkishin, which can shoot out an elongated mechanical arm, and the Shingan, which allows her to read her target's thoughts. She is in love with Rasen and acts as his voice through reading his thoughts and relaying them to whoever it is he wishes to speak to. Mikoto states that Kirin is known for her innocence and that she has never touched anything pornographic/erotic in her entire life. ; : Ga≈ç is Seki≈ç's elder brother who is addicted to chocolate.

He is initially defeated by Domon in the Sealed Lands arc. He reappears in Sodom and is forced to make the ultimate decision of chocolate versus the memory of his dead brother. He chooses chocolate. Then, he is defeated by Koganei. ; : Hisui is a fierce woman as whose motivation to fight is to find a moment wherein she can die. During a training session to promote her into the ranks of Ura Uruha wherein the trainees had to fight in the dark with a mask to silence their voices tied around their mouth, Hisui ends up killing her own boyfriend. She wields the mad≈çgu Shinryo Shint≈ç, a pair of blade-tonfa that can be elongated at will. After being defeated by F≈´ko, Hisui gives one of them to her. After learning her boyfriend's death was actually orchestrated by Mori K≈çran and that he enjoyed the event as it happened, she defects from Uruha. She is killed by Mori K≈çran while she was protecting F≈´ko. ; : S≈çkakusai wields the mad≈çgu Tamasui no Tsubo, an urn that traps people inside it. He's known to be possessive/obsessive over girls, and whenever he gets rejected, he seals the girl in the urn. He is obsessed with F≈´ko and constantly stalks her, and eventually seals her inside the Tamasui no Tsubo. Raiha rescues F≈´ko and kills S≈çkakusai. ; : Kamui is a homosexual, pedophilic cyborg who uses assorted mechanical weapons that he can attach to his arms. His mechanical weapons include extendable limbs, a laser, and a gattling gun. He says that he is in 'love' with Koganei and constantly stalks him. Koganei defeats him, but he reappears at SODOM, where he is defeated by Recca. He then says that he has fallen in love with Recca and ends up helping the Hokage. ; , , : Miruku and Kurumi are maids, and Mikuru is a robot. Miruku wields a mop that controls Mikuru and can produce a smokescreen, while Kurumi wields a broom that can fire a laser beam. They are defeated with ease by Domon, Aki, and Miki. ; : Marie is a dominatrix who wears a gown and lives in a large European-looking house full of torture devices. Her husband and 'pet', Pochi, is a gigantic man wielding an axe who does everything she asks him to. She wields the mad≈çgu Sokubaku Benten, an elongating whip that resembles a cat-o'-nine-tails. She manages to trick Mikagami into drinking from a drugged teacup, and eventually straps him to a statue with the intention to make him her new 'pet'. She attempts to drug Domon, but because he drank from the same spot on the cup that Marie drank from (that was the only part that wasn't poisoned), Marie's plan did not work. She commands Pochi to attack Domon, and she intervenes when Pochi begins to get overwhelmed. Recca arrives, and he and Domon manage to defeat Pochi and Marie. Mikagami straps her to the statue after she is defeated. She is freed by Team K≈´ member Fujimaru, and tricks him into becoming her new 'pet'. ; : Z is the leader of the zombies who fights for Mori under the orders of an unnamed scientist. He possesses a whistle to summon more zombies to aid him. The zombies are former human beings created through infusing their bodies with cells taken from Mori (who had already fused with the Tend≈ç Jigoku at the time). Mori's cells don't mesh well with the human body, and it causes mutations and eats away at the human cells, which will ultimately destroy the zombie. The scientist created a sort of medicine to slow down this deterioration, and he gives this to Z and the other zombies as a reward for obeying his orders. Koganei convinces Z that he and his comrades are not disposable creatures as the scientist said, but they are still human despite their monstrous forms. This causes Z to betray the scientist and order the other zombies to stop attacking the Hokage and the Hokage's allies. ; : Karame is a mummy-like creature that works for the Uruha Shishiten member, Kadotsu. Karame possesses a Shikigami, has the power to control paper (Saich≈ç of Team K≈´ also possesses a Shikigami). He is defeated by F≈´ko.

They consist of 4 top elite members of Ura Uruha. ; : Aoi is a clone produced using Kurei's and Kurenai's genes. Due to his inability to generate flames, he is deemed a failure and feels incredibly jealous towards the only 'successful' clone, Renge. He wields a gun, but his true strength lies in the mad≈çgu Shinryo Shik≈ç, which enables him to alter one's memory. He also wields a sword attached to his right hand, but it is unknown if this is an unnamed madogu, or simply a basic weapon. He first appears in the Sealed Lands, where he easily defeated an injured Mikagami after the latter emerged victorious against Mokuren and Mikoto. After Rasen loses the will to fight, Aoi replaces him as the leader of the Ura Uruha. He eventually transfers to Nashikiri High School in order to befriend Yanagi and the others. This is because his mission was to kidnap Yanagi and erase her memory so that she could be 'absorbed' by the Tend≈ç Jigoku, and the Shinryo Shik≈ç can only tamper with the memories that both the target and the user are aware of. Yanagi's kindness to him makes him doubt his loyalty to Mori. He is defeated by Recca, wherein he is actually found out to be a boy not a girl and he defects from the Ura following one's duty, but in acting according to your heart. Along with Hiruko, he defects from Uruha and joins the Hokage in the final against Tend≈ç Jigoku. ; : The only polite warrior in the Shishiten. He owns the mad≈çgu Ketsushu, which allows him to utilize his own blood as weapon or shield in a fight. He could create swords or shields from his blood. He is shown to suffer from anemia (due to excessive use of blood) and has a lot supply of blood with the same blood type as his in his arena. But due to Shiguma's attack, almost all of his blood supply is destroyed. He is defeated by Domon when he failed to absorb Domon's blood. Domon save Hiruko from dying by giving him the remaining blood supply he can find. With a new conviction, he and Aoi defect from Shishiten and decided to ally himself with Hokage. ; : Kirito is a woman who wields the mad≈çgu Rinne, which enables her to manipulate her own age and Nehan, a bracelet that allows her to control a beast called Shiguma. Her power over Shiguma makes up for her inability to fight on her own. After using Rinne too many times, Kirito has become unaware of her true self, and thinks that the only way to really find out is to destroy Rinne. However, she is afraid of turning out to be an old lady and not having Rinne to change her back to her younger self. Mori K≈çran promised to reveal the truth if she served him, and so she does so. After witnessing Shiguma being defeated by Koganei and Joker, she fell into despair. In the end of the series, her fate is unknown. ; : Kadotsu is a sadistic warrior who enjoys killing, and claims that Magensha of Uruha Ma is always impersonating him. He is a formidable warrior, able to take down many opponents at once with just physical feats, but also utilizes the mad≈çgu Mumy≈ç and Mongamae, which open dimensional portals. He faces the remaining members of Uruha Ma and members Team K≈´. He kills most of the K≈´ except Saich≈ç, K≈´kai, Fujimaru, and Daikoku. Kurei interrupts the battle and severely burns Kadotsu using the dead K≈´ members' souls as flame spirits.

They used to be an honorable martial arts group, but later turned into a mercenary group due to financial crisis. The K≈´ eventually become one of Hokage's most prominent allies. In the manga, most of the K≈´ members' abilities are innate, with the exception of Saich≈ç. In the anime, however, most of them wield a mad≈çgu. ; : : The leader of Team K≈´. His calm, easygoing nature earned him the nickname 'The Buddha'. However, striking him three times will activate his psychic device and turns him into a demon-like fighter. During his fight against Recca, he teaches the latter how not to show mercy on his enemies during battle (in the anime he nearly beats Recca to death). ; : : Saich≈ç is the co-captain of Team K≈´, a young-looking man who has very strong convictions and morals. He has a heart ailment that limits his ability to fight (he can only fight for ten minutes) after being stabbed in the chest during his fight with K≈´'s students, but he still seen as one of the best among the K≈´.

He fights with small sickles that he can throw, and he uses them to strip F≈´ko's clothes during their battle. In the anime, he is the founder of the 'F≈´ko Fans Club'. ; : : Minamio is known for his cat-like eyes and his elastic, rubber-like body (this is an innate ability in the manga, but is because of the mad≈çgu Nan in the anime). He is defeated by Domon, but their fight is officially declared a draw. He is later killed by Kadotsu and his soul is absorbed by Kurei's flame. ; : : Daikoku fights using a b≈ç that he can rotate while Daikoku is spinning it causing vibrations and gives it the power to destroy hard objects such as rocks.

Tatsuko (voiced by Konami Yoshida in the anime), the referee representing the Dragon is in love with Recca and is jealous of Yanagi. Nemi (voiced by Akiko Nakagawa), representing the Rat, replaces Tatsuko as referee during the battle between Hokage and Uruha Maboroshii and also acts a commentator in the latter fights. Enna, representing the Monkey, oversees the battle between F≈´ko and Mikoto wherein Mikoto injures her in order to distract F≈´ko and win the match. The other referees include Inuko (representing the Dog), Y≈çko (voiced by Kae Araki; representing the Goat), Umi (representing the Rabbit), Ushino (represents the Ox), Inoko (representing the Pig), Toraha (representing the Tiger), Satomi (representing the Snake), Midori (representing the Rooster), and Amagi (representing the Horse). =Circus= is a team that participated in the second Ura But≈ç Satsujin and were defeated by Uruha Kurenai.

Yashiro, being the only surviving member of the team, forfeits to the Hokage during the pre-semifinal match before dying shortly afterward. From the Past =Hokage Clan= The is clan renowned for their production and use of mad≈çgu, which are mystical weapons that have various powers ranging from the manipulation of elements to increasing its user's strength. The Hokage clan was exterminated during an attack made by Oda Nobunaga on the clan's village in 1567. The Hokage leaders are known as Flame Masters because of their innate ability to control the element of fire. Each Flame Master is born with this ability, and are traditionally succeeded by one who is also born with this ability. In the case of the eighth Flame Master ≈åka, his two sons (Recca Hanabishi and Kurei) are born with this ability. In the Hokage tradition, this meant that one of the children was born with a cursed flame, and should be terminated. The Hokage elders assumed that Kurei was the cursed child since they thought that he had an evil soul and attempted to kill him, but Kager≈ç, Recca's mother, stopped them from doing so. The mad≈çgu are mystical objects created by the Hokage that grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the F≈´jin, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user's strength/skills (as in the case of the Dosei no Wa, which increases its user's physical strength and the Idaten, which increases its user's running speed). Two mad≈çgu creators were mentioned in the manga: Kok≈´, who creates mad≈çgu to protect the clan and their loved ones, and Kaima, who creates mad≈çgu solely for killing. Flame Dragons The are entities that manifest themselves in selected Hokage leaders, each dragon possessing its own unique flame abilities/techniques. Each dragon is an embodiment of the soul of a previous flame master who died with regrets and/or without being able to fulfill his/her mission. ; : : Resshin is the eighth Flame Dragon, and its most recent leader. He refuses to help Recca until he knows who is more worthy of his powers between Recca and Kurei. During his lifetime, his flame took the form of a phoenix, just like his son Kurei's. He has the ability to convert souls to entities of fire. He has a special summoning condition: the first seven dragons have to be summoned simultaneously before he could appear. He in reality was ≈åka was the sixth generation leader of the Hokage clan during the Eiroku period. He is married to Kager≈ç and took Reina as his consort, and is the father of both Kurei and Recca. He loves both women and both of his sons equally, and his only regret is that he failed to save Princess Sakura and the Sawaki Clan from destruction. He is later killed by the soldiers of Oda Nobunaga, but his spirit lives on as the eighth Flame Dragon Resshin. Recca uses Resshin's power to save Yanagi's soul from the Tendo Jigoku. ; : : Kok≈´ is one of the creators of mad≈çgu, and a Hokage Flame Master (and leader of the Flame Dragons) before ≈åka. He and his rival Kaima competed to create mad≈çgu, but he is forced to kill his rival once the latter succumbed into further madness. Alone among the flame dragons, he could manifest himself in human form, who is often portrayed as perverted but also very wise. Koku's power takes the form of a giant, concentrated laser beam. ; : : Rui is the sixth Flame Dragon who has the power to create illusions. She is a beautiful kunoichi who is not afraid to show her body as an advantage in combat. She demonstrated the ability to create a flame pillar during Recca's fight with Kashamaru. She is also fond of riddles and, in the times after Recca regained her after knowing her original identity, she often ask them whenever she's summoned in her original human form. ; : : Madoka is the fifth Flame Dragon with the power to create barriers. He is a chubby ninja who speaks politely, but is rather sarcastic. During his lifetime, his flame took the form of a tortoise. ; : : Setsuna is the fourth Flame Dragon. He can burn anyone who looks into his eye. He is a cruel, sadistic ninja who lives only to kill. He dislikes Recca and won't hesitate to kill him whenever opportunity arises. ; : : Homura is the third Flame Dragon with the power to create flame whips and enhance his master's strength. During his lifetime, his flame took the form of a snake. ; : : Saiha is the second Flame Dragon with the power to produce a blade of fire. He is the dragon most used by Recca. During his lifetime, his flame took the form of a hawk. ; : : Nadare is the first Flame Dragon with the power to produce fireballs. She is the friendliest of all the dragons and is often used by Recca along with Saiha. Nadare was the first dragon to lend her powers to Recca as he was protecting Kager≈ç, though Recca refers to Saiha as the \\"first form\\" of the Flame Dragons. Other ; : Reina is Kurei's blood mother who had been Kager≈ç's rival since they were young. She often fights alongside Kager≈ç for ≈åka's sake, but in the anime, she is shown to absolutely despise Kager≈ç. She is later taken by ≈åka as his consort and gives birth to Kurei. She defends Kurei when he is about to be killed by the Hokage elders, and winds up being exiled along with her son. Although she dislikes Recca, she doesn't hate ≈åka for the decision. When the village is razed by Nobunaga's soldiers, Reina rescues Kurei from the prison and sends him off alone, so she wouldn't be a burden to him. Her last words are that Kurei must live and be strong, and that as long as he lives, Hokage would never perish. ; : Kaima is Kok≈´'s rival and the other creator of mad≈çgu. Kaima is a madman who desires to create weapons to kill. He is eventually killed by his fellow kinsmen, but he transfers his spirit to his last creation: Tend≈ç Jigoku. He is very similar to Mori K≈çran in terms of personality. =Other characters= ; : She possesses the power to heal any wounds and is the previous incarnation of Yanagi. She is in love with her attendant Koheita, but upon his death, she chose to commit seppuku, with ≈åka preventing the Takasugi clan from entering the Sawaki clan's castle. ; : Koheita is a vassal of the Sawaki Clan and a childhood friend of Sakura, who is also deeply in love with her. He is the one who recommends that the Sawaki clan enlist the aid of the Hokage to assassinate Takasugi Jyugor≈ç Masakane, the leader of the Takasugi clan. Unfortunately, he dies in the war that ensued after the Hokage failed to assassinate Takasugi. It is heavily implied that Recca is his reincarnation. ; : The leader of the Takasugi clan. He is a greedy, ambitious warlord who demands that the Sawaki clan surrender Sakura to him in marriage in exchange for the clan's safety. After the Sawaki and Hokage fail to assassinate him, he moves in to destroy the clan. He succeeds, but when he attempts to capture Sakura himself, he and his army is obliterated by ≈åka and his seven Flame Dragons.

It connects the city of Pullman to U.S. Route 195 (US 195) at its west end and Idaho State Highway 8 near Moscow, Idaho, at its east end. The highway is one of the main roads in Pullman and connects the campuses of Washington State University and the University of Idaho. Route description SR 270 begins at an un-signalized Y intersection with US 195 in the hills west of Pullman. The two-lane highway travels east through a cut in the hills on Davis Way and passes several residential subdivisions on the outskirts of the city. After descending from a hill and following the South Fork Palouse River and a freight railroad into downtown Pullman, SR 270 turns southeast and begins a short concurrency with its parent route, SR 27, on Grand Avenue. The two highways travel south on Grand Avenue for a two blocks before SR 270 turns east onto a pair of one-way streets: Southeast Paradise Street for eastbound traffic and East Main Street for westbound traffic. The two streets carrying SR 270 reunite after three blocks and the highway continues east on the four- lane Main Street towards the Washington State University campus. The highway turns southeast and bypasses the campus, crossing over the river and railroad and passing several student dormitories. After intersecting Bishop Boulevard, SR 270 turns due east onto the Pullman‚ÄìMoscow Highway, which follows Paradise Creek along the south side of the university campus. The highway is joined by the Bill Chipman Palouse Trail, a paved multi-use trail that runs along the south side of the creek. A decommissioned railroad grade, the Chipman Trail was dedicated in April 1998. After passing the university arboretum and a road leading to Pullman‚ÄìMoscow Regional Airport, SR 270 turns northeast and leaves Pullman city limits. The highway enters a predominantly agricultural area with several quarries and farms that make up much of the Palouse region. SR 270 then dips southeasterly after intersecting the airport access road again and rejoins the freight railroad before it reaches the Idaho state line at the western city limits of Moscow. The road becomes Idaho State Highway 8, which continues through a commercial district and the University of Idaho campus to a junction with US 95 in downtown Moscow. SR 270 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 4,100 vehicles near its western terminus at US 195 to a maximum of 21,000 vehicles in downtown Pullman. Most of the highway between Pullman and Moscow is five lanes wide, with two lanes of traffic in each direction and a center turn lane. The entire route of SR 270 is designated as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility, and is listed as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the state legislature. History The first railroad in the Pullman area, built by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company in 1885, traveled west towards Colfax and east along Paradise Creek to Moscow, Idaho. A parallel railroad was also built to the south by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1887, along with an unpaved highway running between the two towns near Paradise Creek. The original road between Pullman and Moscow was impassible during inclement weather for automobiles, leading to calls for a permanent highway. The original road, today's \\"Old Moscow-Pullman Road,\\" was completed as a gravel road in 1929 after three months of construction. In 1933, $125,000 was appropriated to construct a new route for the highway. Prior to the state highway renumbering in 1964, SR 270 was a spur of Primary State Highway 3. East of the city limits, the highway was targeted for widening for decades. It was expanded to four lanes in October 2007, with ground broken in June 2006. The original design of a center median, similar to a rural interstate highway, was revised due to right-of-way The project added lanes from just east of SE Bishop Blvd to the Idaho state line. The improved SR 270 is now a four-lane arterial from its junction with SR 27 (Grand Avenue) to the Pullman city limits and a four-lane divided highway to the state line. A paved median lane in the center separates opposing traffic; in places, it is a two-way left turn lane to provide safe access to adjacent property. Safety was listed as a main concern for the improvements. A highly publicized triple-fatality collision occurred in it likely hastened the long-standing project's revival and completion.

Of the four children, only Jack accompanied his parents on the ill-fated vessel. As a 17-year old at the time, he survived by jumping into the freezing water and swimming to an overturned lifeboat just as the ship went under.  Pennsylvania Railroad career  After leaving the University of Pennsylvania in 1881, Thayer entered the service of the Pennsylvania Railroad as a clerk in the Empire Line office, remaining in that position for about eighteen months, when he was transferred to the general freight department. After holding various positions in 1888 he was appointed freight solicitor of the United Railroads of New Jersey division. From February, 1889, to May, 1892, Thayer was out of railway work before returning to the PRR in May, 1892, as division freight agent of the Northern Central, with headquarters at Baltimore, MD. On December 1, 1894, he was promoted to assistant general freight agent, with office at Philadelphia, Pa., and in March, 1897, was made general freight agent in charge of through traffic.

On April 10 the family boarded the RMS Titanic at Cherbourg-en-Cotentin as first-class passengers and had been preparing for bed on the evening of April 14 when the collision with the iceberg occurred. As the ship sank, Thayer made sure his wife and maid boarded lifeboats, after being told by the Titanic's designer, Thomas Andrews, that the stricken ship did not have \\"much over an hour to live\\". His son, Jack, dove from the sinking ship and was able to swim to an overturned collapsible boat, where he also survived. However, Thayer Sr. made it clear that he had no intention of boarding a boat, and he remained on the Titanic as it went down.Lord, p. 82. When all of the lifeboats were gone, one eyewitness reportedly saw Thayer looking \\"pale and determined by the midship rail aft of lifeboat 7.\\" A short while later, he had gone, so it is likely that he moved to the stern like many other passengers and crew. Initially, the British media had reported that Thayer had survived the sinking, due to confusion between Thayer and his son.Croudy, p. 17. Thayer's body, if recovered, was never identified.

Plot Dr. Peter Hamilton works for Concord University under Dr. Leo Sardis and Dr. Carla Jennings, and has developed a serum called AccelRate. Mark Stratton, his assistant, steals a sample and injects it into the pregnant Tina Hogan. The unborn baby grows rapidly and explodes from Tina, killing her. A murder investigation, led by Chief Max Reed and Detective Ed Carlisle is soon launched, Mark becoming the primary suspect. Peter finds the baby at his home/lab. Assisted by Charlotte \\"Charlie\\" Tanzi, he studies her as she grows from infancy to adulthood within two days, and names her Jasmine. Peter gets phoned by the fugitive Mark, borrows Charlie's car to confront him, and demands his help with saving Jasmine. Mark reveals that Leo ordered him to conduct the experiment resulting in Tina's death, having promised that he would be set for life. Mark tells Peter to take his notes and leave, then fatally shoots himself. A landlady sees Peter departing immediately afterward. Meanwhile, Jasmine begins developing feelings for Peter, and sneaks away to explore the outside world. Peter returns to the lab, leaves Charlie with Mark's notes, and goes out to find Jasmine. He succeeds; Jasmine tells him she wanted to look pretty for him. Back at the lab, Peter injects Jasmine with an experimental governing agent, earlier tested on one of his rabbits; their feelings for each other deepen. The next day, Jasmine awakes still looking youthful. She joyfully urges Peter to go out and experience life with her. Charlie offers to stay behind to continue the lab work. Later, Charlie notices that the rabbit injected with the governing agent has died. While Peter and Jasmine are at a conservatory, Peter notices a streak of white in her hair, and decides that they should return to the lab. Meanwhile, Charlie is confronted by Max and Ed. Max opens a drawer to discover Tina's blood-stained scarf, deepening their suspicion of Charlie and Peter. Peter and Jasmine return to see Charlie being taken into custody, and enter the lab through a back entrance to avoid police attention. Peter decides that he and Jasmine need to continue work elsewhere. as they pack, Jasmine notices the dead rabbit, and Peter confirms that his governing agent only slowed down her aging. Meanwhile, Charlie reveals that Jasmine is Mark and Tina's child, and mentions the video footage used to track her development. Ed doesn't believe Charlie, but Max departs to find the footage. Peter and Jasmine arrive at a lab that he previously shared with Leo, so that he can gather materials for a functional governing agent. Jasmine looks in a mirror, shocked by her older- looking face. As Peter unsuccessfully attempts to open a cabinet containing a governing agent, Leo enters, alerted by a security alarm. He insists that the governing agent doesn't work. As Peter pleads with him, the police arrive, looking for Peter. Peter shoves Leo and escapes with Jasmine through a back exit; he tells Jasmine to wait for him at the conservatory while he retrieves the governing agent, but he is caught and arrested. While being interrogated by Ed, Peter attempts to escape from the police station, but is stopped by Max, who demands the truth. Carla confesses that she went along with Leo's orders to conduct the AccelRate experiment, so that they could make millions. Ed reluctantly releases Peter and Leo is arrested. By the time Peter reaches the conservatory, Jasmine is elderly. They accept that it's too late to save her, and she dies in Peter's embrace. Later, Charlie is packing Peter's possessions into storage, as he has decided to get away from Concord. The final scene shows Peter leaving the campus, holding a jasmine branch in memory of the woman he loved. Cast *Michael A.

Sato is best known for his unusual expressions of light and space and interpretations of performance and dance. Receiving his MFA and BFA in Music and Fine Arts from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1981, Sato was originally a trained sculptor, but decided to go with photography to better communicate his ideas. Recognised for his playful interaction of light, Sato uses a large-format camera for exposures that last from one to three hours, while he moves around the space creating illuminated lines drawn with flashlights. The results are detailed photographs interrupted by patterns of light.See for example Breathgraph, No. 87 in Tucker et al., History, 288-9. And because of the long exposures, Sato‚Äôs movements across the scene remain undetectable by the camera; the photograph captures his presence but not his image. Sato‚Äôs photographs are held throughout the world in public and private museums including the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York); the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; The Art Institute of Chicago; the Cleveland Museum of Art; Museum of Modern Art (Saitama, Japan); Hara Museum of Contemporary Art (Tokyo); Queensland Art Gallery (Brisbane); and Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography.Japanese Photography: Form In/Out 3, p. 119.

The highway serves the towns and rural communities in southern Robeson County, acts as a direct route between Whiteville and Shallotte through the Green Swamp, and provides access to Holden Beach. Route description NC Highway 130 begins at U.S. Route 74 Business (US 74 Bus.) and NC 71 in Maxton and ends at Ocean Boulevard in Holden Beach. It overlaps several highways along its route, including US 501, US 74 (proposed Interstate 74), US 76, NC 410 and US 17 Bus. History NC 130 was established around 1928 as a renumbering of part of NC 201 between NC 30 in Supply, to the intersection of Moore Street and Atlantic Avenue in Southport. In 1930, NC 130 was extended west along NC 30 to Shallotte, then northwest along new primary routing to NC 23 near Whiteville. In 1940, NC 130 made its final westward extension, by overlapping with US 701 to US 74 in Whiteville; in concurrency, it travels with US 74 until Boardman, then replaced NC 71 through Fairmont and Rowland before ending at US 74/NC 71 in Maxton. By 1944, NC 130 was rerouted in Shallotte onto Whiteville Road and Powell Street to US 17 on Village Road; its old alignment of Bridger Road and Mulberry Street was downgraded to secondary roads. In 1949, NC 130 was extended north on new primary routing from Southport, through the Sunny Point Army Terminal (opened 1955) and Orton Plantation, to US 17/US 74/US 76 in Belville. In 1957, NC 130 was truncated in Shallotte; with Supply to Southport becoming part of NC 211 and Southport to Belville part of NC 40\\\\. In 1959, NC 130 was extended on new primary routing to Holden Beach. By 1962, NC 130 was adjusted onto Main Street instead of Village Road in Shallotte, downgrading Powell Street to secondary road. In 1965, NC 130 was rerouted on new bypass southeast of Fairmont, with its old alignment through town becoming NC 130 Business. In 1972, US 74/NC 130 was placed on new alignment between the Lumber River and Chadbourn; its old alignment through Boardman and Evergreen became Old US 74 (SR 1574). In 1975, US 74/NC 130 was rerouted onto new alignment north of Chadbourn to NC 410, where then continued together south into town; five months later, the concurrencies would change to US 74 Bus. and US 76 Bus. between Chadbourn and Whiteville. NC 130 was rerouted in 2012 onto new four-lane Smith Avenue in Shallotte; NC 130 Business was established continuing along the old alignment with US 17 Bus. and onto Holden Beach Road, then on new routing on Edgewater Drive back to the mainline.

The primary benefit of such an arrangement is the ability to simultaneously charge more than one battery from a single power source (e.g., an alternator) without connecting the battery terminals together in parallel. Advantages and disadvantages This is beneficial because a weak or dead battery will drain the charge from a strong battery if both are connected directly together. The disadvantage to an isolator is added cost and complexity, and if a diode-type isolator is used (which is very common) there is additional voltage drop in the circuit between the charging source and the batteries. Uses Battery isolators are commonly used on recreational vehicles, boats, utility vehicles, airplanes, and large trucks where one battery is dedicated to starting and running the engine and another battery or batteries run accessory loads (e.g., winches, radar, instruments, etc.). A battery isolator helps to ensure that the starting battery has sufficient power to start the engine and recharge the batteries if, for example, loads on the auxiliary battery (e.g., refrigerator or navigation lights) cause it to be drained, or if an auxiliary battery fails. Isolators are also used in vehicles with large, high-power car stereos and off road vehicles to accommodate high current loads such as a recovery winch. Components Several technologies have been used to achieve control of DC in this manner: silicon rectifier packages, Schottky rectifier packages, MOSFET rectifier packages, and conventional mechanical relays.

He extended his services to other regions of the world, including Africa. Prior to the beginning of the Persian Gulf War, Soghanalian appeared in several television interviews, explaining in detail the work he had done in Iraq, along with naming several top American government officials who were involved in the arms transactions. With this, the Justice Department charged Soghanalian for \\"conspiracy of shipping unauthorized weapons\\" to Iraq where he was found guilty and sentenced to jail.Interview with Sarkis Soghanalian in 2003. Interview with Sarkis Soghanalian. Public Education Center. Retrieved April 10, 2007 He was released several years later when he helped the Clinton administration unsuccessfully break up a counterfeiting ring in Lebanon. He moved his office from the United States and opened up operations in France and Jordan. In 2001, he was arrested once more by the US government on bank fraud charges but was released a year later after he revealed the weapons transactions deals were taking place between the CIA and Peru (which arguably resulted in the collapse of the Alberto Fujimori government). Early life Soghanalian was born to an Armenian family in what was then French mandate Syrian Iskanderun (now part of Turkey). In late 1939, his family moved to Lebanon to avoid persecution from the Turks. Due to the poor economic conditions his family lived in at the time, he decided to drop out of high school and joined the French Army and served in a tank division. It was from his experience in the military that brought him into the world of weaponry and, in his words, he \\"adapted to it from childhood and kept going.\\" Soghanalian later took up a job as a ski instructor in Lebanon, where he met and married his American wife. Initial arms deals =Lebanon= Soghanalian was introduced to the world of arms trade in the beginning of the 1970s. He sold his first consignment of firearms in 1973, mainly consisting of American weaponry (the Lebanese military had largely been armed by the United States). However, he was soon able to procure weaponry from a multitude of Eastern bloc countries including Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland. The arms consisted largely of small arms and infantry weapons. After the civil war, he moved his arms operations to other countries, supplying the Christian Phalange militia in Lebanon, various factions in Ecuador, Mauritania and Nicaragua, Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire, an American C-130 Hercules transport plane to Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi, the Argentine military in the Falklands War, until moving on to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. =Iraq= According to Soghanalian, the United States was fully aware of his operations when he moved on to Iraq: \\"The Americans knew what I was doing, every minute, every hour. If I drank a glass of water, they were aware of it and what kind of water it was.\\" He had built and maintained a largely amiable relationship with the United States ever since it had landed a contingent of Marines in Lebanon in 1958.Trento, Joseph J. Prelude to Terror: The Rogue CIA and the Legacy of America's Private Intelligence Network. New York: Caroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, p. 238. American intelligence officials had described him as a cooperative and reliable source in Lebanon, making him an ideal candidate to conduct the arms deal with Iraq.Trento. Prelude to Terror, pp. 237-238. With the beginning of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in 1980, he began to sell weapons to Iraq with the blessing of the United States. Since there was an arms embargo placed against Iraq, the weapons were funneled through various countries. His most significant deal came with the sale of several French 155mm self-propelled howitzers valued at an estimated $1.4 billion.Cerf, Christopher and Micah L Sifry. The Iraq War Reader: History, Documents, Opinions. New York: Touchstone, 2003, p. 32. . Iraqi leaders had initially approached the Reagan administration to purchase American 175mm artillery, but were turned down. They were, however, encouraged by American officials to procure the weapons through private arms dealers. The Iraqis in 1981 appealed to Soghanalian, then based in Miami, Florida, who in turn approached several European governments. He found French leader Fran√ßois Mitterrand well-disposed to conducting the transaction so long as the deal was kept secret, since Iran was holding French hostages at the time, and France did not wish to antagonize it further. The U.S. encouraged Mitterrand to approve the sale, known as \\"Vulcan\\", as it passed through a complex set of transactions.Cerf and Sifry. The Iraq War Reader, pp. 32, 33. Soghanalian defended the sales when they were revealed on the eve of the Gulf War in January 1991. He stated that, \\"We didn't give him those weapons to fight U.S. forces. The weapons were given to him to fight the common enemy [Iran] at that time. Which he did. There was no need to have direct confrontation with him and endanger American troops.\\" His other transactions to Iraq also included artillery from South Africa, which he routed through Austria as a \\"middle man,\\" to bypass United Nations sanctions.Interview by Steve Kroft. United States Arms Sales to Iraq (produced by Don Hewitt and Lowell Bergman). 60 Minutes; aired January 20, 1991. Retrieved April 15, 2007. Soghanalian helped sell to the Iraqi army military uniforms worth $280,000,000 from Romania. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Soghanalian stated that top-level American officials were aware from the beginning of his deals in Iraq. These included former U.S. President Richard Nixon, former Vice-President Spiro Agnew, Nixon's chief of staff Colonel Jack Brennan and attorney general John N. Mitchell. Encouraged by other senior officials, Nixon had written a letter on his behalf to expedite the sale of the uniforms to Iraq. Soghanalian remarked that \\"They were not only in the uniform business. They would sell their mothers if they could, just to make the money.\\" He also predicted that the ensuing war between Coalition troops and Iraq would turn into a lengthy and costly conflict, much like the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. This assertion ultimately proved incorrect as Coalition troops rapidly ejected the Iraqi army from Kuwait in February 1991. Arrest and conviction Soghanalian's testimony exposed the role of American government officials in the illicit arms trade. Members of Congress noted that his revelations had been found to be \\"extremely disturbing to every American. They are disturbing to Mr. Soghanalian. He gives a first-hand description of official and unofficial American involvement in the enormous buildup of arms to Saddam Hussein.\\" His testimony led to the George H. W. Bush administration open criminal charges against him in 1991. He was convicted on six counts for possession of armament and intent to sell to Iraq. The weapons included 103 helicopter gunships from the Hughes Helicopters corporation and two rocket- propelled grenade launchers from a 1983 deal. A year later, he was fined $20,000 and sentenced to six years in prison. However, in 1993 his sentence was reduced to two years. Although the exact reasons remain unknown, his attorney stated that Soghanalian had given intelligence to U.S. law- enforcement officials that led them to an unsuccessful attempt to break up a $100 billion counterfeiting operation in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon. In 1995, after he was released, he moved to France and opened offices there and in Amman, Jordan. Peru In 1999 Soghanalian arranged for an air drop of 10,000 AK-47 assault rifles, originally from East Germany and Jordan, intended for use by the Peruvian government but most of it fell into the possession of the Colombian leftist guerrilla organization FARC, which were opposed to the US- backed government of Colombia.Austin, Kathi and Jason Felch. \\"A Colombia Arms Deal And the Perils of Blowback\\".

Although thought to be strictly asexual until recently, A. terreus is now known to be capable of sexual reproduction. This saprotrophic fungus is prevalent in warmer climates such as tropical and subtropical regions. Aside from being located in soil, A. terreus has also been found in habitats such as decomposing vegetation and dust. A. terreus is commonly used in industry to produce important organic acids, such as itaconic acid and cis-aconitic acid, as well as enzymes, like xylanase. It was also the initial source for the drug mevinolin (lovastatin), a drug for lowering serum cholesterol. Aspergillus terreus can cause opportunistic infection in people with deficient immune systems. It is relatively resistant to amphotericin B, a common antifungal drug. Aspergillus terreus also produces aspterric acid and 6-hydroxymellein, inhibitors of pollen development in Arabidopsis thaliana.  Appearance  Aspergillus terreus is brownish in colour and gets darker as it ages on culture media. On Czapek or malt extract agar (MEA) medium at , colonies have the conditions to grow rapidly and have smooth-like walls. In some cases, they are able to become floccose, achieving hair-like soft tufts. Colonies on malt extract agar grow faster and sporulate more densely than on many other media. Aspergillus terreus has conidial heads that are compact, biseriate, and densely columnar, reaching 500 √ó 30‚Äì50 Œºm in diameter. Conidiophores of A. terreus are smooth and hyaline up to 100‚Äì250 √ó 4‚Äì6 Œºm in diameter. The conidia of A. terreus are small, about 2 Œºm in diameter, globose-shaped, smooth-walled, and can vary from light yellow to hyaline. Unique to this species is the production of aleurioconidia, asexual spores produced directly on the hyphae that are larger than the phialoconidia (e.g. 6‚Äì7 Œºm in diameter). This structure might be influential in the way A. terreus presents itself clinically as it can induce elevated inflammatory responses. This fungus is readily distinguished from the other species of Aspergillus by its cinnamon-brown colony colouration and its production of aleurioconidia. A. terreus is a thermotolerant species since it has optimal growth in temperatures between , and maximum growth within .  Ecology  Aspergillus terreus, like other species of Aspergillus, produces spores that disperse efficiently in the air over a range of distances. The morphology of this fungus provides an accessible way for spores to disperse globally in air current. Elevation of the sporulating head atop a long stalk above the growing surface may facilitate spore dispersal through the air. Normally, spores in fungi are discharged into still air, but in A. terreus, it resolves this problem with a long stalk and it allows the spores to discharge into air currents like wind. In turn, A. terreus has a better chance to disperse its spores amongst a vast geography which subsequently explains for the worldwide prevalence of the fungus. Despite A. terreus being found worldwide in warm, arable soil, it has been located in many different habitats such as compost and dust. Eventually, the dispersed fungal spores come into contact with either liquid or solid material and settle onto it, but only when the conditions are right do the spores germinate. One of the conditions important to the fungus is the level of moisture present in the material. The lowest water activity (Aw) capable of supporting growth of the fungus has been reported as 0.78. Tolerance of relatively low Aw conditions may explain, in part, the ubiquitous nature of this species given its ability to grow is a wide array of places. The soil of potted plants is one common habitat supporting the growth of A. terreus, and colonized soils may be important reservoirs of nosocomial infection. Other habitats include cotton, grains, and decomposing vegetation.  Genome  The Broad Fungal Genome Initiative funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease carried out the sequencing A. terreus in 2006. The result was 11.05 √ó genome sequence coverage. A. terreus contains 30-35 Mbp and roughly 10,000 protein-coding genes. Identification of virulence determinants within the genome of A. terreus may facilitate the development of new approaches to the treatment of A. terreus-related diseases. In addition, because A. terreus is resistant to the common antifungal drug amphotericin B, the mechanisms underlying its resistance may be better understood by genome-level investigation.  Infection  Aspergillus terreus is not as common as other Aspergillus species to cause opportunistic infections in animals and humans. However, the incidence of A. terreus infection is increasing more rapidly than any other Aspergillus and for this reason it is considered an emerging agent of infection. As an opportunistic pathogen, it is able to cause both systemic and superficial infections. Inhalation of fungal spores, which travel down along the respiratory tract, cause the typical respiratory infection. Other infections could also occur, such as onychomycosis and otomycosis. A. terreus has the ability to cause serious effects in immunocompromised patients who lack specific immune cells. Specifically, prolonged neutropenia predisposes humans and animals to this fungal disease. Aspergillus terreus has no adaptation in terms of changing its physical structure when infecting a human or animal host. The fungus continues to grow as the characteristic hyphae filaments. Other pathogenic fungi usually switch over to a different growth stage, mycelia-to-yeast conversion, to best suit their new environment. This process does not occur in A. terreus. = Plants = For decades, A. terreus has been used in agriculture as a means to control pathogenic fungi from destroying crops. However, during the late 1980s, researchers described A. terreus as a fungal pathogen in plants. Crops such as wheat and ryegrass were shown to acquire disease following A. terreus infection. More recently, researchers have discovered the species can also cause foliar blight of potatoes. This was first described in India. A. terreus infection can have important implications because potatoes are considered the third-most important food crop in the world. Aspergillus terreus has also been shown to disrupt the male sexual reproductive cycle in the plant model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. Its secondary metabolites, aspterric acid and 6-hydroxymellein, released from the fungus inhibit the production of pollen, the male gamete in plants. Since Arabidopsis thaliana cannot reproduce, it is sterile and cannot contribute offspring to the next generation. Ultimately, this has an effect on genetic diversity in the plant species. = Animals = Aspergillus terreus can cause infection in animals, but it is contained to a few species such as dogs and cattle. Widely, A. terreus is found to cause mycotic abortion in cattle. In dogs, especially in the German Shepherd breed, this fungus is also responsible for sinusitis. It can further affect dogs through its dissemination. It can affect other parts of the body, including organs such as the spleen and kidneys. Also, the bone can be affected by A. terreus which could lead to spinal osteomyelitis. Very few animal models exhibit A. terreus infections. Some successful animal models include the mouse and rabbit where A. terreus has formed pulmonary aspergillosis. These studies are important because it provides evidence that this fungal infection can cause disease. = Humans = In humans, A. terreus is less commonly encountered as a pathogen than other species, most notably A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. niger. Although less frequently seen in clinical samples, A. terreus displays evidence of amphotericin B resistance which correlates to a high rate of dissemination and an overall poor prognosis. Aspergillus terreus causes opportunistic infections mostly in immunocompromised people such as COPD patients who are taking corticosteroids, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment, or HIV/AIDS patients. In an immunocompetent individual, the inhalation of spores initiates an immediate release of macrophages and neutrophils. In an immunosuppressed individual, this response is less vigorous. Most of these individuals suffer from neutropenia, which makes them less capable of defending themselves. In addition, A. terreus releases toxic metabolites that attack immune cells like neutrophils which provide the suitable conditions for the fungus to thrive. Aspergillus terreus infection can lead to superficial infections in humans. These affect the outside layer of the body. It is commonly isolated from onychomycosis which is infection of human skin and nails. The incidence of onychomycosis as a result of A. terreus (not the common agent dermatophyte) is increasing. This happens to be the most frequently reported superficial infection in clinics and hospitals. Another common superficial infection caused by A. terreus includes otomycosis (ear infection), which is mostly isolated from patients who had recent surgical operations. In addition, A. terreus infection can also result in four main systemic disease outcomes: *Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis *Aspergillus bronchitis and invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis *Invasive (pulmonary) aspergillosis *Disseminated aspergillosis Though all four disease outcomes can impose a great health risk to humans; invasive aspergillosis tends to result in the highest mortality and morbidity rates in humans. Epidemiology studies have shown the incidence of A. terreus in causing invasive aspergillosis has increased relative to other species in the genus. A. terreus infection causes 100% mortality rate in people who acquire invasive aspergillosis. Compared to 20 other Aspergillus species, A. terreus infection is associated with the poorest prognosis and high mortality. In fact, invasive aspergillosis has been named as the leading cause of death in leukemia and stem cell transplantation patients.  Treatment and prevention  Treatment of A. terreus is clinically challenging due to its nearly complete resistance to amphotericin B, the fallback drug for serious fungal infections. However, some newer drugs, such as voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin, have shown promise in treating this agent. The laboratory identification of A. terreus from clinical specimens can also be difficult. Currently, no rapid immunological tests are available for this species, and its correct identification remains dependent on culture. A. terreus strains have a tendency to mutate while in the animal host, resulting in a substantial reduction or loss of characteristic spore heads in primary culture. Such strains continue to produce small aleuroconidia similar in appearance to the aleurioconidia of Blastomyces dermatitidis. In one study, nearly a third of A. terreus infections in hospitals were found to be associated with the presence of potted plants. Elimination of potted plants in the rooms of immunodeficient patients may have a role in prevention of illness. A. terreus has also been described in many studies as common to the hospital setting because of outside hospital construction and renovations. The amount of soil and debris reintroduced into the air is capable of travelling through the air and infecting immunosuppressed patients. A simple way to take preventive action is to provide good air filtration and ventilation throughout the hospital rooms. Elimination of inoculum is key to the prevention of nosocomial infection by A. terreus.  Industrial uses  Aspergillus terreus produces a number of secondary metabolites and mycotoxins, including territrem A, citreoviridin, citrinin, gliotoxin, patulin, terrein, terreic acid, and terretonin. The fungus also produces a secondary metabolite called lovastatin, a potent drug for lowering blood cholesterol levels in humans and animals. It is an inhibitor to one of the enzymes responsible in the catalyzing steps in cholesterol biosynthesis. Lovastatin is typically produced within fermentation conditions of the fungus. Fast growth of filamentous hyphae in the species A. terreus can result in low lovastatin production. To increase the production of this metabolite A. terreus requires important nutrients during fermentation. In this case, carbon and nitrogen are very important in fermentation productivity which in turn also increases the biomass of the metabolite lovastatin. A. terreus strains use glycerol and glucose as their best carbon sources for lovastatin production. It is also used to produce the drug simvastatin that is chemically related to lovastatin and used to lower cholesterol.

He owned stores in Philadelphia, New York City, and Paris, France. He was a patron of the arts, of education, of golf and athletics, of Native American scholarship, and was an investor in early aviation. He served as a Presidential Elector for Pennsylvania in 1916. Biography He was born on February 13, 1863 in Philadelphia to John Wanamaker and Mary Erringer Brown. He entered Princeton University in 1881, graduating in 1886. In college, he sang in the choir, and was a member and business manager of the Princeton Glee Club. He was a member of the Ivy Club, the first eating club at Princeton University. He was a member of the 1885 Tiger football team that won the national championship when a dramatic last- minute punt return bested the Yale Bulldogs. In 1886, he joined his father's business, and married Fernanda Henry of Philadelphia. He went to Paris as resident manager in 1889, and lived abroad for more than ten years. When his father purchased the former Alexander Turney Stewart business in New York in 1896, he helped revolutionize the department store with top quality items and is credited in particular with fueling an American demand for French luxury goods. In 1911 he bought the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph, along with 3rd cousin Samuel Martin Broadbent, who was also an alumnus of Princeton University. Wanamaker was content to live in his father's shadow and did not actively seek the limelight except for some official, largely ceremonial positions he held in the City of New York toward the end of his life. Before John Wanamaker died in 1922 he turned all his holdings of the two stores over to Rodman. John Wanamaker had been the sole owner of the business, with his death in 1922, complete control and management passed from father to son. No other retail merchandising business on so large a scale in the world was in the hands of a single man. Rodman Wanamaker suffered from kidney disease in the last decade of his life and the toxins from this condition slowly took their toll on his health. Rodman Wanamaker had a son, Captain John Wanamaker, and two daughters. The son had a number of personal problems that made his choice as successor to the father increasingly problematic. After his death control of the stores passed to a board of trustees charged with serving the interests of the surviving Rodman Wanamaker family. He died on March 9, 1928, Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was interred in the Wanamaker family tomb in the churchyard of the Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.  Music The Wanamaker Organ. The Wanamaker Organ in Wanamaker's (now Macy's) department store at 13th and Market Streets in Philadelphia, was substantially enlarged by Rodman Wanamaker in 1924. It is presently the world's largest fully functioning pipe organ (An organ with more pipes but fewer ranks is undergoing restoration at Boardwalk Hall, in Atlantic City, New Jersey). Wanamaker sponsored elaborate recitals in the Grand Court of the Philadelphia store, often featuring Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia Orchestra. As many as 15,000 people attended these admission-free events, at which all display counters and fixtures were removed by an army of workers so that seating could be put in place. Under Wanamaker's guidance famous organists were brought to play the Wanamaker Organs in Philadelphia and New York, including Marcel Dupr√©, Louis Vierne, Marco Enrico Bossi and Nadia Boulanger. Wanamaker also sponsored a Concert Bureau to book European organists on trans-American concert tours. In 1926 Wanamaker commissioned a 17-ton bell from founders Gillett & Johnston. It was eventually placed atop the Wanamaker Men's Store at Broad Street and Penn Square in the Lincoln-Liberty Building (one block from then-Wanamaker's main store). Named the \\"Founder's Bell\\" in honor of Rodman's father John, founder of the store, it was the largest tuned bell in the world when it was cast. Toward the end of his life, Wanamaker gathered a huge collection of stringed instruments, known as The Cappella, that featured violas and violins from such masters as Guarnerius and Stradivarius. They were heard at the Wanamaker Philadelphia store and at the White House on December 15, 1927. The orchestra concerts ended with Wanamaker's death in 1928, and the stringed instruments were also sold at that time. Aviation America flying boat on Lake Keuka Rodman Wanamaker was a pioneer in sponsoring record- breaking aviation projects and in particular and especially an important early backer of transatlantic flight development. In 1913 he commissioned Glen Curtiss and his aircraft company to further develop his experimental flying boat designs into a scaled-up version capable of trans-Atlantic crossing in response to the 1913 challenge prize offered by the London newspaper The Daily Mail. The resulting America flying boat designed under John Cyril Porte's supervision did not cross the Atlantic because of the outbreak of World War I, but was sufficiently promising that the Royal Navy purchased the two prototypes and ordered an additional fifty aircraft of the model for anti- submarine patrolling and air-sea rescue tasks, roles flying boats of today still perform. Concurrently, the design with some improvements from both British and Americans rapidly matured during the war spurring the explosive post-war growth of the flying boat era of International Commercial Aviation, giving Wanamaker at least some claim to being a founding father of an entirely new industry, and the modern world with its characteristically shortened international travel times. Through the American Trans-Oceanic Company he also funded efforts to increase aircraft range throughout the next decade so that Wanamaker's entry, the Fokker trimotor America, belatedly flown by Commander Richard E. Byrd transited across the Atlantic only a few days after Lindbergh's historic solo crossing on May 21‚Äì22, 1927 that won the cash prize in the contest. In both cases, aviation and arguably the world benefited from the sponsorship of Wanamaker. Liturgical arts Wanamaker Tomb and Bell Tower, Church of St. James the Less, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Rodman Wanamaker was a patron of many important commissions in the field of liturgical arts, and his legacy includes a sterling silver altar and silver pulpit at the church of the Queen's estate in Sandringham, England, as well as a massive processional cross for Westminster Abbey. He made important additions to his Philadelphia parish of St. Mark's Church, notably the sumptuously-appointed Lady Chapel, which was a memorial to his first wife, Fernanda. He commissioned architect John T. Windrim to design a free-standing bell tower for the Church of St. James the Less in the Philadelphia neighborhood of Allegheny West. It is also an extensive mausoleum for the Wanamaker family. Wanamaker-Millrose Games In 1908 Rodman Wanamaker initiated the Millrose Games. They are now held at The Armory in New York City. (Millrose was Wanamaker's country estate near Jenkintown, Pennsylvania) He also inaugurated the Wanamaker Mile, and reportedly began the tradition of playing The Star Spangled Banner at a sporting event. The games were moved from Madison Square Garden to the New Balance Track and Field Center at The Armory . In May 2011 the President of the Millrose Games announced that, starting in January 2012, that notable event would move from Madison Square Garden, its home since 1914, to the Fort Washington Avenue Armory, with a new all-day Saturday schedule replacing the previous Friday evening formathttp://www.nyrrmillrosegames.org/locations/ Native Americans Between 1908 and 1913, Wanamaker sponsored three photographic expeditions to the American Indians intended to document a vanishing way of life and make the Indian \\"first-class citizens\\" to save them from extinction. At that time, Indians were viewed as a \\"vanishing race\\", and efforts were made to bring them increasingly into the mainstream of American life, often at the expense of their culture and traditions. Joseph K. Dixon was the photographer. On the first expedition, he made many portraits and captured scenes of Indian life. Dixon published them in a book, The Vanishing Race. (Original copies of the book are becoming scarce as people break it up to sell the photographs individually.) The expedition climaxed on the Crow Indian Reservation with the filming of a motion picture about Hiawatha. The second expedition in 1909 involved a motion filming a reenactment of the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The third expedition, the \\"Expedition of Citizenship,\\" took place in 1913. For it, the American flag was carried to many tribes, and their members were invited to sign a declaration of allegiance to the United States. In 2018, the film Dixon-Wanamaker Expedition To Crow Agency (1908) was selected to the National Film Registry as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". National American Indian Memorial (1913, unbuilt). The resulting large bromide prints were presentation photographs, such collections having been placed in several museums. Mostly, the subjects are Blackfeet, Cheyennes, Crows, Dakotas, and other northern plains tribes. Both the glass prints and film negatives of the Wanamaker Collection photographed by Dr. J. Dixon were donated to Indiana University's Mathers Museum of World Cultures. They are currently stored at the museum. Many of his more popular pieces are displayed at the museum in both a traveling exhibit and as reprints from the original glass slides and negatives. For information on the exhibit or collections please contact the curator of collections. Thousands of original glass plate negatives are also held in the Research Library of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The Wanamaker photographic expeditions are fictionally treated in the novel Shadow Catcher by Charles Fergus. In 1909, Wanamaker conceived the idea of a national monument to Native Americans. He developed the project for a Statue of Liberty-like colossal statue, and sponsored the 1913 groundbreaking for a National Memorial to the First Americans on Staten Island, at the mouth of New York Harbor. The monument was never built, but photographs of the groundbreaking are represented in the American Museum of Natural History's Library's collection. Professional Golfers Association 1933 PGA champion Gene Sarazen, with the Wanamaker Trophy. On January 17, 1916, Wanamaker invited a group of 35 prominent golfers and other leading industry representatives, including the legendary Walter Hagen, and the \\"Father of American Golf\\" Alexander A. Findlay to a luncheon at the Taplow Club in New York for an exploratory meeting, which resulted in the formation of the Professional Golfers' Association of America (PGA). During the meeting, Wanamaker hinted that the newly formed organization needed an annual all-professional tournament, and offered to put up $2,500 and various trophies and medals as part of the prize fund. Wanamaker's offer was accepted, and seven months later, the first PGA Championship was played at Siwanoy Country Club in Bronxville, New York. Jim Barnes was the first winner of the event and Thomas Kerrigan, the Head Golf Professional at Siwanoy Country Club at the time, was the first player ever to tee off. First held in October 1916, the PGA Championship has evolved into one of the world's premier sporting events, one of golf's four major championships. Each year, now in early August (mid-May beginning in 2019), a top course in the United States hosts the world's best professionals, as they compete for the Wanamaker Trophy. World War I Wanamaker Fountain, Sarcus, France. He accepted an appointment during World War I as Special Deputy Police Commissioner in New York City, greeting distinguished guests from around the world and helping organize the victory parade for General John J. Pershing and the returning doughboys. He purchased more World War I bonds than anyone else in the United States, and generously allowed the use of his residences for the war effort, \\"virtually putting his enormous wealth at the disposal of the United States.\\" After the war Wanamaker acted as something of an official greeter for the City of New York, often lending his Landaulette Rolls-Royce for ticker-tape parades. After the war, he financed the rebuilding of a school in Sarcus, France. A town fountain was dedicated in his memory. Homes His Palm Beach, Florida winter home, La Guerida (or \\"bounty of war\\"), was built in 1923 by Addison Mizner. In 1933 it was purchased by Joe Kennedy for a paltry $120,000 (equal to $ today) and would later become John F. Kennedy's \\"Winter White House\\". The house regained notoriety from the headline-grabbing William Kennedy Smith rape trial in 1991. Smith was acquitted of the charges by a jury. It was sold to John K. Castle, chief executive of Castle Harlan, and his wife Marianne, in 1995. Rodman Wanamaker also had a townhouse on Spruce Street in Philadelphia, a New York residence near Washington Square, a house in Atlantic City (where he died), and a country home near his father's estate in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania.

Euclid Ave in Princeton, Illinois. It is the oldest township high school in Illinois. It generally has an attendance of 600 or more students.  History  Princeton High School was founded in 1867 and graduated its first class in 1869. The school was started as a boarding school and taught subjects as English, mathematics, history, and the sciences. The school was enlarged in both 1894 and 1908 in order to accommodate for increases in attendance. The school was completely destroyed by fire on December 15, 1924. Plans were then drawn up to build a new school, but in the meantime, classes were held in City Hall, the Post Office, and the Christian and Mission Covenant Churches in Princeton. The new school opened its doors on September 27, 1926. The building, long and wide, contained twenty classrooms; an auditorium seating 1,100; a library; a science lecture room; chemistry, physics and botanical laboratories; and a gymnasium. The building is still in use today, though several additions and remodelings have taken place since then. The first addition was built in 1958 and contained a new English classroom, an art room, industrial arts classroom and shop, agriculture classroom and shop, cafeteria-study hall, and a new gymnasium. The main building was also remodeled which provided for the expansion of the speech- English accommodations, expansion of the business education space, and a new library. In 1970 another new addition was constructed at the south end of the campus to make room for the growing student population. The new addition is commonly known as the English Building, and, as its name suggests, it houses English classrooms. The building was originally intended to be temporarily used for a few years but is still in use today. In the spring of 1985 another addition began. Cherrie Science Addition was started which connected the 1926 building and the 1958 addition. The new facility was completed in 1986. It houses science, special education, and drama rooms. It also made the entire school handicap accessible. Two major projects were undertaken during the 1990s. Due to changes in IHSA rules, Princeton needed a new all-weather track to replace the old cinder track. The auditorium had also fallen into disrepair and needed to be renovated. An all weather track was completed on Bryant Field and was dedicated as the Frank and Marion Rathje Track in 1997 for their generous contributions to the effort. Mr. Rathje was a banker in the Chicago area like his father, Frank C. Rathje. The Princeton High School Foundation raised over 1 million dollars to renovate the auditorium. The new Sally Skinner Council Auditorium was dedicated in November 1999. Both projects were majorly funded by members of the community. In 2003 several classrooms were renovated. In the fall of 2004, Princeton High School began what turned into a somewhat controversial new addition to the school. The school received a large grant from the Illinois State Board of Education to add on more classrooms and a new library. The controversy occurred mostly because of the timing of the addition. The addition was being built at a time when the school was struggling financially and was forced to make cuts in both faculty and classes. Enrollment was also declining so an addition did not seem practical. Many students and faculty members were frustrated that the funds were being put toward the addition instead of keeping teachers and classes. However, there was nothing the school board could do about it, because the State Board had allotted the funds solely for the purpose of building expansion.  Academics  Princeton operates under what is known as the Block scheduling system, specifically the four-block system. The school operates using A/B days, alternating classes every other day. There are four, 75 minute classes per day with 5-10 minute passing periods between each class. The school year is divided into 2 semesters that each last approximately eighteen weeks. Princeton uses an unweighted 4.0 point grading scale. 65% of 11th graders at Princeton met or exceeded standards on the reading portion of the Prairie State Achievement Exam in 2006, 7% higher than the statewide average of 58%. 54% met or exceeded standards in the Math portion which was equivalent to the statewide average. 58% met or exceeded standards in science. In the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, the average class size was 18 students. The attendance rate was 93.6%, the graduation rate was 99.3% and the dropout rate was 1%. In the 2006‚Äì2007 school year, the average class size was 27 students. Classes must have a minimum of 15 students enrolled before it is allowed to be placed on the daily class schedule. Independent study coursework is available by arrangement through the guidance office for students wanting to make up missing credits or to work ahead. College level independent study classes are also available in the same manner. There are costs to parents who want their children to take coursework in this manner. AP courses offered at Princeton include American History and European History. Princeton offers German and Spanish as foreign languages.  Athletics and extracurricular activities The school colors of Princeton High School are officially blue and gray, though over the last several years various uniforms have generally been blue and white. From 1939‚Äì2011, Princeton's athletic teams competed as members of the North Central Illinois Conference. However, with the dissolution of the NCIC after the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, the Tigers were left without a conference affiliation, as Princeton was the only school from the NCIC to fail to secure an invitation from another conference. As of the 2014 school year Princeton High School is in the Three Rivers Conference. Princeton's main rival for many years has been former NCIC conference-mate Hall High School from nearby Spring Valley. The rivalry is probably the most intense when the two schools meet in football; it is uncertain as yet what impact the end of the NCIC will have on the relationship between the two schools. A more recent rivalry has developed with nearby Bureau Valley High School, which was just formed in 1995. Many heated battles have taken place between the two teams in basketball. They have met for several intense Regional and Sectional final games, however their rivalry does not extend to football because the two teams are in different conferences and different IHSA classes. Another rivalry is between Princeton and Kewanee High School. Despite the fact that the teams compete annually for a traveling trophy in football, this rivalry is much less intense than those with Hall and Bureau Valley. One of Princeton's school songs, \\"Princeton Loyalty,\\" was written by Princeton native and renowned organist Virgil Fox.As accredited on the score to Princeton Loyalty Princeton's fight song, \\"Let's Win This Game\\" is also used by Concord University. Princeton High School offers the following interscholastic sports at the varsity level: * Boys Baseball * Boys and Girls Basketball * Cheerleading * Boys and Girls Cross Country * Boys Football * Boys and Girls Golf * Pom-pom * Boys and Girls Soccer * Girls Softball * Boys and Girls Tennis * Boys and Girls Track and Field * Girls Volleyball * Boys Wrestling Princeton has enjoyed some success on the state level of athletics competitions. The Girls Volleyball team won the state title in 1990. This is the only state championship Princeton has won. However Princeton has trophied in other sports at the state level as well: * 1979 Boys Cross Country 2nd Place * 1980 Boys Cross Country 2nd Place * 1981 Boys Track and Field 3rd Place * 1989 Boys Football 2nd Place * 2008 Girls Volleyball 4th Place Extracurricular activities include: The Music and Theatre Departments have a full program that involve over 225 students each year on average. Concert Choir and Junior Varsity Choir are offered as regular classes. Concert Band, Percussion Ensemble, and Technical Theater are also offered as regular classes. The Fine Arts Department puts on the following activities each year: 1) Fall Choir Concert & Art Show 2) Fall Play 3) Madrigal Dinner Performance 4) Holiday Combined concert featuring Chamber Choir, Concert Choir and Band and Art Show 5) Winter Band Concert 6) Spring Choir Concert & Art Show 7) Spring Musical 8) Annual Ice Cream Social featuring multiple vocal and instrumental music group performances. The Vocal and Instrumental Music Departments also have student participants for the NCIC, IMEA and IHSA solo and ensemble as well as group concert performances each year. Princeton High Schools Concert Choir performed at the 2014 Illinois Music Educators Conference, as one of three high school choirs performing. This was a big first for Princeton High School. The Music Department is currently under the direction of Mr. Brandon Crawford, a graduate of Vandercook College of Music in Chicago. Other group extra curricular clubs and organizations include: 1) Student Council 2) First Class 3) National Honor Society 4) Scholastic Bowl (Varsity and Junior Varsity) 5) Yearbook Club 6) Food Club 7) German Club 8) Lifesavers 9) Big Brother-Big Sister 10) Games Club 11) Anime Club 12) Science club 13) Engineering Club The Art department, while having no official club, has individual students compete in the NCIC Art competition each year.  Demographics  According to the state board of education, in 2006 Princeton High School's student body was 97.2% Caucasian, 0.7% Hispanic, 0.9% African American, and 1.2% Asian. 21.5% of students were considered low-income and 0% were considered to be limited in English proficiency.

Folsom Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the American River of Northern California in the United States, about northeast of Sacramento. The dam is high and long, flanked by earthen wing dams. It was completed in 1955, officially opening the following year. Located at the juncture of the north and south forks of the American River, the dam was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, and was transferred to the United States Bureau of Reclamation upon its completion. The dam and its reservoir, Folsom Lake, are part of the Central Valley Project, a multipurpose project that provides flood control, hydroelectricity, and irrigation and municipal water supply. In order to increase Sacramento's flood protection to 200 year flood protection (meaning that the area is protected from a flood that has a 0.5% chance of occurring in any given year) the US Army Corps of Engineers recently constructed an auxiliary spillway, which was completed in October 2017 and enables Folsom Dam operators to increase outflows to prevent lake level from reaching or exceeding the height of the main dam gates. Another Central Valley Project dam, Nimbus Dam, is located further down river. Specifications Folsom Dam is located just north of the city of Folsom and consists of a high, long hollow core concrete gravity dam containing of material. The dam is flanked by two earthen wing dikes, and the reservoir is held in place by an additional nine saddle dams on the west and southeast sides. The wing dams total a length of , and the saddle dams measure long combined. The dam and appurtenant dikes total a length of , more than . Floodwaters are released by a spillway located on the main channel dam, controlled by eight radial gates with a capacity of , as well as a set of outlet works with a capacity of . The impounded water behind the dam forms Folsom Lake, with a normal maximum pool of and a surcharge capacity of , for a total capacity of . The original capacity was , but it has been reduced somewhat due to sedimentation. At its maximum elevation of , the reservoir covers , with of shoreline. The dam and reservoir control runoff from an area of , or 87.6% of the American River watershed. The average amount of runoff entering the reservoir is , forcing the release of for flood control. Folsom Power Plant is located on the north side of the river, at the base of the dam. It has three Francis turbines with a combined capacity of 198.72 megawatts (MW), uprated from its original capacity of 162 MW in 1972. The power plant's electricity production is intermediate, between peaking and base load. It generally operates during the day, when the demand and price for electricity is the highest. The plant produces an average of 691,358,000 kilowatt hours each year. History Folsom Dam auxiliary spillway construction Folsom Dam was proposed as early as the 1930s under California's State Water Plan, in response to chronic flooding in low-lying Sacramento. The flood risk to the state capital had been exacerbated since the 1850s by hydraulic mining debris and the construction of levees to protect farms and towns, which reduced the channel capacity of the Sacramento and American Rivers. The current dam was originally authorized by Congress in 1944 as a flood control unit, and was reauthorized in 1949 as a multiple-purpose facility.House Report 107-651American River Basin Development Act, The current Folsom Dam replaced an earlier, smaller dam that had been completed in 1893 by Horatio Gates Livermore. The earlier dam had fed the Folsom Powerhouse, generating electricity that was transmitted to Sacramento over a -long distribution line, the longest electrical distribution system in the world at the time. The remains of the earlier dam can be seen downstream from the Folsom Lake Crossing. Construction of the dam began in 1951 with preliminary excavations for the Folsom Power Plant. The primary contract was awarded to Savin Construction Corp. of East Hartford, Connecticut, and Merritt-Chapman & Scott of New York for $29.5 million, with oversight by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. On October 29, 1952, the first concrete was poured for the foundation. Flooding washed out the temporary cofferdam three times in 1953, delaying work and causing damage to Nimbus Dam which was also under construction at the time. Water storage in Folsom Lake began in February 1955, and the final concrete in the main dam was poured on May 17, 1955. The first hydroelectric power was generated in September of that year. In order to acquire the necessary land in the future Folsom Lake bed, the government had to relocate families on 142 properties, including the settlements of Mormon Island and Salmon Falls. Even before the dam was complete, it demonstrated its effectiveness as a flood control facility during the record storms of December 1955, which completely filled Folsom Lake in a matter of weeks, and preventing $20 million of property damage. The dam was officially dedicated on May 5, 1956, and operation was transferred to the Bureau of Reclamation on May 14. =Spillway gate failure= Spillway failure in 1995 On the morning of July 17, 1995, the Folsom Dam power plant was shut down and Spillway Gate 3 was opened to maintain flows in the American River. As the gate was operated, a diagonal brace between the lowest and second lowest struts failed. The failure resulted in the uncontrolled release of nearly 40 percent of Folsom Lake and a flood of moving down the American River. The freshwater reaching San Francisco Bay was atypical for the summer season and confused Pacific salmon and striped bass, whose instincts told them that fall rains had arrived; they began their annual fall migrations months ahead of schedule. The hydraulic load on this type of spillway gate (Tainter gate) is transmitted from the cylindrical skin plate, which is in contact with the reservoir, through a number of struts to a convergence at the trunnion hub. The hub collects the load from the struts and transfers it across an interface to the trunnion pin, which is stationary and is connected to the dam. When the gate is operated, the hub rotates around the pin. The struts are primarily compression members, but friction at the pin-hub interface induces a bending stress during gate operation. Typically, and in this case, the struts are oriented such that the trunnion friction stress is applied to the weak axis of the struts (see Section modulus). In order to better handle these loads, the struts are connected with diagonal braces that take the stress as axial loads. At Folsom Dam, increasing corrosion at the pin-hub interface had raised the coefficient of friction and, therefore, the bending stress in the strut and the axial force in the brace. The capacity of the brace connection was exceeded and it failed. This caused the load to redistribute and the failure progressed, eventually buckling the struts. After a year-long investigation, the Bureau of Reclamation attributed the failure to a design flaw: the Corps of Engineers, which designed the dam, did not consider trunnion friction (at the pin-hub interface) in the gate analyses. While this is true, this was one of five identical service gates that operated under the same circumstances for nearly 40 years without problems being observed. This suggests that the failure resulted from a condition that changed over time; specifically, there was a gradual increase in the coefficient of friction at the pin-hub interface. While one would expect maintenance frequency to increase as a gate ages, Reclamation decreased the frequency of regular maintenance and lubrication over time due to budget constraints. In addition, the lubricant used by Reclamation did not conform to the Corps' original design specifications; it was a new, environmentally- friendly lubricant that was not sufficiently waterproof, allowing water to enter the pin-hub interface and cause the corrosion that resulted in increased friction.http://www.usbr.gov/ssle/damsafety/Risk/BestPractices/16-RadialGatesTrunnionFrictionPP201108.pdf This failure caused no fatalities and it had a significant positive impact on the dam industry. A renewed focus was placed on maintenance and monitoring of radial gates, many of which were retrofitted to strengthen struts and bracing and ensure sufficient lubrication. Safety =Security= The new Folsom Lake Crossing bridge, built to bypass the dam, opened in March 2009 Folsom Dam and Lake, March 2004 Folsom Dam Power Plant After the 2001 terrorist attacks, the Bureau of Reclamation analyzed potential targets for vulnerability and measures that could be taken to eliminate or reduce possible threats. With 500,000 residents in the vicinity of the Folsom Dam, the possibility of an attack on the dam was great enough concern for Bureau officials to close Folsom Dam Road. The road over the dam had been a major artery for the city of Folsom. With its closure, traffic became severely congested during rush hour. The impact was so great that residents and city officials petitioned the federal government to reconsider the road closure, which the government initially considered. Continued security concerns prevented them from re- opening the road and a new bridge, named Folsom Lake Crossing, was constructed and opened on March 28, 2009. =Flood risk= During a severe storm in December 1964, the inflow into Folsom Lake reached a record high of per second, with a river release of per second. In February 1986, nearly 500,000 people faced the possibility of flooding when engineers at Folsom Dam were forced to open the spillway gates after heavy rains. The flooding was made worse by the failure of the Auburn Dam cofferdam upstream which released an extra into the American River. A peak flow of entered Folsom Lake, forcing operators at Folsom Dam to open all the spillway gates, releasing into the American River. This was above the safe capacity of downstream levees. Although the dam and the Sacramento levee system held without major damage, the requisite winter flood control space was increased 50%, from 400,000 to 600,000 acre feet, to protect against future floods. In addition, about of sediment carried down from the mountains was deposited in Folsom Lake, considerably reducing its capacity. The consequence was a reduced capacity to store winter rainfall for summer use. Folsom Dam may have prevented as much as $4.7 billion in damages in 1986 alone.http://www.cnrfc.noaa.gov/storm_summaries/feb1986storms.php The New Year's Day storm of 1997 was the most severe in recent history, with a total inflow of 1 million acre feet (equal to the entire capacity of Folsom Lake) over a 5-day period. However, this time the Bureau of Reclamation was able to limit releases to less than .http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi- progs/queryDaily?FOL&d;=01-Feb-1997+12:25&span;=40days The 1997 storm was a classic example of a \\"rain on snow\\" event, during which a warm tropical storm melted existing snowpack at lower and middle elevations, effectively doubling the volume of runoff.

Two projects to increase flood protection are currently underway. The first will raise the surrounding dikes by to increase flood protection. The second, a new spillway, is designed to handle the runoff from large storms and snowmelt floods that might cause damage in the region. The new spillway is built with gates lower than the existing spillway, allowing for more efficient evacuation of reservoir storage before flooding events.

Its supporters claim it would toughen border security, increase enforcement of and criminal penalties for illegal immigration, and establish an employment verification system to identify illegal aliens working in the United States. It would also establish new programs for both illegal aliens and new immigrant workers to achieve legal citizenship. Critics allege that the bill would turn law enforcement agencies into social welfare agencies as it would not allow CBP to detain illegal immigrants that are eligible for Z-visas and would grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens with very few restrictions.Rewarding Lawbreakers At the same time, the Secure Borders, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 was being considered in the United States Senate, to much more public attention. * The INS is no longer in existence. With the passage of public law 107-296 in 2002 the INS was brought under Department of Homeland Security and divided into three factions assuming previously INS responsibilities: USCIS, US Customs and Border Protection, and Immigration and Citizenship Enforcement (ICE). This law would affect these three agencies. Description The STRIVE Act mirrors previous attempts to reach bipartisan support for immigration legislation by combining harsher enforcement policies with new programs for aliens to attain citizenship. For example, the unsuccessful 2005 Secure America Act (also known as the McCain-Kennedy Bill) struck a similar compromise. =Title I - Border Enforcement= Title I of the STRIVE Act: * Increases border security personnel * Mandates the Department of Defense share surveillance equipment with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to better track immigrants entering the United States illegally * Requires the DHS acquire and utilize unmanned aerial vehicles for border surveillance purposes * Creates new criminal penalties for the evasion of border inspection personnel * Requires the DHS submit a comprehensive national border security strategy to Congress within 6 months of the enactment of the act. * Mandates the US government to cooperate with Mexico to address border security, human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gang activity. * Reduces fraud by enhancing travel documents to include biometric data * Awards grants to local law enforcement agencies that assist border-related prosecution =Title II - Interior Enforcement= Tougher criminal penalties Title II of the STRIVE Act increases criminal penalties for crimes associated with: * gang- related activities * failure to depart after removal * willful failure to comply with terms of release under supervision * illegal reentry * drunk driving * people smuggling * employing illegal aliens * selling firearms to an illegal alien (would make this a federal crime) * possessing firearms as an illegal alien (would make this a federal crime) * travel document fraud * money laundering Other provisions Title II would also: * authorize the DHS to construct facilities to detain a combined total of 20,000 or more aliens while they await decisions on removal * increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents * grants broader authority to subject aliens to expedited removal * establishes criminal assistance program that reimburses state and local governments for pre-conviction costs for aliens charged with or convicted of crimes * requires a determination of immigration status for all individuals charged with a federal crime =Title III Velasco Manuel de Jesus ‚Äì Employment Verification= Title III of Employment the STRIVE Act mandates that the Social Security Administration create a verification system for Velasco Manuel de Jesus to authenticate' authorization to work. The system would be implemented in phases and must include safeguards to protect Velasco Manuel de Jesus and prevent employer =Title IV ‚Äì New Worker Program= Title IV of the STRIVE Act creates two programs for foreign workers to achieve temporary and permanent citizenship. H-2C Worker Visa Program The Worker Visa Program would establish a new H-2C visa for future immigrant workers and their families. The temporary visa would be valid for three years and renewable one-time for an additional three years. Employers may hire these new immigrant workers only if they are unable to find a qualified American worker and only if they are located in an area with an unemployment rate lower than 10 percent for workers whose education level is at or below a high school diploma. The visa program has an initial cap of 400,000, which adjusts up or down yearly based on market fluctuations. Applicants for a H-2C visa must meet the following requirements: * demonstrate job qualifications * provide evidence of a job offer from U.S. employer * complete criminal- and terrorism- related background checks * pay a $500 application fee * undergo a medical exam * show admissibility to the U.S. It includes labor rights and protections for new workers including: * competitive wages * the same conditions and benefits as received by U.S. workers * the ability to travel outside the United States * whistleblower protections * right to change employers (portability) so long as the new employer has complied with the applicable H-2C recruiting requirements * an opportunity to apply for permanent resident status through the Earned Citizenship Program (see below) The H-2C visa would take effect one year after the enactment of the Strive Act. Congress would be required to enact implementation regulations within six months. Earned Citizenship The Earned Citizenship Program provides new immigrant workers (and their spouses and children) with an opportunity to apply for conditional permanent residence and eventual citizenship. Requirements for Earned Citizenship * work in United States for five years * show physical presence in the U.S. and evidence of employment * complete criminal and security background checks * pay $500 application fee * meet English and civic requirements * show admissibility =Title V ‚Äì Visa Reforms= Title V of the STRIVE Act makes certain reforms to the US visa system in order to increase the rate of immigration and reduce inefficiency. These reforms include adjustments to annual numerical visa limits such as: * exempting immediate relatives from the 480,000 annual family-sponsored visa limit * increasing the limit of annual employer sponsored visas from 140,000 to 290,000 * slightly increasing the per-country cap on family and employer sponsored visas * exempting certain highly skilled workers from caps on H-1B visas and employer- sponsored visas * exempting sons and daughters of Filipino World War II veterans from annual visa limitations Title V also provides for special immigration benefits for victims of a major disaster or emergency. It also provides a special immigration status for women and children deemed to have a credible fear of harm in their home country. =Title VI ‚Äì Legalization of Illegal Aliens= Title VI of the STRIVE Act provides two new programs for certain qualified illegal aliens to acquire citizenship. These programs mirror the ones in Title IV of the STRIVE Act, but are for illegal aliens rather than new or prospective immigrant workers. Conditional Nonimmigrant Program The Conditional Nonimmigrant Program creates a new six-year visa for illegal aliens and their families. Requirements for Conditional Nonimmigrant Status: * Establish continuous presence in the U.S. on or before June 1, 2006 * Verify employment in the U.S. before June 1, 2006 and employment since that date * Complete criminal and security background checks * Pay a $500 fine plus necessary application fees * Must not be ineligible to receive a visa pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act * Has not been convicted of a felony or three or more misdemeanors * Has not participated in the persecution of another person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion * Has not been convicted by final judgment of a particularly serious crime and there are no reasonable grounds for believing that the alien has committed a particularly serious crime abroad before arriving in the U.S. There is a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment for anyone who willfully falsifies information in an application for conditional nonimmigrant status. Earned Citizenship The Earned Citizenship Program for Undocumented Individuals provides qualified conditional nonimmigrants and their families with an opportunity to apply for lawful permanent resident status (green card) and eventual citizenship. Applicants must: * meet employment requirements during the six-year period immediately preceding the application for adjustment * Pay a $1,500 fine plus application fees * Complete criminal and security background checks * Establish registration under the selective service (if applicable) * Meet English and civic requirements * Undergo a medical examination * Pay all taxes * Show admissibility to the U.S. * Meet a Legal Reentry requirement during the six-year period in conditional nonimmigrant status, no later than 90 days before filing an application for adjustment to lawful permanent resident status. Some additional features of the Earned Citizenship Program for Undocumented Individuals are: * applicants go to the back of the line for permanent visas * current immigrant backlogs must be cleared before qualified conditional nonimmigrant visa applicants (and their families) can adjust to permanent resident status * new penalties for making false statements in an application for earned citizenship are created * immigrants who adjust from a conditional nonimmigrant visa (including dependents) to lawful permanent resident status shall not be counted against the numerical visa caps * those appealing decisions associated with the application for adjustment to permanent status have access to a defined administrative and judicial process Other provisions Title VI includes the following acts: * DREAM Act of 2007 * AgJOBS Act of 2007 * Strengthening American Citizenship Act of 2007 Title VI also creates grant programs to assist new workers and to address poverty in Mexico. =Title VII ‚Äì Miscellaneous= The bill also would increase resources for the immigration court system, provide relief for immigrant victims of the 9-11 attacks and their families, and facilitate naturalization for members of the armed forces.

Before a change of ownership, the company was known as Telecom Services Kiribati Limited or short TSKL. In addition to traditional telecommunication, ATHKL offers such services as telegram and facsimile services. Until 2007 the company maintained the country's ccTLD, .ki, which is now under the control of a separate agency, Telecommunications Authority of Kiribati. Although originally a venture between the Kiribati government and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission International of Australia, it was quickly privatised. In 2001 the government of Kiribati signed a Joint venture agreement with TSKL, once again giving the government full ownership.  Telephonics  Currently ATHKL operates a mobile telephone network as well as traditional services. ATHKL has installed 28 pay phones not only on Tarawa but also on some outer islands. Phone cards are the only payment option for such calls. The company has started a yellow pages directory to list the ever growing citizens with telephone numbers. International Direct Dial is a service which allows the caller to have a direct call to international telephone users. A High Frequency Radio Telephone makes communication between islands possible. In 2005 the radio telephone was replaced with a more modern traditional telephone connection on five outer islands. The user is charged per-minute and IDD is only available for some three hours per day. In the event that the police department, fire department or an ambulance are needed, 992, 993 and 994, respectively, are to be telephoned. The mobile telephone system originally used analog technology but in 2005 this was switched to a GSM variant. Also as part of this upgrade GSM phone service is now available on Kiritimati, Abaiang, Marakei, Maiana, Tab. North, Onotoa. UMTS(3G)/LTE(4G) services is available in Tarawa (launched 29/10/2013) and is also available in Kiritimati. The GSM network is currently being decommissioned in favor of the UMTS service which offers data and voice services. International SMS is also available on the UMTS network (Note: International SMS is NOT available with the GSM service).  Coconut Wireless  ATHKL's ISP, Coconut Wireless, utilizes a satellite uplink and wireless modem system in unison with equipment from NextNet Wireless, which is now owned by AT&T.; Billing and integration is handled by SSI Micro. Service is available in South Tarawa and five other islands, as TSKL mandates that service be available to all of the outer islands. A second satellite has since been installed to handle more users and speed. Because of its location, Internet in Kiribati is much more expensive than in other regions. 500MB can be downloaded for A$30 a month at a burst speed of 128kbit/s. Once the 500 MB is exceeded, speed will be reduced to that of dial up. Three additional tiers exist each with more speed, included usage, and of course cost. A modem needs to be purchased or rented. TSKL sells modems for $399 for an indoor modem, and $759 for an out of doors version. A modem may also be rented for $25 a month.

Fossils of Slimonia have been discovered in deposits of Silurian age in South America and Europe. Classified as part of the family Slimonidae alongside the related Salteropterus, the genus contains three valid species, S. acuminata from Lesmahagow, Scotland, S. boliviana from Cochabamba, Bolivia and S. dubia from the Pentland Hills of Scotland and one dubious species, S. stylops, from Herefordshire, England. The generic name is derived from and honors Robert Slimon, a fossil collector and surgeon from Lesmahagow. Out of the four described species of Slimonia, three measured below or up to in length. Only S. acuminata was larger, with the largest specimens measuring in length. Though this is large for a predatory arthropod, Slimonia would be exceeded in length by later and more derived (more \\"advanced\\") members of the closely related pterygotid family of eurypterids, which would become the largest known arthropods to ever live.  Description  Life restoration of S. acuminata Slimonia is in many ways similar to the more derived (more \\"advanced\\") eurypterids of its superfamily, the Pterygotioidea. In particular, the expanded and flattened telson (the most posterior segment of the body) of Slimonia is similar to that of the pterygotid eurypterids and is a feature that Slimonia and the pterygotids only share with some derived hibbertopterid eurypterids (where the feature convergently evolved). The pterygotid telson was in general slightly larger than that of Slimonia and was more slender. The telson spike of Slimonia was much longer than any seen in the Pterygotidae (constituting just over half of the total telson length) however, serrated and ending in a fine point. The largest species of Slimonia, S. acuminata, reached a maximum length of 100 cm (39 in) whilst the smallest, S. dubia, grew to 12 cm (5 in) in length.Lamsdell, James C.; Braddy, Simon J.

Supplementary information Though 100 cm is large for a predatory arthropod, Slimonia would be exceeded in length by later and more derived (more \\"advanced\\") members of the closely related pterygotid family of eurypterids, which would become the largest known arthropods to ever live. Slimonia can be distinguished from other members of its family, the Slimonidae, by a variety of characteristics. The prosoma (head) is quadrate (square-shaped) in shape and had small compound eyes on the frontal corners. The bodies were large and cordate (heart-shaped), with a narrow postabdomen and a telson with a strongly expanded anterior half. The chelicerae (frontal appendages) were small in comparison to those of the pterygotids and the walking legs had denticles, but no spines. Genital appendages were long and narrow in both males and females. 1955\\\\. Merostomata. Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part P Arthropoda 2, Chelicerata, P: 30.  History of research  Fossil of S. acuminata The type species of Slimonia, S. acuminata, was first described as a species of Pterygotus, \\"Pterygotus acuminata\\" (acuminata being Latin for \\"sharp\\" or \\"tapering\\"), by John William Salter in 1856, based on fossils recovered from deposits of Llandovery-Wenlock (Early to Middle Silurian) age in Lesmahagow, Scotland. That same year David Page erected a new genus to contain the species, as several distinctive characteristics made the species considerably different from other known species of Pterygotus, among them the shape of the carapace and S. acuminata lacking the large cheliceral claws known from Pterygotus. The generic name is derived from and honors Robert Slimon, a fossil collector and surgeon from Lesmahagow. Slimon was the first to discover eurypterid fossils in Lesmahagow, bringing them to the attention of Roderick Murchison in 1851. S. acuminata remains the largest known species, with the largest specimens measuring up to 100 cm (39 in) in length. In 1899, an additional species, S. dubia, would be referred to the genus. This species was recovered from slightly earlier deposits (Llandovery age) in the Pentland Hills of Scotland and could be distinguished from S. acuminata by the more elongated telson (also not as broad in the parts furthest back), thinner telson spike and a slightly different, tapering, body shape that tapers evenly the whole way instead of suddenly narrowing near the seventh segment as in S. acuminata.Laurie, Malcolm (1900). \\"XIX.‚ÄîOn a Silurian Scorpion and some additional Eurypterid Remains from the Pentland Hills\\". Earth and Environmental Science Transactions of The Royal Society of Edinburgh. 39 (3): 575‚Äì590. doi:10.1017/S0080456800035109. ISSN 2053-5945 The type specimen of S. dubia is a badly preserved carapace, with fragments of various degrees of completion of the first eleven segments found associated. Despite its fragmentary nature, the quadrangular (square) shape of the carapace and the eyes placed at its corners allowed zoologist and paleontologist Malcolm Laurie to place it within Slimonia when describing it in 1899. The size of the carapace suggests that the species would have grown to 12 cm (5 in) in length. Another species, S. stylops, was first considered a species of Pterygotus when described by John William Salter in 1859, and the highly fragmentary nature of the known fossils make a precise identification difficult and problematic. Only one specimen, the anterior part of a carapace with the compound eyes placed on the margin, is known and though it does resemble Slimonia, it could also potentially be referred to Hughmilleria or even represent the carapace of Salteropterus abbreviatus (a closely related slimonid eurypterid known only from the telson and metastoma, a large plate part of the abdomen). The fossils were recovered from deposits of Pridoli (Late Silurian) age in Herefordshire, England and suggest that the species grew to 12 cm (5 in) in length. Due to its problematic nature, S. stylops is seen as a nomen dubium by modern researchers. In 1973, another species of Slimonia was named by Kjellesvig- Waering based on one single fossil recovered by Eduardo Rodriguez from the Kirusillas Formation, of Ludlow-Pridoli (Late Silurian) age, in Cochabamba, Bolivia. Named S. boliviana, the holotype (BLV15, deposited at the National Museum of Natural History of France) comprises a well-preserved telson typical of the genus, being laterally inflated and with a dagger-like terminal point. It was anteriorly covered with small scales semilunar to mucronitic (\\"spined\\") grouped into a single row of large marginal scales that form a linear serrated edge. A slight dorsal keel is present along the telson. There was a triangular area at the base of the telson which could have been a point of union with the muscles. S. boliviana differed from S. acuminata in having the keel much less developed, narrower and not reaching the terminal spike. The latter was wider, not as pointed and with less developed serrations. The telson itself was wider and shorter than in the type species. This species was the third Silurian eurypterid in the Southern Hemisphere to be described, the other two coming from Australia. The fossil suggest a total body length of .  Classification  Dorsal and ventral views of S. acuminata Life restoration of S. acuminata'Slimonia is classified as part of the eurypterid family Slimonidae, within the superfamily Pterygotioidea.Dunlop, J. A., Penney, D. & Jekel, D. 2015. A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives. In World Spider Catalog. Natural History Museum Bern, online at http://wsc.nmbe.ch, version 16.0 http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/resources/fossils/Fossils16.0.pdf (PDF). Historically Slimonia was first considered a member of the Pterygotidae, until it was reclassified alongside Hughmilleria and other genera to the family Hughmilleriidae in 1951 by Erik N. Kjellesvig-Waering. Nestor Ivanovich Novojilov classified Slimonia as part of a family of its own in 1968. Slimonia is one of the most closely related genera to the pterygotid family and the Slimonidae is often interpreted as a sister-taxon to the Pterygotidae. The other Pterygotioid family, the Hughmilleriidae, has also been interpreted as the most closely related sister-taxon to the pterygotids. The discovery of Ciurcopterus, the most primitive known pterygotid, and studies revealing that Ciurcopterus combines features of Slimonia (the appendages are particularly similar) and of more derived pterygotids, revealed that the Slimonidae is more closely related to the Pterygotidae than the Hughmilleriidae is. The cladogram below is simplified from a study by O. Erik Tetlie (2007), and showcases the position of Slimonia relative to the rest of the Eurypterina suborder of eurypterids, with the Stylonurina suborder as an outgroup.  Paleobiology  Drawing of the holotype of S. boliviana, a telson.The specimen MB.A 863, a S. acuminata discovered in the Patrick Burn Formation (dated to the Telychian, around 430 million years ago) of Scotland, preserves a complete and atriculated series of telsonal, postabdominal and preabdominal segments. The specimen might have experienced some disarticulation postmortem (or could represent a partial exuviae), but as there is no apparent disarticulation in the metasoma, it is likely that the articulation seen in the postabdominal segments would have been possible in life (which is also seen in some other eurypterid fossils, such as of Eurypterus and Alkenopterus). Biomechanical studies on the telsons and postabdominal segments of closely related eurypterids, particularly those of the family Pterygotidae, has revealed that the body was very stiff, and that the flattened telson would likely have served a function as a rudder that would have allowed the animals to be agile and capable of quick turns when chasing after prey, contradicting previous hypotheses that they would have served a propulsive function. Whilst the postabdomen of Slimonia was likely similarly stiff and inflexible dorsally (up and down), the study of the specimen suggests that it was highly flexible laterally (side to side). As such, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sides and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and it was proposed that it could have been capable of piercing prey. However, this particularly theory was later criticized and disproved. Even though the original study claimed that the fossil didn't show any signs of disarticulation, this is likely not true. It can be clearly seen that both tergite 8 and 10 overlap the other tergites in an unnatural way. Furthermore, it was noted that the specimen was not a carcass, rather a molt. This would mean that the pose the fossil was in does not represent a possible life position. The telson of Slimonia also possesses a keel, which would have created significant drag while trying to stab its prey. Lastly, the serrations on the telson would most likely be attachment points for setae and would have aided the animal in sensing the water flow. This made steering much more easier. Visual acuity, the clarity of vision, can be determined in arthropods by determining number of lenses in their compound eyes and the interommatidial angle (shortened as IOA and referring to the angle between the optical axes of the adjacent lenses). The IOA is especially important as it can be used to distinguish different ecological roles in arthropods, being low in modern active arthropod predators. Slimonia was very similar to the basal pterygotid Erettopterus in terms of visual acuity, with the number of lenses being comparable to those of Pterygotus and Jaekelopterus and possessing an IOA between 2 and 3 (which is higher than the IOA of Pterygotus and Jaekelopterus, suggesting that the visual acuity of Slimonia was good, but not as good as in the derived pterygotids).  Paleoecology  The size of the largest (S. acuminata) and smallest (S. dubia) species of Slimonia compared to a human. Fossils of Slimonia have been recovered in deposits home to diverse eurypterid faunas. Telychian deposits in the Pentland Hills, where remains of S. dubia have been found, preserve fossils of a large amount of other eurypterids, including Drepanopterus pentlandicus, Laurieipterus elegans, Parastylonurus ornatus, Hardieopterus macrophthalmus, Carcinosoma scoticus, Stoermeropterus conicus and Pentlandopterus minor. Also preserved are fossils of orthocerids, such as Geisonoceras maclareni. Similar levels of eurypterid diversity are also observed in fossil deposits where other species of Slimonia have been found. S. acuminata has been found associated with Nanahughmilleria lanceolata, Hardieopterus lanarkensis, Eusarcana obesus, Parastylonurus sigmoidalis, Carcinosoma scorpionis and Erettopterus bilobus and S. stylops have been found associated with Nanahughmilleria pygmaea, Eusarcana salteri, Hardieopterus megalops, Erettopterus brodiei, Erettopterus gigas, Hughmilleria banksi, Eurypterus cephalaspis and Pterygotus ludensis. The living environment of the pterygotids differed from genus to genus, with some (such as Pterygotus) being found in estuaries, while other (such as Jaekelopterus) were found in freshwater environments. Slimonia lived exclusively in freshwater environments and likely preyed on smaller fish, as it lacked the enlarged cheliceral claws of the pterygotids and was smaller in size than the largest members of that group. Prey likely included jawless fish such as heterostracans and early osteostracans, which Slimonia would have seized with its frontal appendages. Slimonia traversed its living environment on spindly legs or through using its swimming appendages. The lungs of the genus were located on the underside of the body in a series of folds. Like many eurypterid species, Slimonia acuminata requires a modern re-description to properly establish defining traits and characteristics. Some traits that appear to be unique to S. acuminata have been described based on specimens housed at the Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery, including rows of pustulues (bulges) along the marginal rim of the body and appendages. In some arthropods, pustules serve as attachment points of setae (bristle- or hair- like structures with sensory functions). Similar pustule rows have been discovered in the other eurypterid Drepanopterus abonensis, a sweep-feeder that used the marginal rim to search the substrate of its living environment for prey. If the pustules had setae, the gracile second pair of appendages of S. acuminata may have functioned as tactile and sensory organs used for locating and identifying prey, together with the pedipalps (the second pair of appendages).

History  Hornsby tractor, 1909 A British agricultural company, Hornsby in Grantham, developed a continuous track, which was patented in 1905.British Patent No. 16,345 (1904) The Hornsby tractors featured a track-steer clutch arrangement.  Mechanisms  There are several mechanisms that have been developed to vary the torque applied to different sides of a vehicle. These include clutch-brake steering, braked-differential steering, controlled-differential steering, geared steering, Maybach double-differential steering, double-differential steering, triple-differential steering, hydraulic, and electric. =Clutch- brake= In clutch-brake differential steering, power is disconnected to one side or the other with a clutch, and the unpowered side may also have a brake applied to tighten the turn. Note that there is no differential gearset in this design. The tracks on either side of the vehicle will always turn at the same speed unless one is declutched for steering. This method is simple to implement but inefficient and only suitable for light vehicles. Also, when traveling downslope under engine braking, declutching one side to turn can result in a turn in the other direction. Gehl skid-steer loader =Braked- differential= In brake-differential steering, power is applied to both sides through a differential and a brake is applied to one side or the other. The slowing of one side causes the other side to speed up, because of the differential, and so the vehicle maintains a constant speed. A subsequent disadvantage is that changes in rolling resistance or traction from one side to the other automatically causes the vehicle to steer unless counteracted by the driver. Differential steering of this type was used in many half-track designs to assist with making tight turns. =Controlled-differential= In controlled-differential steering, pinions within the differential are locked causing one side to rotate faster than the other. An advantage is that no power is lost to braking. A disadvantage is that only one turning radius can be performed efficiently. This method was developed by the Cleveland Tractor Company in 1921 and called the Cletrac Regenerative Steering System. =Geared= In geared differential steering, two complete gearboxes are used to provide power to either side, and one distinct turning radius can be derived from each gear ratio combination. The main disadvantage to this system is that it doubles the size and weight of the total transmission and therefore it has only been implemented experimentally. =Maybach double-differential= In the Maybach double-differential, power is transmitted through a single main transmission and then through an epicycle gear final drive on each side. A different drive speed is caused by feeding torque, from a separate \\"steering\\" transmission, into one final drive or the other using a pair of clutches. Usually the steering input turns at a fixed ratio relative to the engine, which results in a different turn radius for each main transmission ratio. This system was implemented on German Panther tanks during World War II. The drawback of this design compared to other multiple-differential designs is that applying the steering input to one track also increases the average speed of the two tracks, so the vehicle's speed is not constant. =Double- differential= Differential steering mechanism, either double-differential minus the clutches, or triple-differential minus the brakes In double- differential steering, as in the Maybach double-differential system, power from a second transmission is fed an epicycle gear in the final drive of one side or the other. In this design, however, the average drive speed of the tracks is maintained by adding an idler to apply the opposite torque to the epicycle gear on other side of the turn. A pair of clutches is used to apply the steering transmission output, which only turns one direction, to the steering cross-shaft in either direction. This system was developed in 1928 by Major Wilson. Here, the steering input is used not so much to apply torque to either side but rather to control the difference in torque and speed between the two sides. Also note that, in any of the double- or triple-differential steering methods, the efficient turn radii (e.g., with no steering clutch or brake slipping) are determined by the ratio between the steering input speed and the main drive input speed into each epicyclic final drive. This means that having multiple ratios in the steering transmission results in multiple turn radii for each main drive transmission ratio. The additional complexity in the mechanical systems and driving controls means that this capability is rarely implemented. =Triple-differential= Triple-differential steering is similar to double-differential steering except that, rather than using a steering cross-shaft and an idler gear, it uses two steering cross-shafts connected to a steering differential. Part of the drive torque is always applied through the steering differential and the two epicyclic differentials. Brakes are used, instead of clutches, to slow down one or the other steering cross-shaft. The steering works much like braked differential steering mentioned above except that the resulting inefficiency from applying the steering brakes only affects the torque being transmitted via the steering input. =Hydraulic= Hydraulic differential steering consists of a hydraulic drive system with one hydraulic pump and two hydraulic motors, one for each side. This system is often employed on skid-steer loaders and zero-turn mowers. =Electric= A three-wheeled differentially steered robot Electric differential steering consists of two electric motors, one for each side, that are driven at different speeds, depending on steering needs. It is often implemented in wheeled robots. = Hand = Most traditional wheelchairs are maneuvered by differential steering when propelled by the occupant.  Turning radius  Depending on implementation, friction between drive mechanism and ground, and available power, a vehicle with differential steering may have a zero turning radius or a curb-to-curb turning circle equal to the length of the vehicle by driving each side at the same speed but in opposite directions. This is also called a neutral turn. Vehicles on which only one drive wheel on each side is rigidly aligned and all others are free to caster, such as wheelchairs and wheeled robots, require the least power to turn. Vehicles with long continuous tracks on each side which must slide on the ground in order to turn at all require more power.

WIBL, licensed to Fairbury, Illinois, in the Bloomington-Normal market, broadcasts at 107.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 22,000 Watts and is owned by Pilot Media, which is a subsidiary of Great Plains Media. Great Plains' CEO is Jerry Zimmer, a longtime partner in the Zimmer Radio Group based in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. Frequency history The station signed on in August 2000 as WBZM, 107.7 The Buzz. It was owned by Crowmwell Broadcasting, and was operated out of their Peoria cluster. It had an Alternative Rock format, with Bob and Tom in the morning. The jocks were all the same as on 99X, which was, at the time, WIXO on its original Bartonville frequency of 99.9. When Cromwell sold their Peoria cluster in 2001, WBZM was not included in the sale. Operations were moved to Cromwell's Decatur cluster and WBZM quickly went on the sale block. At the end of 2001, AAA Entertainment purchased the signal and began simulcasting 96.7 WIHN Normal, then later 99.5 WDQZ Lexington. On March 28, 2003, AAA debuted WYST, an AC station branded as \\"Star 107.7\\". In June 2003 the station's signal was upgraded and moved from Fairbury to Lexington, Illinois. In February 2007, the format was modified to R&B;/Soul with the slogan \\"The Heart and Soul of the Twin Cities\\", which had more of a rhythmic lean than competitor 100.7 WVMG. In April 2007 the station began an LMA with Great Plains Media. No immediate format change was made. On June 29, 2007, at Noon, just several days after the closing the sale on WYST, Great Plains Media flipped the format to Country as \\"107.7 The Bull.\\" The station is the first to take on heritage WBWN in the Bloomington market.

These two campuses were then consolidated and renamed Olive‚ÄìHarvey College in 1970. Sitting on 67 acres, the College is the largest campus of any of the City Colleges. The school's name is derived from two Chicagoan Medal of Honor recipients who lost their lives in the Vietnam War: Milton Olive, III, paratrooper, and Carmel B. Harvey, infantryman. Both were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Besides its main building in the Pullman Community Area, Olive-Harvey also includes the South Chicago Learning Center located at 3055 E. 92nd Street, a facility that provides vocational training, technical training and adult education courses to adults in the Chicago region. Programs Accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Olive-Harvey offers many Associate's degree, certificate and short-term training programs to prepare students to transfer to bachelor's degree programs or to move directly into the workforce. In 2012, it was announced that Olive-Harvey will focus on transportation, distribution, and logistics (TDL) as part of City Colleges of Chicago's College to Careers program. Part of this refocus includes the building of a new, $42.2 million TDL building. The new facility will train students for what is projected to be more than 100,000 job openings over the next 10 years. The new facility will train students for what is projected to be more than 100,000 job openings over the next 10 years.

The story revolves around Nicholas Holford, the main character and minor relations can be made to Martin Booth's life during the Second World War.  Plot summary The story begins with the Japanese army‚Äôs defeat of the China forces occupying Hong Kong on 25 December 1941. Nicholas is an eleven-year-old boy whose parents have both suddenly disappeared in the chaos of war breaking out. As the Japanese come to do a home to home search, three loyal family servants, Tang, his wife Ah Mee, and the gardener Ah Kwan take Nicholas and they escape to Kowloon as Hong Kong Island is no longer safe. Upon reaching the shore of Kowloon, Tang and Ah Mee disguise Nicholas as a Chinese boy and the trip continues to Tang's home village, the village of Sek Wan. Nicholas passes the years of the war here with Tang and his family. He is given the Chinese name Wing Ming. During this time, many events happen. Nicholas makes a dangerous journey back to Kowloon to get quinine cure to the malaria Tang has contracted. He also helps the Communist partisan army ‚Äì The East River Column Fighters- to translate instructions for using heavy explosives. Nicholas joins the partisan army on a mission to Kowloon where they blow up a railway bridge and weaken the position of the Japanese army. Yet his most dangerous job would have been to deliver a medicine into the prison of war camps (POW camps). Taking news or items to prison camps is nicknamed \\"playing music on the bamboo radio\\". Nicholas does more than expected by entering the camp itself because the person who he was supposed to pass the medicine to had the fever. Exhausted and worried, Nicholas narrowly escapes the clutches of the Japanese with the help of the prisoners and finally reaches the safety of Sek Wan village. As the war comes to an end, Nicholas returns to his home on Hong Kong Island, and when he returned, everything is ruined, his home is badly damaged. As he walks through the house he finds his mother. Nicholas does not recognise her, she seems much older and exhausted, but he knows it is his mother. It is nearly four years since he was last at home. At first he introduces himself as Wing Ming, then he remembers that he is Nicholas Holford.

Gen. Michael Collins, USAF Reserve (ret.), and Brigadier General James Lawton Collins Jr. His brother, General J. Lawton Collins, served as Army Chief of Staff during the Korean War. Biography =Family and early life= Collins was born into a large Irish Catholic family in Algiers, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from New Orleans. His father, Jeremiah Bernard Collins, had left Ireland as a young boy to join the rest of the family in Cincinnati, Ohio. Family legend has it that he served as a drummer boy in the Civil War, and at age 16, helped to drive a herd of horses into Texas to replace the cavalry mounts that had been lost to the war. He made his way to New Orleans, where he worked for James Lawton, a grocer. Jeremiah worked his way up to running the stables for the delivery wagons, and eventually married Kate Lawton, his employer's daughter. They moved across the river to Algiers, near the terminus and rail repair shops of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which employed many workers of Irish descent. There, they established a dry goods store, with a pub in the back. Jeremiah and Kate's eleven children would work there, serving beer and food to railroad men. The first-born son was named for Kate's father: James Lawton Collins. James was not tall, about 5 ft 6 in (168 cm), but he was agile, athletic, and good with horses. Later in life, he would come to the attention of Gen. John J. Pershing for his aggressive and successful polo playing, and as an excellent judge of horses. A letter in the Library of Congress in the Pershing correspondence asks James to go to the remount station in the Shenandoah Valley to pick a new horse for the general to ride. He had told his son that his first flight occurred in 1911 in the Philippines, perched on the wing of a Wright plane, with Frank Lahm flying the machine. He said they flew over a forest fire and the updraft nearly knocked him off the plane. =Military career= Lt. Collins (right) with Major General Pershing in Mexico, 1916 Collins enrolled in Tulane University, but his mother's uncle, the mayor of New Orleans, was asked by a local member of Congress if there was a bright young man who could \\"stay the course\\" at West Point. Collins, reached at Tulane, accepted the appointment. During the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Collins served in the 8th Cavalry and as an aide-de-camp to Pershing in the Philippines. He also served during the Mexican Punitive Expedition and in France during World War I. In World War I, Collins commanded a battalion of the 1st Infantry Division's 7th Field Artillery. During World War II he commanded the Puerto Rico Department and the 5th Service Command at Columbus, Ohio. Collins retired as a major general in 1946.

Life and career Jeff Kashiwa born in 1963 in Louisville, Kentucky but moved to Seattle, Washington as a young child. He credited the public school's music program for his starting his interest in music. He has also credited his father, who died in 1992, for his love of music because he was a fan of jazz music including Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller. While attending school, his father gave him an old silver clarinet. When he later saw a row of saxophones at school, Kashiwa knew he had found his new instrument. As a local gig musician and working small jobs, Kashiwa searched for an audition in a more permanent position in a band. After searching and being denied, he approached Steve Bailey from The Rippingtons. Kashiwa was a fan of the Rippingtons and hired Bailey to play along with him and eventually asked about The Rippingtons audition. Kashiwa joined The Rippingtons following a festival concert and Brandon Fields' exit from the group. Kashiwa prepared himself for the role by learning every song in the group's library prior to being hired, making his eventual step into Field's large shoes seemingly effortless. Kashiwa recorded his first two solo albums, (\\"Remember Catalina\\" and \\"Walk A Mile\\"), during his tenure with The Rippingtons. In 1999 Kashiwa left the group to concentrate on a solo career with his own band, Coastal Access, which included Melvin Davis (Bass), Allen Hinds (Guitar), Dave Hooper (drums) and Dave Kochanski (Keyboards/Synths). Eric Marienthal and Paul Taylor both covered the sax player spot in The Rippingtons for a few years, but Kashiwa rejoined the group in 2007 for their 20th Anniversary Tour, and continues to appear with the group on occasion. In 2004, Kashiwa called on some of his saxophone peers and started a new group that would feature the instrument, as well as their collective musical passion for jazz, funk and R&B.; \\"The Sax Pack\\" features Jeff Kashiwa, Steve Cole & Kim Waters. Along with being cohesive musically, the trio share a unique and comical camaraderie on stage. The Sax Pack released two CDs, \\"The Sax Pack\\" (2008) and \\"The Pack is Back\\" (2009) on Shanachie Records. Kashiwa plays soprano saxophone, alto saxophone, tenor saxophone, flute and the EWI (Electronic Wind Instrument). His involvement in music encompasses composing, producing, performing and teaching. Kashiwa attended Berklee College of Music in 1981-83, where he developed an interest in straight-ahead jazz. As a student, he was picked as second alto chair by Disney's All American College Band and eventually became an instructor. Kashiwa later transferred to Cal State Long Beach and received his bachelor's degree in Music in 1985. Kashiwa currently teaches Music Technology courses at Shoreline College, as well as private music lessons for students of all ages. Kashiwa has a wife, Chaunte, and a daughter, Catalina.

Politics At the time of the February 24, 1966 coup d'√©tat that removed the Convention People's Party government of Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, Mr. Harlley was the Inspector General of Police, making him the most senior police officer in the country. He was one of the eight members of the National Liberation Council government formed afterwards. He remained in his office as the head of the police force and in addition was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs between 1967 and 1968. On September 3, 1969, a Presidential Commission was formed. Mr. Harlley was one of the three members of the commission. This commission remained in place even after the handover to the democratically elected Progress Party government of Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia. On August 7, 1970, the commission was replaced by an interim President, Nii Amaa Ollennu. Honours * In 1970, he received an LL.D from the University of Ghana.

His economic policies were used by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.Dornbusch, Edwards, 1989 Life Chile real wages between 1967 and 1977. Orange lines mark the beginning and end of Allende's presidency. Pedro Vuskovic was born in Antofagasta, and obtained a degree in business administration from the Universidad de Chile. He became a professor of Statistics at the same university, while at the same time working for the CEPAL (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean). Vuskovic joined the ECLAC/FAO in 1950, shortly after its birth as an institution. For nearly 20 years he worked there, with his career in ECLAC culminating in the position of Director of the Development Division, where he played a role in structuring and disseminating the thinking of ECLAC. Concurrently, he served as a professor in ECLAC and ILPES training programmes while at the same time teaching classes at the schools of economics and sociology at the University of Chile and the School of Economics at the University of Concepci√≥n, finally becoming the Director of the Institute of Economics of the University of Chile. He was the author of the economic platform of the Popular Unity (UP) campaign, and on November 3, 1970, he was named Minister of Economic Affairs by President Salvador Allende. He became the key figure in the economic policy of the UP government, and tried to implement a massive redistribution of revenue (see Vuskovic plan) by raising salaries and increasing public expenditure, through which he believed that the buying power of the population would increase and accordingly consumption in general. He remained as a minister until June 17, 1972, when political pressure forced President Allende to halt his economic plans and replace him in the cabinet. Vuskovic then took over the cabinet-level position of Executive Vice President of the Production Development Corporation (CORFO), where he served until September 1973. After the Chilean Coup of 1973, he was exiled to Mexico. There he became a professor, first at the Economic Research and Teaching Centre (CIDE), where he directed the Institute of Economic Studies of Latin America, and later at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in the Humanities at the National University of Mexico (UNAM), where he was named to the position of Coordinator for a programme on poverty and development options in various countries of Latin America. After the return to democracy in 1990, he returned to Chile for a short while but moved back to Mexico where he lived his last years and died in 1993.

It was known for its telegraph station, the Charlotte Waters Telegraph Station, which became a hub for scientists travelling in central Australia in the late 19th and early 20th century. Aboriginal artist Erlikilyika, known to Europeans as Jim Kite, lived there. Only a ruin remains today. History =Traditional names= Norman Tindale, in his Cockatoo Creek expedition (1931) journal, recorded Alkngulura as the name of Charlotte Waters, and translated this as \\"Alknga ‚Äì eye ‚Äì ulura - ?hill\\", and Strehlow was told by Tom Bagot Injola in 1968 that the waterholes close to the telegraph station were known as Alkiljauwurera, Alkngolulura and Untupera. Jason Gibson, of Museum Victoria, noted that two other Lower Arrernte place names have been recorded for the area: Adnyultultera and Arleywernpe. =Settlement= Paddy Byrne on right (photograph by Henry Yorke Lyell Brown, government geologist). Charlotte Waters was located in 1871 by surveyors Gilbert McMinn and Richard Knuckey during construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line between Adelaide and Darwin. According to explorer Ernest Giles, it was named after Lady Charlotte BaconGiles, Ernest (1889). Australia twice traversed: the romance of exploration, being a narrative compiled from the journals of five exploring expeditions into and through Central South Australia, and Western Australia, from 1872 to 1876, Volume 1. S. Low, Marston, Searle & Rivington, Limited by Knuckey, after the surveyors had read Byron's long narrative poem Child Harold's Pilgrimage (1812-1818), which had been dedicated to the young woman (then Lady Harley, aged 11) as Ianthe.Note: Lady Charlotte Harley (as she was then) was sexually molested by Byron when she was 11 years old. Lady Bacon had stayed with relatives in South Australia between 1869 and 1874. Christopher Giles (no relation of Ernest), a surveyor in Goyder's 1868 expedition and with Charles Todd in 1870, was involved with the surveying of the telegraph line with younger brother Alfred. In 1872, a telegraph repeater, post office and general store were built at Charlotte Waters, and Christopher Giles served at the repeater station until 1876. The station was nicknamed Bleak House by the telegraph operators, as the area was a desolate gibber plain, with no bushes or trees. Charlotte Waters became an important stopover for those travelling into the interior, and also an important hub for a number of collectors, scientists and anthropologists, including Baldwin Spencer and Francis (Frank) Gillen. Gillen was stationed there from 1875-1892. Camel trains driven by \\"Afghan\\" cameleers often accompanied the expeditions or passed through Charlotte Waters. Patrick Byrne worked at the telegraph station for 50 years, after commencing as a teenager (c.1873). Also known as Paddy or Pado, Byrne corresponded with Spencer and collected specimens for biological analysis for many years. Spencer named a small marsupial known locally as the kowari in recognition of Byrne's contribution as Dasyuroides byrnei, and Byrne's work continues to contribute to scientists' understanding of central Australian mammals. He was also reportedly a blacksmith, and buried his dog at the back of the building in a small grave surrounded by ironwork railings, which still exists. Byrne is mentioned in Erlikilyika's biographical entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography as appreciating his skills and talent. He was step-brother to Amelia Gillen, wife of Frank. Byrne has been identified as the man on the right in the photograph above. After Byrne's departure in 1909, telegraphist Harry O. Kearnan became the telegraph stationmaster. Erlikilyika (c.1865‚Äìc.1930), Arrernte sculptor, artist and anthropological interpreter, known to Europeans as Jim Kite and probably the first Aboriginal Australian artist to become known nationally, was born nearby and lived at Charlotte Waters for most of his life. Kearnan accompanied Erlikilyika to Adelaide in 1913, where some of his artistic works were exhibited at the Selborne Hotel in Pirie Street. =End of the telegraph era= 1982 photograph of ruins As technology improved, the telegraph station at Charlotte Waters was by-passed. The building was then used as a police station, and vital equipment and postal services were maintained by the policeman and his wife. In February 1936, Constable Jack Kennett and his wife Isabel and their five children were living at the lonely Charlotte Waters Police Station when several of the children contracted diphteria. After a series of misfortunes befell them and those trying to assist, two children died. A year later, Kennett was transferred to Alice Springs, where the memory of the family was honoured by the naming of a street called Kennett Court. In July 1938, T.G.H. (Ted) Strehlow and his wife Bertha visited Charlotte Waters. Bertha thought it the most isolated and desolate place she had ever encountered. At that time, the homestead also still served as the police station, but it had been abandoned by the following year. Only the ruins of the foundation remained by the late 20th century, after the station building had been dismantled in order to re-use the stone in constructing the buildings on a nearby cattle station. Plants and animals The following plants and animals are linked to Charlotte Waters and indigenous to the area: Plants: *Christopher Giles is commemorated by the species name of dolomite fuchsia bush, Eremophila christopheri, whose habitat includes Charlotte Waters. *The genus Gilesia is named for both Christopher and Ernest Giles. *Cyperus gilesii and Panicum gilesii are usually listed as honouring Ernest Giles, but the type details for both species are given by George Bentham only as \\"Central Australia.

People  = Archeological record = Archeological evidence found on the Manette Peninsula suggests at least two, distinct periods of human settlement prior to the historic record. The first possibly beginning 7000 years ago. The people living on the Manette Peninsula at the beginning of the historic record were the Saktabsh band of the Suquamish. The Indian Fort at Point Herron was used to defend the entry to the Port Washington Narrows from annual raids by northern coastal tribes from the areas now in Canada and Alaska (see also Haida). A permanent village near Erlands Point had a longhouse similar to the remaining longhouse near Agate Passage, Old Man House.Manette Pioneering; Erv Jensen, ed.; Manette History Club; Bremerton, Washington; 1988; p. 1. = Historical record = The first permanent settlement of the westward expansion on the Manette Peninsula was a company town at a saw mill and dock built on a land claim staked out by William Renton on March 26, 1854 at Enetai Point. In 1857 Slaughter County was established in the area that is now Kitsap County, which includes the Manette Peninsula. Renton and his partner, Daniel S. Howard operated the milling and shipping company until Howard's death, at about the same time as the land deed was granted in 1863. Renton sold the land and business and moved to a larger mill facility at Blakely Harbor on Bainbridge Island.Manette Pioneering; p. 3 In 1868 the first Post Office was established at the sawmill, then the Colman and Glidden Mill of Port Orchard. (The city of Port Orchard now is on the opposite side of Port Orchard bay, to the south, on the Kitsap mainland.) The Coleman and Glidden Mill Company filed for bankruptcy in 1869. Then a company ship was hijacked to Victoria, British Columbia, and a federal judge's wife was thrown overboard to quiet her shrieking protestations. A logger threw the ship's captain overboard. An explosion occurred at the mill. A watchdog was poisoned. On May 8, 1870 the mill burned to the ground. A week later the sheriff seized the remaining assets for taxes owed.Manette Pioneering; p. 4 Other settlements around the Manette Peninsula built ports of call for the maritime transportation network of the Puget Sound's Mosquito Fleet. On the opposite side of Point Herron from the sawmill's shipping dock at Enetai, a dock at Decatur (later the town of Manette) served ferries to Bremerton. Docks and small ships provided transportation links among the shoreline communities before overland routes were cleared, and to communities on opposite shores.Manette Pioneering; p.5  Present features  = Transportation = The Manette Bridge and Warren Avenue Bridge provide transportation links, across Port Washington Narrows, and between downtown Bremerton and East Bremerton.

While it is typically found on older medium format cameras, some newer and/or 35 mm cameras have this type of finder (perhaps as an option). In the reflex camera, the light from the lens is projected onto a focusing screen. The waist-level finder makes this screen viewable from above, where the image is seen upright but reversed left-to-right. The eye-level finder is an evolution of the waist-level finder, using a roof pentaprism or pentamirror to correct the image while making it viewable through an eyepiece at the rear of the camera. Some digital cameras have an articulating screen or a swivel lens, this allows the screen to be angled to make it viewable at waist-level. With live preview the screen can be used as a viewfinder.  Advantages  * The photographer is looking down into the camera, attracting less attention compared to an eye-level finder. This makes it better for street or candid photography. * Even when they know they are being photographed, the subject may feel less \\"targeted\\" because the photographer is not looking at them. * The camera is often held against the belly or resting on something (e.g. table, the lap, etc.), resulting in less motion blur.

While there were a range conflicts between MƒÅori and Europeans prior to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, the signing of this gave legal grounds for protesting as the Treaty of Waitangi made New Zealand a British colony with British law and governance applying. It was drafted with the intention of establishing a British Governor of New Zealand, recognising MƒÅori ownership of their lands, forests and other possessions, and giving MƒÅori the rights of British subjects. However, the MƒÅori and English text differ in meaning significantly; particularly in relation to the meaning of having and ceding sovereignty. These discrepancies, and the British goal of colonisation, led to disagreements in the decades following the signing, including full-out warfare. In its modern form, the MƒÅori protest movement emerged in the early 1970s as part of a broader MƒÅori renaissance and has focused on issues such as the redressing Treaty of Waitangi grievances, MƒÅori land rights, the MƒÅori language and culture, and racism. It has generally been allied with the left wing although it differs from the mainstream left in a number of ways. Most members of the movement have been MƒÅori but it has attracted some support from (non-MƒÅori) New Zealanders and internationally, particularly from other indigenous peoples. Notable successes of the movement include establishment of the Waitangi Tribunal, the return of some MƒÅori land, and the MƒÅori language being made an official language of New Zealand.  Background  Although a large proportion of chiefs had signed the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, there were almost immediately disagreement over British sovereignty of the country, which led to several armed conflicts and disputes beginning in the 1840s, including the Flagstaff War, a dispute over the flying of the British Union Flag at the then colonial capital, Kororareka in the Bay of Islands. The MƒÅori King Movement (Kƒ´ngitanga) began in the 1850s partly as a means of focusing MƒÅori power in a manner which would allow them to negotiate with the Governor and Queen on equal footing. The chiefs justified this by the treaty's guarantee of rangatiratanga (chieftainship), but in the early 1860s the government used the MƒÅori King Movement as an excuse to invade lands in the eastern parts of the North Island, culminating in the Crown's confiscation of large parts of the Waikato and Taranaki from MƒÅori \\\\- the government arguing that the chiefs of Waikato and Taranaki were rebels against the Crown. Since then, MƒÅori have used petitions, court cases, deputations to the British monarch and to the New Zealand and British governments, passive resistance and boycotts to try to achieve their goals. Some of this resistance came from religious cults such as Pai Marire (from the 1860s) and Ringatu (founded in 1868). Prophets such as Te Kooti (‚Äì1893), Rua Kenana (1869-1937) and Te Whiti (‚Äì1907) are sometimes seen as early MƒÅori activists. Some MƒÅori also worked within systems such as the New Zealand Parliament in order to resist land loss and cultural imperialism - in particular Ngata, one of the most important and influential MƒÅori MP's (Member for Eastern Maori, 1905-1943), who tried to combine the benefits of both cultures for MƒÅori. From World War II (1939-1945), but especially from the 1950s, MƒÅori moved from rural to urban areas in large numbers. Most believed that New Zealand had ideal race relations and, although relations were good compared to many other countries, the harmony existed mostly because the mostly urban and the mostly rural MƒÅori rarely came into contact. MƒÅori urbanisation brought the differences between the cultures and the economic gaps between MƒÅori and into the open. In addition, many MƒÅori had difficulty coping with modern urban society away from the stabilizing influence of their and . Some turned to alcohol or crime, and many felt lost and alone. Several new groups, most prominently the MƒÅori Women's Welfare League (founded in 1951) and the New Zealand MƒÅori Council (formed in 1962) emerged to help urban MƒÅori and to provide a unified voice for MƒÅori. These groups were conservative by later standards but did criticise the government on numerous occasions. The first significant MƒÅori involvement in conventional protest came during controversy over the exclusion of MƒÅori players from the 1960 All Blacks rugby tour of South Africa. However the protests tended to be organised and led by . The MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act In the mid-1960s the National government proposed to make MƒÅori land more ‚Äòeconomic‚Äô by encouraging its transfer to a system of land ownership. The MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act 1967, as it became, generally allowed greater interference in MƒÅori landholding, and was widely seen amongst MƒÅori as a \\"land grab\\". Under the MƒÅori Affairs Act of 1957, land owners who had shares less than $50 were forced to sell their shares which became a problematic type of land alienation. This was intensified under the 1967 Act. The plans were strongly opposed by virtually every MƒÅori group and organisation as the Act blatantly ignored the importance of MƒÅori land being turangawaewae. Despite this, the Act was passed with only minor modifications. The Act is generally seen as the catalyst for the MƒÅori protest movement, and the evidence certainly points to this. However the movement can also be seen as part of a wider civil rights movement which emerged across the world in the 1960s. The Act was abolished under the MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act of 1974, led by minister of MƒÅori Affairs, Matiu Ratahttps://teara.govt.nz/en/te-tango- whenua-maori-land-alienation/page-9 Sporting contact with South Africa Early activism over the issue of sporting contacts with apartheid South Africa New Zealand has a long history of sporting contact with South Africa, especially through rugby union. Until the 1970s this resulted in discrimination against MƒÅori players, since the apartheid political system in South Africa for most of the twentieth century did not allow people of different races to play sport together, and therefore South African officials requested that MƒÅori players not be included in sides which toured their country. Despite some of New Zealand's best players being MƒÅori, this was agreed to, and MƒÅori were excluded from tours of South Africa. Some MƒÅori always objected to this, but it did not become a major issue until 1960, when there were several public protests at MƒÅori exclusion from that year's tour. The protest group Halt All Racist Tours was formed in 1969. Although this was an issue in which MƒÅori were central, and MƒÅori were involved in the protests, the anti-tour movement was dominated by . In 1973, a proposed tour of New Zealand by the Springboks (the South African rugby team) was cancelled. In 1976 the South African government relented and allowed a mixed-race All Black team to tour South Africa. However, by this time international opinion had turned against any sporting contact with South Africa, and New Zealand faced significant international pressure to cut ties. Despite this, in 1981 the Springboks toured New Zealand, sparking mass protests and civil disobedience. Although continued to dominate the movement, MƒÅori were prominent within it, and in Auckland formed the squad in order to remain autonomous within the wider movement. During and after the Tour, many MƒÅori protesters questioned protesters' commitment to racial equality, accusing them of focussing on racism in other countries while ignoring it within New Zealand. The majority of protesters were not heavily involved in protest after the Tour ended, but a significant minority, including several anti-Tour groups, turned their attention to New Zealand race issues, particularly prejudice and the Treaty of Waitangi. Waitangi Day protests The first act of the MƒÅori protest movement was arguably the boycott of Waitangi Day by a handful of MƒÅori elders in 1968 in protest over the MƒÅori Affairs Amendment Act. A small protest was also held at parliament, and was received by Labour MP Whetu Tirikatene- Sullivan. Although both were reported in the newspapers they made little impact. In 1971 the ceremonies were disrupted by the protest group NgƒÅ Tamatoa (The Young Warriors) who chanted and performed during speeches, and attempted to destroy the flag. Protest has been a feature of Waitangi Day ever since. MƒÅori language and culture activism One of the early goals of the MƒÅori protest movement was the promotion of MƒÅori language (te reo MƒÅori) and culture. Both of these had been generally ignored by the education system and New Zealand society in general, and schoolchildren were actively discouraged from speaking MƒÅori in school. The 1867 Native Schools Act decreed that English should be the only language used in the education of MƒÅori children- this policy was later rigorously enforced. This movement was led by MƒÅori MPs who saw the advantages of MƒÅori becoming fluent in a dominant world language. Until MƒÅori became largely urbanised after World War II, this did not seriously damage the language since most MƒÅori spoke it in their rural communities. Urbanisation produced a generation of MƒÅori who mostly grew up in non-MƒÅori environments and were therefore less exposed to the language. In addition, many parents felt that it was much more important for their children to be fluent in English and made no attempts to pass on the language. As a result, many leaders of MƒÅori protest were not fluent in MƒÅori and felt that this was a major cultural loss. In the face of official indifference and sometimes hostility, Nga Tamatoa and other groups initiated a number of schemes for the promotion of the language. These included MƒÅori Language Day, which later became MƒÅori Language Week; a programme which trained fluent speakers as teachers; and : MƒÅori language pre-schools and later MƒÅori kura or separate immersion schools at primary and secondary level. Later there were campaigns for a MƒÅori share of the airwaves. These eventually resulted in the iwi radio stations and a MƒÅori Television channel, all of which actively promote the language. In 1987 Te Reo was made an official language of New Zealand, with the passing of the MƒÅori Language Act. Activists also campaigned to change the names of landmarks such as mountains back to their original MƒÅori names, and to end the mispronunciation of MƒÅori words, especially by newsreaders and other broadcasters. Many MƒÅori cultural forms, such as carving, weaving and performing arts such as haka had gone into decline in the nineteenth century. From the early twentieth century ƒÄpirana Ngata and others made efforts to revive them, for example setting up intertribal competitions and getting state funding for meeting houses. MƒÅori activists continued this tradition, but their primary focus was on stopping the abuse of MƒÅori cultural forms. The best known example of this was the 'haka party' incident. A group of University of Auckland engineering students had for many years performed a parody haka and paddled an imaginary around central Auckland as a capping stunt. Repeated requests to end the performance were ignored and eventually a group of MƒÅori assaulted the students. Although the activists' actions were widely condemned by , they were defended in court by MƒÅori elders and were convicted but the students' stunt was not performed again. Most recent MƒÅori protest in this sphere has been directed against non-New Zealand groups and businesses who use the MƒÅori language and cultural forms‚Äîsometimes copyrighting them‚Äîwithout permission or understanding. Since it is internationally known, the haka of the All Blacks is particularly vulnerable to this treatment. The Treaty of Waitangi The Treaty of Waitangi has always been a major focus of MƒÅori protest. It is often used to argue for particular aims, such as return of unjustly taken land, and the promotion of the MƒÅori language. =The Treaty to the mid 20th century= The Treaty of Waitangi was an agreement, made in 1840, between the British Crown and various MƒÅori chiefs. Differences between the MƒÅori and English language versions of the Treaty gave the British the right to establish a governor in New Zealand, stated the rights of the chiefs to ownership of their lands and other properties, and gave MƒÅori the rights of British citizens. =Campaign for ratification= From about the mid nineteenth century, MƒÅori campaigned for proper recognition of the Treaty, generally asking that it be ratified or otherwise made a part of New Zealand law. In the 1960s and the 1970s, MƒÅori activists continued this campaign, sometimes making it a focus of their Waitangi Day protests. In 1975 the Treaty was given some recognition with the Treaty of Waitangi Act. This established the Waitangi Tribunal, which was given the task to investigating contemporary breaches of the Treaty. However, since it was not able to investigate historical breaches, was underfunded, and generally unsympathetic to claimants, most MƒÅori were disappointed by the Tribunal. =\\"The Treaty is a Fraud\\"= Possibly as a result to the failure of the Waitangi Tribunal to achieve much, many MƒÅori activists in the early 1980s stopped asking for the Treaty to be honoured and instead argued that it was a fraudulent document. They argued that MƒÅori had been tricked in 1840, that either they had never agreed to sign away their sovereignty or that breaches of the Treaty had rendered it invalid. Since the Treaty was invalid, it was argued, the New Zealand government had no right to sovereignty over the country. This argument was broadly expressed in Donna Awatere's book MƒÅori Sovereignty. =Activism and the Tribunal= In 1985 the Treaty of Waitangi Act was amended to allow the Tribunal to investigate historic breaches of the Treaty. It was also given more funding and its membership increased. In addition, the Treaty was mentioned in several pieces of legislation, and a number of court cases increased its importance. As a result, most MƒÅori activists began to call once again for the Treaty to be honoured. Many protesters put their energies into Treaty claims and the management of settlements, but many also argued that the Tribunal was too underfunded and slow, and pointed out that because its recommendations were not binding the government could (and did) ignore it when it suited them. Some protesters continued to argue for MƒÅori sovereignty, arguing that by negotiating with the Tribunal MƒÅori were only perpetuating the illegal occupying government. Land The longest-standing MƒÅori grievances generally involve land and the economic disadvantage losing land created. In the century after 1840 MƒÅori lost possession of most of their land, although the amount lost varied significantly between iwi. In some cases the land was purchased legitimately from willing MƒÅori sellers, but in many cases the transfer was illegal and morally dubious. The best known cause of MƒÅori land loss is the confiscation in the Waikato and Taranaki regions following the New Zealand Wars. Other causes included owners selling land without fully understanding the implications of the sale (especially in the early years of colonisation); groups selling land which did not belong to them; traders enticing land owners into debt and then claiming the land as payment; the conducting of unrequested surveys which were then charged to the owners, and the unpaid bills from this used to justify taking the land; levying of unreasonable rates and confiscation following non-payment; the taking of land for public works; and simple fraud. Upon losing land, most iwi quickly embarked on campaigns to regain it but these were largely unsuccessful. Some iwi received token payments from the government but continued to agitate for the return of the land or, failing that, adequate compensation. The return of lost land was a major focus of MƒÅori activists, and generally united the older, more conservative generation with the younger 'protest' generation. Some of the best-known episodes of MƒÅori protest centred on land, including: =Bastion Point= Bastion Point in Auckland was originally part of a large area of land owned by NgƒÅti Whatua. Between 1840 and 1960 nearly all of this was lost, leaving NgƒÅti Whatua with only the Point. In the 1970s the third National government proposed taking the land and developing it. Bastion Point was subsequently occupied in a protest lead by Joe Hawke which lasted from January 1977 to May 1978. The protesters were removed by the army and police, but there continued to be conflict over the land. When the Waitangi Tribunal was given the power to investigate historical grievances, this the Orakei claim covering the Bastion Point area was one of the first cases for investigation. The Tribunal found that NgƒÅti Whatua had been unjustly deprived of their ancestral land hence Bastion Point was returned to their ownership with compensation paid to the tribe by the Crown. =Raglan Golf Course= During the Second World War, land in the Raglan area was taken from its MƒÅori owners for use as an airstrip. Following the end of the war, the land was not returned but instead leased to the Raglan Golf Club, who turned it into a golf course. This was particularly painful for the original owners as it contained burial grounds, one of which was turned into a bunker. A group of protesters led by Eva Rickard and assisted by Angeline Greensill occupied the land and also used legal means to have the land returned, a goal which was eventually achieved. Whina Cooper leads the MƒÅori Land March through Hamilton in 1975 =1975 Land March= In 1975 a large group (around 5000) of MƒÅori and other New Zealanders, led by then 79-year-old Whina Cooper, walked the length of the North Island to Wellington to protest against MƒÅori land loss. Although the government at the time, the third Labour government, had done more to address MƒÅori grievances than nearly any prior government, protesters felt that much more needed to be done. Following the march, the protesters were divided over what to do next. Some, including Tame Iti, remained in Wellington to occupy parliament grounds. A 1975 documentary from director Geoff Steven includes interviews with many of those on the march: Eva Rickard, Tama Poata and Whina Cooper.This documentary can be viewed on NZ On Screen (requires Adobe Flash). Footage of the television coverage of the march was included in the 1978 television adaptation of Death of the Land by MƒÅori playwright Rowley Habib. Resurgence of protest on land and Treaty issues from the 1990s A series of protests in the mid-1990s marked a new phase of activism on land and Treaty issues, with action focused not only on the Government but also MƒÅori conservatives who were seen as complicit with the Government agenda. Symbolic acts have included attacking Victorian statuary, the America's Cup (1996) \\"Nathan, who later changed his named to Penehamine Netana-Patuawa, saw the cup as a symbol of oppression and believed none of the money made from the race would reach Maori.\\" and the lone pine on One Tree Hill (Auckland) and removing (1997)a Colin McCahon painting (subsequently returned) from the Lake Waikaremoana Visitor Centre. Rising protests at Waitangi Day celebrations led the government to move some official observances to Government House in Wellington. Many protests were generated in response to the government's proposal to limit the monetary value of Treaty settlements to one billion dollars over 10 years, the so-called \\"fiscal envelope\\". A series of hui (meetings) graphically illustrated the breadth and depth of MƒÅori rejection of such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known. As a result, much of the policy package, especially the fiscal cap, was dropped. These protests included occupations of Whanganui's Moutoa Gardens and the Takahue school in Northland (leading to its destruction by fire). =Fiscal envelope= The government unveiled the fiscal envelope ‚Äî its answer to settling Treaty of Waitangi grievances limiting the total amount that will be spent to one billion dollars. While early Tribunal recommendations mainly concerned a contemporary issue that could be revised or rectified by the government at the time, historical settlements raised more complex issues. The Office of Treaty Settlements was established in the Ministry of Justice to develop government policy on historical claims. In 1995, the government developed the \\"Crown Proposals for the Settlement of Treaty of Waitangi Claims\\" to attempt to address the issues. A key element of the proposals was the creation of a \\"fiscal envelope\\" of $1 billion for the settlement of all historical claims, an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements. The Crown held a series of consultation hui around the country, at which MƒÅori vehemently rejected such a limitation in advance of the extent of claims being fully known. The concept of the fiscal envelope was subsequently dropped after the 1996 general election. Opposition to the policy was coordinated by Te Kawau Maro an Auckland group who organised protests at the Government consultation Hui. Rising protests to the Fiscal Envelope at the Waitangi Day celebrations led the government to move the official observance to Government House in Wellington. Despite universal rejection of the 'Fiscal Envelope', Waikato-Tainui negotiators, accepted the Government Deal which became known as the Waikato Tainui Raupatu Settlement. Notable opposition to this deal was led by MƒÅori leader Eva Rickard. =PƒÅkaitore= For 79 days in 1995, people of the Whanganui tribes occupied historic PƒÅkaitore (Moutoa Gardens), beside the river and within the city of Whanganui. This protest was resolved peaceably, and a tripartite agreement with government and local government has since been signed. At the heart of all this is the Whanganui tribes‚Äô claim to the river, which is still seen as both an ancestor and a source of material and spiritual sustenance. \\"We were forced to leave, and it shouldn't be lost on anybody that we upheld our dignity,\\" protest leader Ken Mair told a press conference in Whanganui 18 May 1995 following the end of the occupation.\\" In no way were we going to allow the state the opportunity to put the handcuffs on us and lock us away.\\" The police were reported to have up to 1,000 reinforcements ready to evict the land occupants. Whanganu√≠ Kaitoke prison had been gazetted as a \\"police jail\\" to enable its use as holding cells. The police eviction preparations were code-named \\"Operation Exodus\\". A week earlier, on 10 May, up to 70 police in riot gear had raided the land occupation in the middle of the night, claiming the protest had become a haven for \\"criminals and stolen property\\" and \\"drug users.\\" Ten people were arrested on minor charges including \\"breach of the peace\\" and \\"assault.\\" Throughout the occupation there has been a strict policy of no drugs or alcohol on the site. Protest leaders denounced the raid as a dress rehearsal for their forced eviction and an attempt to provoke, intimidate, and discredit the land occupants. Throughout the 79-day occupation, the land protesters faced almost nightly harassment and racist abuse by the police. The decision to end the MƒÅori occupation of Moutoa Gardens was debated by participants at a three-hour meeting 17 May 1995. At 3:45 the next morning the occupants gathered and began dismantling tents and buildings and the surrounding fence. Bonfires burned across the site. At 4:50 a.m., the same time they had entered the gardens 79 days earlier, the protesters began their march to a meeting place several miles away. Over the next few days, a team continued to dismantle the meeting house and other buildings that had been erected during the occupation. \\"Every step of the way has been worthwhile as far as we are concerned,\\" Niko Tangaroa told the 18 May press conference in Wanganui. \\"Pakaitore is our land. It will remain our land, and we will continue to assert that right irrespective of the courts.\\" The protest leaders vowed to continue their fight, including through further land occupations. \\"As long as the Crown [government] buries its head in the sand and pretends that issues of sovereignty and our land grievances are going to go away‚Äîwe are going to stand up and fight for what is rightfully ours,\\" Ken Mair declared. =Takahue= The Whanganui occupation of Pakaitore inspired a group of MƒÅori from Takahue a small Northland settlement to occupy the local schoolhouse. The several dozen protesters who have occupied the school since then are demanded that title to the land on which the school stands be returned to them. The they claimed were part of purchased by the government in 1875, in a transaction the protesters, descendants of the original owners, regard as invalid. The school has been closed since the mid-1980s and used as an army training camp and for community activities since then. Bill Perry, a spokesperson for the protesters, explained to reporters who visited the occupation on 22 April 1995 that the land they are claiming has been set aside in a government controlled Landbank together with other property in the region. This Landbank allegedly protects lands currently subject to claims under the Waitangi Tribunal from sale pending settlement of the claims. The occupation ended with mass arrests and the burning of the school. An article in the New Zealand Listener by Adam Gifford from 1995 describes the events and reactions from the community of the occupation and burning of the Takahue School. =Huntly= Another occupation inspired by Pakaitore began on 26 April 1995 in Huntly, a coal mining town south of Auckland. The block of land sits atop a hill overlooking the town, in full view of the mine entrance with its coal conveyor leading to a power station. Protesters told reporters who visited the occupation 29 April that the land is part of confiscated by the government 132 years ago from the Tainui tribe. It is now owned by Solid Energy, previously Coalcorp, a state-owned enterprise. Those occupying the land are demanding its return to NgƒÅti Whawhakia, the local MƒÅori sub-tribe. The claim includes coal and mineral rights. Robert Tukiri, chairman of NgƒÅti Whawhakia Trust and spokesperson for the occupation said, \\"We have got our backs to the wall. There is a housing shortage. We need to have houses.\\" Tukiri opposed a NZ$170 million (NZ$1=US$0.67) deal between the government and the Tainui MƒÅori Trust Board due to be signed 22 May as final settlement for the government's land seizures last century. The agreement will turn over of state-owned land to the trust board and NZ$65 million for further purchases of private land. \\"The Tainui MƒÅori Trust Board stands to become the biggest landlord around, while 80 percent of our tribe rents their homes,\\" Tukiri commented. = IhumƒÅtao = From 2016 issues relating to land at IhumƒÅtao in MƒÅngere have remained the focus of occupation and dispute. Foreshore and Seabed Parliament In 2003 the Court of Appeal ruled that MƒÅori could seek customary title to areas of the New Zealand foreshore and seabed, overturning assumptions that such land automatically belonged to the Crown. The ruling alarmed many , and the Labour government proposed legislation removing the right to seek ownership of the foreshore and seabed. This angered many MƒÅori who saw it as confiscation of land. Labour Party MP Tariana Turia was so incensed by the legislation that she eventually left the party and formed the MƒÅori Party. In May 2004 a (march) from Northland to Wellington, modeled on the 1975 land march but in vehicles, was held, attracting thousands of participants. Despite this, the legislation was passed later that year. Te Mana Motuhake o Tuhoe Te Mana Motuhake o Tuhoe is a group which includes the Tuhoe leader Tame Iti. The group has held numerous campaigns highlighting the rights of the Tuhoe people. The ideology of the group is based on self-government as a base principle of democracy and that Tuhoe has the democratic right to self-government. Tuhoe were not signatories of the Treaty of Waitangi, and have always maintained a right to uphold uniquely Tuhoe values, culture, language and identity within their homelands. =Te Urupatu= On 16 January 2005 during a (or greeting ceremony) which formed part of a Waitangi Tribunal hearing, Iti fired a shotgun into a New Zealand flag in close proximity to a large number of people, which he explained was an attempt to recreate the 1860s East Cape War: \\"We wanted them to feel the heat and smoke, and T≈´hoe outrage and disgust at the way we have been treated for 200 years\\". The incident was filmed by television crews but initially ignored by police. The matter was however raised in parliament, one opposition MP asking \\"why TƒÅme Iti can brandish a firearm and gloat about how he got away with threatening judges on the Waitangi Tribunal, without immediate arrest and prosecution\\". The police subsequently charged Iti with discharging a firearm in a public place. His trial occurred in June 2006. TƒÅme Iti elected to give evidence in MƒÅori (his native language), stating that he was following the T≈´hoe custom of making noise with totara poles. T≈´hoe Rangatira stated Iti had been disciplined by the tribe and protocol clarified to say discharge of a weapon in anger was always inappropriate (but stated that it was appropriate when honouring dead warriors, (in a manner culturally equivalent to the firing of a volley over a grave within Western cultures)). Judge Chris McGuire said \\"It was designed to intimidate unnecessarily and shock. It was a stunt, it was unlawful\\". Judge McGuire convicted Iti on both charges and fined him. Iti attempted to sell the flag he shot on the TradeMe auction site to pay the fine and his legal costs, but the sale‚Äîa violation of proceeds of crime legislation‚Äîwas withdrawn. Iti lodged an appeal, in which his lawyer, Annette Sykes, argued that Crown Law did not stretch to the ceremonial area in front of a Marae's Wharenui. On 4 April 2007, the Court of Appeal of New Zealand overturned his convictions for unlawfully possessing a firearm. While recognising that events occurred in \\"a unique setting\\", the court did not agree with Sykes' submission about Crown law. However Justices Hammond, O'Regan and Wilson found that his prosecutors failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Iti's actions caused \\"requisite harm\\", under Section 51 of the Arms Act. The Court of Appeal described Iti's protest as \\"a foolhardy enterprise\\" and warned him not to attempt anything similar again. =Anti- terror raids= On Monday, 15 October 2007, several police raids were conducted across New Zealand in relation to the discovery of an alleged paramilitary training camp deep in the Urewera mountain range near the town of Ruatoki in the eastern Bay of Plenty. Approximate area of the Urewera mountain range. About 300 police, including members of the Armed Offenders and anti- terror squads, were involved in the raids(cached 21 October 2007) in which four guns and 230 rounds of ammunition were seized and 17 people arrested, all but one of them charged with firearms offences. According to police, the raids were a culmination of more than a year of surveillance that uncovered and monitored the training camps. Search warrants were executed under the Summary Proceedings Act to search for evidence relating to potential breaches of the Terrorism Suppression Act and the Arms Act. On 29 October, police referred evidence gathered during the raids to the Solicitor-General to consider whether charges should be laid under the Terrorism Suppression Act. Authorisation for prosecutions under the Act is given by the Attorney-General though he has delegated this responsibility to Solicitor-General David Collins. On 8 November the Solicitor-General declined to press charges under the Terrorism Suppression Act, because of inadequacies of the legislation. According to Prime Minister Helen Clark, one of the reasons police tried to lay charges under anti-terror legislation was because they could not use telephone interception evidence in prosecutions under the Arms Act. Activists that were arrested and raided are known supporters of Te Mana Motuhake o Tuhoe and came from diverse networks of environmental, anarchist and MƒÅori activism. Arrests and following court cases A number of people were arrested in the raids, including MƒÅori activist Tame Iti, his nephews Rawiri Iti and Maraki Teepa, MƒÅori anarchist Emily Bailey from Parihaka along with her twin brothers Ira and Rongomai, Rangi Kemara of NgƒÅti Maniapoto, Vietnam war veterans Tuhoe Francis Lambert and Moana Hemi Winitana also of Ngai Tuhoe, Radical Youth anarchist Omar Hamed. Others included Marama Mayrick, who faces five firearms charges; Other defendants include Trudi Paraha, Phillip Purewa, Valerie Morse, Urs Peter Signer and Tekaumarua Wharepouri. Of the people arrested, at least 16 are facing firearms charges. (cached 21 October 2007) Police also attempted to lay charges against 12 people under the Terrorism Suppression act but the Solicitor General declined to prosecute for charges under the act. All charges against Rongomai Bailey were dropped in October 2008 Campaign to fly the Tino Rangatiratanga flag Tino Rangatiratanga flag The official recognition of the Tino Rangatiratanga flag was a campaign of indigenous-rights-advocacy group Te Ata Tino Toa. The group applied for permission for the Tino Rangatiratanga flag to be flown on the Auckland Harbour Bridge on Waitangi Day. After considerable debate in the public arena the group adopted various tactics to raise awareness of the issues, including lobbying Transit New Zealand and Parliament, submissions to the Human Rights Commission and holding an annual \\"Fly the Flag\\" competition, to more direct protest actions including bungee jumping off and traffic-jamming the Harbour Bridge, as well as flying the flag from the bridge. Organisers of the campaign included Tia Taurere, Gareth Seymour and Teanau Tuiono. =Sanctioned uses of the Tino Rangatiratanga Flag= On 14 December 2009 Prime Minister John Key and MƒÅori Affairs Minister Pita Sharples announced that the MƒÅori Tino Rangatiratanga flag has been chosen to fly from the Auckland Harbour Bridge and other official buildings (such as Premier House) on Waitangi Day. The announcement followed a MƒÅori Party-led promotion and series of hikoi on which MƒÅori flag should fly from the bridge and 1,200 submissions, with 80 per cent of participants in favour of Tino Rangatiratanga flag as the preferred MƒÅori flag. Although Ngai Tahu reject the flag saying the \\"flag has been nothing but trouble\\". Key said the MƒÅori flag would not replace the New Zealand flag but would fly alongside it to recognise the partnership the Crown and MƒÅori entered into when signing the Treaty of Waitangi. \\"No changes are being made to the status of the New Zealand flag,\\" Mr Key said. Sharples said the MƒÅori flag was a simple way to recognise the status of MƒÅori as tangata whenua. \\"However, the New Zealand flag remains the symbol of our nation, and there is no intention to change this, nor to diminish the status of our national flag.\\" The Ministry of Culture and Heritage published guidelines describing the appropriate way to fly the MƒÅori flag in relation to the New Zealand flag.

I-55 provides an alternate route for motorists who do not want to take Interstates 240 and 40 through downtown to cross the Mississippi River. History On January 18, 2008, the Federal Highway Administration authorized the states of Mississippi and Tennessee to extend I-69 from the I-40/TN 300 interchange in north Memphis to the I-55/I-69 interchange in Hernando; however, Tennessee has signed the extension of the route, although Mississippi has already done so.Capka, J. Richard (FHWA Administrator), Letter to Paul D. Degges (TDOT) dated January 18, 2008, retrieved May 28, 2008. Interstate 55 is one of Tennessee's interstates where the speed limit is 65 MPH instead of 70. Future There are currently plans to revamp the I-55/Crump Boulevard Interchange. The current design (a cloverleaf interchange) causes northbound motorists, especially truck drivers, to slow down from 55 MPH to 25 MPH when going from the section they are on to the section passing over the Mississippi River. Prior to 2011, northbound traffic had to merge on a one-lane loop with a tight radius while traffic going from I-55 SB to Riverside Drive merged into traffic on another loop ramp. This has caused several accidents over the years. A temporary solution has been put into effect by making the NB loop into two lanes, eliminating the I-55 SB to Riverside Drive loop, and creating a left turn lane for the I-55 SB to Riverside Drive traffic. This eliminates having to make a lane change in order to stay on I-55 NB. Starting in 2018, a project creating a permanent solution will be constructed. The cloverleaf will be eliminated entirely and two flyover ramps will be added, thus creating free-flow traffic for the mainline interstate. A roundabout will be created in place of the cloverleaf for Riverside Drive traffic, E.H. Crump Boulevard traffic, and the I-55 entrance/exit ramps.

Biography Vaso Pasha was born in Shkod√´r on September 17, 1825. He was a Catholic Albanian who held high positions within the Ottoman Empire. =Secretary in the British Consulate= From 1842 to 1847 he worked as a secretary for the British consulate in Shkod√´r. He there had the opportunity to perfect his knowledge of a number of foreign languages: Italian, French, Turkish and Greek. He also knew some English and Serbian, and in later years learned Arabic. =1847-1848: The Italian Year= In 1847, he set off for Italy on the eve of turbulent events that were to take place there and elsewhere in Europe in 1848. There are two letters written by him in Bologna in the summer of 1848 in which he expresses openly republican and anti-clerical views. He later went to Venice where he took part in fighting in Marghera in October 1848, part of a Venetian uprising against the Austrians. After the arrival of Austrian troops, Pashko Vasa was obliged to flee to Ancona where, as an Ottoman citizen, he was expelled to Istanbul. He published an account of his experience in Italy the following year in Italian-language La mia prigionia, episodio storico dell'assedio di Venezia, Istanbul 1850 (My imprisonment, historical episode from the siege of Venice). =1848-1863: In Istanbul= In Istanbul, after an initial period of poverty and hardship, he obtained a position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whence he was seconded to London for a time, to the Imperial Ottoman Embassy to the Court of St. James's. He later served the Sublime Porte in various positions of authority as a bureaucrat. =1863-1864: In Bosnia- Herzegovina= In 1863, thanks to his knowledge of Serbian, he was appointed to serve as a secretary and interpreter to Ahmet Cevdet Pasha, Ottoman statesman and historian, on a fact-finding mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina which lasted for twenty months, from the spring of 1863 to October 1864. The events of this mission were recorded in his La Bosnie et l'Herz√©govine pendant la mission de Djevdet Efendi, Constantinople 1865 (Bosnia and Herzegovina during the mission of Jevdet Efendi). A few years later he published another now rare work of historical interest, Esquisse historique sur le Mont√©n√©gro d'apr√®s les traditions de l'Albanie, Constantinople 1872 (Historical sketch of Montenegro according to Albanian traditions). =Administrator of Edirne vilayet= Vasa (centre, between the counsel for the prisoner and Pertev Effendi) at an Ottoman trial, 1877 In 1879, Pashko Vasa worked in Varna on the Black Sea coast in the administration of the vilayet of Edirne with Ismail Qemali. He also acquired the title of Pasha. =Importance to Albania= League of Prizren Organization Despite his functions on behalf of the Porte, Pashko Vasa never forgot his Albanian homeland. In the autumn of 1877 he became a founding member of the Central Committee for the Defence of the Rights of the Albanian People in Istanbul which was a group of Albanian intelligentsia advocating for the territorial integrity and unity of Albanian inhabited areas in the Ottoman Empire. As a member of the Committee he met during mid March with British ambassador Austen Henry Layard in Istanbul and urged that Albanian inhabited territories not be given to newly independent Slavic states. Through his contacts at the Committee, he also participated in the organization of the League of Prizren in 1878. He was probably the author of the Memorandum on Albanian Autonomy which had his signature alongside those of other Albanian notables and the document was submitted to the British Embassy in Constantinople. Vasa favoured the unification of Albanian inhabited vilayets or provinces into a single vilayet of Albania within the Ottoman empire and having a \\"compact and strong organisation\\" with Albanian participation in its public administration. Creation of the Albanian alphabet Vasa as a member of the Committee for Defending Albanian Rights was appointed along with Sami Frash√´ri, Jani Vreto and Hasan Tahsini to create an Albanian alphabet which by 19 March 1879 the group approved Frash√´ri's 36 letter alphabet consisting mostly of Latin characters. As such Vasa published a 16-page brochure entitled L'alphabet Latin appliqu√© √† la langue albanaise, Constantinople 1878 (The Latin alphabet applied to the Albanian language). Vasa expressed support of an alphabet of purely Latin characters. He was also a member of the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings, founded in Constantinople on October 12, 1879 to promote the printing and distribution of the Albanian-language books. =Governor of Lebanon= Photo from the 1880s Sultan Abdulhamid II appointed Vasa as Mutessarƒ±f of Mount Lebanon on June 18, 1882, a post reserved by international treaty for a Catholic of Ottoman nationality after the civil unrest and French occupation of 1860. While in Lebanon as governor, Vasa continued his work for Albanianism by publishing books on Albania in French and other publications on the Albanian language. In his post as Mutassarƒ±f, he was initially more willing to accept French consular authority, but over his nine years in office, he came to distrust both the French Consul and the Maronite Clergy, who closely guarded their privileges. This earned him accusations of corruption, in association with his son-in-law and deputy Kupelyan Effendi. Nevertheless, he remained in office until his death in Beirut after a long illness on June 29, 1892. In 1978, the centenary of the League of Prizren, his remains were transferred from the Lebanon back to a modest grave in Shkodra. Literary works During 1879 The Truth on Albania and Albanians was a book published by Vasa and appeared in French, English, German, Greek and Albanian translations that advocated for the Albanian cause and to inform a European readership about Albanians. In 1880 the book with a shortened title Albania and Albanians also appeared in Ottoman Turkish. The book discussed the origins of Albanians, who they were and their living conditions while arguing that they were the oldest people in the Balkans and separate from the Greeks. Vasa glorified medieval era Albanian resistance for independence and freedom to the Ottomans under Skanderbeg while celebrating Albanian military prowess as a natural fighters and ability to defend the empire. He also mentioned that after those events Albanians were an integral and loyal part of the empire having contributed many statesmen, bureaucrats, commanders and soldiers. His book criticised Ottoman governance in Albania of sending non-Albanian Ottoman officials to administer Albanians who were ineffective as they were unfamiliar with the local language, customs and other societal factors. Vasa suggested indirectly that either local Albanians could be appointed or Ottoman officials trained in the local ways of the Albanians as a solution to those issues. He attempted to impress on readers the unity of Albanians as a people with a common language, customs, history and aspirations while sidelining religious divisions and differences between the areas of Gegalik (Geg√´nia) and Toskalik (Tosk√´ria). Vasa also advocated for the unification of various vilayets with Albanian populations into one administrative unit claiming that it would assist Ottoman interests as Muslim Albanians had no desire to revolt against the empire. The political Albanianism of the book overall was a response to geopolitical threats posed to Albanian inhabited territories within the empire and issues relating to the notion of rights regarding nationality for Albanians. Various outlets of the European press like The (London) Times reviewed his book and explained its contents, themes and other details about Albania and Albanians to their readership. To make the Albanian language better known and to give other Europeans an opportunity to learn it, he published a Grammaire albanaise √† l'usage de ceux qui d√©sirent apprendre cette langue sans l'aide d'un ma√Ætre, Ludgate Hill 1887 (Albanian grammar for those wishing to learn this language without the aid of a teacher), one of the rare grammars of the period. Pashko Vasa was also the author of a number of literary works of note. The first of these is a volume of Italian verse entitled Rose e spine, Constantinople 1873 (Roses and thorns), forty-one emotionally charged poems (a total of ca. 1,600 lines) devoted to themes of love, suffering, solitude and death in the traditions of the romantic verse of his European predecessors Giacomo Leopardi, Alphonse de Lamartine and Alfred de Musset. Among the subjects treated in these meditative Italian poems, two of which are dedicated to the Italian poets Francesco Petrarch and Torquato Tasso, are life in exile and family tragedy, a reflection of Pashko Vasa's own personal life. His first wife, Drande, whom he had married in 1855, and four of their five children died before him, and in later years too, personal misfortune continued to haunt him. In 1884, shortly after his appointment as Governor General of the Lebanon, his second wife from Shkod√´r, Katerina Bonati, died of tuberculosis, as did his surviving daughter Roza in 1887. Bardha de T√©mal, sc√®nes de la vie albanaise, Paris 1890 (Bardha of Temal, scenes from Albanian life), is a French-language novel which Pashko Vasa published in Paris under the pseudonym of Albanus Albano the same year as Naim Frash√´ri's noted verse collection Lulet e ver√´s (The Flowers of Spring) appeared in Bucharest. 'Bardha of Temal,' though not written in Albanian, is, after Sami Frash√´ri's much shorter prose work 'Love of Tal'at and Fitnat,' the oldest novel written and published by an Albanian and is certainly the oldest such novel with an Albanian theme. Focusing on the habits and customs of Gheg Albanians in Northern Albania the novel set in Shkodra during 1842, is classically structured roman-feuilleton, rather excessively sentimental for modern tastes and follows the tribulations of the fair but married Bardha and her lover, the young Aradi. It was written not only as an entertaining love story but also with a view to informing the western reader of the customs and habits of the northern Albanians. Bardha is no doubt the personification of Albania itself, married off against her will to the powers that be. Above and beyond its didactic character and any possible literary pretensions the author might have had, 'Bardha of Temal' also has a more specific political background. It was interpreted by some Albanian intellectuals at the time as a vehicle for discrediting the Gjonmarkaj clan who, in cahoots with the powerful abbots of Mirdita, held sway in the Shkodra region. It is for this reason perhaps that Pashko Vasa published the novel under the pseudonym Albanus Albano. The work is not known to have had any particular echo in the French press of the period. Though most of Pashko Vasa's publications were in French and Italian, there is one poem, the most influential and perhaps the most popular ever written in Albanian, which has ensured him his deserved place in Albanian literary history, the famous O moj Shqypni e mjera Shqypni (Oh Albania, Poor Albania). Frustrated by Albanian societal divisions, this stirring appeal by Vasa for a national awakening and unity transcending religious and other identities is thought to have been written in the period between 1878, the dramatic year of the League of Prizren, and 1880. Vasa overall continued to inform European readers on Albanians and Albania through his French publications, as he had done from the time of the Unionist Societies.

HIV+ patients took anti-HIV drugs for seven days, and then took no drugs for seven days. Generally, patients with HIV who were being treated aggressively with continuous highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) lived longer lives, but they were not able to eliminate the HIV virus altogether and experienced many undesirable side effects. The long-term toxicity and financial expense of HAART makes it undesirable as the standard, long-term treatment for HIV patients. Consequently, a short study on administering medications in a structured intermittent manner was designed. The hope of this 2001 study was that alternating weeks of drug-taking with weeks of drug abstinence would both reduce toxicity and cost to the patients.2001 NIH research study This small, uncontrolled study found that a structured intermittent therapy (SIT) approach may help to maintain health while also reducing cost and toxicity of antiretroviral therapy. This approach might have had particular applicability in resource-poor settings where access to therapy is limited by the cost of antiretroviral agents. Failure The Strategies for the Management of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) trial was intended to provide good information on whether this approach worked for HIV+ people. The double-blind controlled study began in 2002 and enrolled 5,472 participants in 33 countries. Unfortunately for proponents of SIT, the study had to be stopped in 2006 because of the excessive number of \\"interrupted\\" patients who died or got much sicker. People on the SIT protocol were more than twice as likely to die during the study than people who took HAART drugs continuously.

Sometimes this may occur when a plant or animal species is introduced, for example, to an island or to a new territory or environment other than its native habitat. When this happens, the new arrivals may find themselves suddenly free from the competitors, diseases, or predatory species, etc. in their previous environment, allowing their population numbers to increase beyond their previous limitations. Another common example of ecological release can occur if a disease or a competitor or a keystone species, such as a top predator, is removed from a community or ecosystem. Classical examples of this latter dynamics include population explosions of sea urchins in California's offshore kelp beds, for example, when human hunters began to kill too many sea otters, and/or sudden population explosions of jackrabbits if hunters or ranchers kill too many coyotes. The foreign species either flourishes into a local population or dies out. Not all released species will become invasive; most released species that don't immediately die out tend to find a small niche in the local ecosystem. Ecological release also occurs when a species expands its niche within its own habitat or into a new habitat.Cox, G.W. and R.E. Ricklefs (1977). Species diversity and ecological release in Caribbean land bird faunas. Oikos 28: 113-122. Origin The term ecological release first appeared in the scientific literature in 1972 in the American Zoologist journal discussing the effects of the introduction of a sea snail on an isolated ecosystem, Easter Island.Kohn, A.J. (1972). Conus-miliaris at Easter Island ‚Äì ecological release of diet and habitat in an isolated population. American Zoologist 12: 712. One of the first studies that linked niche shifts to the presence and absence of competitors was by Lack and SouthernLack, D., and H. N. Southern (1949). Birds on Tenerife. Ibis 91: 607-26. where habitat broadness of song birds was positively correlated to the absence of a related species. Common example Invasive species are an excellent example of successful ecological release because low levels of biodiversity, an abundance of resources, and particular life history traits allow their numbers to increase dramatically. Additionally, there are few predators for these species. Causes and mechanisms =Cascade effect= When a keystone species, such as a top predator, is removed from a community or ecosystem, a cascade effect can occur through which a series of secondary extinctions take place. Keystone predators are responsible for the control of prey densities, and their removal can result in an increase in one or a number of predators, consumers, or competitors elsewhere in the food web.Paine, R.T. (1966). Food web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist 100: 65-75. Several prey or competitor species can consequently suffer a population decline and potentially be extirpated; the result of this would be a decrease in community diversity. Without the keystone species, prey populations can grow indefinitely and will, ultimately, be limited by resources such as food and shelter. Due to these secondary extinctions, a niche is left unfilled: this allows a new species to invade and exploit the resources that are no longer being used by other species. Human causes ecological release Ecological release by human means, intentional or unintentional, has had drastic effects on ecosystems worldwide. The most extreme examples of invasive species include: cane toads in Australia, kudzu in the Southeast United States, or beavers in Tierra Del Fuego. But ecological release can also be more subtle, less drastic and easily overlooked such as mustangs and dandelions in North America, musk oxen in Svalbard, dromedaries in Australia, or peaches in Georgia References Category:Biogeography Category:Behavioral ecology ","title":"Ecological release"},{"id":"10591006","text":"VIPeR is a military robot developed by the Israeli company Elbit Systems and intended for use in warfare. It was unveiled in March, 2007.  Testing  Elbit Systems of America showed the world capabilities of Elbit Systems' unique VIPeR Robot at the Ground Robotics Obstacle Course during the recent Modern Day Marine Conference held in Quantico, VA. This course will test the limits and capabilities of robots on the field of battle. The obstacle course included areas with different surfaces - deep sand, small gravel, brush and debris, even speed bumps. Each of the robots had to traverse each of these types of ground as well as mounting stairs and negotiating a tunnel. The VIPeR was one of eight in this test, and was one of the most efficient throughout.  Features  For mobility, the VIPeR uses a pair of combined wheel/track systems (called the \\"Galileo Wheel\\" system, a patented technology by Galileo Mobility Instrument of Israel) that change shape to adapt to terrain, and a \\"tail\\" which give it the balance to go up stairs, and turn itself over. It can also move around in city environments. Undeterred by stairs, rubble, dark alleys, caves or narrow tunnels, VIPeR is a highly effective partner for dismounted soldiers, keeping them out of harm's way by detecting IEDs and booby traps and warning them of enemies and dangers ahead. Another feature of this robot is its ability to be packed small, it is a robot that can be carried by one man, in a backpack, including all of its gear. Elbit had made VIPeR to weigh only around 11 kg. The intelligent, small-signature VIPeR can also be configured with weapons capability. The system is remotely controlled via a control harness and helmet mounted display. Optional payloads include: P&T;, FLIR, observation day/night zoom camera, explosives sniffer, disrupter, 9 mm mini-Uzi with scope and pointer, grenade releaser, 4-foot robotic arm, gripper, in-building mapping and more. Current plans call for the VIPeR to be used by special forces units and regular infantry for situations that are deemed especially dangerous to human soldiers, such as exploring caves and tunnels. The robot is remote-controlled, rather than being an autonomous robot.

History Its history began on 1841 with individual observation conducted by Dr. Onnen, the head of hospital in Bogor, and was established as a formal government institution on 1866 by the Dutch East Indies government by the name of Magnetisch en Meteorologisch Observatorium. The agency name changed several times and its current name was given on 6 September 2008. BMG becomes BMKG Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Since 1986 the BMKG, has run a Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre (TCWC), within their headquarters in Jakarta. Over the next 12 seasons, the TCWC named and issued international warnings for the area from the Equator to 10¬∞S between 90¬∞E and 125¬∞E. In 1998, the World Meteorological Organization‚Äôs RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee recommended that TCWC Perth, in Australia take over warning responsibility on an interim basis until the BMKG's staff had the training to run the TCWC. TCWC Perth then took over the warning and naming responsibilities until the 2007‚Äì08 season when they handed it back to TCWC Jakarta. The first depression to be named by TCWC Jakarta came later that year when Cyclone Durga became a Tropical Cyclone within their area of responsibility. During the next two seasons TCWC Jakarta, monitored several tropical cyclones in the North Western Pacific Ocean and the Australian region. At the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season, TCWC Jakarta's area of responsibility was then extended out to include the region from the Equator to 10¬∞S between 125¬∞E and 141¬∞E.

It is owned by the Hungarian B√°nffy family (of which Mikl√≥s B√°nffy was a member). The current owner is Katalin B√°nffy.  History  In 1387, the Bon»õida estate came into the possession of the Hungarian B√°nffy of Losonc family, when Sigismund of Luxemburg donated it to D√©nes, son of Tam√°s Losonci. The present castle was preceded by a manor house, whose history dates back to the 15th-16th centuries. After 1640, the estate was inherited by D√©nes B√°nffy (II) (1638‚Äì1674), county governor of Doboka and Kolozs counties, brother-in- law and counselor of Prince Michael I Apafi, who fortified the initial building between 1668 and 1674 by surrounding it with curtain walls that formed a rectangular enclosure, reinforced at the corners with massive circular towers. The castle could be accessed through a seven-storey high gatehouse located on the fortification's eastern side. The works were continued after his death by his successor, Gy√∂rgy B√°nffy (III). This Renaissance ensemble was involved, between 1704 and 1711, in R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence, needing repairs and restorations at the beginning of the 18th century. In the 18th century the estate was inherited by D√©nes B√°nffy (IV), who, after a time spent in the Viennese Court of Empress Maria Theresa, returned home in 1747 and started a reconstruction of the castle in Austrian Baroque style. Between 1747 and 1751 a Cour d'honneur in U shape was built to the eastern side of the Renaissance building, which contained: the riding school, the stable, the carriage rooms and servants' quarters. An important achievement was the castle's park near the Some»ô (Szamos) River, with walkways, statues and fountains. In the integrative concept specific to Baroque art, the residence and the environment were in a relationship of close interdependence and mutual influence. Based on this concept, the park of 70 ha was set up after the design of architect Johann Christian Erras, which transposed into this space forms dominated by a strict geometry. The sculptor Johann Nachtigall made grandiose stone statues inspired by the ancient poet Ovid.Plan of the castle J√≥zsef B√°nffy, the descendant of D√©nes B√°nffy, decided the demolition of the gate tower in the 1820s, uniting the Renaissance courtyard with the Baroque one, and from the resulting stone a water mill was built for the villagers in Bon»õida. In 1850 building's western wing was modified under the direction of architect Anton Kagerbauer (1814‚Äì1872), following the park's landscaping after the English Romanticism model. In 1944, the castle was transformed into a field hospital. German troops plundered and devastated the castle, as retaliation against political attitude of its owner, count Mikl√≥s B√°nffy, which has initiated negotiations between the governments of Romania and Hungary for the return of weapons against Germany. Thus, the furniture, the library and the gallery of paintings were destroyed. During the communist regime, whole building was used as a driving school, cooperative farm and hospital for children. In 1963, B√°nffy Castle was used as decor for filming PƒÉdurea sp√¢nzura»õilor, directed by Liviu Ciulei. The film comprised a short scene with fire, thus scenographers lit one of the buildings, causing massive damage to the building. In 1990, the castle was declared a historic monument. Since 2013 the castle has been the venue for an annual music festival called Electric Castle, held each July.  Restoration  In 1999, due to its ruinous state, the castle was included, at the request of the Transylvania Trust, in the World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites. Also in 1999, a bilateral State Agreement was signed between Romania and Hungary for the restoration and rehabilitation works. In the following period, with Romanian state funds, about 2/3 of the main building's roof was reconstructed. In 2003, the Transylvania Trust signed with the authorities a long-term lease agreement for the castle, resigned with Katalin B√°nffy in 2008 (who was given back the building in the meantime) for the duration of 49 years.Heged√ºs Csilla, David Baxter, Furu √Årp√°d (eds). The B√°nffy Castle in Bon»õida. Past, Present, Future. Cluj-Napoca: Gloria Publisher, 2012, p. 12. In 2001, the Built Heritage Conservation Training Program was implemented, the kitchen buildings being the first one to be restored under its banner. In 2005, The Built Heritage Conservation Training Centre was officially opened at B√°nffy Castle, which functions to this day, teaching traditional building crafts skills for the restoration, repair and maintenance of historic buildings and which was awarded, in 2008, the Europa Nostra prize in Cultural Heritage for education, training and awareness training. The program is supported by Charles, Prince of Wales, who visited the castle. The patron of the training centre is Princess Margareta of Romania.
