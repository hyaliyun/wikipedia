It addresses the growing epidemic of obesity. and its effect on the health of Georgia citizens. Georgians' increasingly sedentary lifestyles and disconnection from nature are resulting in alarming health declines and a diminishing conservation ethic. Get Outdoors Georgia encourages citizens to take advantage of the state's diverse natural resources to get fit, lead healthier lives, bond with their families and curb the obesity epidemic. Program History The GO Georgia initiative evolved out of the state's five-year recreation research and planning effort, the 2008 – 2013 Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP). The plan identifies health, fitness and livability of Georgia communities as a primary priority. Get Outdoors Georgia launched in July 2014 when Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue announced the GO Georgia program at a press conference at Skidaway Island State Park in Savannah and declared by proclamation that June is \\"Georgia Great Outdoors Month.\\" He noted that almost every Georgia resident lives within an hour's drive of one of the 63 Georgia state parks or historic sites. Activities such as biking, hiking and paddling clubs; specific healthy events and recreational activities throughout the state park system; the addition of a GO Georgia badge to the Junior Ranger Program; and a Library Loan ParkPass Program to make admission to state parks and historic sites accessible through local public libraries are major components of GO Georgia. In addition, a fun- loving gopher mascot2 encourages people to \\"go for\\" a walk, a hike or a day in the park. Online Support Program The program's websitegetoutdoorsgeorgia.org was designed as a primary tool to encourage Georgians to participate in the Get Outdoors Georgia program by allowing them to search by activities that appeal to them. This functionality, which incorporates Google Maps, works in tandem with landing pages that target activity clusters with specific passions, such as camping, hiking, mountain biking, family vacation ideas and more. The result is effectively increasing the likelihood that a visit to the site will lead to a visit to the park and ultimately to a positive impact on health. The Epidemic of Obesity In 2000, the Office of the Surgeon General reported that obesity costs the nation approximately 117 billion dollars a year. 61% of adults in the United States were overweight or obese (body mass index greater than 25). 300,000 deaths each year in the United States are attributed to obesity. The State of Georgia ranks 14th in adult obesity and 12th in the number of overweight children. GA SCORP Survey Data Separate surveys conducted in January 2007 and 2008 as part of Georgia's Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan identified both problems and opportunities. * Over 1.8 million Georgians are severely overweight. This costs Georgia $2.1 billion in medical costs each year. * Children are most at risk, with structured lives, fewer opportunities to play outdoors and less physical activity. * As outdoor recreation opportunities shrink, the waistlines of Georgia's children continue to expand. * Georgians overwhelmingly support public outdoor recreation in the state of Georgia with 88% indicating that they think public funds should be spent on creating outdoor recreation opportunities in Georgia.

When the Golden Age Starman (Ted Knight) is kidnapped by neo- Nazi skinheads whilst giving a lecture on alternative energy sources, Batman and Hellboy team up to rescue him. The duo eventually track the group calling itself the Knights of October to a deserted airfield, but in the ensuing battle their leader Dantz escaped with the prisoner on board a small plane.

The site includes the main concentration camp at Auschwitz I and the remains of the concentration and extermination camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau. Both were developed and run by Nazi Germany during its occupation of Poland in 1939–1945. The Polish government has preserved the site as a research centre and in memory of the 1.1 million people who died there, including 960,000 Jews, during World War II and the Holocaust.For the figures, see It became a World Heritage Site in 1979. Piotr Cywiński is the museum's director.  Overview  The museum was created in April 1946 by Tadeusz Wąsowicz and other former Auschwitz prisoners, acting under the direction of Poland's Ministry of Culture and Art. It was formally founded on 2 July 1947 by an act of the Polish parliament. The site consists of 20 hectares in Auschwitz I and 171 hectares in Auschwitz II, which lies about three kilometres from the main camp. Over 25 million people have visited the museum. From 1955 to 1990, the museum was directed by one of its founders and former inmates, Kazimierz Smoleń.www.jewish-guide.pl Bio note on Kazimierz Smoleń In 2019, 2,320,000 people visited the site, including visitors from Poland (at least 396,000), United Kingdom (200,000), United States (120,000), Italy (104,000), Germany (73,000), Spain (70,000), France (67,000), Israel (59,000), Ireland (42,000), and Sweden (40,000).  History  Gate in Auschwitz II-Birkenau The first exhibition in the barracks opened in 1947. In Stalinist Poland, on the seventh anniversary of the first deportation of Polish captives to Auschwitz, the exhibition was revised with the assistance of former inmates. The exhibition was influenced by the Cold War and next to pictures of Jewish ghettos, photos of slums in the US were presented. After Stalin's death, a new exhibition was planned in 1955. In 1959, every nation who had victims in Auschwitz received the right to present its own exhibition. However, victims like homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, Sinti and Roma, and Yeniche people did not receive these rights. The state of Israel was also refused the allowance for its own exhibition as the murdered Jews in Auschwitz were not citizens of Israel. In April 1968, the Jewish exhibition, designed by Andrzej Szczypiorski, was opened. A scandal occurred in 1979 when Pope John Paul II held a mass in Birkenau and called the camp a \\"Golgotha of our times\\". In 1962, a prevention zone around the museum in Birkenau (and in 1977, one around the museum in Auschwitz) was established to maintain the historical condition of the camp. These zones were confirmed by the Polish parliament in 1999. In 1967, the first big memorial monument was inaugurated and in the 1990s the first information boards were set up. = National exhibitions = The Auschwitz death wall, where inmates were executed, was located near block 11 in Auschwitz I. Since 1960, the so-called \\"national exhibitions\\" have been located in Auschwitz I. Most of them were renewed from time to time; for example, those of Belgium, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and the former Soviet Union. The German exhibition, which was made by the former GDR, has not been renewed. The first national exhibition of the Soviet Union was opened in 1961 and renewed in 1977 and 1985. In 2003, the Russian organizing committee suggested to present a completely new exhibition. The Soviet part of the museum was closed, but the reopening was delayed as there were differences in the questions of the territorial situation of the Soviet Union between 1939 and 1941. The question of the territories annexed by the USSR during the war, i.e. the Baltic countries, eastern Poland, and Moldova could not be solved. In 1978, Austria opened its own exhibition, presenting itself as a victim of National Socialism. This one-sided view motivated the Austrian political scientist Andreas Maislinger to work in the museum within the Action Reconciliation Service for Peace (ARSP) in 1980/81. Later he founded the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service. The Austrian federal president Rudolf Kirchschläger had advised Maislinger that as a young Austrian he did not need to atone for anything in Auschwitz. Due to this disapproving attitude of the official Austrian representation, the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service could not be launched before September 1992. =Filming= The museum has allowed scenes for four films to be filmed on the site: Pasażerka (1963) by Polish director Andrzej Munk, Landscape After the Battle (1970) by Polish director Andrzej Wajda, and a television miniseries, War and Remembrance (1988), and \\"Denial\\" (2016). Permission was denied to Steven Spielberg for the construction of film sets on the grounds of the museum, for shooting scenes for Schindler's List (1993) onsite. A \\"replica\\" camp entrance was constructed outside the infamous archway for the scene in which the train arrives carrying the women who were saved by Oskar Schindler. =Religious disputes= In 1979, the newly elected Polish Pope John Paul II celebrated mass on the grounds of Auschwitz II to some 500,000 people, and announced that Edith Stein would be beatified. Some Catholics erected a cross near Bunker 2 of Auschwitz II where she had been gassed. A short while later, a Star of David appeared at the site, leading to a proliferation of religious symbols, which were eventually removed. Carmelite nuns opened a convent near Auschwitz I in 1984. After some Jewish groups called for the removal of the convent, representatives of the Catholic Church agreed in 1987. One year later, the Carmelites erected an 8 m (26 ft) tall cross from the 1979 mass near their site, just outside Block 11 and barely visible from within the camp. This led to protests by Jewish groups, who said that mostly Jews were killed at Auschwitz and demanded that religious symbols be kept away from the site. The Catholic Church told the Carmelites to move by 1989, but they stayed on until 1993, leaving the cross behind. In 1998, after further calls to remove the cross, some 300 smaller crosses were erected by local activists near the large one, leading to further protests and heated exchanges. Following an agreement between the Polish Catholic Church and the Polish government, the smaller crosses were removed in 1999, but a large papal one remains.Article on Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum =Liberation-day anniversaries= The 50th anniversary of the liberation ceremony was held in Auschwitz I in 1995. About a thousand ex-prisoners attended it. In 1996, Germany made January 27, the day of the liberation of Auschwitz, the official day for the commemoration of the victims of National Socialism. Countries who have also adopted similar memorial days include Denmark (Auschwitz Day), Italy (Memorial Day), and Poland (Memorial Day for the Victims of Nazism). A commemoration was held for the 70th anniversary of the liberation in 2015. Visiting the museum The larger part of the exhibitions are in the area of the former camp at Auschwitz I. Guided tours take around three hours, but access is possible without guides from 16-18:00 (as of 2019). This part is situated short of 2 km south of the train station at Oświęcim. From there, shuttle buses go to Auschwitz II, originally called KL Auschwitz-Birkenau, situated around 2 km to the north- west of Auschwitz I. As of 2019, trains from Vienna to Kraków, and from Prague to Krakow, stop at Oświęcim, where local trains from Katowice (around every one to two hours) from Krakow end. Local trains take around 100 minutes from Kraków. UNESCO name change The Polish Foreign Ministry has voiced objections to the use of the expression \\"Polish death camp\\" in relation to Auschwitz, in case the phrase suggested that Poland rather than Germany had perpetrated the Holocaust. In June 2007, the United Nations World Heritage Committee changed its own name for the site from \\"Auschwitz Concentration Camp\\" to \\"Auschwitz Birkenau\\", with the subtitle \\"German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940–1945).\\" Recent eventsArbeit macht frei sign theft= Arbeit macht frei at Auschwitz I Early in the morning on 18 December 2009, the Arbeit macht frei (\\"work makes you free\\") sign over the gate of Auschwitz I was stolen. Police found the sign hidden in a forest outside Gdańsk two days later. The theft was organised by a Swedish former neo-Nazi, Anders Högström, who reportedly hoped to use proceeds from the sale of the sign to a collector of Nazi memorabilia, to finance a series of terror attacks aimed at influencing voters in upcoming Swedish parliamentary elections. Högström was convicted in Poland and sentenced to serve two years, eight months in a Swedish prison, and five Polish men who had acted on his behalf served prison time in Poland. Högström and his accomplices badly damaged the sign during the theft, cutting it into three pieces. Conservationists restored the sign to its original condition, and it currently is in storage, awaiting eventual display inside the museum. A replica hangs in its original place. =Iranian visit denied= In February 2006, Poland refused to grant visas to Iranian researchers who were planning to visit Auschwitz.Poland to Bar Iranian Team from Auschwitz, Payvand, February 18, 2006 Polish Foreign Minister Stefan Meller said his country should stop Iran from investigating the scale of the Holocaust, which Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed as a myth. Iran has recently tried to leave the Ahmadinejad rhetoric in the past, but President Rouhani has never refuted his predecessor's idea that the scale of the Holocaust is exaggerated. Holocaust denial is punishable in Poland by a prison sentence of up to three years.Text of the Act (English). =Art purchases= Czechoslovakian Jew Dina Babbitt imprisoned at Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1943–1945 painted a dozen portraits of Romani inmates for the war criminal Dr. Josef Mengele during his medical experiments. Seven of the original 12 studies were discovered after the Holocaust and purchased by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum in 1963 from an Auschwitz survivor. The Museum asked Babbitt to return to Poland in 1973 to identify her work. She did so, but also requested that the Museum allow her to take her paintings home with her. Officials from the Museum led by Rabbi Andrew Baker stated that the portraits belonged to the SS and Mengele, who died in Brazil in 1979. There was an initiative to have the Museum return the portraits in 1999,Referred to Senate committee (8/5/1999), S.CON.RES.54. Bill Summary & Status.

Albrecht Dürer. Johann of Schwarzenberg (December 25, 1463 – October 21, 1528) (also Johann, Freiherr von Schwarzenberg and Hohenlandsberg) was a German moralist and reformer who, as judge of the episcopal court at Bamberg, introduced a new code of evidence which amended the procedure then prevalent in Europe by securing for the accused a more impartial hearing. Life In 1507, at the direction of the Prince-Bishop of Bamberg, Georg Schenk von Limpurg, Schwarzenberg drew up the Halsgerichtsordnung (Procedure for the judgment of capital crimes) of Bamberg (also known as the Bambergensis). It was based on the humanistic school of Roman law, and it was in turn the basis for the Constitutio Criminalis Carolina, drafted in 1530 and ratified in 1532. In 1507, Schwarzenberg was a leader of the knights of Franconia. From 1522 to 1524, he was a member of the Reichsregiment (Imperial regiment), a body formed for the government of the Holy Roman Empire, and in the absence of Charles V even the governor of the Empire. He composed moral and satirical poems and works regarding the Reformation. He also did translations, mainly of Cicero. He was an early adherent and friend of Martin Luther.

Located at 10 South Street, near the intersection with Whitehall Street, it is used for excursion trips and has been used as the ferry terminal to Governors Island since 1956.\\"Architecture\\" on the Battery Maritime Building website The Beaux-Arts building was built from 1906 to 1909 as the Municipal Ferry Pier. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description Whitehall Street Ferry Terminal, 11 South Street, in the 1970s Designed by the firm Walker and Morris, it used a variety of architectural metals, including cast iron, rolled steel, and stamped zinc and copper, and the vaults under the porch roof utilize Guastavino tiles. It is the only Exposition Universelle- style ferry building still operating in Manhattan. Approaching from the water side, the building contains three ferry piers with steel arches. The arches, in turn, are supported by four pilasters with ornate capitals. The entrances to each of the piers can be closed-off by elaborate swinging gates. The steelwork on the remainder of the building contains decorative motifs such as paneled lattice work, raised moldings, and elaborate cross bracings. The building contains a penthouse with five bays of sash windows between six pairs of columns, and a landward-facing balcony with an elaborate railing. The building was originally constructed with a wide central stairway to large upper level waiting room. The upper level had a direct connection to the elevated train station that served it, the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal, and Lower Manhattan. The terminal had three slips: 5, 6, and 7, its lower level serving as a vehicular loading area for wagons and motor vehicles. The Whitehall Terminal was constructed at the same time nearby and appeared as a two slip twin before being drastically rebuilt in 1956. In 1991 the Whitehall Terminal was gutted by fire. It was replaced first with an interim structure and then the current 2005 building. History The structure was built from 1906 to 1909, replacing an earlier building on the site that had operated since 1887. Both the new building and its predecessor was used by ferries traveling to 39th Street in South Brooklyn (now the neighborhood of Sunset Park in Brooklyn), and as such, was named the Municipal Ferry Piers to South Brooklyn. The Brooklyn ferry service shut down on March 15, 1938, and the building was used by various city agencies, including the Department of Marine and Aviation beginning in 1959. In subsequent years, its original multi-colored appearance was replaced by a paint color intended to emulate the copper patina of the Statue of Liberty. View of the ferry slips, numbered 5 through 7 (from left to right) In 1956, the U.S. Army began using the terminal to provide service to Fort Jay, an Army post on Governors Island. Replacing smaller steam-power ferries with two larger new diesel-electric boats, the Army required larger ferry slips and docks, moving their ferry operation from an open ferry slip located at the Barge Office, west of the Staten Island Ferry Terminal to the Battery Maritime Building. When the United States Coast Guard took over Governors Island from the Army in 1966, they continued to use the terminal to provide vehicle and passenger service to the island for its 3,000 residents and 2,000 daily commuters until its departure in 1996. Between 2001 and 2005, in a $36 million renovation, the exterior of the building and its deteriorating wooden piers were restored and its exterior repainted in its original multiple color scheme by Jan Hird Pokorny Architects., p.8-9 Current usage During the summer season, public ferry service to Governors Island operates out of Slip 7 of the building. Ferries are operated by the Trust for Governors Island, an nonprofit agency created in 2003 by the City of New York. The ferry line operates with two vessels, the Lt. Samuel S. Coursen and the Governors 1. Ferry service operates from May to October. NY Waterway also operates rush hour commuter service to Port Liberté out of Slip 5. Other NY Waterway services operate out of the Pier 11/Wall Street landing. In 2009, Dermot Construction won the bid to convert the building into a hotel. After numerous delays, including Hurricane Sandy, the project received a new round of funding in 2018 and a group including Cipriani S.A. hopes to open it as soon as 2020.

The genre was a type of short, satirical musical comedy popular in 18th- century Spain, and later in Cuba and other Spanish colonial countries.

It drew its personages from everyday life and included popular and folk music and dance, and vernacular language. The tonadilla also influenced the development of the zarzuela, the characteristic form of Spanish musical drama or comedy.

It is the sixthcfcc.edu largest community college in the state with nearly 23,000 students taking classes each year. The service area of Cape Fear Community College includes New Hanover and Pender counties with a main campus located in downtown Wilmington and satellite campuses in Castle Hayne, Burgaw, and Surf City. Campuses Downtown Wilmington Campus= It was decided that the institute's new facilities would be located in downtown Wilmington as part of a $58.8 million project to bring new life to the riverfront. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand. In the general election of 1972, the citizens of New Hanover County approved another bond issue for $3,675,000 for the expansion of the college's facilities. This resulted in a seven-story building that provided additional classrooms, shop, and office space, with one floor devoted to the library. In 1982 the New Hanover County Commissioners responded favorably to a request made by the Board of Trustees to purchase and renovate a facility to house second year electronic and instrumentation technologies curricula. The building, located three blocks from the main campus, was renovated to meet the needs of the two curricula at a total cost to the County of $300,000. Computer Engineering Technology was later offered in the same building. In 2013, the college opened the doors of Union Station. =North Campus= In 1998, the college purchased land (145 acres) in the northern part of New Hanover County. The first building on the North Campus, the McKeithan Center, opened in the fall of 2002 and the second building, Applied Technologies, opened in the fall of 2005. In 2008, a partnership between New Hanover County, the City of Wilmington, and Cape Fear Community College resulted in the construction of a $10,500,000 Safety Training Center on a 14-acre site at the North Campus for in-service training of fire, rescue, and law enforcement personnel. The facility includes a seven-story drill tower, a residential burn building, a commercial burn building, a tear gas building, a classroom building, drafting pits for testing pumpers, an open burn pad, and a truck driver training off-road range. In 2009, a 30,000 square-foot building was added at the North Campus with the ground floor of the two-story structure designated for the Wilmington Early College program and the remaining space allotted for Cosmetology, Nail Technology, and Esthetics. In 2017, a multi-building Advanced and Emerging Technologies Center opened at the North Campus. =Alston W. Burke Surf City= In 2009, Mr. Alston Burke, a retired educator, and longtime Pender County resident, donated 25 acres for a campus for the College in Surf City. The appraisal value of the gift exceeded $1.8 million, and CFCC named the campus in honor of Mr. Burke. In 2011, a $2.3 million building was approved by the Board of Trustees for the Alston Burke Campus in Surf City, NC, the first such facilities to be constructed on this new location. The first building at the Alston W. Burke Campus was named after Surf City Mayor A.D. “Zander” Guy. =Burgaw Center= In 1990, Cape Fear Community College opened a satellite center in Burgaw offering curriculum and continuing education courses. History Founded in 1958 as one of the Industrial Education Centers around the state, The Wilmington Industrial Education Center (WEIC) offered courses for high school students during the day and classes for adults at night. The 32,000-square-foot facility included shop areas, classrooms, chemistry labs, physics labs, a library, and a small administrative office. Following the 1963 Community College Act, the WIEC officially transformed into Cape Fear Technical Institute (CFTI). With the strong support of the local industry as well as the Chamber of Commerce Committee of 100 and the Merchant's Association, a $575,000 bond issue was proposed to match federal funds for building new facilities to be used exclusively by the Industrial Center. The first buildings downtown opened in 1967. The new facilities allowed Cape Fear Tech to expand its offerings to include new programs and enroll more students in the programs with high demand. To more clearly reflect its expanded role and mission, the Board of Trustees later recommended that the school again change its name. The New Hanover County Commissioners concurred with the Board, and on January 1, 1988, the institution officially became Cape Fear Community College (CFCC). Throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, CFCC has doubled its academic offerings and its facilities to keep pace with the dramatic growth of the area and the increasing job training needs of employers and new industries moving to the area. With the support of local taxpayers, CFCC opened a new campus in northern New Hanover County in 2002 and is currently expanding in both New Hanover and Pender counties to serve the needs of its citizens and businesses. = Accreditation = In 1969 the college was granted status as a Special Purpose Institute by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The following year the Commission on Colleges granted membership to the College contingent upon successfully completing a self-study within the next five years. This was accomplished and at the Association's meeting in 1975, the college was granted membership status. In December 1986, in 1996, and again in June 2007, the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools reaffirmed its accreditation of Cape Fear Community College. =Scandals= In recent years, in spite of accolades recognizing exceptional faculty, staff, and degree programs, the college has dealt with multiple scandals associated with the Board of Trustees, past college president Ted Spring, and current president Jim Morton. In recent years, nearly all of the scandals are associated with Jim Morton, including the issues surrounding his lack of credentials and allegations that he has created a toxic work environment. Ted Spring was hired in November, 2012. He was asked by the Board of Trustees to resign in 2015 after coming under fire for misuse of public funds. He reportedly attempted to get free housing, free airline upgrades, to get public funds to pay for his wife's travel, engaged in nepotism, and blackmailed subordinates, in spite of making a salary of $268,356 a year. Although there was evidence uncovered by the NC State Auditor of Spring engaging in inappropriate behavior, he was successful in a lawsuit against the CFCC Board of Trustees due to their process in asking him to resign, which Spring successfully argued violated his \\"due process rights\\". Shortly after Spring's resignation, the Board of Trustees hired interim president Amanda Lee, PhD, as college president. She was forced to resign shortly afterwards. Following her resignation, and without an exhaustive search, the Board of Trustees installed interim president Jim Morton as college president. Jim Morton was given the top job in spite of the fact that he had no higher-education experience prior to his hiring to CFCC in 2015. The Board voted in 2018 not to conduct a search for a new college president, with all members of the Board of Trustees voting for Mr. Morton with the exception of Jonathan Barfield, William Turner, and John Melia. In spite of his lack of higher-education experience, and the fact that he is the only community college president in North Carolina who only holds a bachelor's degree, Morton was given a raise over his predecessor and was given control of the college. Immediately after his appointment in 2018, and in the years since, Morton's installment has been contested by faculty, staff, and members of the community. After Mr. Morton took control of the college, he has been criticized for ignoring transfer programs in favor of vocational programs, creating a toxic work environment, engaging in retaliation against employees, having an inappropriate relationship with his executive assistant, paying his executive assistant significantly more than average, hiring friends and loyalists, and engaging in gross mismanagement. Morton was quoted by a high-level employee as saying that \\"Faculty are like line workers in a factory. When one drops dead, you just easily replace them with another.\\". Under Morton's leadership, there has been exceptionally high turnover for experienced faculty and staff. In his response to WECT, President Morton claimed that he had \\"positive relationships with staff and faculty\\". However, two days after the WECT expose about Mr. Morton's mismanagement aired on January 13, reporter Ann McAdams announced on the 6:00 p.m. news that she had been contacted by no less than 26 current and former employees of CFCC, all of whom corroborated events listed in her first report. The chair of the Board of Directors gave WECT a statement, suggesting that employees follow the employee handbook policies to report mismanagement by President Morton. However, the original report revealed that earlier complaints went directly to Mr. Morton, after which he attempted to do handwriting analysis to find the anonymous culprit. In early 2020, the issues at CFCC relating to President Jim Morton were covered by national news outlets. National Review Reporter, George Leef, argued that Morton's administration of CFCC was an example of an“abuse of power”, and that “...[T]he root of the problem seems to be that the Board of Trustees, rather than exerting independent oversight of the president, is in league with him.\\" Investigative Reporter Ann McAdams uncovered a dramatic increase in the fees paid by CFCC to their law firm. When requested by WECT, they repeatedly refused to explain the increase, provide requested itemized bills, or explain why they have started paying their law firm nearly 10 times more than they did before local reporters began investigating multiple allegations against Jim Morton and the Board of Trustees. This lack of transparency has led to speculation that Morton may be using state funds for public relations purposes, which has been found to be an inappropriate use of funds in past court decisions. In response to the scandals, then President of the North Carolina Community Colleges System, Peter Hans, released a statement about CFCC stating the following: \\"I have advised the college to undertake a climate survey of faculty and staff confidentially administered by an independent third-party.\\" In spite of additional concerns, CFCC administration has confirmed that they will not be following the state requests, and will not complete the faculty climate survey recommended by the state in order to identify problems relating to the toxic work environment.

The Cambridge companion to Renaissance philosophy. p. 358. – October 31, 1499, in Vicenza) was an Italian Averroist philosopher, at the University of Padua.Influence of Arabic and Islamic Philosophy on the Latin West Life He studied at Pavia, under Paolo da Pergola in Venice, and with Gaetano da Thiene in Padua, graduating with a doctorate in 1458. His first work was on the unitas intellectus, the theory of Averroes on the unity of the soul and intellect.Schmitt and Skinner, p. 839. In natural philosophy he posed the question of the scope of the subject. Following Averroes, he took “mobile being” as the topic, against the scholastic views of Antonius Andreas and John Canonicus.Edward Craig, ed., Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998), p. 407. Pietro Barozzi, Bishop of Padua, in 1489 issued a decree limiting academic discussion, and Vernia had to withdraw from his position. He wrote against Averroes, in Contra perversam Averrois opinionem, attacking his views on the immortality of the soul and the unity of the intellect.Deno John Geanakoplos, Constantinople and the West: Essays on the Late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman Churches (1989), p. 119. His students included Agostino Nifo and Pietro Pomponazzi. Both Vernia and Nifo changed allegiance from Averroes to the interpretations of Aristotle in certain Greek commentators, one of whom, Themistius, was being translated by Ermolao Barbaro, a colleague at Padua. As time went on, the commentary On the Soul by Alexander of Aphrodisias was translated into Latin, by Girolamo Donato, and a translation of the commentary attributed to Simplicius was also circulated. Vernia's views of the correct interpretation of Aristotle modified in the light of access to these fresh opinions.Anthony Grafton and Nancy Siraisi (editors), Introduction p. 9, in Natural Particulars: Nature and the Disciplines in Renaissance Europe (1999).Edward Craig, Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1998), p. 409.Pietro Pomponazzi NotesReferences *Charles B.

Avaya ACE architecture Avaya ACE is composed of two server elements: the Avaya ACE core server and the Application Integration Engine (AIE). The Avaya ACE server hosts SOAP-based Web services that enable client applications to access core communications capabilities. ACE routes service requests to the underlying network elements that provide those capabilities. The AIE is an optional Avaya ACE component that hosts a number of the Avaya ACE prepackaged applications and provides a central point for administration of those applications. Web services Avaya ACE offers its web service APIs bundled in developer-friendly toolkits for custom application development. Avaya ACE supports standards-based interfaces such as Parlay X that provide developers high-level access to communication capabilities such as audio and video call control, media service control, call notification, and presence. Services such as click-to-call, presence, notification, and call forwarding are modular and platform-neutral so they can be combined, assembled, and sequenced in different ways, without regard to the underlying communications platform. Developers can integrate these services into applications and business process using any platform or programming language. Packaged applications Avaya ACE also provides a set of pre-programmed applications that offer out-of-the-box integration into common business applications such as Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, OCS 2007 R2, Lync 2010, Microsoft Dynamics, SFDC, IBM Business Process Management and IBM Lotus Sametime (either standalone or embedded within Lotus Notes).

The Directive required member states to have put regulations in place by 26 September 2008. Although the UK managed to introduce the single market requirements by that date, they failed to implement the collection and recycling requirements. Following a recent consultation, the government laid the new Regulations before Parliament on 16 April which will come into force on 5 May 2009. Responsibility for the financing of waste battery collection and treatment will be applied to producers from 1 January 2010 whilst retailers will have to offer free take back of portable batteries to consumers from 1 February 2010. The new Regulations have included some significant changes from the consultation. Only those that place more than one tonne per year onto the market will now have to register through Compliance Schemes and be required to finance collection etc. Those below a tonne will now have to register with one of the environmental Agencies for an annual fee of £30 creating a huge disparity between the two classes of producer as the larger ones are likely to have costs that will run into several thousands of pounds. The threshold for retail involvement has also changed, removing a 280m2 minimum floor space requirement but upping the total weight of batteries sold from 16 kg to 32 kg. This means that any retail premises selling more than approximately 24 AA batteries a week will be required to offer in-store take back. The requirements also apply to industrial and automotive batteries, but given the current value of those and their hazardous nature, there is little change to the current commercial processes that already see them all recovered anyway. The Directive requires member states to be collecting 25% of portable batteries by the end of 2012. The UK is believed to be collecting around 4%, so this is not without its challenges. Whether the system being proposed will achieve that remains to be seen, but an increase of these proportions has taken several years longer in other EU countries such as the Netherlands. In summary, for portable batteries, the regulations require the following: * Large portable battery producers will have to register with a batteries compliance scheme by mid October each year, paying an Agency fee of £680 plus a proportion of the scheme's £118k annual registration fee. * Small producers - those who place one tonne or less onto the market - will have to register with one of the Agencies by mid October. * Data from producers for the quantity of portable batteries placed onto the UK market in 2009 must be supplied to the Agencies by 31 January 2010. * For large producers, this will have a collection target applied - 10% in 2010 - which compliance schemes will have to meet on behalf of their members by setting up collection schemes with retailers, local authorities etc. The target for 2011 is 18% and 2012 is 25%, but the 2010 and 2011 targets are not mandatory. * Large producers will have to supply data to their scheme quarterly for onward submission to the Agencies. Small producers will only have to supply data once a year. * All retailers that sell more than 32 kg a year will have to offer in store take back of batteries which schemes will then have to collect and recycle. This equates to approximately 25 AA batteries a week. * Schemes will have to pay £17k to get approved then £118k per year to register their members plus another £680 per year per member * Schemes will have to demonstrate how they intend to communicate the battery recycling message to consumers See also *Battery recycling ReferencesExternal links *Batteries at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) *EC Directive on Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries and Accumulators at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills *ecosurety - Expert batteries compliance support and advice *BatteryBack Information on the UK Battery Regulations Category:Recycling in the United Kingdom Category:Battery recycling Category:Law of the United Kingdom ","title":"Battery regulations in the United Kingdom"},{"id":"21672854","text":"\\"Valentine's Day\\" is a song by Nigerian R&B; singer Faze released as the 7th single from his platinum Originality album.

History The lighthouse is located on the largest island Storön, and is the only lighthouse in Stockholm archipelago with the classic iron design of architect Nils Gustaf von Heidenstam. Before the lighthouse was built there had been a checkered day beacon on the island, it is now located at the island of Storkläppen in Östergötland. Svenska Högarna lighthouse was lit in 1874 with a colza oil lamp. In 1887 a paraffin lamp was installed, in 1966 it was electrified and in 1986 solar cells were put in use to generate power. The island is staffed with a weather station. It is frequently reported as a wind observation station in the Shipping Forecast of the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. Since 1994 the lighthouse is owned by a foundation called \\"Edward Sjöbloms stiftelse\\". All of the islands are a nature reserve with sparse vegetation. On the islands you can also observe two giant's kettles. There is no scheduled traffic to Svenska Högarna. Access is by own boat or taxiboat. The isolated islands are not easy to reach: the weather must be very calm in order to moor boats safely to the rocky shores. Climate Svenska Högarna has an oceanic climate with low diurnal temperature variation, windy and mild conditions. Summer highs are cool, whilst winter lows remain very mild, with some years barely having a meteorological winter. The climate has a significant seasonal lag, with temperature extremes often being two months after maximum and minimum insolation. The climate is relatively dry in terms of rain and snowfall, but retains a high humidity. In spite of its isolated position, the climate has semi-continental characteristics, with significant differences between seasons for such an isolated island.

His short story collection In Other Rooms, Other Wonders, has been translated into sixteen languages, and won The Story Prize, the Commonwealth Writers' Prize and other honors and critical acclaim. Born in Los Angeles, USA, he spent his childhood in Pakistan. At the age of thirteen he moved back to the US, where he received higher education and worked as a journalist, a director, a lawyer, a businessman, before finally devoting his efforts to writing. Life and worksEarly life= Mueenuddin was born in Los Angeles, USA, to a Pakistani father Ghulam Mueenuddin and a second-generation Norwegian-American mother, Barbara. His father was a member of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), and after the independence of Pakistan in 1947 he became Secretary of Pakistan's Establishment Division, which administered the civil service (later he was the country's Chief Election Commissioner). In the late 1950s, Mueenuddin's father was posted for several years to Washington as chief negotiator of the Indus Waters Treaty (1960) between India and Pakistan where he met his future American wife Barbara, a reporter at The Washington Post. After a courtship and marriage they moved to Pakistan in 1960, living first in Rawalpindi and later in Lahore. Keeping with an agreement she had made with her father, a surgeon in Los Angeles who had heard of unsanitary conditions in Pakistani hospitals, his expectant mother flew back to the U.S. and Mueenuddin was born in Los Angeles in April. Two months later mother and child returned to Rawalpindi, Pakistan, then the country's temporary capital. Several years later, the family moved to Lahore, where Mueenuddin attended the Lahore American School. Mueenuddin remembers his youth there as a \\"magical\\" time which included hunting and riding. Mueenuddin and his brother Tamur often visited the US in the summers. At age 13 his parents separated and the two boys moved with their mother back to the US, where Mueenuddin spent five years at prep-school, Groton School in MA, graduating in 1981. Later he graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College. The summer of his graduation he returned to Pakistan where his father, in his 80s was in failing health, and losing control of the prosperous family mango farm to its managers. His father asked him to stay in Pakistan and rescue the farm. Mueenuddin recalled it as a lonely and arduous life, but one well suited to Daniyal, who spent early mornings writing poetry, and evenings reading through the library that his mother had left behind. (Later in life Mueenuddin would thank his mother for teaching him \\"that becoming a writer was a legitimate thing to do.\\" His mother was a Trustee of PEN American Center and died in October 2009.) In 1990 his father died, leaving Mueenuddin more exposed but also more independent. He ran the farm as a business, and not in the traditional feudal way like many of his neighbors, by \\"hiring good managers, paying them well, and demanding a lot of them.\\" Mueenuddin would also later inherit his mother's family farm in Wisconsin. =Family= Mueenuddin is married to Cecilie Brenden Mueenuddin, a Norwegian anthropologist whom he met while on a Fulbright Scholarship in Oslo, Norway. He was previously married to the New York artist and lawyer Rachel Jeanne Harris in 1999. Mueenuddin is the godson of Katherine Anne Porter, who was a friend of his mother.. Pg. 162 Porter died in 1980 and his mother became one of the trustees of the Porter literary estate. Career In 1993, with the farm running fairly smoothly, he decided to spend time in the West again and moved back to the US where he attended Yale Law School for three years, serving as Editor-in-Chief of the Yale Journal of International Law and as Director of the Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic. After graduation he worked briefly at Human Rights Watch and then as a corporate lawyer at the New York firm Debevoise & Plimpton between 1998 and 2001. However he found the life unsatisfying and decided to begin a new career in writing, explaining that: He enrolled in the MFA program (writing) at the University of Arizona at Tucson, where he earned a degree in 2004. His first published story was \\"Our Lady of Paris\\" published in Zoetrope: All-Story in Fall 2006. This gained the attention of a literary agent, Bill Clegg, who then helped him to publish a story in Granta and three stories in The New Yorker.Works by Daniyal Mueenuddin, at The New Yorker Mueenuddin's first collection of stories In Other Rooms, Other Wonders was published in February 2009 (four new stories, plus the four previously published). Mueenuddin's writing is influenced by Anton Chekov, \\"I like the Russians, like everyone else. I am constantly reading Chekov. I am never not reading Chekov.\\" Awards Mueenuddin was the winner of the 2010 Rosenthal Family Foundation Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In Other Rooms, Other Wonders was the winner of The Story Prize for 2009, and the 2010 Commonwealth Writers' Prize (Best First Book, Europe and South Asia). The collection was also one of four finalists for the 2009 National Book Awards, one of three finalists for the 2010 Pulitzer Prize, and was a finalist for the 2010 Los Angeles Times First Fiction Award, and the 2010 Ondaatje Prize.

The traditional mountain architecture of Cantabria, even with its differing local varieties, is a cultural heritage that has been preserved over time.

History Founded in 1978, Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences was approved by Central Government top leaders in the form of Executive Order. Different from other graduate schools run by university or college, Graduate School of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences functions directly under the highest academic authority of Chinese social sciences research — the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) — one of the largest state-run research organizations serving as the most important think tank set up to provide policy-making suggestions in social, national and international domains. Originally, the purpose of GSCASS was to construct a Prospect Research Faculty Incubator — as its founding spirit may suggest — instrumental in providing qualified first-class research backups to aid the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. After 30 years’ development, however, the Graduate School has now established its prestigious achievement in elite education for official and unofficial needs. A high percentage of GSCASS graduates entered the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of Chinese government and research organizations, playing leading roles in academic research, policy-making, and social movement. The establishment of GSCASS made a huge impact on Chinese humanity and social science education at the dawn of the reform and opening Up (also known as the Economic reform in the People's Republic of China).

It has so far grown up with the widest coverage in research and education spanning humanity and social science areas and has defined its leading momentum among all graduate schools in China. By now, the GSCASS was authorized to confer Doctoral and Master research degree in 11 disciplines, 167 sub-disciplines of humanity and social science. Original and independent research is a hallmark of GSCASS. GSCASS is composed of Faculty Committee, Academic Council, Academic Degree Evaluation Committee, six Departments, 38 Schools and over 900 faculty members. Typically, a faculty member has at most one student to advise in three years. This one-to-one system between teacher and student encourages graduate students to be involved in important research programs — usually waged by public. Students are free to embrace more significant experiences combining the theoretical and practical, as well as deeper emotional communication under such an arrangement. In international communication, the GSCASS has established strong academic exchange programs with prestigious graduate schools around the world. Overseas programs for non-Chinese speaking students began running in 1985. The number of degree students from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan kept surging from its first opening in 2000. Compared with other famous graduate schools run by universities, the scale of GSCASS graduates has been very small. Up to June 2008, the Academic Degree Evaluation Committee of GSCASS had conferred 2,574 doctoral degrees, 4,198 master's degrees and 339 professional master's degrees. In recent years, The GSCASS enrolls about 260 Doctoral candidates and 182 Master candidates annually. Students from the mainland of China qualified for application are required to obtain outstanding scores in National Master Entrance Examination or Doctoral Entrance Examination the school holds annually. So far, all GSCASS Master's degree candidates are fully financial aided. Ph.D. candidates, due to the latest policy, however, were covered by fund support in a fixed percentage to encourage top students to compete extra financial aid by outstanding performance in academic research. Campus life The campus was in Wangjing area, northeast of the Beijing city, adjacent to Central Academy of Fine Arts, Beijing Youth Politics College and China Medical University. Small in scale, it was well integrated and fully equipped, exuding a kind of 1980s’ spirit and confidence which is rare today.

It is set in the criminal underworld of Northern England especially Liverpool, Merseyside. Synopsis As a major heist approaches and with betrayal all around him, respected crime boss Ged Brennan has to summon all his street nous and killer instinct as he fights for survival. Plot The film starts off with Gerard (Ged) Brennan and his crew hijacking a truck, only to find the truck is a dummy truck that is empty to ward of hijackers for that very purpose. The next morning, the radio news announces that a \\"business-man\\" named Leo Murphy, aka Leo the Pig, is found naked and killed on a boat out at sea. Even though the truck heist was a dud, Ged still has to pay his crew so that they don't go work for others and take jobs for other competitors; this causes a strain on his marriage with his wife Debbie. Their young son is unaware of what his father does for a living, wanting to go to \\"work\\" with his dad. When Ged goes to drop off his son at a posh, private school, their neighbor, Pamela Thompson, comes over. Pam and Deb do lines of cocaine at the house when Ged leaves; after Ged drops off his son, he drives to a desolated area where there are business people standing around. Pam's husband, Keith Thompson, is trying to get investors for a land deal, and Ged is one of the investors, but he has to front up the money to buy shares of the land; which he does not have all upfront. He gives Keith a down payment to hold a piece of the share for him, telling him that he'll get the rest soon. John Paul, aka Ratter (Kenny Doughty), is pulling up to the crew's bar with his new lackey, Paul the Hom, who has small connections with the drug world. Outside the bar area are a group of wanna-be thugs, with a young kid, Ritchie, as the leader. They do little side jobs for the crews and others, and know bits and pieces of info here and there about the crime world. Ratter is Ged's younger brother; and he and Paul wants to take the crew into a new business venture, drugs. Ratter brought Paul along as a get-up to convince the crew to take over Leo's business turf, especially Ged, who is the crew's boss. When Paul starts talking about how much money they could make, the crew gets interested, but when Ged arrives and Paul and Ratter tries to pitch the sale to Ged, he doesn't buy into it. Ged is old-school when it comes to his crimes, and he won't mix in with the drug business because he knows that drugs is always the most riskiest of crimes; people always get caught or end up dead. Ged won't have anything to do with drugs, and throws Paul out of the bar. He wants to just stick with his truck heists, and he displays his disappointment in Ratter. Ged meets up with Jimmy, the truck driver that was in the dummy truck. Jimmy and Ged are in the business together, with Jimmy providing info to Ged about his truck routes and shipments, and getting a cut in on the deal. Jimmy's truck company is unaware because Ged and his crew always makes the robbery authentic, even knocking out Jimmy and his co-driver. Jimmy tells Ged that there will be three shipments going out soon from his company, the new PlayStations, about 20-30 thousands of them per truck. They decide to let the first two shipments go so that the company won't be alerted, and to rob the third shipment instead, which will be the last shipment. Jimmy gives Ged all the info; routes, times, destination, etc. He also warns Ged that these truck shipments will all have GPS on them, and that they will have about ten minutes to carry out the heist before the company calls it in. Jimmy tells Ged that since this is a huge heist that he's giving to Ged and his crew, that he wants to be square away with him, and that he wants out after this last heist. Ged tells him that if the heist goes good he'll think about it, as Ged, too, wants to get out of the game. At a barbecue that is being hosted by Ged and Debbie at their home, the whole crew is there with their wives and children. Ged tells the crew about the PlayStation job; and also informs the crew that Franner (Francis), is looking for who killed Leo, as well as hosting Leo's funeral. Franner is apparently a big time crime boss, on top of the underworld game, and Leo was one of his big guys in the business. Pam and Keith arrive at the party as well, on the invitation of Deb. Ged is distressed about this, as he doesn't want Keith and Pam, who appears to be legit business people, to mix in with the crew. However, an intoxicated Ratter, upon talking to Keith, finds out about Ged's land investment. This leads to tension, with Keith and his wife leaving the party after only being there for a few minutes. They invite Ged and his wife to a party at their house that they're having next week before they leave. Ratter confronts Ged about his land deal that he has on the side that he's keeping from the crew, and after much taunting, Ged knocks out Ratter. Mobey, a member of the Brennan crew, has his son's communion coming up that he and his wife are preparing for, and that he keeps on annoying the crew with reminders for them to attend. The communion is on the 20th day of the month. Mobey visits a gentlemen's club frequently, that is owned by a Serbian criminal that is in the drug business, Lepi. Mobey has an outstanding tab at the club for 900 pounds, and Lepi's man, Dusan, brings it up to Mobey's attention. Ratter and Paul are also in the club, because they want to land a deal with Lepi to take over Leo's business; which Lepi was Leo's biggest customer. Instead of the supplier dealing directly with the customer, they want to be the middle-man, which was what Leo was. However, they need Lepi to front up the money for them to buy the drugs from the supplier, which is the \\"Irishman\\", Dermot. Ratter tries to get a business trade for the front-money by telling Lepi about the PlayStation job; but when Lepi finds out that his brother, Ged, isn't okay with the drug deal, Lepi doesn't want to do business. However, even without Lepi in on it, Ratter is sure that he can get him on board later on, and tells Paul to set up a meeting with the Irishman anyway. As Paul and Ratter are leaving, they see Mobey there. Mobey tells the two to forget about the whole drug deal because Ged is against it, and they pretend as if they have. Ratter and Paul drive to a warehouse, where Ratter meets with the Irishman, the drug supplier. He asks Ratter if Franner knows about this, and Ratter reassures him that he will talk to Franner and that he'll get the okay. The Irishman tells Ratter that Leo's business was a big deal to handle, and that if he knows how to work the business then he'll go in on it, but that it's money upfront, and to talk to Franner first. Meanwhile, Franner and his man are going around the area asking Ged and his crew if they know anything about Leo's death, as well as asking Ritchie and his young crew what they know - everyone tells Franner that they are hearing that it's the Serb gang that did it. Franner tells his man to keep an eye on Ritchie; which Ritchie informs Franner about the PlayStation heist coming up, because he gets paid by Franner for info. Mobey gets beat up by Lepi's man, Dusan, at the club over the 900 pound tab that is still outstanding, and Ged gets a call about it when he's at the Thompson's party. Deb is upset over the loyal attention that Ged has to give the crew, and when he leaves to go see Mobey, Deb and Pam go upstairs to the bedroom where they snort lines of coke and then have sex with each other. Deb has a lesbian infatuation with Pam, a mix from the cocaine and the alienation she feels from Ged as the crime business seems to be taking its toll on him. Ged goes to Lepi to square away their two men's beef. Before Ged goes to Lepi's club, Ratter and Paul are there first. They try to make a deal with Lepi again for him to front up the money so that they can get the drugs from the Irishman, the supplier. In return for the upfront money, Ratter tells Lepi that he will give him what he wants - Ged Brennan and his crew. Just then, Dusan tells him that Ged is outside and wants to see him. Paul starts flipping out, worrying that Ged is on to them, and keeps on trying to find a back door exit because Ged is outside the front door. Ratter keeps trying to calm Paul down, who is getting hysterical. Outside, Ged tells Lepi that it ends two ways, either they have an all out war with their crews, or their men go at it one-on-one. Lepi agrees that their men go at it one on one, and they arrange to meet at 8 o'clock in the morning the next day. After Ged leaves, Lepi flips out on Dusan for having Mobey beaten up over a 900-pound tab. He also tells Ratter and Paul to get out, that they don't have a deal with him. At the funeral that is being hosted by Franner, Mobey is not allowed to drink at all because of his one-on-one fight in the morning with Dusan. Ged even sends him home early so that he can get rest up, but instead Mobey goes to one of the prostitutes that he frequently visits for one of his many fetishes. At the funeral reception, Franner makes it clear that he will find out who killed Leo and that he will avenge his death. Ratter asks Franner for his approval to take over Leo's business, which Franner gives him the okay for; despite asking him if Ged was in also, and Ratter telling him no. Ged sees Franner and Ratter talking and becomes suspicious and weary of the both of them. Ged picks up Mobey in the morning and they drive out to a dock, where they wait for Lepi and Dusan to show up. Ged asks Mobey if he ever wanted to do anything else, and Mobey confides in him that he wanted to open a pet shop at one time, but that as time went on he gave up that idea. Ged tells him that he's getting out of the business, that the PlayStation is his last job, and then he's getting out. Lepi and his man show up, and then Mobey and Dusan fight their one-on- one, with Mobey winning. After Lepi's man is beaten, with the deal being that the tension is \\"over\\" between the two crews after their men fight it out; Lepi calls Ratter to tell him that he'll accept his offer and front him the money. During Mobey and Dusan's fight, Pam and Keith are at Ged's house. Keith tells Deb that it's the last day for the land investment, and that all of the investors have to have the money in by noon. Deb tries to call Ged, who does not answer his phone because of the fight going on, so instead Deb gives Keith all of their money that they have in the house, which was 108,000 pounds. Deb and Pam goes upstairs to celebrate the deal by having sex and doing lines of coke again. Ged comes home and sees that the safe is empty and wakes up an intoxicated Deb. He is suspicious, and drives over to the Thompson's house, where the whole house is emptied except for a bottle of champagne. Deb and Ged realizes that they were scammed, and that the Thompson's were planning it for months, a wife and husband team that shafted them; clearly something that they are professionals in. Ged tells Jimmy that he needs to move up the heist and that he's going to take one of the early truck shipments of PlayStations instead of the third one. He moved the date up to the 20th, which is Mobey's son's communion date. Ged gathers his men together to tell them about the new date, and apologizes to Ratter about what happened at the barbecue. He then gets a phone call from Franner to meet him. He meets up with Franner and two of his men in the woods, and they are beating Ritchie, who is nailed to a tree trunk by his hands. Ged is clearly bothered by it, and tells the men to let Ritchie go. Franner tells Ritchie to tell Ged what he told him, which was that Ratter had him (Ritchie) kill Leo. Ged doesn't believe it, and points his gun at Ritchie and then at Franner; which Franner and his men have their guns aimed at Ged as well. Ged is distraught because he knows that Ratter will be killed, and he tells Franner that he saw him give Ratter the nod at the funeral reception, that he gave Ratter the okay; which Franner replies that he gave him the okay for the business, not to kill Leo. Franner then asks Ged if he's his brother's keeper, which Ged remorsely says no. Franner tells Ged not to do the heist, that the Serbs will be involved as well, and that it will be a whole big mess. Ged confides to Franner that he has to do the job because he was scammed out of all his money on the \\"land deal\\", that he had checked up on Keith and Pamela, and they seemed legit; and he felt that he was losing his touch. Franner asks him who scammed him, and Ged tells him that it was a husband and wife team, and the guy went by the name of Keith Thompson. Franner tells Ged again not to do the job, and then leaves him there with Ritchie, for Ged to kill him. Ged is distraught over having to kill Ritchie, especially since Ritchie keeps pleading with him, telling him that he's just a young kid; but Ged has to kill him because he was the one that killed Leo, and Franner is going to kill Ratter. On the 20th, Ged and his men wait for Jimmy's truck, which is a last minute change for the crew. Everyone is there except for Ratter, and Ged tells one of his guys, George, that Ratter isn't coming. In flashbacks, it shows Ged and Jimmy planning out the heist, and Jimmy telling Ged that the truck company will be sending out dummy trucks as well. Ged tells Jimmy that he wants all the info on the dummy trucks as well as the shipment trucks. When his crew sees Jimmy's truck, they hijack it, beating up the co- driver, and knocking out Jimmy after they open the trailer, which is loaded with PlayStations, to the relief of Ged. Ratter and Paul go to meet Franner and the Irishman. When they are all standing before each other, Franner confronts Ratter about Leo's death, which Paul panics and runs, but the Irishman shoots him dead with a sniper rifle, and then Franner shoots Ratter in the head at close range with a pistol. Meanwhile, Franner's men and Lepi and his men are trying to hijack the same truck, which they think is the PlayStation job as they only knew the details from the original information that Ged gave to his crew; which Ratter gave to Lepi, and Ritchie told to Franner, but it turns out to be one of the dummy trucks instead. Franner's men kills all of the Serbian crew, including Lepi, and then Franner's man calls him to tell him that the truck was a dummy. Franner meets Ged at Mobey's son's communion party, where Franner gives Ged a piece of paper and tells him to take care of himself, knowing that Ged wanted out. The piece of paper is information to the location of \\"Keith and Pamela\\". The movie ends with Keith and Pam at a house, in a swimming pool, and Ged walking down a pathway with a gun heading towards the house - presumably to kill them.

Plot  The film begins with the final scene of The Vicomte of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later, an 1847-1850 novel by Alexander Dumas. The musketeers Aramis and Porthos are killed in a fight against royal guardsmen. After sensing their deaths, Athos commits suicide by poisoning himself in his own estate. While serving in the Franco-Dutch War as commander of the royal troops, d'Artagnan eventually becomes a Marshal of France as it was predicted by Athos at the Siege of La Rochelle, but is killed by a cannonball at the Siege of Maastricht after barely getting the cherished baton. The friends, who had hitherto been invincible and inseparable, suddenly die in one day. At this point, a total muddle reigns inside France. In the Parliament, fierce debates rage over the stealing from the treasury, for which Cardinal Mazarin, who secretly left France with the royal treasure, is truly responsible. Yet, the Parliament and the people find Queen Anne of Austria, a lover of Mazarin, guilty. As her honor's defenders are no longer alive, the queen feels an urgent need to find new ones. Those are the musketeers' children—Jacqueline the daughter of d'Artagnan, Raul the son of Athos, Henry the son of Aramis, and Angelica the daughter of Porthos. The captain of the Royal Guards, Leon, initially stands against the formed quartet, until he finds out he is the son of Porthos. After the death of Cardinal Mazarin in England, his treasure passes to the Society of Jesus along with the Templar Ring that grants immortality in accordance with the legends. When the young heroes try to take back the wealth belonging to France and its queen, they are taken prisoner, while Raul is killed in an unequal skirmish. The souls of their fathers excitedly and powerlessly observe their children's adventures before a sincere prayer by d'Artagnan returns them to earth, giving a chance to save the descendants and the queen's honor. The sworn enemy of d'Artagnan, the guardsman de Jussac, revives along with them and also seeks the treasure.

She changed her name because of her respect for Nora Greenwald, who used the ringname Molly Holly. Greenwald helped O'Neal in her tryout matches with World Wrestling Entertainment. In late 2004, O'Neal formed a tag team with Krissy Vaine known as Team Blondage. The team wrestled primarily on the North Carolina independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Shimmer Women Athletes and Women's Extreme Wrestling. Team Blondage defeated Cle-ho-patra and Navaho to win the vacant WEW Tag Team Championship on May 8, 2005 at the WEW pay-per-view \\"No Ho's Barred\\".

Ship history Wilfried in the Kiel Canal The ship was built at Nobiskrug shipyard in Rendsburg, Germany and launched on July 26, 1930, under the name Wilfried. Captain Wilhelm Wilckens was her owner and master and he operated from the homeport of Hamburg from 1930 until 1960. The Wilfried had 11 sister ships and belonged to the type \\"Ich verdiene\\" (\\"I earn\\"). In 1960 she was purchased by Captain Andreas Kohler Asmussen of Egersund, Denmark. Asmussen renamed the ship Kajama after his two sons and his wife Kaywe, Jan and Maria. The ship continued to work under sail until the mid-1970s, at which time the Asmussens converted her to a strictly motor- driven vessel. In the spring of 1998 Captain Asmussen suffered a fatal cardiac arrest while at the helm. As he was the only crew on watch at the time the ship went up on a beach near Malmö, Sweden. Drydocking determined that little damage had been suffered. Throughout the years from 1930 until 1998 Kajama traded general cargo. Her voyages went as far south as Bilbao in Northwest Spain, throughout western Europe, and Scandinavia, and above the Arctic Circle in Northern Norway. In January 1999 she was purchased by Great Lakes Schooner Company of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. After preparation for sea she steamed to England, Azores and on to Toronto. Kajama underwent a major overhaul and restoration to her original profile in just over ten months. She is now operating on Lake Ontario, based in Toronto Harbour.

The 300-square-meter mural, painted in acrylics on rough stucco, is located in the lobby of the Casa del Arte of the University of Concepción (Ciudad Universitaria de Concepción), in Concepción, Chile. Its principal theme is the unity and brotherhood of the different Latin American cultures. Description and interpretation A gift from the Mexican government in the 1960s, the famous artist Jorge González Camarena created this remarkable mural recounting the unity between Latin American peoples and cultures throughout the long history of the continent.Short documentary about the Mural \\"Presencia de América Latina\\" livingatlaschile.com, released on January 18, 2014, retrieved on February 18, 2014 =Structure of the mural= The mural is divided into three parts: a flat, central panel measuring 20 by 6 meters, and two sides panels set off at oblique angles to the central part. Each panel measures 7.6 by 6 meters. The mural as a whole is 211.2 m². In addition to this, the mural makes use of a staircase with right angles leading up to a second-story art gallery, increasing the total area to 300 m². =Symbolism= The mural describes the history of Latin America through the use of angular, symbolic images, which emphasize the value of fraternity between the different ethnicities of the Spanish American world. The work is read chronologically from right to left. =Pre-Columbian culture= The sea woman and Tlaloc begin the story of the mural. The Spaniard fighting for conquest. Zontemoc, the twilight of pre-Columbian culture. The right panel represents pre- Columbian America. On the lower part a woman with fish in her hands emerges from the Aztec pantheon, symbolizing the riches of the sea. The woman is accompanied by the green mask of Tlaloc, god of rain. Before her is Quetzalcoatl, the serpent-shaped deity who symbolizes culture and who is depicted coiling around the staircase to the art gallery. On the upper part one can see Zontemoc (\\"The Falling Sun\\"), a god who symbolizes the twilight of pre-Hispanic culture. Completing this first panel of the mural, at the right is a mounted Spanish soldier, wearing armor and carrying a dagger, fighting against an eagle-man armed with a mace, symbolizing the battle of the conquest. =Miscegenation= The central panel begins a bit to the left of the first part with the Spanish soldier and a Native woman, the principal creators of miscegenation. Jorge González called this part The Original Couple (\\"La pareja original\\"), who walk over layers of coal, in which there are imprisoned, sleeping women, symbolizing the riches of the earth: silver, gold, iron and copper. On the surface of this swarm of bodies and precious stones, sprouts a pregnant woman covered with vines, representing the fertility of the earth. From her surge American corn and Old World wheat, nourishment that sustains the bases of industrialization, technology and science, represented as an intricate steel machine on the upper part of the panel. At the center of the panel there are several overlapping faces, which symbolize the fusion of the races: the largest in red, represents the American race. Below these faces a life-sized, naked woman has a map of Latin America on her lap. She constitutes the principal subject matter of the mural. On the woman one can see a capital that symbolizes the Greco-Roman contribution to Latin American culture; and a bit to the left, great blocks of solid rock, which create a great, vertical structure, symbolizing Mesoamerican architecture. =Fraternity= On the left panel of the mural there is a nopal, which merges with the vines of a copihue (the national tree and flower of Mexico and Chile, respectively). The nopal is pierced by daggers, symbolizing the historic mistreatment of Latin Americans, and its roots entwine cadaverous warriors, who nourish the nopal and give it life. At the tail of Quetzalcoatl one can read \\"Pablo Neruda,\\" ending the quote of his poem. All along the top of the mural, the flags of the different Latin American nations wave in sequence. The sequence begins at the right with the flag of Chile and a condor, the national bird, and ends with the flag of Mexico next to an eagle and a serpent, important national symbols of Mexico. The flags are organized from right to left, following the geographical placement of the nations from south to north. Thus the sequence begins with Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia of South America; continues with Haiti, Cuba, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala of Central America and the Caribbean; and ends with Mexico of North America. The only peoples excluded are those who are not sovereign, that is, the French colonies of Clipperton Island, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Martinique, Saint Barthélemy, and Saint Martin--as well as the United States territory of Puerto Rico. The Andes appears in the distant background, and crowning the entire mural are the verses of the Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda: > …There is no beauty like the beauty of America spread out in its hells / in > its mountains of rock and power, in its atavistic and eternal rivers… > (…Y no hay belleza como esta belleza de América extendida en sus infiernos / > en sus cerros de piedra y poderío, en sus ríos atávicos y eternos…) Symbol of the University and Concepción Along with the clock tower of the University of Concepción, the mural Presencia de América Latina is a true symbol of the culture of Concepción. It is frequently visited by foreign and domestic tourists and reproduced in souvenirs, book covers and catalogues, among other products. In 1994 it was depicted on a postage stamp to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the University. It was recognized by the Government of Chile as a National Historic Landmark under Decree Number 147 of 30 April 2009. Also in recognition of its heritage and cultural value to Greater Concepción and the Bío Bío Region, it was one of the cultural artefacts recognised with a plaque in 2009 in celebration of the Bicentennial of Chile in 2010.

Its native habitat receives regular moisture in the form of fog, rain, and streams, with mild temperatures that stay above freezing. The plant was named by botanist John Donnell Smith in 1893 for William Cummings Shannon, who collected it in the wild. The two were apparently serving in the United States military at the same time. Even though it has been grown in Central America for many years, it is relatively new to horticulture in North America. In El Salvador it has been used for treating malaria, and is known as monte amargo, or \\"bitterwood. When grown as a garden plant in most of the U.S., Salvia shannoni needs to be overwintered in a greenhouse to protect it from even the mildest frost. It begins blooming in the summer, and will continue flowering into February inside a greenhouse. The inflorescences are only 2.5–3.5 inches long, appearing short and fat, with only a few flowers blooming at the same time. The flowers are a vibrant violet or lilac, with a small narrow upper lip covered with hairs. The lower lip is much wider and very showy. Large bracts that subtend the flowers add to the stubby appearance of the inflorescence. The calyx is lime-green, and relatively longer than that of other salvias. The 2.5–4.5 inch leaves are obovate with a thick texture. The upper surface is mid-green, turning brown in cold weather, while the underside is whitish with pronounced veins.

Built in the south-western part of the Bishopric of Dorpat, it probably served to control the bishopric's border there. The castle was centred on a rectangular courtyard which was surrounded by wings. The gate, the remains of which are most prominently visible today, was strengthened by a gatehouse that also housed a chapel on its second floor. During the Livonian War, the castle was pillaged by Russian troops. After 1583, when the area came under the influence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as the Duchy of Livonia, it was still in use, this time by local Jesuits. The Jesuits however blew up the castle amid the events that led to the Truce of Altmark and the subsequent incorporation of the area into Swedish Livonia. =Rõngu church= Although the church dates from the late 14th century, only fragments of the original building have survived as the church was devastated during both the Livonian War and the Great Northern War.

Médi@ctions, Institut PANOS Afrique de l’Ouest. 1 April 2003. Independence Both the independence and scope of powers of the CSC has been questioned by domestic and foreign observers. The Committee to Protect Journalists has flatly stated that in 2006 \\"Authorities also used the state-controlled High Council on Communications, known by its French acronym, CSC, to censor the press.\\" As long ago as 1992, journalist groups have called for the press to be governed by press bodies. In 1997, the CSC helped found the \\"Council of the Press\\" (Conseil de presse) as a professional accrediting body. In 2007, the Council created a statue of professional journalism, which the CSC is to use to govern press conduct, and which supeceds a code created by journalist organisations in 1997. Press organisations, such as the Union des journalistes privés nigériens (Ujpn), the Syndicat des agents de l’information (Sainfo) and the Association nigérienne des éditeurs de la presse indépendante (Anepi) criticise the Council as too dependent upon the CSC and the government. Powers The CSC is the only body legally allowed to close media outlets, establish bans on reporting, and license television, radio, and newspaper reporting. It also oversees and disburses government funding for private media, through its \\"press assistance fund\\". It distributes press passes and accredits journalists.Réseau des Journalistes pour les Droits de l’Homme (RJDH-NIGER) . Retrieved 2009-02-23. It functioning under the Third Republic was questioned, due to a perceived lack of resources. Journalists observing the CSC contrasted the vast, if vague scope of the CSC's powers, with its lack of personnel and funding, rendering it \\"unable to exercise its numerous powers\\", and charging that this served the interest of political control of the media. Under the Fifth Republic it further is responsible for creating a professional committee of journalism in Niger, which in turn creates the \\"Charter of Professional Journalists of Niger\\" (Charte des Journalistes professionnels du Niger). This is the code which the CSC then uses to oversee and sanction the professional behaviour of journalists. The CSC is the only government agency with the legal power to close radio stations, and it may do so only after receiving a complaint. Despite this, as recently as 2005 the government have closed radio outlets without recourse to the CSC. In this case, a private radio station publicised protests to tax increases, and although initial police closures were overturned, the CSC ordered the station to refrain from broadcasting political news, sports coverage, or commercials.Niger: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2005.

He founded San Antonio, the first Spanish civilian settlement in Texas. TexasFirst term= Alarcón was first appointed governor of the Spanish provinces of Coahuila and Texas in 1705.Weddle (1967), p. 548. At this time, no Spanish settlements existed in Texas. The last of the original Catholic missions in East Texas had been abandoned in 1699.Weber (1992), p. 155. The French had been establishing settlements west of the Mississippi River, and Spanish authorities feared that the French would expand into Texas. In 1707, the viceroy of New Spain ordered all provincial governors to prevent the entry of foreigners and their goods.Chipman (1992), p. 107. Alarcón proposed that one of the missions along the Rio Grande, Mission San Bernardo, be relocated into Texas, along the Frio River. Nothing came of this idea, and later in 1707 Alarcón authorized an expedition into Texas, primarily to dissuade the Indians in the area from becoming friendly with the French. The Spanish troops reached only as far as the Colorado River (Texas) o río San Marco, but spent some time exploring the area around the San Antonio River; they were much impressed with the land and availability of water.Chipman (1992), p. 110. =Second term= In early 1716, the Spanish government authorized a second attempt to convert the Hasinai tribe of East Texas to Christianity.Chipman (1992), p. 111.Chipman (1992), p. 112. Four missions and a presidio were established. Several of the soldiers assigned to the presidio brought their families with them, marking the first Spanish women recorded to enter Texas.Weber (1992), p. 60. Later that year, Alarcón was re-appointed governor of Coahuila and Texas. He soon received word that the new missions were in dire straits, with extremely low levels of provisions. Their supplies must come from the nearest Spanish settlement, San Juan Bautista, located away.Chipman (1992), p. 113.Chipman (1992), p. 116. Alarcón envisioned creating a way station between the interior provinces and the missions of Texas. He looked first to the headwaters of the San Antonio River, an area the Spanish had mapped in 1707. It was already home to a large community of Coahuiltecans.Weber (1992), p. 163. As Alarcon journeyed to San Juan Bautista, the launching point for an attempt to resupply the missions, he received a letter from Father Olivares, alleging that Frenchman Louis Juchereau de St. Denis had established an illegal trade network along the Rio Grande. On his arrival at San Juan Bautista, Alarcon began an investigation of the allegations.Weddle (1967), p. 552. St. Denis was jailed during the four- month investigation, but Alarcon was unable to find proof that the presidial soldiers had-actively or passively-allowed illegal trade to flourish in the area. St. Denis was released from prison and fled back to Louisiana.Weddle (1967), p. 553. Map of Texas in 1718, during the government of Alarcon By the time the investigation ended, winter had begun, making it impractical for Alarcón to immediately proceed into Texas. On April 9, 1718, Alarcón headed an expedition to found a community in central Texas. He was accompanied by 72 people, including 10 families. They brought with them 548 horses, 6 droves of mules, and other livestock. On their arrival, the group first built a temporary structure to serve as a mission, named San Antonio de Valero, which later gained fame as the Alamo. One mile (two km) north of the mission, Alarcón built a presidio, Presidio San Antonio de Bexar.Chipman (1992), p. 117. Near the presidio, Alarcón chartered a new municipality, called Bejar (now known as San Antonio). Given a status higher than a village (pueblo) but lower than a city (ciudad), San Antonio became the only villa in Texas, and the colonists who settled there relied on farming and ranching to survive. With the new settlement established, Alarcón continued on to re-provision and inspect the East Texas missions.Chipman (1992), p. 118. Besides replenishing mission supplies, Alarcón was tasked with resettling the Indians in villages near the missions,Buckley (1911), p. 2. and wished to investigate whether the Spanish in East Texas were illegally trading with the French at nearby Natchitoches. The missionaries were becoming increasingly desperate as they waited for Alarcón to arrive. They appointed two members, representing both the missionary schools of Querétaro and Zacatecas, to carry a personal appeal to Spanish authorities in Mexico City.Buckley (1911), p. 7. Their missive not only detailed the deprivations they had endured and the perceived slowness of Alarcón's response, but also mentioned their fear that France would soon extend their settlements into Texas.Buckley (1911), p. 8. While visiting the existing missions, Alarcón ordered that a new mission be established for the Nassoni people. Before his orders could be enacted, he received a letter from a French explorer, Bernard de la Harpe.Cox (1906), p. 11. La Harpe had just established a trading post within Nassoni territory (now part of Oklahoma). In a series of letters, Alarcón and la Harpe set out their positions for the boundaries between the territory of the two nations. Alarcón maintained that the area la Harpe had settled was in fact part of Spanish New Mexico, while la Harpe responded that all of Texas should belong to the French. Although la Harpe challenged Alarcón to remove the French trading post, Alarcon made no attempt to do so.Cox (1906), p. 12. In late May 1719, Alarcón and his men began their return trip to the Mexican interior. Between the Brazos River and the Colorado River Alarcón encountered the Rancheria Grande which was the home to Yojuane, Ervipiame, Jumano, Mayeye and several other allied Native American groups. While traveling through the Rancheria Grande Alarcón attempted to set up easy trading with the people of the Rancheria by designating El Cuilón, who he called Juan Rodriguez, a prominent Ervipiame, as the chief of the Rancheria and giving him the baton to designate him as a commander.Juliana Barr, Peace Came in the Form of a Woman: Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007), p. 124-125 While Alarcón and associates were en route, a group of French soldiers took control of the mission of San Miguel de los Adeas from its sole defender, The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.Weber (1992), p. 166-7. The missionaries sent a scathing letter to the viceroy, blaming Alarcón for their difficulties and the French usurpation of their post.Buckley (1911), p. 13. On December 19, 1719, Alarcón was removed from office.Buckley (1911), p. 21.

History The state-owned Residenzgalerie provides a cross- section of painting from the 16th to the 19th centuries. It bears similarities with the extensive painting collection of Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo, which was exhibited during his era (late 18th century) in rooms that are now the Residenzgalerie. After 1800, however, this collection was repeatedly plundered during the French Wars. In the age of the monarchy, many of the works were transferred from Salzburg to Vienna. A new collection was proposed shortly after the First World War by a group of Salzburg artists, and the Residenzgalerie was opened in 1923. Apart from reinstating a permanent collection for Salzburg, the new gallery was also intended to be used by an art academy (never founded), encourage tourism, and provide a cultural attraction to go with the Salzburg Festival.Residenzgalerie Salzburg: History Residenzgalerie website. The centrepiece of the Residenzgalerie is the Czernin Collection. This was first exhibited at the gallery in 1954, initially on loan and then bought outright between 1980 and 1991. Its paintings by 17th- century artists are principally Dutch, but also Italian, Spanish and French. Assembled between 1800 and 1845, the collection's original owner was Count Johann Rudolf Czernin von und zu Chudenitz, who studied law in Salzburg and was related to Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. Also important are a number of works from the collection of Friedrich Karl, Count Schönborn-Buchheim (1674–1746), featuring mostly Dutch and Italian artists of the 17th century, which the gallery acquired on permanent loan in 1956.

Henry Milward and Sons and its employees boast over a quarter of a millennium making needles. History The earliest reference to the Milward family in connection with needle making is a James Milward who was a needle maker on Fish Hill in 1676. Symon Milward created the company of Henry Milward & Sons aka Milward's Needles (Milward's) in 1730 at the age of 40, in Redditch, United Kingdom. It was however, his son Henry who takes credit for the foundation of the company as the company was registered in his name during the first year of his birth.[see Redditch Museum Family tree] From the first half of the 18th century, the name of Henry Milward and Sons became well known as the makers of good quality needles. At one point they were the largest manufacturer of its type in the world, producing knitting needles, surgical needles, and fishing tackle, from a number of factories both in the UK and globally, such as Murcia, Spain. Knitting and surgical needles The manufacture of needles was originally a cottage industry. During the Industrial Revolution the industry prospered and became mechanised. By the late 1800s the company was the largest manufacturer in the whole district. Redditch became the hub of the needle industry in the UK, with trade directories showing that in the Redditch area in 1868/9 there were 117 firms listed as manufacturers in various aspects of needle and fish tackle trades. Small needle businesses amalgamated, often through inter-marriage between the leading needle makers of Redditch. Henry Milward and sons amalgamated with John James, W. Avery & Son, Wm. Bartleet, and thus the \\"Milward empire\\" grew. William Hall of Studley amalgamated with Thos. Harper, Samuel Thomas, H. Wilkes and William Vale among others and formed a group of needle makers known as Amalgamated Needles & Fish Hooks. This resulted in Milwards and the aforementioned group being the 2 largest needle makers in the district. In 1912 John James and Sons merged into Henry Milward and sons and a new board was announced. Members of the board consisted of C.B James as chairman and C.F Milward as deputy chairman, H.T Milward, A.D Bartleet and C.E James. In 1930 two of the great needlemaker giants Milward's of Redditch and Hall's of Studley joined forces under a single holding company, Amalgamated Needles and Fish Hooks Limited, who formed in 1932 a separate manufacturing organisation called The English Needle and Fishing Tackle Co. Ltd (ENTACO). However Milward's needles continued in Redditch until the 1950s, there were satellite factories setup during World War II in Evesham, Bewdley, Kidderminster and Moreton-in-Marsh. The basic needle plant was dispersed between Studley and Redditch during the war and in 1952 Arrow Works was officially opened and were still producing some brands of Milward's needles as were first made and marketed under the name of Henry Milward & Sons. The years of greatest growth both in factory growth and world sales were at the end of the 19th century when the fortunes of the company were in the hands of Charles Frederick and Henry Tomson. Fishing tackle Colonel Henry Milward was a fervent fly angler who decided to mix business with pleasure when he created Milward’s Fishing Tackle Company as part of his centuries-old needle-factory. A dozen workers left needle- and syringe-making to become experts in hooks, flies, devons, spoons and split-cane rods. This remarkable adventure lasted until 1965, when Milward died. Milward, alongside Allcock, Partridge, Wilkins, Lee, Martinez & Bird and J.W. Young was just one of many fishing tackle manufacturers located in Redditch, just south of Birmingham Colonel C.F. Milward Esq Colonel C.F. Milward, Deputy Lieutenant, was born in the United States and returned to England at the age of 5 and in due course he entered the family business, he was responsible for the companies amalgamations prior to 1930, he became the major chairman of the board of the holding company A.N. & F.H. Limited. His father was a justice of the peace. He was elected to the Mastership of the Livery Company, The Worshipful Company of Needle Makers, and was High Sheriff of Worcestershire. He was known as the Colonel. H.T Milward, J.P Esq H.T Milward, justice of the peace, was known as Mr Harry, and was the Colonel's cousin. Harry's father was Colonel Victor Milward, a Member of Parliament. Harry's main interest in the family business was sales and included Russia in his sales trips. In 1930, the board of directors were: Charles F Milward (Chairman of the company), Henry T Milward J.P, G.H. Corbet- Milward, C. Ernest James, Gerald Bartleet, Arthur D. Bartleet, and L. Sidney Milward. When these 2 great figures died, others took over the running of the company, now renamed Needle Industries Limited, but still the name Milward was the major trading company. The next Joint Managing Directors were Basil King OBE and Alderman L. Haines of William Hall and Company, whilst Colonel G.V. Milward DL of Worcestershire, was a director of the company. Colonel Milward became the Managing Director of Milwards Fishing Tackle. He was also responsible for Surgical needles and braided suture manufacture after he returned to the company after he saw active service between 1939-1945. During the term of G.B King's Managing Directorship that Arrow Works in Studley was built, thus creating the business as we knew it to this present day. During this phase, the last of the Milward family was in the business: Ian Newton, grandson of Mr Harry briefly was Sales Manager (Needles) until 1968. Since 1952 the fortunes of the Milward business were in the hands of L.H.Beare and in the 1980s J.A Mackrael was the managing director. The trend of taking over companies continued, taking over Abel Morrall's Aero Needles (1989). Although Milwards owned many companies, each retained their own trade mark and name! Purchase and subsequent sale by Coats In 1973 the entire share capital was purchased by Coats Patons Ltd, now known as Coats PLC. Needle Industries continued until the 1990s when Coats sold it to its management. Coats retained the Milwards brand name for its own use. Following the management buyout of Needle Industries, led by Victor Barley, a new company was registered in 1991 called ENTACO, (an acronym of English Needle & Tackle Company) in the old Victoria Works, adjacent to Needle Industries. Mr Barley was Managing Director of Entaco from 1991-1997. Entaco were involved in a cartel with Prym and Coats at the later end of the 20th century. Purchase by Groves Ltd of Thame in 2016 In 2016 Milwards Needles was purchase by Groves Ltd of Thame, Oxfordshire, a family company started in 1966 by Rodney and Marlene Groves. The products are still sold around the world and in 2020 Milward's Needles celebrated its 290th year of trading.

First mentioned about 1120, for centuries the Prince- Archbishops of Salzburg resided at the Residenz and used the palace to present and represent their political status. Today the Salzburg Residenz palace is a museum and one of the most impressive attractions in the city. History The earliest recorded reference to the bishop's palace was in a document dated around 1120. Construction began under Archbishop Conrad I, when he relocated his residence from St Peter's Abbey to its present site close to Salzburg Cathedral. In the sixteenth century, several changes and additions to the structure were made. The bishop's palace took on its present Renaissance appearance under the auspices of Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau between 1587 and 1612, probably according to plans designed by the Italian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi. In the early seventeenth century, work began on the south wing, which included the addition of the large staircase and the Carabinieri- Saal, a section that connected the palace to the Franciscan Church and a large courtyard. The successors of Wolf Dietrich continued to expand and refine the palace through to the end of the eighteenth century. The Residenzplatz façade as well as the interiors were altered with Baroque elements designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt and paintings by Johann Michael Rottmayr. Throughout the centuries up to the rule of the last prince-archbishop Hieronymus von Colloredo (1772–1803), the palace served as archiepiscopal residence, as well as a place of public gatherings and state affairs, all taking place in a setting that reflected power and grandeur. Upon Salzburg's secularisation in 1803, the Residenz building served as a domicile of the Austrian imperial dynasty, as for Emperor Francis' widow Caroline Augusta of Bavaria, and of the Habsburg-Tuscany branch. After World War I, a plan to assemble an art gallery was proposed by the Residenzmuseum. Planning for the Residenzgalerie was completed in 1922 by the official curator of Salzburg, Eduard Hütte. In 1923, the Residenzgalerie was opened, intended to replace the art collection of the prince-archbishops, which had been lost during the Napoleonic wars in the early nineteenth century. It was also intended to support a planned academy of art, as well as promote tourism. Today, the Residenzgalerie presents notable paintings from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, as well as Austrian paintings from the nineteenth century. Wallistrakt Bildergalerie at the Salzburg Residenz The wing of the Salzburg Residenz called Wallistrakt is a part of its vast complex. It is a composition of various architectural components built during different construction stages. The apartment in the Wallistrakt has not been dealt with as a part of the prince-archiepiscopal residence in literature, due to several re-constructions and changes of proprietors. The so-called Hofbogengebäude that was built during the first constructional stage, starting in 1604, was originally a place of accommodation for the apartment of Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau. It was put up in the medieval Frohnhof, the forecourt of the cathedral, where there was enough space to quickly build a new living unit for the prince archbishop without disturbing the procedures of the Residence or having to redeem civic houses. After the Hofbogengebäude was completed in 1606, the medieval Residence was open to further renovation and modernization. To the north, the Hofbogengebäude was connected directly to the hall called Carabinieri-Saal, the sala grande of the Salzburg Residence. From there, the apartment on the second floor extended southwards to where the prince archbishop´s private chambers were located in the very south of the building. A richly stuccoed staircase led from there to a garden hall, opening towards the garden called „Hofgärtl“ that was located in the west. This giardino segreto was surrounded by a high garden wall. The assignment to the hall as sala terrena, which today is not legible any more. In literature, a connection between the Hofbogengebäude and the Venetian architect Vincenzo Scamozzi is repeatedly established. Scamozzi demonstrably stayed in Salzburg during 1603/1604 to draw up a project for Wolf Dietrich of Raitenau, including a new cathedral as well as the renovation and extension of the episcopal residence. Regardless, the five passages planned for the Hofbogengebäude could unmistakably be put in context with Scarmozzi's draft of the cathedral. However, there must have been a change of plan (or planner) during the building phase between 1604 and 1606, as it shows in the modification of the original sketch of the facade.

These sites get their name Diy-Gid-Biy from the Mafa language, which can be translated as \\"place of chiefly residence.\\" There are 16 of these DGB sites which date back to around the 15th century AD. While knowledge of these sites has existed for some time, only in 2001 archaeologists began to investigate the sites and their cultural heritage in relation to the region.Jean-Marie Datouang Djoussou, Archaeology and cultural heritage in Cameroon: the case of the DGB sites, Antiquity, http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/djoussou327/ Archaeology The site = The Diy-Gid-Biy sites are of varying sizes, with DGB-1 and 2 being the largest. They are spread out over approximately 25 km, although DGB-1 and 2 are only 100 meters apart and are sometimes referred to as the same site. The DGB sites are constructed in a system of terraces and platforms built using a dry stone architecture that doesn't appear in any other sites using local granite and rocks, with stairs and silos being placed throughout. After studying various sections of whole and collapsed walls, archaeologists discovered that the walls were not constructed with shaped square stones, but rather built using stones naturally lying around and carefully fitted together with smaller stones propping up and holding together the walls. Based on research done by archaeologists, the DGB sites were built in several phases by the original builders who created sever layers of terraces and expanded the sites. The sites were then abandoned by the builders, but some were later on modified by the Mafa who filled in some of the areas with rubble and repurposed the bricks for various reasons. The DGB sites have drawn in archaeologists, not only because of their unique structure and build, but because throughout most of the Manda Mountains there appears little evidence of occupation older than two centuries, while the plains below the mountains have presented archaeologists with sites dating back approximately 2,500 years ago. In fact, the DGB sites are the only coherent sites that have been found in the Mandara Mountains dating back so far. Through the use of radiocarbon dating, archaeologists have been able to determine that the majority of the 16 sites were first constructed in the 15th century, although the wide range of dates from the various stages of development had originally made it difficult to figure out the structures beginnings. DGB-1 is a unique anomaly though in that radiocarbon dating places that particular site's origins back farther to around 1250 AD. At this site there has also been evidence that a pre-DGB culture lived at this location before construction was started, but little is truly known about this earlier people.Magnavita, Sonja. Crossroads / Carrefour Sahel: Cultural and technological developments in First Millennium BC/AD West Africa. Journal of African Archaeology Monograph Series, Germany, 2009 = Excavation and discovery= Although knowledge of the sites has existed for many years, true archaeological research only began in 2001 with the excavations of DGB-2 and 8 by Nicholas David. A number of artifacts have been found at the sites, with items such as various ceramics originating from the Mandara Mountain region. Other artifacts that have been found are unfamiliar iron objects, a ground greenstone axe, upper grindstones, quartz hammerstones, and grindstone-mortars. While most of the objects found originate back to a time before the Mafa lived in the region, archaeologists have noted that the ceramics that have been found are barely, if at all, different from modern Mafa pottery. At DGB-1 though, while regional items such as pottery and stone tools were found, other artifacts such as copper and glass items that didn't originate from the area were discovered as well, thus indicating that the people of DGB-1 had contact with peoples of other areas, something that wasn't as evident through previously excavated artifacts. In fact, other archaeological excavations of the Mandara region have presented a lack of artifacts originating from outside the area, with DGB-1 being basically the only site to show evidence of contact with areas beyond the Mandara region. Other artifacts that have been found at DGB-1 include iron spear tips and iron arrow heads found under the floor of the site, as well as an iron hoe and chain. These finds suggest that the inhabitant at one point smelted iron and forged their own tools, although it is unknown when these items were made. The make of the iron artifacts has also been compared to iron items made by the Mafa of today, which bear a likeness to the artifacts, even though the Mafa and the builders of the DGB sites are not one and the same. = Hypothesis of use= Based on the archaeology done around the sites, as well as traditions used by the modern Mafa of the region, experts believe that the DGB sites were constructed as ritual structures relating to rain and water. The DGB sites began to appear around the time that a severe drought was occurring in the region, and so the construction makes sense in regards to ritual practices of the Mafa today who inhabit the region. Archaeologists have also found a large amount of sand and gravel from a local river that had been brought to DGB-2 and 8, possibly as a physical representation of flowing water. Several other suggestions as to the purpose of the DGB sites have also been given, especially in the description of the sites presented in the UNESCO World Heritage tentative list. These purposes include the sites being defensive forts or places of refuge in times of war, places of burial for local chiefs, locations of residence for the elites of the region, and/or market centers or places of trade. While some of these ideas at the moment lack evidence to back them up, the construction of the DGB sites with towers and walls has supported the idea of the locations being defensive structures, while the finding of artifacts that didn't originate from the region has also convinced others that at least DGB-1 may have had a purpose in regards to engaging with foreign peoples. These foreign artifacts have even led some archaeologists, such as Nicholas David, to the hypothesis that at least the DGB-1/2 sites acted as places of interchange with peoples to the north, possibly as a place of trade. = Possible interactions = A number of archaeologists have presented the concept that a great deal of the interactions that occurred with foreign peoples at DGB-1 seem to have happened around the same time that European and Arabic writers noted the rise of Wandala, otherwise known as the Mandara Kingdom. Thus experts believe that some sort of trade occurred between the two peoples, as well as there possibly being a relationship between the creation of the DGB sites and Wandala around the same time. World Heritage Status This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on April 18, 2006 in the Cultural category and remains on the Tentative list today.Les Diy- Gid-Biy du Mont Mandara - UNESCO World Heritage Centre Reasons for presence in the list include: because they provide a link between the past and present history of the Mandara region, they provide a unique archaeological perspective to the area as sites that stand on their own, and they are viewed by different native peoples as sacred ground which brings them closer to the spirits through the construction of many different alters constructed on or around the sites.

Its main theatre (or Großes Haus) seats 650 people and is used for the performance of plays, opera, musical theatre and ballet. Designed by Georg Daniel, the present building was built between 1883 and 1886 after the previous court theatre had been destroyed by fire in 1882. It was inaugurated on 3 October 1886 with a performance of Gluck's Iphigénie en Aulide with Marie Wittich in the title role. The complex also includes the State Museum in Schwerin (Staatliche Museum Schwerin) and a 240-seat concert hall, now used for performances of chamber works. All theatres were closed for the autumn season of 1944, with the staff drafted wherever possible. By German standards, wartime casualties and destruction by bombing in Schwerin were small, in spite of nightly RAF raids and the droning of massive bomber pulks as silver specks on the sky during the day on their way to Berlin. Americans were the first to enter the town in the spring of 1945, handing it over to the British until the Russians arrived. These ordered the immediate reopening of the theatre, taking great interest in light operas and operettas as an art they very much appreciated, but until then out of their reach in most parts of Stalin's Soviet Union. Not familiar with Central European culture, one saw their well-fed ladies wearing night gowns during the invariably full houses as a substitute for an evening dress. In the immediate years to follow, there was a gradual exodus of key staff to the West, where few found equivalent employment. The ensuing vacancies provided new chances for many musicians, who were prepared to stay in East Germany to gain important positions there in their later career.

Established as North American Breweries by New York City investment firm KPS Capital Partners to manage its brewery acquisitions (Genesee Brewing Company, Pyramid, and Magic Hat), the company has been owned by the Costa Rican food and beverages company Florida Ice & Farm Co. (FIFCO) since December 2012. In 2009, the company purchased Labatt USA, including the American rights to its core Labatt products (such as Blue, Blue Light, and Labatt 50) and agreed to brew those brands on Labatt USA's behalf until 2012. This sale was mandated by the U.S. Department of Justice for competitive reasons following InBev's merger with Anheuser-Busch, since Budweiser and Labatt Blue were both among the top brands in upstate New York, despite the latter having less than 1% market share in the U.S. overall. The sale did not include U.S. rights to Labatt products not carrying the Labatt label, such as Kokanee or Alexander Keith's, which are now distributed in the U.S. by Anheuser-Busch. Moreover, the underlying intellectual property (such as the Labatt trademarks) remains the property of the Canadian Labatt firm. In addition, the sale did not affect Labatt's Canadian operations in any way; Anheuser-Busch InBev retains full control of the Labatt brand portfolio within Canada. On April 25, 2017, Labatt USA and Pegula Sports and Entertainment partnered on a project to develop the Pegula owned 79 Perry Street in the Cobblestone district in Buffalo into a mixed-use facility, including a small test brewery called the \\"Labatt House\\", a restaurant called \\"The Draft Room\\", and retail, commercial and residential space. The company relocated its Labatt USA headquarters from Fountain Plaza to the building's second floor in November 2018 and PSE moved its headquarters to the building's third and fourth floor in 2019.

NPP) was a political party in Russia. It was founded in spring 1992, reportedly under guidance of Gennady Burbulis with the aim on consolidating support for the Boris Yeltsin regime among military people (former soldiers and veterans). The party was officially founded in July 1992, Alexander Kotenev and Anatoly Gil became co-chairmen (both were leaders of an Afghan veteran's organization). In 1992/93, the party was joined by 4 people's deputies. The party also joined a number of pro-reform coalitions, like 'Supporters of Reform' and the bloc Democratic Choice of Russia. After Burbulis was sacked from his positions in the government, the party drifted for a time between democratic (pro-reform), moderately nationalist and socialist positions, before fixing its allegiance to president Yeltsin and the executive branch. In September 1993 the party's leaders supported president Yeltsin's decree Nr. 1400 dissolving the Russian Supreme Soviet. It is reported that NPP battalions formed of (private) security service employees took part in blocking the Supreme Soviet building. The party sought to participate of the 1993 Russian legislative election but failed to gather enough signatures to be enabled to present its list. In 1994, Kotenev left the party. The NPP took part in the 1995 Russian legislative election within the list 'For Motherland'. The bloc failed to pass the 5% barrier, winning only 0.28% of votes. The party also contested the 1999 Russian legislative election, this time within the list Unity. The party should not be mistaken for a nationalist organization of the similar name (Народно-патриотическая партия), existing from 2002 to 2007.

She claimed that it happened in Dübendorf in the night of February 9, 2009. The case generated national and international repercussions; the version first provided by Ventura suggested that it was an act of xenophobia. Ventura was injured on February 9, 2009 near a train station, after being allegedly stabbed for about 100 times. She was helped by the police of Zurich. Ventura said she was pregnant with twins, and was immediately hospitalized by doctors at University Hospital Zurich. Among the numerous cuts on her body, the acronym \\"SVP\\" drew some attention, which stands for Schweizerische Volkspartei (Swiss People's Party), a far right Swiss political party that condemns the entry of foreigners in the country. Days before the attack took place, Ventura sent an email to friends and colleagues with ultrasound images of a report on a pregnancy of twins. She sent a notice via email saying that she was pregnant. She enclosed a picture with the title \\"Twins 6 wks\\". The Zurich prosecutor confirmed that she lied about the abuse suffered, and about being pregnant. According to police, Paula Oliveira would self-flagellate, and she may face three years in prison for trying to mislead the authorities. The governor of Pernambuco, Eduardo Campos, regretted what happened and met with family members to help in investigations. Ventura is being monitored by doctors for psychological trauma, and has been in her residence in Dübendorf since February 17, 2009. According to her family, Ventura suffers from Systemic lupus erythematosus, immune disorder that can cause psychiatric disorders. Ventura had a history of inventing things to draw attention to her. On December 16, 2009, she was trialed and convicted to pay a 10,800 swiss franc fine and more 2,500 swiss francs as compensation for the judicial expenses. She was released to leave Switzerland but declared the intention to stay in the country. Nevertheless, her visa expired in March 2010 and she had to return to Brazil.http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2010/03/12/paula- oliveira-condenada-por-mentir-sobre-ataque-neonazista-na-suica-ja-esta-de- volta-pernambuco-916048528.asp ReferencesSources * http://www.swissinfo.ch/por/capa.html?siteSect=109&ty;=st&sid;=10321019 * http://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/sociedad/Brasilena_embarazada_denuncia_ataque_racista_en_Zurich.html?siteSect=601&sid;=10322936&cKey;=1234516760000&ty;=st * http://www.ovimagazine.com/art/4072 * http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7900154.stm Category:2009 in Switzerland Category:Brazilian expatriates in Switzerland Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Dübendorf ","title":"Paula Oliveira case"},{"id":"21673723","text":"Valter Guchua (born 6 June 1975) is a Georgian footballer who plays for FC Baia Zugdidi.

Family and early life Herbert Blakiston was born in Hastings the son of artist, Douglas Yeoman Blakiston (1832–1914) and Sophia Matilda Dent (1826–1912).Person Page 17130 at thePeerage.com His father subsequently became a clergyman and the family moved to the vicarage at East Grinstead. Blackstone was a descendant of Sir Matthew Blakiston, the Lord Mayor of London from 1760–1761; he was the great-grandson of Sir Matthew Blakiston, 2nd Baronet Blakiston. Herbert Blakiston was the eldest of six children, he had two sisters and three brothers. His brother Charles was killed in a firearm accident, at the age of 24, in October 1887. A house surgeon at the Salop Infirmary, Shrewsbury, Charles was accidentally shot in the back while hunting rabbits with a colleague. Another brother, William, accidentally fell under a train at Charing Cross Station on the night of 1 October 1889, and died in hospital some days later. The third brother, John, was a telegraph clerk who was among those killed while defending Mazowe, Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) on 18 June 1896, during the Second Matabele War. Herbert Blakiston's parents and sisters all died within a four-year period, just before World War I. Academic career Blakiston attended Tonbridge School. He also studied at Trinity College, Oxford, gaining a first class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1885. He was ordained and became Fellow, Chaplain, and Lecturer at Trinity College in 1887. He then became Tutor in 1892, Senior Tutor and Junior Bursar in 1898, before being elected President of the College in March 1907. He also served simultaneously as Estates Bursar (1915–38). Blakiston was not the college fellows' first choice for the presidency. Robert Rapier was the preferred candidate but he turned the position down, citing his advancing age as an obstacle.Hopkins (2005), p.336 During World War I, large numbers of Trinity staff and students left to join the armed forces. By 1918, there were just nine undergraduates in residence. Blakiston became Vice-Chancellor of the university in 1917 and did much to improve the university's finances, which had been placed under strain by the war. Although his health was affected by the strain of the additional responsibilities.Hopkins (2005), p.350 He was badly affected by the loss of 155 Trinity men during the war, many known to him personally, and afterwards devoted much effort to a new library that was to be their memorial. He designed the building himself and paid five percent of its cost from his own pocket. Blakiston was later described as being unsociable, snobbish, parsimonious and obsessed with finance. The central character Theodore Fletcher, in Joanna Cannan's 1931 novel High Table, was a thinly disguised, cruel caricature of him.Hopkins (2005), p.338 During his presidency, Blakiston was largely responsible for college admissions and developed a particular notoriety for refusing applications to Trinity from non-white candidates.

A library of randomized nucleotides representing potential transcription factor binding sites (10–20 base pairs), the “prey”, is cloned upstream of HIS3 and URA3, positive and negative selectable markers, respectively. If the transcription factor binds to the randomized region it will recruit RNA polymerase via direct fusion to the α- or ω-subunit and thus activate transcription of the downstream reporter genes. The host E. coli strain being used must lack the bacterial homologues of these biosynthetic genes (HIS3 and URA3 ). The bacterial one-hybrid (B1H) system is a method for identifying the sequence- specific target site of a DNA-binding domain. In this system, a given transcription factor (TF) is expressed as a fusion to a subunit of RNA polymerase. In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences are cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence.  Introduction  Across all living organisms, regulation of gene expression is controlled by interactions between DNA- binding regulatory proteins (transcription factors) and cis-regulatory elements, DNA sequences in or around genes that act as target sites for DNA- binding proteins. By binding to cis-regulatory sequences and to each other, transcription factors fine-tune transcriptional levels by stabilizing/destabilizing binding of RNA polymerase to a gene's promoter. But despite their importance and ubiquity, little is known about where exactly each of these regulatory proteins binds. Literature suggests that nearly 8% of human genes encode transcription factors and the functions and specificities of their interactions remain largely unexplored. We are on the brink of a convergence of high-throughput technologies and genomic theory that is allowing researchers to start mapping these interactions on a genome-wide scale. Only recently has a complete survey of DNA-binding specificities been attempted for a large family of DNA-binding domains. B1H is just one emerging technique among many that is useful for studying protein–DNA interactions.  Method overview  Figure 2: The bacteria one-hybrid system requires two customized plasmids: (a) the “bait” vector (pB1H1 or pB1H2) which expresses the DNA-binding domain as a fusion construct with a subunit (α or ω) of RNA polymerase, and (b) a reporter plasmid (pH3U3) containing selectable markers and a binding-site library, or “prey,” which will potentially interact with the \\"bait.” Transformation of a bacterial host with two different plasmids is required. One is designed to express a DNA-binding protein-of-interest as a fusion construct with a subunit of RNA polymerase (bait). The other plasmid contains a region of randomized sequence representing potential binding sites (prey) which, if bound to by the chimeric fusion product, drives expression of downstream reporter genes. This reporter region facilitates both positive and negative selection by HIS3 and URA3, respectively, which together allow for isolation of the prey containing the true DNA target sequence. HIS3 and URA3 encode proteins required for biosynthesis of histidine and uracil. Using a negative selectable marker is crucial for greatly reducing the incidence of false-positives. Self-activating prey, where the randomized region facilitate reporter expression in the absence of TF binding, are removed by transforming the reporter vector library into bacteria in the absence of bait and assaying for growth on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA). The protein product of URA3 converts 5-FOA into a toxic compound, thereby allowing survival of only those colonies that contain reporter vectors which are not self-activating. Negative selection normally precedes positive selection so that a smaller, purified prey library can be subjected to the more rigorous positive selection process. Upon transformation of the purified prey library with the bait plasmid, positive selection is achieved by growing the host E. coli on minimal medium lacking histidine (NM selective medium) that is usually supplemented with varying concentrations of 3-amino-triazole (3-AT), a competitive inhibitor of HIS3. HIS3 encodes a protein required for histidine biosynthesis and thus only those cells containing bait-prey combinations that activate the reporter genes will be able to grow. Manipulating 3-AT concentrations allows for the characterization of binding stringencies. In this way, researches can gauge how strongly bait binds its prey (correlated with the level of expression of HIS3) and thus determines which nucleotide binding-sites have strong or weak preferences for a given base. In other words, if cells can grow despite a high concentration of 3-AT, bait-prey binding must be of high enough stringency to drive reporter gene expression (HIS3) at a sufficient level to overcome the resulting competitive inhibition. Finally, positive clones are sequenced and examined with preexisting motif- finding tools (ex, MEME, BioProspector).  History of method  The bacteria one-hybrid system has undergone numerous modifications since its inception in 2005. It ultimately arose as a variation of the bacteria two-hybrid system, conceived in 2000, which itself was inspired by the yeast one- and two-hybrid systems. Whereas the two-hybrid versions can assess both protein–protein interaction and protein–DNA interactions, the one-hybrid system specializes in the latter. Meng et al.’s B1H system differs from the two-hybrid version in two key respects. It uses a randomized prey library consisting of many (<2x108) unique potential target sequences and also adds a negative selection step in order to purge this library of self-activating clones. Although these ideas were borrowed from the original yeast one-hybrid system, they had not yet been applied to a bacterial host before 2005. As the technique grew in popularity, researchers amended their protocols to improve the B1H system. Designing the fusion construct (bait) to the omega, rather than the alpha, subunit of RNA polymerase has recently been favoured in order to improve the chimera’s stereochemistry and dynamic range. A zinc-finger domain on the fusion construct and its corresponding DNA target site, adjacent to the randomized prey sequence, has also been added to the increases affinity and specificity of protein–DNA interactions. This increased overall binding affinity allows for the characterization of even those DNA-binding domain proteins which interact weakly with a target sequence. Figure 3: Overview of the B1H negative and the positive selection procedure. The DNA segment labeled 'RR' refers to the randomized region on prey vectors. Self-activating sequences are purged from the original binding-site library by attempting to grow prey-transformed E.coli on medium containing 5-FOA, a compound that is cleaved into a toxin by URA3. The resulting purified prey library is then transformed with the bait plasmid and grown on minimal medium lacking histidine in order to positively select for actively expressed reporter vectors. This medium is supplemented with varying concentrations of 3-AT, a competitive inhibitor of HIS3, to elucidate the binding affinities of the transcription factor to each particular target sequence. The randomized regions from surviving colonies are then isolated and sequenced prior to motif-finding analysis (ex, MEME, BioProspector). Finally, optimal and tolerated bases at the key binding-site positions are generated.  Advantages  The B1H system has significant advantages over other methods that investigate protein–DNA interactions. Microarray-based readout of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) for high-throughput binding-site determination relies on specific antibodies which may not always be available. Methods that rely on protein-binding microarrays also require additional protein purification steps that are not required in the B1H system. Furthermore, these microarray-based techniques are often prohibitive in terms of requiring special facilities and expertise to analyze the resulting data. SELEX, another system commonly used to identify the target nucleic acids for DNA-binding proteins, requires multiple rounds of selection. In contrast, the bacterial one-hybrid system requires just one round of in vitro selection and also offers a low-tech alternative to microarray-based technologies. Antibodies are not required for studying the interactions of DNA-binding proteins in the B1H system. A further advantage is that the B1H system works not only for monomeric proteins but also for proteins that bind DNA as complexes. The B1H system should be considered a specialized technique for studying DNA-protein interactions whereas the two-hybrid variations (B2H and Y2H) can assess both protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions. These two-hybrid systems are multi-purpose but are limited in terms of assaying only a single “prey” library. An advantage of the bacterial one-hybrid system over the yeast one- hybrid system (Y1H) lies in the higher transformation efficiency of plasmids into bacteria which allows for more complex “prey” libraries to be examined.  Limitations  Despite its aforementioned advantages as a specialized tool, the B1H system does have some drawbacks. First, the B1H selection system is limited in its capacity to determine the binding specificities of transcription factors with lengthy binding sites. This arises from the fact that the number of randomized “prey” clones required to represent all possible target sequences increases exponentially with the number of nucleotides in that target sequence. Second, some eukaryotic factors may not express or fold efficiently in the bacterial system, attributed to differing regulatory networks and transcriptional machinery. Hence when working with DNA-binding proteins of eukaryotic origin, a yeast-based hybrid system may be beneficial. Third, the B1H system may not be ideally suited for transcription factors that recognize binding sites with low affinity. The logic here is that competition created by binding sites elsewhere in the bacterial genome may limit the signal that can be realized from a single binding site that is present upstream of the reporter.  Application  B1H system provides a tool in our arsenal for identifying the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors and thus predicting their target genes and genomic DNA regulatory elements. It also allows for examination of the effects of protein–protein interactions on DNA binding, which may further guide the prediction of cis regulatory modules based on binding-site clustering. Moreover, the B1H selection system has implications for the predicting regulatory roles of previously uncharacterized transcription factors.  Specific examples  Using the bacterial one-hybrid system, one study has characterized 35 members of the Drosophilia melanogaster segmentation network which includes representative members of all the major classes of DNA-binding domain proteins. Implications for medical research are evident from another study that used the B1H system to identify the DNA- binding specificity of a transcriptional regulator for a gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The B1H system has also been used to identify an important turnover element in Escherichia coli.

After being published in Horizon in abridged form, it was published alongside two of his other pieces in Inside the Whale and Other Essays from Victor Gollancz Ltd. The essay deals primarily with the School Stories published in The Magnet and The Gem and also with the 'Tuppenny Bloods' published by D.C. Thomson. He suggested that the style of The Magnet and Gem was deliberately formulaic so that it could be copied by a panel of authors whom he erroneously supposed to lie behind the author's names. He also denigrated the works as outdated, snobbish and right-wing, . He characterises the mental world of The Magnet and Gem as being \\"1910 - or 1940, but it is all the same... there is a cosy fire in the study... The King is on his throne... Everything will be the same forever.\\" He then addressed what he regarded as more up-to-date papers, DC Thompson's tuppenny bloods. He notes that the stories were shorter and faster paced and tend to be dominated by a single figure. He suggests the working classes are depicted in a stereotyped manner in both types of paper and regrets the absence of any Socialist perspective. According to Orwell the weeklies avoid describing any form of working class life and do not mention long-term unemployment or the dole. Orwell wrote that the weeklies serve the function of instilling into the minds of young boys the ideas that \\"the problems of our time do not exist, that there is nothing wrong with laissez- faire capitalism, that foreigners are unimportant comics and that the British Empire is a sort of charity-concern which will last forever\\". In the final paragraph he summarises by writing \\"All fiction from the novels in the mushroom libraries downwards is censored in the interests of the ruling class. And boy's fiction above all ... is sodden in the worst illusions of 1910. The fact is only unimportant if one believes that what is read in childhood leaves no impression behind. Lord Camrose and his colleagues evidently believe nothing of the kind, and, after all, Lord Camrose ought to know\\". Charles Hamilton later published a reply to his comments about The Magnet and Gem, under the Magnet pen-name of Frank Richards; this reply included his first public acknowledgement of himself as author of both papers and defended the wholesome nature of the stories as being appropriate for his audience .

The FEE details on the example of fast calculation of the classical constant e  For the evaluation of the constant e take m = 2^k, \\\\quad k \\\\geq 1, terms of the Taylor series for e, : e = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{1!} + \\\\frac{1}{2!} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{(m-1)!} + R_m. Here we choose m, requiring that for the remainder R_m the inequality R_m \\\\leq 2^{-n-1} is fulfilled. This is the case, for example, when m\\\\geq \\\\frac{4n}{\\\\log n}. Thus, we take m=2^k such that the natural number k is determined by the inequalities: : 2^k \\\\geq \\\\frac{4n}{\\\\log n} > 2^{k-1}. We calculate the sum : S = 1 + \\\\frac{1}{1!} + \\\\frac{1}{2!} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{(m-1)!} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{m-1}\\\\frac{1}{(m-1-j)!} , in k steps of the following process. Step 1. Combining in S the summands sequentially in pairs we carry out of the brackets the \\"obvious\\" common factor and obtain : \\\\begin{align} S & = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(m-1)!} + \\\\frac{1}{(m-2)!}\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{(m-3)!} + \\\\frac{1}{(m-4)!}\\\\right) + \\\\cdots  & = \\\\frac{1}{(m-1)!}(1+m-1) + \\\\frac{1}{(m-3)!}(1+m-3) + \\\\cdots . \\\\end{align} We shall compute only integer values of the expressions in the parentheses, that is the values : m , m-2 , m-4 , \\\\dots . \\\\, Thus, at the first step the sum S is into : S = S(1) = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{m_1-1}\\\\frac{1}{(m-1-2j)!}\\\\alpha_{m_1-j}(1) , : m_1 = \\\\frac m2 , m = 2^k , k \\\\geq 1 .

After that we act in a similar way: combining on each step the summands of the sum S sequentially in pairs, we take out of the brackets the 'obvious' common factor and compute only the integer values of the expressions in the brackets.

New Writings in SF was a series of thirty British science fiction original anthologies published from 1964 to 1977 under the successive editorships of John Carnell from 1964 to 1972 (the last volume with the aid of Diane Lloyd) and Kenneth Bulmer from 1973 to 1977. There were in addition four special volumes compiling material from the regular volumes. The series showcased the work of mostly British and Commonwealth science fiction authors, and \\"provided a forum for a generation of newer authors.\\"Aldiss, Brian W. \\"Carnell, Edward John (1912–1972),\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. It is the earliest of four notable science fiction original anthology series of the 1960s and 1970s. The popularity of New Writings crossed the Atlantic, and several US original anthology series publications emerged, including Orbit, Nova, and Universe. However, overexpansion of the original anthologies field attributed by some to one a particular editor, who was unable to fulfill a significant proportion of the volumes he signed contracts for with various U.S. publishers, resulted in the sub-genre ending up a fad, lacking overall the distribution and sales of the better-established series and magazines. The series was issued quarterly for the first nine volumes but could not sustain this pace thereafter. Successive issues were released at somewhat irregular intervals, with as few as one and as many as five volumes appearing in a given year. Initial publication was usually in hardcover by Dennis Dobson to 1972, and by Sidgwick & Jackson from 1972 onward. Volumes were reissued in paperback after an interval by Corgi, though on more than one occasion the pattern was reversed, with the Corgi edition appearing first, Corgi Books being the main paperback imprint of London-based publisher, Transworld Publishers. The American publisher for volumes 1-9 was Bantam Books, which reissued volumes 1-6 in paperback, usually a few years after publication in England. The contents of Bantam's volumes 7-9 diverged from their British counterparts, consisting of repackaged selections from volumes 7-15 the original series. Bantam did not continue its series beyond its volume 9, and there was no American publication for the remaining volumes of the original series. Purpose The stated aim of the series was to be \\"a new departure in the science fiction field,\\" to consist of new stories written especially for the series by international authors, both established and new. \\"The editor will also be encouraging new methods and techniques of story-telling.\\"Carnell, John, ed. New Writings in SF 1. London, Corgi, 1964, back cover. Contents Each volume featured a number of novelettes and short stories, mostly new works by British and Commonwealth science fiction authors, with occasional pieces by American authors, together with a foreword by the editor. The first twenty volumes included forewords by Carnell, the twenty-first by Diane Loyd, and the twenty-second through the thirtieth by Kenneth Bulmer. The Carnell-edited volumes averaged seven pieces per volume; the Bulmer-edited volumes averaged eleven. Dozens of prolific authors contributed stories, some in series, such as James White's Sector General.

The palace with its gardens is a listed cultural heritage monument and part of the Historic Centre of the City of Salzburg UNESCO World Heritage Site. History Mirabell Palace, The palace was built about 1606 on the shore of the Salzach river north of the medieval city walls, at the behest of Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau. The Archbishop suffered from gout and had a stroke the year before; to evade the narrow streets of the city, he decided to erect a pleasure palace for him and his mistress Salome Alt. Allegedly built within six months according to Italian and French models, it was initially named Altenau Castle. When Raitenau was deposed and arrested at Hohensalzburg Castle in 1612, his successor Mark Sittich von Hohenems expelled Salome Alt and her family from the premises. Mark Sittich gave the palace its current name from , bella: \\"amazing\\", \\"wonderful\\". It was rebuilt in a lavish Baroque style from 1721 to 1727, according to plans designed by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. On 1 June 1815 the later King Otto of Greece was born here, while his father, the Wittelsbach crown prince Ludwig I of Bavaria served as stadtholder in the former Electorate of Salzburg. The current Neoclassical appearance dates from about 1818, when the place was restored after a blaze. Archbishop Maximilian Joseph von Tarnóczy resided here from 1851 to 1863. The father of Hans Makart worked here as a chamberlain. Joachim Haspinger (1776-1858), Capuchin priest and a leader of the Tyrolean Rebellion, spent his last year in a small flat. The palace was purchased by the City of Salzburg in 1866. After World War II it was temporarily used for the mayor's office and housed several departments of the municipal administration. Marble Hall Marble Hall The Marble Hall of Mirabell Palace is the venue of the \\"Salzburg Palace Concerts\\" (), directed by Luz Leskowitz. It is also a popular location for weddings. On 3 June 1944 Gretl Braun, the sister of Eva Braun (later to marry Adolf Hitler), married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, who served as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Their wedding took place at Mirabell Palace with Hitler, Himmler, and Martin Bormann as witnesses. Her sister Eva made all the wedding arrangements. Miller, Michael (2006). Leaders of the SS and German Police, Vol. 1. R. James Bender Publishing. . Gardens One of the dwarf statues inside the Dwarf Garden Hohensalzburg The Mirabellgarten was laid out under Prince-Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun from 1687 according to plans designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. In its geometrically-arranged gardens are mythology-themed statues dating from 1730 and four groups of sculpture (Aeneas, Hercules, Paris and Pluto), created by Italian sculptor Ottavio Mosto from 1690. It is noted for its boxwood layouts, including a sylvan theater (Heckentheater) designed between 1704 and 1718. An orangery was added in 1725. The gardens were made accessible to the public under Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Up to today, it is one of the most popular tourists' attraction in Salzburg. Several scenes from The Sound of Music were filmed here. Maria and the children sing 'Do-Re-Mi' while dancing around the horse fountain and using the steps as a musical scale.

The museum was opened in 1999, and by 2007 had been visited by more than one million people. Historic site Hitler and Eva Braun on the terrace of the Berghof, 1942 Located in the German state of Bavaria, close to the Austrian border, Obersalzberg in the 19th century was one of the earliest tourist destinations in the Berchtesgaden Alps. That changed, when Hitler purchased the Berghof (Mountain House) residence upon the Nazi seizure of power in 1933 and a large area was cordoned off and evacuated. After World War II, the premises were handed over to the State of Bavaria, however, they remained occupied by a United States Armed Forces recreation center and the General Walker Hotel for US troops, which had been the original Platterhof luxury hotel that had been used by the Nazis. The hotel was demolished in 2001. The nearby Hotel Türken which was often used by the SS, was badly damaged in 1945. It was rebuilt in 1950 and reopened as a hotel before Christmas that year. Visitors can still explore the historic underground hallways and tunnels that had been used by the Nazis. Access to the bunkers was closed for construction in September 2017 and remained closed in July 2018 \\"until further notice\\". After the withdrawal of the US forces in 1996, the Bavarian state government resumed its plans to have a luxury hotel erected, but also the documentation center on the Nazi past in order to prevent the re-opened area becoming a pilgrimage site for Neo-Nazis. The hotel (originally the InterContinental and now the Kempinski Hotel Berchtesgaden) was built at the former site of Göring's residence. The museum itself sits on the foundation of the Hoher Göll guesthouse. There is also a link through a tunnel to the extended bunker complex at the demolished General Walker Hotel (former Platterhof), constructed in 1943-45. Exhibitions The upper floor of the exhibition area The museum exhibition is taken care of by the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich. It offers over 950 documents, photographs, audio clips, films and maps as well as a scale model of the Obersalzberg area overlaying current buildings with the position of historical Nazi installations. The exhibition covers the two floors of the main building and extends through the tunnel to the bunker. However, only a portion of it is dedicated to the history of the Obersalzberg itself, including a small section on the post-1945 era, when most of the area was used by the American military. The ground floor of the main building and most of the tunnel exhibits cover general topics of Nazi Germany, such as \\"The Fuehrer\\", \\"Actors in the regime\\", \\"Machinery of Terror\\", \\"Resistance\\", \\"Foreign Policy\\" etc. that are not directly related to the Obersalzberg resort. The path of the exhibition ends in a documentation of the Holocaust in the dark of the bunker. Only a part of the extensive shelter network is accessible today. Inside the Platterhofbunker There are also special exhibitions. The 2008 Winter Exhibition was about \\"Free time in Fascism\\". From October 2012 to April 2013, the museum showed an exhibition on the victims of euthanasia.

The term was coined by Collins (1956, 1957) who recognised that there seemed to be people that lived in the Eastern Canadian Arctic prior to the Dorset, but for whose culture it was difficult to give the defining characteristics. Hence, for Collins and others afterward, the term is a catch- all phrase for all occupations of the Eastern Canadian Arctic that predated the Dorset. To Taylor (1968) and Maxwell (1973), however, the Pre-Dorset were a distinct cultural entity, ancestral to the Dorset, and that lived in the Low Arctic of Canada with a number of incursions into High Arctic. At the site of Port Refuge on the Grinnell Peninsula, Devon Island, McGhee (1979) distinguished two sets of occupations, one that he ascribed to the Independence I culture, the other to Pre-Dorset. Due to the often poor preservation of organic material and the fact that bones from marine mammals can appear older with radiocarbon dating than their actual age (the marine reservoir effect), it is typically difficult to date Arctic sites. But the Independence I settlement is several metres higher above sea level, and McGhee took this to mean that the Independence I settlement was roughly 300 years older than the Pre-Dorset one at Port Refuge. Indeed, assuming that settlers are always close to the water, because sea levels fell over the centuries, older sites are expected to lie higher above the sea. Most features that McGhee believed different between the Pre-Dorset and Independence I settlements of Port Refuge are problematic and cannot systematically be used to distinguish their cultural affiliation. It has been suggested that Pre- Dorset and Independence I are parts of the same culture. Chronology Maxwell (1985:107, 109) divided the Pre-Dorset in four phases, a scheme refined by Murray (1999:467): * Early Pre-Dorset 4450 to 3650 14C BP (c. 3350-2950 to 2200-1900 cal BC) * Middle Pre-Dorset 3650 to 3250 14C BP (c. 2200-1900 to 1650-1450 cal BC) * Late Pre-Dorset 3250 to 2750 14C BP (c. 1600-1450 to 900-850 cal BC) * Terminal or Dorset Transitional Pre-Dorset 2750 to 2450 14C BP (c. 1000-850 to 750-400 cal BC) It is typically difficult to ascribe a Pre-Dorset site to one of these four phases without relying on radiocarbon dates. Proposed defining characteristicsRegional variantsCanadian Central Low Arctic= The Low Eastern Arctic, namely Arctic regions on Baffin Island or to the south, are usually considered the core area of the Pre-Dorset. =Canadian High Arctic= Most Pre-Dorset occupations are known from the Low Arctic. But the complex is known from a number of occupations in the High Arctic as well, namely to the north of Baffin Island, on the islands of Devon and Ellesmere. One important site, the Port Refuge National Historic Site of Canada, on Devon island, hosts occupations ascribed to the Pre-Dorset and others ascribed to Independence I. At this site, Pre- Dorset dwellings are clustered and show no mid-passage feature, whereas the Independence I dwellings are arranged linearly with mid-passage features.Port Refuge National Historic Site of Canada =Greenland= The Pre-Dorset is generally restricted to the Low Arctic, and given that incursions to the High Arctic are rare, incursions into Greenland from the High Arctic are even rarer. Grønnow and Jensen (2003:42-43) ascribe one small site in Greenland to the Pre-Dorset, the only one to date. This is a mid-passage dwelling in Solbakken, Hall Land, just across from the Nares Strait, separating Canada from Greenland. This occupation was identified as Pre-Dorset on the basis of the re-sharpening technique of the burins, as well as other lithic characteristics. There is an Independence I occupation at the same site that the authors believe more ancient than the Pre-Dorset on grounds of altitude (21 vs. 19 m). It appears probable that surveys or re-analysis of excavated material will reveal more Greenlandic Pre-Dorset occupations. Genetics A genetic study published in Science in August 2014 examined the remains of a Pre-Dorset individual buried in Rocky Point, Canada between c. 2140 BC and 1800 BC. The sample of mtDNA extracted belonged to haplogroup D4e. The examined individual was found to be closely related to peoples of the Saqqaq culture and Dorset culture. The ancestors of the Saqqaq, Pre-Dorset and Dorset probably migrated from Siberia to North America in a single migration around 4000 BC.

Selig's company, Little Airplane Productions, produced the series. The show revolves around a community of birds and their adventures. It was broadcast on the BBC's CBeebies channel from 4 June 2008 to 31 July 2010. Described in its initial press release as \\"a charming new animated series all about community\\", the show's format generally involves one or more of the characters encountering a problem which must be solved using the social skills which pre- school children must develop in order to make their way in the world. The show uses an animation style known as \\"photo-puppetry\\", in which the animation is created by the use of manipulation of photographs (similarly to Josh Selig's previous venture Wonder Pets). CharactersMain characters= *Samuel (voiced by Sam Lewis) - The eldest of the Lovebird children, Samuel is a green lovebird. He acts as a role model to his younger sister, Muffin, and often tries to teach her how to be responsible. *Muffin (voiced by Eden Jarrett) - A pink lovebird and Samuel's younger sister. Not yet old enough to fly, she usually rides on Samuel's back. Muffin calls Samuel \\"Sam'el,\\" Rudy \\"Udy,\\" and Mr. Beakman \\"Beaky.\\" *Rudy (voiced by Morgan Gayle) - Rudy is a cockatoo (despite resembling a cockatiel more closely) and Samuel's best friend.

It was constructed in 1937 as Municipal Auditorium and renamed in 1966. The facility includes the Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theatre, the Freede Little Theatre, CitySpace, the Meinders Hall of Mirrors and the Joel Levine Rehearsal Hall. The Civic Center Music Hall is managed and operated in conjunction with the Rose State Performing Arts Theatre. Together they serve more than 300,00 patrons at around 250 performances at six different stages each year. The center is home to eight professional arts organizations: Black Liberated Arts Center, Canterbury Choral Society, Nederlander, Lyric Theatre and Academy, Oklahoma City Ballet, Oklahoma City Philharmonic, Oklahoma City Repertory Theatre, and Oklahoma City Theatre Company.Resident Companies (accessed May 19, 2010).  History  In 1927, the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce and the city jointly purchased the land that would become home to a municipal auditorium after voters approved a $4 million bond for the site. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs in the 1930s contributed 55 percent of the cost of building through the Public Works Administration. J. O. Parr began planning and designing the Municipal Auditorium, budgeted at $1.25 million. The original design features a six-story building with both neoclassical and Art Deco features that seated 6,200 in the main hall and smaller theatre that seated 400. In August 1935, the Roosevelt Administration announced that all PWA projects had to break ground by December 1935 or risk losing federal support. W. S. Bellows Construction became the primary contractor and began on-site excavation on time. The Municipal Auditorium was completed in April 1937. The first performance, \\"Rhapsodic Rhythms\\" took place on October 4, 1937. The Oklahoma Art Center, a community art center administered by the Federal Art Project, was located in Municipal Auditorium. Fundraising campaigns began for the successful organization as the Federal Art Project came to an end, and in May 1945 the Oklahoma Art Center was incorporated. In 1989 it was merged into the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. In 1966, the Municipal Auditorium was remodeled and renamed the Civic Center Music Hall.Civic Center Music Hall Profile, About.com (accessed May 19, 2010). The main auditorium was renovated to cater more to the performing arts by decreasing the size of the hall, moving the side wall in and installing mahogany panels, lowering the ceiling and replacing the portable floor with a sloped fixed floor. In 1971, the basement was converted into office space and later converted back to the theatre space and dressing rooms. One of the biggest concerts to ever play the venue was KISS on their 1976 Alive! tour. The band's opening act did not make it to the building forcing the management to find a new opening act on the day of the show. The band that was called to fill in was referred by the then Assistant Technical Director Richard Charnay (who would put in a 40+ year career at the music hall). The band was called Mountain Smoke which featured an unknown artist by the name of Vince Gill. The Little Theatre was closed in 1985 because it was damaged from old age, abuse, and a fire. It was later renovated and reopened to the public. In September 2001, the Civic Center Music Hall reopened after a three-year renovation. A complete interior renovation of the historic Civic Center Music Hall includes accommodations for major theatrical, dance and musical groups; a multi-story atrium; balconies, box seats and suites; excellent acoustics; and a hydraulic orchestra pit. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Foundation and volunteer organizations The Civic Center Foundation, established in 2001, is a private non-profit organization that supports the Civic Center Music Hall financially to help bring performing arts to Oklahoma City to improve the community.Civic Center Foundation (accessed May 19, 2010). The Civic Center Foundation has helped make capital improvements including the Civic Center Music Hall's new message center and improvements to the Freede Little Theatre. The foundation raises funds through two programs, the Seat Back Campaign and the Suite Holder Program. Patrons can help the Civic Center Music Hall by purchasing personalized seat back plates at the Thelma Gaylord Performing Arts Theatre or by becoming a suite or box holder at the Civic Center Music Hall. The Civic Center Music Hall is also home to STARS, a volunteer group of more than 300 people who contribute thousands of hours each year.Civic Center Volunteers (STARS) (accessed May 19, 2010).

His German father, who served in the R.A.F., and English mother moved from England to Ireland in 1947. Knuttel has a very eccentric family history with a grandfather involved in World War 1 and vivid memories of his sadistic grandmother trying to lock him into his father's \\"huge dark wardrobe\\". He admits he can still hear her cackling and feel her nails clawing the back of his neck. The family on his father's side is clouded in secrecy and mystery but his mother's side is said to be more normal and relates closer to the art world. Knuttel is related to the founder of the Newlyn School of Painters, Thomas Cooper Gotch as well as the famous English actor Cary Grant who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's film To Catch a Thief. Knuttel has a brother (Peter, father of artist Jonathan Knuttel) and sister both approximately ten years older than he is. The age gap left him with a sense of independence that left him to follow his own destiny. Knuttel never cared much for academia and spent little time in school, rather spending his time exploring the cafe and pub society of Dublin as well as its rocky coastline. In his time away from school he began to absorb himself in drawing and art. He enrolled in the Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design at the age of eighteen and the bohemian lifestyle of art school suited him well. It was during his time at Dún Laoghaire that his training led him to his beloved craft of figurative representational painting. Although his style of painting did not receive the great acclaim it does now from a group of new American tutors. They appreciated a very different style of artwork and therefore Knuttel had to make the transition from painting to sculpture to pass his final year of college. Although this transition was undesired, Knuttel discovered a new passion for the craft. He received his diploma for an exhibition of mechanical wooden sculptures of a bird as well as medieval- themed pieces of a shield and a portcullis.

Omogha 1 (JP) FCAI. He has the power to appoint his Kinsmen (also known as Chiefs), which assist him in decision(s) making relating to the affairs of Oleh community. In addition to the monarch and his chiefs, there is also Oleh community executives headed by an elected president. Both the community executives and the king with his chiefs work together to see to the smooth running of the community affairs. They are also the traditional custodian of the people's customs and traditions. The monarch is influential in Isokoland in matters relating to his kingdom. He is also a member of the state council of traditional rulers, which also provides him a platform for some influence on statewide issues. Economy There are different economic classes in Oleh, ranging from civil servants, merchants, skilled and unskilled personnel and farmers. The farmers mostly specialise in food crop farming, fishery, livestock farming and sometimes hunting of bush animals. The food crops cultivated by the farmers include; cassava, maize, oil palms, plantain and yams. Women form a large proportion of the farming population. They also engage in trading of food crops for cash to meet other basic household needs. On market days, women can be seen peddling their assorted wares in the town markets.

These models play an vital role in the design of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANET). Most of the times simulators play a significant role in testing the features of mobile ad hoc networks. Simulators like (NS, QualNet, etc) allow the users to choose the mobility models as these models represent the movements of nodes or users. As the mobile nodes move in different directions, it becomes imperative to characterize their movements vis-à-vis to standard models. The mobility models proposed in literature have varying degrees of realism i.e. from random patterns to realistic patterns. Thus these models contribute significantly while testing the protocols for mobile ad hoc networks. Background and terminology The study of large and complex networks is possible by experimenting on a simulator rather than on analytical studies. The relatively new form of networks like Mobile Ad Hoc Networks(MANET), Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANET), etc are characterized by nodes which are autonomous and dynamic in nature. Thus it becomes very essential to capture their movements so that the corresponding simulations results are nearer to reality. Mobility models are basically classified as stochastic, detailed, Hybrid and Trace based Realistic models. * The stochastic models are based on random movements and the nodes are free to move in any direction. Example include Random waypoint model, Random walk and Random direction model. * The detailed models are tailored for specific scenarios. This could include meetings, library and classroom scenarios. Example includes Street random waypoint (STRAW), * The Hybrid models try to strike a balance between realism (Detailed models) and freedom of movements(Stochastic models). Examples include Reference point group mobility model, Manhattan mobility model and Freeway mobility model. * The Real trace models contain a collection of movements of realistic users based on specific scenarios. Example includes CRAWDAD. Mobility models For mobility modelling, the behavior or activity of a user’s movement can be described using both analytical and simulation models. The input to analytical mobility models are simplifying assumptions regarding the movement behaviors of users. Such models can provide performance parameters for simple cases through mathematical calculations. In contrast, simulation models consider more detailed and realistic mobility scenarios. Such models can derive valuable solutions for more complex cases. Typical mobility models include *Random waypoint model * Random walk model * Random direction model * Street random waypoint *Reference point group model (RPGM) *Manhattan mobility model *Freeway mobility model  Metrics for Mobility Models  Mobility model metrics are useful to study the impact of mobility models on the performances of mobile ad hoc networks. Metrics are usually classified as mobility metrics, connectivity graph metrics and protocol performance metrics. * The mobility metrics usually speaks about the mobility patterns. These include spatial dependence, temporal dependence, relative speed and geographic restrictions. * The connectivity graph metrics speaks about the number of link changes, link duration, path duration and path availability. * The protocol performance metrics speaks about throughput and routing overhead.

It is in the building of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in downtown Belgrade.  History  The origin of the Belgrade-based Institute of Balkan Studies goes back to the Institut des Études balkaniques founded at the initiative of King Aleksandar I Karađorđević in Belgrade in 1934 and funded by the king, while the organization of the Institute was entrusted to Ratko Parežanin and Svetislav Spanaćević. Aimed at promoting peaceful Balkan cooperation the Institut des Études balkaniques was the only one of its kind in the Balkans. The pre-war Institute published the Revue internationale des Études balkaniques, a prestigious scholarly journal written in French, English and German. Its contributors were the most prominent European experts on the Balkans, from various disciplines. The Institute was shut down by the Nazi occupation authorities in 1941. Under the name Balkanološki institut SANU (Institute for Balkan Studies, SASA) it was re-established in 1969, with historian Dimitrije Đorđević, archaeologist Nikola Tasić and anthropologist Dragoslav Antonijević as his first research fellows. Thus, the Institute resumed with its scholarly pursuits under its present-day name and under the auspices of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Among its members, past and current directors, the most prominent have been Radovan Samardžić, Nikola Tasić and Dušan T. Bataković. The Institute's new research team was built so as to be able to cover the Balkans from prehistory to the modern age in a range of different fields of study, from archeology and ancient history to anthropology, linguistics and history. This multidisciplinary approach has remained its long-term orientation. The Institute for Balkan Studies has organized a number of domestic and international conferences promoting intellectual exchange and cooperation between scholarly communities at both the regional and European level.  Present-day activities  The Institute for Balkan Studies declares itself to be committed to rigorous scholarly research aimed at furthering the understanding of an oft-stereotyped European region both in terms of its distinctiveness and of its inseparability from the rest of the world. In nearly forty years since its re-establishment the Institute has published more than one hundred monographic volumes in its Special Editions series (monographs, proceedings of scholarly conferences and edited volumes), as well as thirty-eight volumes of its annual Balcanica, published since 1970, mostly in the Serbian language. In order to reach a broader scholarly audience Balcanica has been published in English and French since 2006 (nº XXXVI). Its current Editor-in-chief, since 2005 is Dušan T.

After Gus's death, it is determined that his heart is a match for Olivia. Natalia does not want Olivia to get his heart because she thinks he died because of Olivia. But then Natalia sees Olivia's young daughter Emma (Jacqueline Tsirkin)\\"Jacqueline Tsirkin\\", Internet Movie Database, imdb.com. and decides Emma should not be motherless. So, despite her hatred for Olivia, Natalia makes the incredibly difficult decision to give Olivia his heart. After the transplant, when Olivia finds out that she is alive because Gus died, Olivia becomes angry and depressed. The guilt over the transplant, the grief over Gus's death, and the pain from the surgery all combines to put Olivia in an extremely despondent state. She does not want to live. Being a housekeeper at the Beacon affords Natalia the opportunity to nurse the despondent Olivia. Though Natalia still hates Olivia, she decides to try to force Olivia to recover from her transplant surgery because she wants to keep Gus' heart alive. However, Natalia's goodwill is tested by Olivia's cruel actions and words. Despite Olivia's cruel behavior, Natalia declares her determination to keep Olivia alive. Because of Natalia's determination, after many bitter confrontations with Natalia, Olivia begins to recover from the transplant and decides to take care of Gus' heart. =Olivia's Sacrifice= As the seasons change from spring to summer, Olivia and Natalia begin to forge their own unique friendship. Their friendship centers around both of them trying not only to heal from Gus's tragic death but to deal with the resulting ramifications. Olivia and Natalia are drawn closer because of Rafe's suffering over the loss of Gus and the troubles caused by his actions. After Rafe accidentally shoots District Attorney Jeffrey O'Neill (Bradley Cole), Natalia asks Olivia for money so that Natalia can travel to find Rafe. Olivia decides to help Natalia. By the fall, Olivia and Natalia are drawn ever closer because of Rafe's return to Springfield. Rafe is arrested and sentenced to two years in prison. Olivia is supportive of Natalia during this trying period. Olivia and Natalia also grow more dependent on each other. They create an inseparable bond due to Olivia's worsening heart problems (a bout of heart rejection) and Natalia's worry over Rafe's safety in the maximum security prison. Because Olivia's frail health is deteriorating, Natalia helps Olivia to fulfill her duties as the owner of the Beacon Hotel and also as the high-profile spokesperson for Galaxy Hotels – an international hotel chain run by the savvy businessman named Larry Decker (Tom Wiggin). Olivia is determined to fulfill her duties without Decker knowing she is ill. One day in October 2008, Olivia suffers cardiac arrest. As Remy (Lawrence Saint-Victor) attempts to resuscitate Olivia, Natalia pleads to Olivia to stay alive for not only the sake of her children but for Natalia. Remy eventually resuscitates Olivia and she receives a pacemaker. Despite the pacemaker, Olivia continues to weaken. Yet, even in her weakened state, Olivia tries to solve Natalia's problems. Just days after her pacemaker procedure, Olivia physically confronts the prison warden over Rafe being beaten by the other inmates. Later, Olivia works out a deal with the governor where he purchases Natalia's house for above market value so he can complete a transportation project. Also, Rafe being transported to the minimum security prison is part of the transaction. And most difficult of all, Olivia tries to convince Decker to return to Natalia the $80,000.00 (the money from the house sale) that Natalia loses when she invests the money in Decker's risky hedge fund scheme. Natalia invests her money in the risky scheme because she overhears Olivia and Decker discussing the risky scheme. Olivia blames herself, and Frank (Frank Dicopoulos) also blames her, for Natalia investing her money in the hedge fund. Olivia makes what Decker calls “an impassioned” plea for him to return Natalia her money. Olivia's impassioned plea to Decker drains her strength. She is admitted into the hospital. While in the hospital, Decker confronts a bed-ridden Olivia. Decker says he will return Natalia's money, but only if Olivia publicly resigns her position with Galaxy and then publicly acknowledges that she deceived Decker concerning her medical problem. For Natalia's sake, Olivia reluctantly accepts Decker's demand and the public humiliation. In December 2008, Natalia uses her freshly returned money to buy the farmhouse which she has wanted to own. When Olivia gives Natalia the check from Decker, Natalia quickly realizes that Olivia has made a huge sacrifice on her behalf. Natalia surmises that Decker found out about Olivia's illness and forced her to resign as part of the deal for Natalia to receive her money. Wanting to own the house and to help Olivia, Natalia convinces Olivia to move herself and Emma into the farmhouse while Olivia recovers from her heart problems. In a joyous moment, Olivia agrees. =\\"My Two Mommies\\"= The new family moves onto the farm and into the farmhouse. Olivia and Natalia find it difficult to live together because of their different lifestyles. Being a devout Catholic, Natalia has religious symbols, such as crosses and statues. Olivia is not religious. On Christmas day, Natalia convinces Olivia to stay despite their differences and bickering. The family is still basking in the joy of their home life when Emma is given a school project about what makes her family unique. Emma decides to make her presentation on her two mommies. Olivia and Natalia are unaware as to the subject of the presentation because Emma insists on it being a surprise. The presentation is revealed to them when Emma presents it to the crowd of children and parents at the Family Day school presentation. Olivia quickly realizes that people construe “the two mommies” to mean that she and Natalia are lesbian lovers. Seeing the presentation through her own naïve eyes and also wanting to see it from Emma's innocent perspective, Natalia does not understand the inferences being drawn from Emma's presentation. Olivia tries to explain the inferences to Natalia; however, she is unable to say “lesbians” and skirts the issue by using ambiguous terms. Finally, after Natalia still does not comprehend the meaning, Olivia impulsively kisses Natalia to make her understand the inference. It works. Natalia then understands the lesbian inference. The kiss, however, unsettles the both of them. In the aftermath of Emma's school presentation, Olivia realizes that she indeed has romantic feelings for Natalia. Natalia, concerned with public perception and her religious beliefs, is having problems facing her feelings for Olivia. Instead, Natalia tries to date Frank Cooper, a man infatuated with Natalia, but someone that Natalia considered only as a friend prior to Olivia's kiss. In the following few months, Olivia and Natalia engage in a figurative dance over their burgeoning romantic feelings. Olivia deals openly with her romantic feelings toward Natalia by discussing them with several people in town, including the closeted lesbian mayor of Springfield Doris Wolfe. Olivia even attempts to verbalize these feelings to Natalia, but Natalia foils Olivia's attempts. Natalia has a difficult time facing her romantic feelings for Olivia because of her religious beliefs and her value system. Nonetheless, Natalia continues to spend time with Olivia, especially in dealing with Olivia's fears over the return to Springfield of Olivia's ex- husband/Emma's father Phillip Spaulding (Grant Aleksander). The two women grow closer while the tension between them worsens over their unspoken romantic feelings. =Natalia's Confession= As a result of her confused feelings for Olivia, Natalia has a sexual encounter with Frank, and immediately regrets it. She prays to her Virgin Mary statue to help her deal with her confusing feelings. An extremely distraught and sobbing Natalia tells Olivia that she slept with Frank and she does not know why because she does not love him. Frank proposes to Natalia. Natalia spends many weeks debating the decision. Then one day when Olivia is lightly sedated following a pacemaker procedure, Natalia tells the sedated Olivia that Olivia makes her happy. Natalia kisses Olivia on the forehead and then moves in for a kiss. Olivia awakens and in doing so, stops the near kiss. After the near kiss, Olivia is concerned about acting on her feelings for Natalia. Olivia vents her fears to Mayor Doris Wolfe. Olivia is afraid to lose her heterosexual identity and to subject Natalia and Emma to potential ridicule by others. Olivia goes to the farmhouse and tells Natalia that she should marry Frank. Natalia accepts Frank's proposal. The wedding occurs shortly thereafter. Prior to the wedding, at Gus' graveside, a visibly distraught Olivia is forced by Natalia to tell her why Olivia is so upset. Olivia screams through her sobs that she is in love with Natalia. Despite an emotionally intimate moment after Olivia's declaration of love, Olivia convinces Natalia that marrying Frank is best because Natalia deserves a better life than Olivia thinks she could provide her. At the wedding altar, with Olivia as her Maid of Honor, Natalia is unable to say her vows to Frank, and flees the church. Olivia finds Natalia and tries to get her to return to the wedding. Natalia refuses as she declares that she cannot marry Frank because she does not love him - she loves Olivia. Natalia is unable to tell Frank why she did not marry him. Olivia intercedes and blames it on Natalia's lingering grief over Gus. Frank accepts this explanation and agrees to give Natalia space. Later, Olivia tells Natalia that she is ashamed of her feelings for Olivia. Olivia walks away from Natalia after saying they have no relationship because someday Natalia will regret loving her and Olivia is unable to live with that prospect. =A Love Supreme= In the aftermath of the failed wedding, Natalia convinces Olivia that she understands the consequences of her declaration of love and that she wants a relationship with Olivia. The two women are trying to establish their relationship by dating and spending time with each other. The newness and challenges of the relationship (not to mention the ongoing dramas of Springfield!) keep their progress on a \\"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back\\" trajectory, however. More often than not, it is Olivia who initiates the two steps forward, with Natalia's doubts pushing back (or at least slowing things down). Nevertheless, in the first six weeks following the Wedding That Wasn't, Olivia and Natalia have grown more comfortable with each other, gradually letting others in on their changed status (Olivia to Jeffrey: \\"Friends...and a little bit more\\" 5-22-09). They have frequently received a (dubious) assist in this regard, from Mayor Wolfe (who informs Natalia's ex-fiancé Frank about their relationship, before Natalia can do it herself). Notably, after he guessed, Natalia confirmed to her priest, Father Ray, that Olivia is indeed the \\"Someone Else\\" who ended her engagement to Frank. In so doing, Natalia made a signal break in letting the opinions of others (the Roman Catholic Church) define her own morality (which nevertheless remains strongly grounded in her personal faith). As both Olivia and Natalia are mothers, each remains strongly concerned with how to explain their new (coupled---more or less!) relationship to their children. Olivia has visited her older daughter (out-of-state, and offscreen), Ava, but it has not been stated whether or not she was informed of her mother's changed relationship to Natalia. More immediately pressing, is how to tell the two children in Springfield: Natalia's 19-year-old son Rafe (freshly released from prison), and Olivia's 8-year-old daughter, Emma (who, with the \\"My Two Mommies\\" project behind her, may be the most instinctively supportive member of the family). In all their struggles, however, Olivia and Natalia seem entirely resolved to face their challenges together. As they do so, consciously or not, they seem to be evermore drawn to each other on a physical level, in ways both tender and flirtatious: increasingly expressing that they are in love.  Reception and impact  As Olivia and Natalia's relationship grew deeper, the storyline garnered critical praise from the soap press for being a well-crafted and \\"superbly performed\\" storyline that is addressing lesbian relationships and internalized homophobia.Purvis,Matt. \\"Guiding Light Weekly Blog, Blogging at the Beacon.

Unlike traditional search engines, which crawl existing webpages and their hyperlinks, DeepPeep aimed to allow access to the so-called Deep web, World Wide Web content only available via for instance typed queries into databases. The project started at the University of Utah and was overseen by Juliana Freire, an associate professor at the university's School of Computing WebDB group. The goal was to make 90% of all WWW content accessible, according to Freire. The project ran a beta search engine and was sponsored by the University of Utah and a $243,000 grant from the National Science Foundation. It generated worldwide interest.  How it works  Similar to Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, DeepPeep allows the users to type in a keyword and returns a list of links and databases with information regarding the keyword. However, what separated DeepPeep and other search engines is that DeepPeep uses the ACHE crawler, 'Hierarchical Form Identification', 'Context- Aware Form Clustering' and 'LabelEx' to locate, analyze, and organize web forms to allow easy access to users. = ACHE Crawler = The ACHE Crawler is used to gather links and utilizes a learning strategy that increases the collection rate of links as these crawlers continue to search. What makes ACHE Crawler unique from other crawlers is that other crawlers are focused crawlers that gather Web pages that have specific properties or keywords. Ache Crawlers instead includes a page classifier which allows it to sort out irrelevant pages of a domain as well as a link classifier which ranks a link by its highest relevance to a topic. As a result, the ACHE Crawler first downloads web links that has the higher relevance and saves resources by not downloading irrelevant data. = Hierarchical Form Identification = In order to further eliminate irrelevant links and search results, DeepPeep uses the HIerarchical Form Identification (HIFI) framework that classifies links and search results based on the website's structure and content. Unlike other forms of classification which solely relies on the web form labels for organization, HIFI utilizes both the structure and content of the web form for classification. Utilizing these two classifiers, HIFI organizes the web forms in a hierarchical fashion which ranks the a web form's relevance to the target keyword. = Context-Aware Clustering = When there is no domain of interest or the domain specified has multiple types of definition, DeepPeep must separate the web form and cluster them into similar domains. The search engine uses context-aware clustering to group similar links in the same domain by modeling the web form into sets of hyperlinks and using its context for comparison. Unlike other techniques that require complicated label extraction and manual pre-processing of web forms, context-aware clustering is done automatically and uses meta-data to handle web forms that are content rich and contain multiple attributes. = LabelEx = DeepPeep further extracts information called Meta-Data from these pages which allows for better ranking of links and databases with the use of LabelEx, an approach for automatic decomposition and extraction of meta-data. Meta-data is data from web links that give information about other domains. LabelEx identifies the element- label mapping and uses the mapping to extract meta-data with accuracy unlike conventional approaches that used manually specific extraction rules. = Ranking = When the search results pop up after the user has input their keyword, DeepPeep ranks the links based on 3 features: term content, number of backlinks. and pagerank. Firstly, the term content is simply determined by the content of the web link and its relevance. Backlinks are hyperlinks or links that direct the user to a different website. Pageranks is the ranking of websites in search engine results and works by counting the amount and quality of links to website to determine its importance. Pagerank and back link information are obtained from outside sources such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing.  Beta Launch  DeepPeep Beta was launched (find the date) and only covered seven domains: auto, airfare, biology, book, hotel, job, and rental. Under these seven domains, DeepPeep offered access to 13,000 Web forms. One could access the website at deeppeep.org, but the website has been inactive after the beta version was taken down.

He entered Princeton University at the age of twelve, but two years later, because of his father’s illness, left his studies. At sixteen he was master in a school at Burlington. He then moved to Philadelphia. Finding his salary insufficient to support his family, he first studied law, but abandoned it and turned to the stage. This vocation did not especially appeal to him, and was strongly opposed by his devout mother who considered it not respectable. He first appeared in \\"Mahomet\\" in 1805 and subsequently was successful on the stage. But this profession was distasteful to him and he soon left it. In 1812, he joined the Baltimore \\"American\\" newspaper as treasurer and bookkeeper. Soon afterward, in connection with his brother-in- law, John Norvell, he purchased and published the Baltimore \\"Whig.\\" During the War of 1812, he was at the Battle of Bladensburg with Norvell and the account of this experience has been chronicled in \\"Some Account of the Life of Spencer Houghton Cone, A Baptist Preacher in America,\\" published in New York in 1856. He then became a clerk in the treasury department in Washington. After moving there, he began to preach with remarkable success. He was converted to the Baptist Church in 1814. In 1815-1816 he became Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. About 1823, he moved to the Oliver street church, New York, where he remained for eighteen years. He then became pastor of the 1st Baptist church there. In 1832, he became president of the Baptist triennial convention, and was re-elected until 1841.

On June 19, 1995, Delmarva Power acquired the Conowingo Power Company service area from PECO. PECO's distribution line voltages are 4,160 volts and 13,200 volts. Subtransmission voltages are 34,500 volts and 69,000 volts. Transmission line voltages are 138,000 volts, 230,000 volts and 500,000 volts. PECO's peak electric load occurred on August 3, 2006 and was 8,932 megawatts (MWs) and its highest peak load in the winter season occurred on December 20, 2004 and was 6,838 MW. Residential electric usage makes up about 35 percent of PECO's total electric delivery and half of the annual electric revenue. PECO's electric sales tend to peak in the summer and winter seasons, driven by air conditioning and heating load respectively when extreme temperatures create greater demand. The company's natural gas sales are generally higher during the winter periods when cold temperatures create demand for heating. The company's highest gas sales occurred on Jan. 17, 2000 and was of gas. Gas usage by residential customers is approximately half of PECO's total deliveries. The PECO transition period for the competitive electric generation market ended on Dec. 31, 2010, when caps on retail rates and competitive transition charges on customer bills ended. PECO electric rates had been capped for 12 years. PECO expects to purchase all of its wholesale electricity from competitive market sources subsequent to 2010 with retail customers charged the actual costs of procurement. According to Exelon SEC Form 10-k for the year 2012: nuclear energy supplied 53% of power supplied, fossils and renewables provided 12% of power supplied, and purchased power provided 35% of power supplied. Facilities and infrastructure PECO owns, maintains and operates of higher-voltage transmission lines, of underground distribution cable, and of aerial distribution lines. On the gas side, PECO owns, maintains and operates of transmission, distribution and service pipes. PECO has a liquefied natural gas storage facility in West Conshohocken, Pa. with capacity of and a propane-air plant in Chester, Pa. with storage capacity of . The company also owns 29 natural gas city gate stations at locations that link with various interstate pipelines. They built the Chester Waterside Station of the Philadelphia Electric Company, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Revenues PECO's total assets are valued at $9.8 billion. The company delivered of natural gas and 39.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity in 2008, generating $5.5 billion in revenue. PECO's utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investments for the electric and gas delivery systems to ensure adequate capacity and reliability for customers. PECO's anticipated capital expenditures for 2009 are estimated at $400 million—about three- fourths for the electric business, nearly 20 percent for gas, and the rest is common. The company pays about $510 million in local, state and federal income and other taxes annually. Controversies In the 1970s through the 1980s, community activist pressure contributed to the delayed opening of nuclear power plants at PECO's Limerick Generating Station and the temporary cancellation of the planned Limerick 2 nuclear power plant, PA.U.S. Anti- nuclear activists partially block establishment of nuclear power plant in Limerick, PA, 1977-82, Global Nonviolent Action Database, accessed April 6, 2016. https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/us-anti-nuclear-activists- partially-block-establishment-nuclear-power-plant-limerick-pa-1977 Both Limerick 1 and Limerick 2 were built and producing power by 1990.

The screenplay by Carrie Fisher is based on her 1987 semi- autobiographical novel of the same title. The film stars Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine, and Dennis Quaid. Plot Actress Suzanne Vale (Meryl Streep) is a recovering drug addict trying to pick up the pieces of her acting career and get on with her life after kicking a cocaine-Percodan habit; after Vale overdosed while on a date, her mother admitted her to a rehab center from the emergency room. When she is ready to return to work, her agent advises her the studio's insurance policy will cover her only if she lives with a \\"responsible\\" individual such as her mother Doris Mann (Shirley MacLaine). Suzanne is very reluctant to return to the woman from whom she struggled to escape for years after growing up in her shadow. The situation is not helped by the fact that Doris is very loud, competitive, manipulative, self-absorbed and given to offering her daughter unsolicited advice with insinuating value judgments while treating her like a child. Producer Jack Faulkner (Dennis Quaid) runs into Suzanne on the set and reveals that he is the one who drove her to the hospital during her last overdose, and the two kiss. Suzanne then agrees to go out with him. During the course of a passionate first date, he professes intense and eternal love for her and she believes every word is true. Suzanne's euphoria is short-lived, however; she subsequently learns from Evelyn Ames (Annette Bening), a bit player in her latest film, that Jack is sleeping with Evelyn as well. Still dressed in the costume she wears as a uniformed cop in the schlock movie, Suzanne drives to Jack's house and confronts him. As their argument escalates, Jack implies that Suzanne was much more interesting when she was trying to function while she was on drugs. At home, Suzanne learns from Doris that Suzanne's sleazy business manager Marty Wiener has absconded with all her money. This leads to an argument between the two women, and Suzanne storms out to go to a looping session. There the paternalistic director Lowell Kolchek (Gene Hackman) tells her he has more work for her as long as she can remain clean and sober. Suzanne arrives home and discovers that Doris has crashed her car into a tree after drinking too much wine (and Stolichnaya smoothies). Suzanne rushes to her hospital bedside where the two have a heart-to-heart talk while Suzanne fixes her mother's makeup and arranges a scarf on her head to conceal the fact she bloodied her wig in the accident. Looking and feeling better, Doris musters her courage and faces the media waiting for her. Suzanne runs into Dr. Frankenthal (Richard Dreyfuss), who had pumped her stomach after her last overdose, and he invites her to see a movie with him. She declines, telling him she's not ready to date yet. Dr. Frankenthal tells her he's willing to wait until she is. In the film's closing moments Suzanne performs \\"I'm Checkin' Out,\\" a foot-stomping Country Western number, for a scene in Lowell Kolchek's new film.

Production In discussing adapting the book for the screen, director Mike Nichols commented, \\"For quite a long time we pushed pieces around, but then we went with the central story of a mother passing the baton to her daughter.\\" He added \\"Carrie doesn't draw on her life any more than Flaubert did. It's just that his life wasn't so well known.\\" Nichols began pre-production in New York, where he assembled a group of actors to run lines from the script in order to perfect it. In return the actors, one of whom was Annette Bening, were given small roles in the movie when it filmed. Responding to questions about how closely the film's Suzanne/Doris relationship parallels her relationship with her mother, Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher stated \\"I wrote about a mother actress and a daughter actress. I'm not shocked that people think it's about me and my mother. It's easier for them to think I have no imagination for language, just a tape recorder with endless batteries.\\" In the DVD commentary she notes that her mother wanted to portray Doris but Nichols cast Shirley MacLaine instead. In her 2013 autobiography, Unsinkable, Reynolds noted that Nichols told her, \\"You're not right for the part.\\" Blue Rodeo accompanied Meryl Streep on \\"I'm Checkin' Out,\\" written by Shel Silverstein. Other songs performed in the film include \\"I'm Still Here\\" (sung by MacLaine) and \\"You Don't Know Me\\" (sung by Streep). ReceptionBox office= The film opened in 1,013 theaters in the United States on September 14, 1990 and grossed $7,871,856 on its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office. It eventually earned $39,071,603 in the US. =Critical response= The film earned positive reviews from critics and currently holds an 84% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews. The critical consensus read, \\"Uniting a pair of powerhouse talents with a smart, sharply written script, Postcards from the Edge makes compelling drama out of reality-inspired trauma\\". Metacritic gave the movie a score of 71 based on 18 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times said the film \\"seems to have been a terrifically genial collaboration between the writer and the director, Miss Fisher's tale of odd- ball woe being perfect material for Mr. Nichols's particular ability to discover the humane sensibility within the absurd.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"What's disappointing about the movie is that it never really delivers on the subject of recovery from addiction. There are some incomplete, dimly seen, unrealized scenes in the rehab center, and then desultory talk about offscreen AA meetings. But the film is preoccupied with gossip; we're encouraged to wonder how many parallels there are between the Streep and MacLaine characters and their originals, Fisher and Debbie Reynolds... Postcards from the Edge contains too much good writing and too many good performances to be a failure, but its heart is not in the right place.\\" Hal Hinson of The Washington Post said, \\"Meryl Streep gives the most fully articulated comic performance of her career, the one she's always hinted at and made us hope for.\\" He felt the film's earlier section was \\"the movie's best, primarily because Nichols is so focused on Streep. In fact, almost nothing else seems to matter to him... But while Nichols is servicing his star, he lets the other areas of the film go slack... [He] is finely attuned to the natural surreality of a movie set, but when he moves away from the show-biz satire and concentrates on the mother-daughter relationship, the movie falters.\\" Awards and nominations * Academy Award for Best Actress (Meryl Streep, nominee) * Academy Award for Best Original Song (Shel Silverstein, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Shirley MacLaine, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay (Carrie Fisher, nominee) * BAFTA Award for Best Film Music (Carly Simon, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy (Meryl Streep, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture (Shirley MacLaine, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song (Shel Silverstein, nominee) * American Comedy Award for Funniest Lead Actress in a Motion Picture (Meryl Streep, winner) * London Film Critics' Circle Award for Newcomer of the Year (Annette Bening, winner) American Film Institute recognition: * AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs – NominatedAFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs Nominees ReferencesExternal links  Postcards From the Edge at the Sony Pictures Entertainment Museum * Category:1990 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1990 comedy- drama films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films about bipolar disorder Category:Columbia Pictures films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about actors Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Mike Nichols Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Mental illness in films Category:Films with screenplays by Carrie Fisher Category:Films à clef ","title":"Postcards from the Edge (film)"},{"id":"21675581","text":"Liberté I is a 1962 French-Senegalese film directed by Yves Ciampi.

Their \\"live like there is no tomorrow, end of the world by nuclear war\\" attitude and lifestyle was documented in Ruth Taylor and Edward Mowbray's Victory Video Arts Presentation's \\"Not Dead Yet\\" in 1984. For another three and half years they continued their antics at the 26A Oxford Street warehouse (Goof World) until May 5, 1991. Spawned from this local scene were the bands 4½ Reasons For Retroactive Abortion, Brutally Honest, Ded Fuck, No Identity (No I.D.), Blasphamy, Nunoyerfuckinbiziness (N.F.B.), Armed and Hammered, B. Bob's Banned, Verboten, PolitiKILL inCOREct and the singer of the present line-up for Random Killing. The band has a notorious reputation for their excessive beer drinking, anti social outbursts and violent behaviour on and off stage as well as their followers. They were label mates with the Dayglo Abortions on God Records and Fringe Product. In November 1985, the singer Crazy Steve Goof, ran for the municipal office of Alderman Ward 6 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, under the name Steve BFG Johnson.

They were extras in many other T. and T. episodes and numerous other television series such as Night Heat, Captain Power, Street Legal, Friday's Curse, Knightwatch, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, My Secret Identity, Katts and Dog, War of the Worlds and Friday the 13th. They can also be seen in movies such as Millennium, Amerika, Dragon Hunt, Twin Dragon Encounters, Freakshow, Class of 1984, Apology, Short Circuit 2, Still Life, Pater Noster, Blindside and The Fly. The BFGs were also featured in a 1980s W5 exposé on Punk music and lifestyle, painting a primarily negative view of it. Joey Only states them as one of his first major influences after seeing them play at Punkfest in his teens.

Geological setting  The Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt is located in the Superior Boundary Zone, in Manitoba, Canada, adjacent to the Thompson Nickel Belt. The Superior Boundary Zone lies along the northwestern margin of the Archaean Superior Craton, and forms the eastern foreland of the ~1.8 billion year old Trans-Hudson Orogen. The Trans-Hudson Orogen was a continental collision that formed following the closure of the ancient Manikewan Ocean. It resulted in the juxtaposition of the Superior Craton with the amalgamated Rae and Hearne Cratons, and a number of continental fragments, including the Sask Craton. Closure of the Manikewan Ocean is believed to have begun by 1915 million years ago, though the first evidence of this ocean closure along the western Superior margin is the initiation of magmatism in the 1890 million year old Snow Lake Arc, interpreted as a subduction zone that formed outboard (towards the ocean) from the Superior Boundary Zone. Mafic to ultramafic magmatism in the Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt is contemporaneous with ongoing magmatism in the Snow Lake Arc, which implies the Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt formed along a convergent plate boundary. The Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt forms part of the ~3000 km Circum-Superior Belt, considered a mantle plume-derived large igneous province. The Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt itself predominantly consists of tholeiitic basalt and komatiite, intercalated with lesser amounts of carbonate and shale sediments, and intruded by mafic and ultramafic cumulates. These overlie a thin interval of conglomerate and sandstone, which lies unconformably on Superior Craton tonalites dated to 2792 million years old. The entire belt underwent sub–greenschist to greenschist facies metamorphism, during the Trans-Hudson Orogeny.  Winnipegosis Komatiites  Flow styles and petrography = Dendritic clinopyroxene textures in massive Winnipegosis Komatiite flows. Ol = olivine, cpx = clinopyroxene, gl = glass. Both 'swallowtail' and 'feathery' clinopyroxene dendrites are visible. The Winnipegosis Komatiites are found as a number of stacked lava flows in boreholes drilled into the Winnipegosis Komatiite Belt. Two main flow types are found: massive and differentiated flows. The massive flows have largely consistent compositions, mineral assemblages, and textures throughout. Olivine and chromite are the only phenocryst minerals and are evenly distributed within each flow. Groundmass phases include dendritic clinopyroxene, serpentinised dendritic olivine, and devitrified glass. Dendritic clinopyroxenes have spectacular textures including 'feathery' and 'swallowtail' varieties. The differentiated flows are separated into a cumulate layer at the base, and a spinifex layer at the top of each flow. The cumulate layers form by downwards sinking of olivine and chromite crystals through the lava, and have a thick layer of equant cumulate olivine overlain by a thin layer of large, skeletal 'hopper' olivine crystals. The spinifex layers form by growth of skeletal crystals from the top of the flow, and contain a range of textures and mineral assemblages, including random olivine spinifex and acicular clinopyroxene layers.

The airport is east of Río Hato. International airport In 2011 the government of Panama gave the order to proceed with a project to rebuild the airport. The restoration work included rehabilitation of the runway and airport terminal, and construction of a tunnel for the Pan-American Highway, which previously crossed the runway. The $53.2 million project was awarded through a public bidding process. The project was supervised by the Ministry of Public Works (MOP) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and lasted 14 months. President Ricardo Martinelli said the new Scarlett Martínez Airport at Río Hato would bring benefits and opportunities for area residents. The airport would allow Panama City's Tocumen International Airport to accept more flights for business and connecting flights in an effort to secure Panama's position as a hub for business and commercial activity in the region. It will serve to boost tourism along the Pacific beaches of Panama, where several beach resorts and condo developments are located. President Martinelli confirmed that the airport would be used by charter companies from the United States, Canada, and Europe. The airport was officially opened by President Martinelli on 13 November 2013. The runway is inland from the Pacific coastline. South approach and departure are over the water. The Rio Hato VOR- DME (Ident: RHT) is located on the field.

Its mission was to seize Río Hato and neutralize the 6th and 7th PDF Infantry Cos. At 01:00 on 20 December, the battalion jumped from C-130s onto the airfield at Río Hato. Both PDF companies had been alerted and fired on the C-130s with small arms and anti-aircraft guns. Despite PDF resistance, the battalion assembled, attacked the barracks, and established an airhead. By morning, the Rangers had accomplished all missions, captured 250 prisoners, and cleared the airfield for future operations. Río Hato was also the first combat target for the US Air Force F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter during Operation Just Cause. On 19 December 1989, a flight of eight F-117s lifted off from Tonopah Test Range Airport, Nevada. Their target was a large open field beside barracks housing two companies of troops belonging to Battalion 2000, an elite unit known to be fiercely loyal to Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega. The plan was for the aircraft to drop two large 2,000-pound Mark 84 bombs, colloquially known as \\"the Hammer\\" (described as \\"the world's largest stun grenades,\\" had a lethal radius of 400 feet and were capable of blowing out eardrums half a mile away), close enough to the buildings to stun the sleeping soldiers so that they could not respond to the nearby nighttime parachute landings by the 2nd Ranger Battalion and elements of the 3rd Battalion. The explosion of the bombs at a designated point of impact just 50 yards from the barracks would do just that, and fused to detonate after they had penetrated a few feet of earth, they would not cause many casualties. Unfortunately, the fog of war was in the air. It also appears that, although the Pentagon brass understood the F-117A's accuracy, they did not fully understand what situation exactly the F-117A was suited for. As the two F-117As approached their target, the wind changed direction. Moreover, a last-minute change in the attack plan and confused communications resulted in the first pilot dropping his bomb where the second was to strike. The other pilot, thinking the attack had reverted to the original plan, dropped his bomb 325 yards wide.

Overview At it is slightly larger than the adjacent Dorchester Square, with a more varied topography due to a downward slope towards De la Gauchetière Street. Place du Canada also differs from Dorchester Square in having manicured, though densely packed, pockets of flora arranged to impede direct lines of sight and diffuse pedestrian traffic. The French term place can roughly be translated as denoting a plaza, which has a different legal definition from squares or parks in Montreal. It is open twenty-four hours per day and is bordered by René Lévesque Boulevard to the North, Peel to the East, De la Cathédrale to the West and De la Gauchetière Street to the South. Photo of Dominion Square in 1927 and the 1907 Groundplan. Notice the key design differences between the square and the plaza History St. George's Anglican Church from Place du Canada Centre of the plaza with cenotaph in foreground and 1000 de La Gauchetière, Place-du-Canada and the Chateau Champlain in the background. Place du Canada was developed along with the present Dorchester Square between 1872 and 1876 and was formally inaugurated that year as Dominion Square. It quickly developed into a prestige address and major transportation hub, with streetcars, cabs, carriages (and by 1889) the Canadian Pacific Railway's Windsor Station at the southwest corner of the plaza. What had once been an informal meeting place and common green would be formalized as a pedestrian traffic corridor, linking the estates and middle class suburbs to the west and northwest with the commercial sector moving up the hill from the southeast. As an urban square, it satisfied two goals; first to provide a method of diffusing transit nodes, and second as an open manicured natural environment to provide rest, recreation and a healthy respite from the cramped industrial and business core immediately south of the area. After the cholera outbreak of 1851, the area had been the site for several hastily convened cemeteries of various denominations. Beginning in 1854, the City of Montreal began exhuming the bodies from the Saint-Antoine Catholic Cemetery to be relocated to Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery on the northeast slope of Mount Royal. This allowed for the extension of Dorchester Boulevard (now René-Lévesque Boulevard) to the west and the development of this area. Several large properties were surveyed and offered for sale. In 1869, St. George's Anglican Church was built on the along the western side of the plaza, which was a former Jewish cemetery that had also relocated to Mount Royal, near the entrance of the Mount Royal Cemetery. Soon, many other Protestant denominations would build churches in the same area—beginning the trend that would establish the site as a prestige address. That same year, it was suggested that the City of Montreal purchase the former Catholic cemetery and transform it into a public park in order to prevent the movement of bodies of cholera victims. The following year (1870), the land was purchased and landscaping was done. In 1872, it was given the name Dominion Square. This name came from Canada, which consisted of the four provinces that make up the Canadian Confederation in 1867. In the 1870s, Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral took up its form as a one-fifth replica of St. Peter's Cathedral along De la Cathédrale forming the eastern side of the plaza. By 1889, Windsor Station would take up its prominent position at the corner of Peel and De la Gauchetière, with the plaza providing a path directly to the corner opposite. In 1895, the Macdonald Monument would be constructed under a stone baldachin in the centre of the northern third of the plaza. His baldachin is replete with copper bas reliefs of the various industrial and agricultural trades practised in the Dominion he first commanded. While the plaza is arranged along the skewed cardinality characteristic of Montreal, John A. Macdonald looks more west-northwest than north. The monument is purposeful; under a canopy created by the union of industry and agriculture, Canada's chief securely observes the vast expanse that awaits the command coming from Montreal. In 1967, when Canada celebrated its centennial anniversary, the southern portion of Dominion Square was renamed and given the name of Place du Canada. From this point, the southern and northern section of the park had different names. Place du Canada was the site of the Unity Rally, a massive political rally held on October 27, 1995, in downtown Montreal, where an estimated 100,000 Canadians from in and outside Quebec came to celebrate a united Canada, and plead with Quebecers to vote \\"No\\" in the 1995 Quebec independence referendum (three days before the vote).Garsten, Ed. \\"Canadians rally for a united country\\".

In 2012, following the redistricting process, Gibbons was redrawn into the 100th District, which included his home in Hallandale Beach and stretched from Fort Lauderdale in Broward to Indian Creek. Gibbons was opposed in the Democratic primary by Sheldon Lisbon, a former Surfside Town Commissioner and son of Holocaust survivors. During the course of the campaign, Lisbon sent out a controversial campaign email that said, \\"[District 100] is primarily a Jewish district that composed of residents like us,\\" which contrasted with the fact that Gibbons is African-American. The Anti-Defamation League blasted Lisbon for the email, which they called \\"divisive\\" and \\"contrary to the ideal of including all Americans in the political process.\\" Gibbons ultimately defeated Lisbon in the primary, winning 55% of the vote to Lisbon's 45%. In the general election, Gibbons was elected to his final term in the House unopposed once again. Broward County Commission In 2014, Gibbons was term-limited and was unable to run for re-election in the Florida House of Representatives, so he instead ran for the Broward County Commission in the 6th District, which consists of southeastern Broward County, stretching from Pembroke Pines to Hollywood and Hallandale Beach, as incumbent County Commissioner Sue Gunzburger could not seek re-election. He faced former Hollywood City Commissioner Beam Furr, and during the campaign, came under fire for whether he actively lived in the county or not. In 2009 and 2010, the County Property Appraiser's Office determined that he \\"falsely claimed his Hallandale Beach condo was his permanent residence,\\" and his wife, Ava Parker, continues to maintain her residence and business in Jacksonville, where they are raising their children, while she spends most of her time in Lakeland as the Chief Operating Officer at Florida Polytechnic University. The Sun- Sentinel, though praising Gibbons as a \\"strong candidate,\\" ultimately endorsed Furr, praising his \\"demonstrated courage in looking out for taxpayers.\\" Ultimately, Furr comfortably defeated Gibbons, receiving 57% of the vote to Gibbons's 43%.

Mobility models are used for simulation purposes when new network protocols are evaluated. The random waypoint model was first proposed by Johnson and Maltz. It is one of the most popular mobility models to evaluate mobile ad hoc network (MANET) routing protocols, because of its simplicity and wide availability. In random-based mobility simulation models, the mobile nodes move randomly and freely without restrictions. To be more specific, the destination, speed and direction are all chosen randomly and independently of other nodes. This kind of model has been used in many simulation studies. Two variants, the random walk model and the random direction model are variants of the random waypoint model. Description of model The movement of nodes is governed in the following manner: Each node begins by pausing for a fixed number of seconds. The node then selects a random destination in the simulation area and a random speed between 0 (excluded) and some maximum speed. The node moves to this destination and again pauses for a fixed period before another random location and speed. This behaviour is repeated for the length of the simulation. Simulation of model BonnMotion is one of the tool to generate mobility scenarios based on random waypoint model and many other mobility models including random walk model, random direction model, etc. Orientation-based Random Waypoint In the context of mmWave communication, optical wireless communication, and Terahertz networks, the orientation of a device is also important (in contrast to the radio frequency networks). Therefore, it is essential to incorporate the orientation of the device with the mobility model. This concept was first introduced in the paper entitled \\"Modeling the Random Orientation of Mobile Devices: Measurement, Analysis and LiFi Use Case\\". https://github.com/mdsoltani/ORWP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OQYVaiqD1k NotesReferences * Category:GSM standard Category:Wireless networking ","title":"Random waypoint model"},{"id":"21675865","text":"In computer science, alternating-time temporal logic, or ATL, is a branching- time temporal logic that extends Computation tree logic (CTL) to multiple players. ATL naturally describes computations of multi-agent systems and multiplayer video games. Quantification in ATL is over program-paths that are possible outcomes of games. ATL uses alternating-time formulas to construct model-checkers in order to address problems such as receptiveness, realizability, and controllability.  Examples  In ATL, we can write logical formulas as \\\\langle \\\\langle \\\\\\\\{a, b\\\\\\\\}\\\\rangle \\\\rangle F p that expresses the fact that agents a and b have a strategy to ensure that the property p holds in the future, whatever the other agents of the system are performing.  Extensions and variants  ATL* is the extension of ATL, as CTL* extends CTL. ATL* allows to write more complex temporal objectives, for instance \\\\langle \\\\langle \\\\\\\\{a, b\\\\\\\\}\\\\rangle \\\\rangle (F p \\\\land G q). Belardinelli et al. proposes a variant of ATL on finite traces. ATL has been extended with context, in order to store the current strategies played by the agents. ATL* is extended by strategy logic. ATL has been generalized to include epistemic features. In 2003, van der Hoek and Woodridge proposed ATEL is the logic ATL augmented with an epistemic operator from epistemic logic. In 2004, Pierre-Yves Schobbens proposed variants of ATL with imperfect recall. In ATL we cannot express properties about individual objectives. That is why, in 2010, Chatterjee, Henzinger and Piterman introduced strategy logic, a first- order logic in which strategies are first-order citizens. Strategy logic subsumes both ATL and ATL*.

On September 16, 1953, a Convair 240 propliner flying this route crashed while attempting to land at Albany Airport in upstate New York, killing all 28 people on board.  Accident  The Convair had arrived at Bradley Field from Boston Airport at 6:57 am for a scheduled stopover. At that time, weather at Albany was below airline landing minima, but was forecast to improve within limits by the flight's scheduled arrival time. The flight left Bradley at 7:14, and once in the Albany terminal area, found poor visibility preventing landings, with several aircraft ahead of it in a holding pattern. The flight joined the holding pattern, circling while awaiting weather conditions legal for landing.American Airlines Flight 723 at Aviation Safety Network At 7:50, a special weather observation reported thin obscurement, with an overcast cloud ceiling estimated at above the airport. Horizontal visibility was , obscured by fog. Two aircraft left the holding pattern, making attempts to land, but both made missed approaches. A third landed at 8:16 following an instrument approach to runway 19. After the latest airplane's successful landing, Flight 723 was cleared to execute the same instrument approach to runway 19. At 8:19, the flight advised the tower that because the aircraft's flaps could not be lowered, they would be abandoning their approach and returning to the holding pattern.Record 19530916-0 at Aviation Safety Net At 8:30, the Albany control tower reported: \\"All aircraft holding Albany. It now appears to be pretty good for a contact approach from the west. It looks much better than to the north,\\" the north being the direction from which approaches to runway 19 had been attempted. Flight 723 was cleared for a contact approach to runway 10. On final approach, while still miles west of the airport, the Convair descended too low, and at an altitude of , struck a set of three -tall radio masts arrayed east to west. The right wing struck the center tower of the three, then the left wing struck the east tower. Seven feet of the outer panel of the right wing including the right aileron and control mechanism from the center hinge outboard together with 15 feet of the left outer wing panel and aileron separated from the aircraft. Ground impact occurred beyond the east tower. At this point, the aircraft had rolled to a partially inverted attitude. The nose and left wing struck the ground first. The rest of the airplane fell to earth in short order and caught fire. The aircraft narrowly missed hitting a trailer park on the Albany-Schenectady road. All 28 occupants on board (25 passengers, two pilots, and a flight attendant) were killed. At the time of the accident, a special weather observation reported thin scattered clouds at 500 feet, with a ceiling of broken clouds estimated at 4500 feet. The visibility had improved to in fog.  Investigation  The Civil Aeronautics Board investigated the accident and issued a report wherein they identified the probable cause of the accident: \\"During the execution of a contact approach, and while maneuvering for alignment with the runway to be used, descent was made to an altitude below obstructions partially obscured by fog in a local area of restricted visibility.\\" Samuel Bloom of Troy, NY had a reservation to be aboard this flight, however, he missed his originating flight from Albany to Boston on September 15 because of heavy traffic on the way to the airport and opted to drive to Boston instead. The heavy traffic ultimately saved his life. This same man missed a ferry during WW2 and was forced to fly.

Plot Hans Schnier is the \\"Clown\\" of the novel's title. He is twenty-seven years old from a very wealthy family. At the beginning of the story he arrives in Bonn, Germany. As a clown, he had to travel across the country from city to city to perform as an artist. He always sees himself as an artist. His home is in Bonn, so he has to stay in hotels when he is not in Bonn. The woman he has been living with, Marie, has left him to marry another man, Zupfner. Therefore Hans has become depressed. He wants to get Marie back from Zupfner, and also has serious financial problems. He describes himself as a clown with no church affiliation. His parents, devout Protestants, sent him to a Catholic school. He met Marie in school and fell in love with her. Although Marie was a Catholic, she agreed to live with him. They never got legally married, largely because Hans would not agree to sign a paper agreeing to raise his children as Catholics. He did not even want to get a marriage license, because he thought that they were for people who did not go to church. While living together, they never had any children. Marie always stated that even though she was living in sin, she was still a Catholic. Once in high school, Hans saw her holding hands with Zupfner, but she told him that Zupfner was only a friend. Hans brought her along on every trip and took her everywhere he went. After five years, there was a Catholic conference near their hotel in a German city. Marie wanted to breathe some Catholic air and ask Hans to go there. Hans had a performance at the same time. When they arrived late at night, he fell asleep. The next morning, he discovered Marie was gone, but had left a note. He never saw her again. The note read: “I must take the path that I must take.” Hans has a mystical peculiarity, as he can detect smells through the telephone. As he explains, he does not only suffer from depression, headaches, laziness and that mystical ability, but also suffers from his disposition to monogamy. There is only one woman that he can live with: Marie. His reversal of values is clearly shown in his statement: \\"I believe that the living are dead, and that the dead live, not the way Protestants and Catholics believe it.\\" When he goes to his home in the Bonn, the first person he meets is his millionaire father. He remembers all of his memories from the past. He had a sister named Henrietta. The family forced her to volunteer for anti-aircraft duty seventeen years ago and she never came back. He also has a brother named Leo. He recently converted to Catholicism and is studying theology in college. Hans tells his father about his financial problems. After his father offers him to work for him for a relatively low wage, Hans rejects the offer. He tells his father that he and his brother never benefited from the wealth of their family. War has affected the family. They were never given enough food or pocket money. Many things were regarded as extravagances. Thus, he lacks any positive memories of the past, which may have been a factor that drove him, at age 21, to leave home to become a clown. He calls many of his relatives in Bonn, but nobody can help him. He soon discovers that Marie is now in Rome on her honeymoon. This news only depresses him more. Finally, he calls his brother, Leo, who promises to bring him money the next day. But, in the middle of the conversation, Leo says that he has talked to Zupner about something and that they became friends. Because Leo has converted to Catholicism, his father no longer supports him. Therefore, Leo is not in a good position financially. In anger, Hans tells him not to come to bring the money. At the end, Hans takes his guitar to the train station and plays as people throw coins into his hat.  Social issues  Apparently, this novel reflects the German society under Hitler and in the postwar years. It criticises many aspects of society such as political and religious beliefs, marriage issues, the conflict between Catholics and Protestants, the effect of war on families (a millionaire one), and many other things in the society of Germany. Heinrich Böll revealed all of those postwar problems and related them to some psychological aspects that harmed a man with some weird beliefs like Hans. Böll sought to focus on the role of the Roman Catholic Church, to exhibit its role in Europe. He includes a depiction of establishment moralities and politics in the novel. The church limited the relations between Catholics and Protestants, and it categorized German society into religious groups. Although the Protestants are shown as richer people in the novel, Böll portrays society was mainly under the influence of Catholics, especially in political and moral issues. The protagonist Hans does not get any benefit from either group. He is shown as a kind of pagan, but a pagan who has some Protestant and Catholic relatives and participates in some ceremonies of both religions — although his beliefs are quite different from either. Even his clown's art does not win approval from some political parties, although he is a great performer. But after he injures his left knee, he is unable to perform as well as before. In conclusion, he describes the age in this statement: \\"If our era deserves a name, it would have to be called the era of prostitution.\\"  Conflicts  There are some conflicts in the story, mainly on character versus society. In fact, it was religion, that takes his wife away and saw him ineligible to have a Catholic wife. Also, this novel indicates that only a written license determines the marriage of a couple. The second important conflict is character versus himself. Hans had his unique ideology about life. However, after Marie left him, he became desperate. He started to talk to himself and to become mentally ill. For example, when he wanted to put on his makeup, he started to stare at himself in the mirror for minutes and he thought that there is someone else looking at him. There was a kind of phobia when he looked at the mirror. Other than that, he could easily accept the offer of his father or do not care about the friendship of his brother, Leo, with Zupfner, but he was loyal to himself and he did not sell his ideologies for money. Character versus character can be considered in the story of Hans trying to win Marie back. At that point he had conflict with Zupfner and even Marie. As well, there were conflicts with his father and his brother as well, for the financial issues and for their past.  Themes  There are some major themes based on the social conflicts in the novel. The first one states that the Christian ethic and spirituality was corruptive during the post war years in German society or even in Europe. Many examples in the Social Issues section support this statement. The second major theme is the loss of traditional familial and social unity. Hans was a clown but from a millionaire family. His family never supported him, even when he came back and asked for money. His brother came out of the support of the family when he converted to Catholicism. Furthermore, regarding Hans lost his sister during the war, his family preferred not to waste their wealth for their two sons. On the other side, Marie left him after five year because of the effects that forced her to feel sinful about her life and leave him to marry another person. All of these examples indicate the social unity and the families have some main problems. The third theme is there is no place for an artist with different ideologies from the people ruling the society. Although during the postwar years Germany did not have a dictator like Hitler to classify the people in the society, the effect of those years made the society do it automatically and indirectly based on ideologies of people. Reactions Following publication in 1963, the novel generated polemics in the press for its negative portrayal of the Catholic Church and the CDU party. Böll's liberal views on religion and social issues inspired the wrath of conservatives in Germany.Frank N. Magill (2013) The 20th Century A-GI: Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 7, p.350 The conservative press even attacked Böll's 1972 Nobel prize award, arguing that it was awarded only to \\"liberals and left-wing radicals.\\" Notes and references Further reading  *Böll, Heinrich.

It has a very deep ventral profile with its anal fin set back. This species has wing-like pectoral fins that often extend to half of the fish's body length. In general, coloration is silver with black patches and stripes but, depending on the angle of light, colors may vary. A stripe that is usually gold stretches horizontally from the gill cover the base of the tail. Black-winged hatchetfish can reach up to 1.5 inches in length.  Distribution and habitat  Black-winged hatchetfish live in the calm streams and pools of the Orinoco and Negro region in South America.  Diet  Black-winged hatchetfish are omnivorous. They can be fed live as well as flake foods. In the wild, they feed mainly at the surface for insects, but can also eat crustaceans.  In the aquarium  Black-winged hatchetfish are peaceful fish that will do well with many other types of tropical fish such as smaller species of catfish and tetras. Make sure that there are small floating plants. Cover every hole at the top of the aquarium because in the wild, hatchetfish catch insects by jumping out of the water.

She served in the Crimean War. Construction The St Jean d'Acre was a Surveyor's Department design. The design was approved on 15 February 1851, and she was ordered the same day. Her keel was laid down at Devonport Dockyard in June 1851, and she was launched on 23 March 1853. Her construction used materials collected for a 90 gun Albion class sailing two- decker line-of-battle ship to be called St Jean d'Acre, which was ordered in 1844, but never laid down, and suspended in 1845. Her design was a stretched version of the James Watt 91 screw two-decker. She was a successful experiment. In service she was very highly regarded. The Conqueror was designed as a slightly elongated St Jean d'Acre, and was laid down on the same slip at Devonport on 25 July 1853. Service St Jean d'Acre was commissioned at Plymouth by Captain Henry Keppel on 21 May 1853.HMS St Jean d'Acre online history She was completed for sea on 20 September 1853.

This engine was instead fitted to the Duke of Wellington and made 1,979 ihp on trials. from the iron-frigate Simoom, but it was decided that as St Jean d'Acre was a new ship, they would order a new engine. She was therefore fitted with a 600 nhp Penn two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion trunk engine. The cylinders were 70.75 in diameter, with a stroke of 3.5 ft. On her Stokes Bay trials on 3 December 1853 the engine generated 2,136 ihp. In May 1854 she formed part of the Allied Fleet serving in the Baltic against Russia in the Crimean War. In 1855, she joined the fleet in the Black Sea. On 7 July 1855 Captain George King took command. In September 1856, St Jean d'Acre took Earl Granville to the coronation of Czar Alexander II at St Petersburg. Earl Granville was leader of the Liberal party in the House of Lords, and head of the British delegation to Alexander II's coronation. She paid off in 1857 at Plymouth. Her second commission was from 4 February 1859 to 13 September 1861. St Jean d'Acre served in the Channel and the Mediterranean. She was initially commanded by Captain Thomas Pickering Thompson, until he was invalided out, and Captain Charles Gilbert John Brydone Elliot took command on 26 September 1860.

Many Assyrians (estimates of fluent speakers range from 500,000) still speak, read and write various Akkadian-influenced dialects of Eastern Aramaic, labelled by linguists as Northeastern Neo-Aramaic and Central Neo-Aramaic. They are predominantly adherents of several denominations of Syriac Christianity,Minahan 2002, p. 209 notably the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Syriac Catholic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. Some are followers of the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church. A minority are secular or irreligious. Annual celebrations Assyrians celebrate many different kinds of traditions within their communities, with the majority of the traditions being tied to religion some way. Some include feast days (Syriac: hareh) for different patron saints, the Rogation of the Ninevites (, Baʿutha d-Ninwaye), Ascension day (Kalo d-Sulaqa), and the most popular, the Kha b-Nisan (, 'First of April'). Some of these traditions have been practised by the Assyrians for well over 1,500 years. = Yawma d-Sahdhe ('Martyrs Day') = A stylised Ṭabbakh (, 'August') in Syriac with the number 7 is often the symbol marking Martyrs Day. The Simele massacre (, Pramta d-Simmele) was the first of many massacres committed by the Iraqi government during the systematic targeting of the Assyrians of northern Iraq in August 1933.

August 7 became known as Martyrs Day (, Yawma d-Sahdhe) or National Day of Mourning by the Assyrian community in memory of the Simele massacre as it was declared by the Assyrian Universal Alliance in 1970. In 2004, the Syrian government banned the Assyrian political organization and the Assyrian community of Syria from commemorating the event, and threatened arrests if any were to break the ban.Good Morning Assyria, Zinda Magazine. On August 7, Assyrians in the homeland and in the diaspora gather together and share poems about the incident, reveal new artwork, etc. =Resha d-Nisan ('Start of Spring' or 'Assyrian New Year')= The Assyrian new year festival, known as Resha d-Nisan (literally 'Head of April'), is celebrated on the first day of spring and continues for 12 days.

After the formation of the Turkish state in the 1920s, Resha d-Nisan along with the Kurdish Nowruz were banned from being celebrated in public. Assyrians in Turkey were first allowed to publicly celebrate Resha d-Nisan in 2006, after organisers received permission from the government to stage the event, in light of democratic reforms adopted in support of Turkey's EU membership bid.Assyrians Celebrate New Year for First Time in Turkey (SETimes.com) =Baʿutha d-Ninwaye ('Fast of Nineveh')= The Fast of Nineveh (, Baʿutha d-Ninwaye, literally 'Rogation of the Ninevites') is a three-day celebration that is composed of prayers and fasting that Assyrians of the Ancient Church of the East, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Syriac Catholic Church (as well as The Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church in India) consider sacred. The word baʿutha (ܒܥܘܬܐ) is a Syriac word for 'pleading,' and from this meaning we receive the title of this commemoration. This annual observance occurs exactly three weeks before the start of Lent. This tradition has been practised by the Syriac Christians since the 6th century. According to legend, in the 6th century, a plague inflicted the Nineveh plains (in modern-day northern Iraq). The plague was devastating the city and the villages surrounding it, and out of desperation the people ran to their bishop to find a solution. The bishop sought help through the scriptures and came upon the story of Jonah in the Old Testament. An Orthodox depiction of Jonah being swallowed by the fish In the Old Testament story, God sent the prophet Jonah to warn the city of Nineveh of great destruction unless they repent for their sins: \\"the word of the Lord came to Jonah the son of Amathi, saying: Arise and go to Nineveh, the great city, and preach in it: for the wickedness thereof is come up before me.\\" Jonah did not wish for Nineveh to be saved since they (the people of Nineveh) were the enemies of Israel and preferred Nineveh to be destroyed. Instead of listening to God, Jonah fled to Tarshish, across the Mediterranean Sea. During his voyage, a violent storm occurred. The other sailors feared the boat would be completely destroyed and kill everyone if they did not get rid of Jonah, so they decided to throw Jonah overboard. As soon as Jonah hit the water, a giant fish swallowed Jonah whole. Jonah found himself in the dark stomach of the fish. Jonah began to pray earnestly for God to save him and, for three days and nights, Jonah prayed and asked for forgiveness for his disobedience. On the third night the fish became violently ill and swam near to the seashore where it vomited Jonah onto the beach. Jonah, thankful that he had been spared, started on the journey to Nineveh. Reaching the walls of Nineveh, he began preaching to people as he walked through its streets, \\"In forty days God will destroy this city because of your great sins.\\" The king of Assyria became disturbed at the message that Jonah preached. He called his people together and commanded them to wear sackcloth clothing and to let neither man nor animals eat as the people prayed and repented of their wicked ways. All of the people of the city cried and prayed and asked God to forgive them for their sins. The city then was not destroyed. To this day, Assyrians of all three denominations—Catholic, Orthodox and Church of the East—still observe the fast for three days each year. =Somikka ('Holy Halloween')= Somikka shares some common aspects with the American festival of Halloween, but its meaning is different. The main purpose of Somikka is to motivate and discipline Assyrian children to observe Lent by scaring them into fasting, when people would abstain from eating animal products for the seven weeks preceding Easter. The evening before the fast begins, what is called 'Somikka night' (Layle d-Somikka), small groups of young men dress in Halloween-like clothes, wear masks and also carry accessories such as wooden swords and shields. These men then would knock on Assyrian homes and scare the children into fasting. The parents in return would give the young men \\"Somikka money\\" (or, traditionally, food items) and tell their children that this was to bribe Somikka off them. They would also warn them that if they broke their fast during Lent, Somikka would come and punish them with misery and a hard life. This form of discipline is seen as part of raising children to grow up into God-fearing and upright adults. Assyrian villages in Urmia had another custom relating to Lent. The head of every family would stick seven coloured feathers into a large onion, the feathers representing the seven weeks of fasting. He would then tie the feathered onion with a string and hang it from the ceiling of their living room, where it would spin every time there was a draft when the door was opened. This attracted attention and served to remind the children of the fast. Every Sunday night he would remove, ceremoniously, one feather to indicate that one week of fasting was over, until all the feathers were gone by Easter night, the last day of fasting. =Kalo d-Sulaqa ('Bride of the Ascension')= The legend of Kalo d-Sulaqa tells of a young Malik Shalita, governor of the Assyrian homeland’s capital Mosul, who was first noticed by Tamerlane after he had successfully fought and defeated his initial attack on the city. The battle is then described as freedom fighters, both Christian and Muslim, defended against the Mongol attack. It was during this time that, according to legend, Malik Shalita’s wife organised Assyrian women dressed in white, and was given the responsibility to collect provisions from the nearby towns in order to feed the men fighting at the front. Having heard the fate that had befallen their countrymen in Tikrit and Mardin, they knew very well the fate in store for them if they were to lose this battle. Instead of running and hiding, the women prepared for the battle and joined the ranks of the defenders against unfavourable odds. The historical account is in keeping with the legend, as both describe a brutal battle of attrition, in which both men and women joined together and defended themselves against Tamerlane's attack. Malik Shalita and his wife—according to the legend dressed in white—are recorded as having been killed in this battle. The Assyrian historian Arsanous states that the young boys and girls represent the dead young men and women who ascended to heaven because they died for the cause of Christianity and in defence of their homeland. The tragic nature of the 1401 event had left such an indelible impression on the minds of the survivors that they remembered the final battle and have honoured the memory of the fallen by re-enacting the camaraderie of the Assyrian men and women who died defending their homeland. There are many traditional practises that Assyrians observe when celebrating Kalo d-Sulaqa (Ascension Day). Most commonly, in Hakkari, prior to the First World War, girls in each village would gather and choose the prettiest one among them to be the Kalo d-Sulaqa ('the Bride of the Ascension') for that year. She would be dressed in a traditional Assyrian wedding costume and then paraded around the village singing and asking for walnuts and raisins, which they would then share amongst themselves in a feast held afterwards in honour of the 'bride.' Assyrians would celebrate this day like any other feast, with music, dancing, food and drink, but also with a few differences. Apart from the little girls dressed as brides, there was also a custom practised by Assyrians living in Hakkari, where ropes were tied to strong branches of large trees. After this was done, all those present would attempt to climb one, and any not doing so would mean bad luck for them, while anyone reaching the end of the rope and the branch would have the best of luck for the coming year. This was done to represent the Ascension of Jesus and the eventual resurrection of the dead and final judgement. This custom is seldom practised today apart from certain areas in the northernmost extremities of Iraq. In Urmi, on the other hand, it was customary for the little girls in the villages to dress as brides and when doing their rounds of their villages would also ask for pennies or trinkets. This is a reflection of the generally greater wealth of the Assyrians in the plains of that region. It is also said that the very same custom was used during fierce battles. Young girls, dressed as brides, were ordered to take provisions to the men fighting on the battlefield. Their mothers, knowing that they may never return, used this custom to instill courage in their young daughters. In Syria, young girls and boys would join together and form a couple, dressed as bride and groom, and then go from door to door, singing. They were usually rewarded, not with money or candy, but with wheat, rice, fruits, and so on. At the end of the day, the children would go out to a field to cook and eat what they had collected. This custom, particular to members of the Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church, survives in these communities worldwide and is marked by a party, often women only. It is also a new custom to hold a mock wedding reception complete with khigga, slow dance, dinner, and cake, the only difference being that the bride, groom, best man and maid of honour are all young girls. Marriage rituals Assyrian wedding Assyrian rituals consist of many different types of elements that have shaped today's modern rituals for the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week and consisted of different rituals for each day. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last for two to three days while Assyrian weddings in the diaspora about one or two days. During the wedding reception, most women have a handkerchief to dance with different colours and noises to distract evil spirits. =Blanket ritual= A week before the marriage, all the women of the neighbourhood and the women in the family go to the house of the bride and make her a large blanket. Everybody had to make sure they sewed a bit of that blanket. So the needle would be passed from one woman to the other and this way all the women sewed a bit. The younger women would dance around it and the older women would sing and dance khigga. During the party food and sweets are served, and the party ends when the blanket was done. =Khyapta/Zyapta d-Khitna ('Washing/Pushing of the Groom')= Shortly before the wedding, all the groom's male relatives and neighbours go to his house and cut his hair and shave his face. The groom's male relatives wash him from head to toe, symbolically cleansing him of 'evilness.' A young boy is usually bathed first (typically by his mother or aunts), then the groom takes a shower or bath afterwards. =Niqda ('Bridewealth')= Bridewealth is commonly practised, even among those who reside in the Western world. The tradition would involve the bridegroom's family paying the father of the bride. The amount of money of the bridewealth is reached by negotiation between groups of people from both families. The social state of the groom's family influences the amount of the bridewealth that is ought to be paid. When the matter is settled to the contentment of both menages, the groom's father may kiss the hand of the bride's father to express his chivalrous regard and gratitude.Assyrian Rituals of Life-Cycle Events by Yoab Benjamin =Mpalatta d-Kalo ('Bringing Out of the Bride') = A tradition symbolic of the bride leaving the home of her parents. Usually the bride is in her home and the groom's family visits to take her out of the home and to the church. While in the house, the women sing traditional lilyane while dola ('drum') and zurna ('flute') is played as they dance. Before the bride leaves the house, a member of the bride's non-immediate family stands at the door and receives an amount of money from a member of the grooms family (usually the father or a brother). The amount is decided by whoever is holding the door. =Burakha ('Blessing')= The wedding tradition where the bride and groom are blessed by a priest in a church. The burakha traditionally lasted about four hours, but more recently the event goes for about one hour. Pins in the shape of two crosses are usually placed on the groom's back. There are some details during the ceremony that differ from village to village. To ward off evil spirits, the Assyrians of Baz are known to have someone poke the groom with a needle to ward off any evil spirits while Assyrians from Tyari make noise with the cutting motion of scissors.http://triptych.brynmawr.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2FBMC_Weddings&CISOPTR;=625&DMSCALE;=29.06977&DMWIDTH;=600&DMHEIGHT;=600&DMMODE;=viewer&DMFULL;=0&DMOLDSCALE;=6.61376&DMX;=0&DMY;=0&DMTEXT;=&DMTHUMB;=1&REC;=8&DMROTATE;=0&x;=63&y;=173 At the end of the burakha as the bride and groom are coming out of the church, dola and zurna is played while rice, candies, and coins are thrown at the bride and groom and people take part in traditional Assyrian dances. =Henna= Henna is mud-like material that is prepared on the day before the wedding. On the night before, people (traditionally only women) gather at the house of the bride and fill a bowl with henna. In some areas, whoever holds the bowl with the henna will dance with it around the others. The groom and bride each put a little finger in the bowl where they are tied to each other by a ribbon. In other areas, everyone is given a turn to wrap his finger with henna, and after everyone, the person that is getting henna in his hand starts the chant of praise for the future couple, as everyone else follows him. Funeral ritualsTraditional= The burial rituals of the Assyrians is described by Surma D'Bait Mar Shimun and the manner by which Assyrians of the highland cared for their dead relatives resemble what Olmsted wrote about how the ancient Assyrian cared for theirs. Surma wrote: \\"In some districts—as in Tkhuma for instance—food is also placed on the graves and in this valley the graves are often made with a little niche in the side of them both for this purpose and for the putting of the light.\\"S urma D 'beit-mar Shimoun, \\"Assyrian Church Customs and the Murder of Mar Shimoun\\", Mar Shimoun Memorial Fund 1983 p.40 About the burial customs of the ancient Assyrians, Olmsted writes: \\"always the lamp was left in a niche, and even the smoke can still be seen. A large water jar, a jug, and several dishes formed the remainder of the equipment needed for the after-life...\\" A.T. Olsmtead, \\"History of Assyria\\" The University of Chicago Press 1968 third edition p.625 Surma further adds; On the morning of the resurrection day before day light Assyrians in the highland visited the graves of their loved ones and lighted tapers on their resting site. The usual greeting at this time was \\"light to your departed\\". =Contemporary= In the modern tradition, the mourning family host guests in an open house-style just after a loved one passes away. Only bitter coffee and tea are served, showcasing the sorrowful state of the family. Symbolically, some will not drink the coffee in front of them at all. On the funeral day, a memorial mass is held in the church. At the graveyard, the people gather and burn incense around the grave as clergy chant hymns in the Syriac language. The closest female relatives traditionally bewail or lament (bilyaya) in a public display of grief, with some beating their chest, as the casket descends. Other women may sing a dirge or a sentimental threnody (jnana, which are short, rhymed chants) to passionately heighten the mood of the mourning at the cemetery, similar to an Indian oppari. Zurna and dola may be played if the departed is a young, unmarried male.Assyrian Rituals of Life-Cycle Events by Yoab Benjamin During all these occasions, everyone is expected to dress in complete black, passively informing the community that they have recently buried a loved one. Following the burial, everyone would return to the church hall for afternoon lunch and eulogy. At the hall, the closest relatives sit on a long table facing the guests (akin to a bridegroom's table at a wedding) as many people walk by before leaving shaking hands, offering their condolences. At the hall, dates and halva may served to offer some \\"sweetness\\" in the bitter grieving period. On the third day, mourners would customarily visit the grave site with a pastor to burn incense, symbolising Jesus' triumph over death on the third day, and 40 days after the funeral (representing Jesus ascending to heaven), and in conclusion one year to the date. Mourners also wear only black until the 40 day mark, with no jewellery and would typically not dance or celebrate any major events for one year.Troop, Sarah. “The Hungry Mourner.” Modern Loss, 22 Jul 2014.

Assyrian cuisine  Typical Assyrian cuisine Assyrian cuisine is the cuisine of the indigenous ethnic Assyrian people, Eastern Aramaic-speaking Syriac Christians of Iraq, northeastern Syria, northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey. Assyrian cuisine is primarily identical to Iraqi/Mesopotamian cuisine, as well as being very similar to other Middle Eastern and Caucasian cuisines, as well as Greek cuisine, Levantine cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Iranian cuisine, Israeli cuisine, and Armenian cuisine, with most dishes being similar to the cuisines of the area in which those Assyrians live/originate from. It is rich in grains such as barley, meat, tomato, herbs, spices, cheese, and potato as well as herbs, fermented dairy products, and pickles. The primary difference between Assyrian and other Middle Eastern cuisines is that alcohol is rather popular, with several brewing traditions specifically in the form of arak, wheat beer, and organic wine being prevalent amongst them. Unlike in Jewish cuisine and Islamic cuisines in the region, pork is allowed as Assyrians are Christians, however, it is not widely consumed in the Arab countries, Turkey or Iran because of restrictions upon availability imposed by the Muslim majority.

About 60 percent of the 1.2 million population of Mauritius is of Indian origin, many them from Bihar, with Bhojpuri as their mother tongue. Bihari Mauritians were mainly from the Gaya, Chhapra, Bhojpur and Gopalganj and East and West Champaran districts. In those early days of Migration, the labourers referred Mauritius as 'Marich'. Amitav Ghosh wrote an acclaimed novel set in this period, based on extensive research, called the 'Sea of Poppies'. This fictional account tells of a ship, called 'The Ibis', which brought the Bihari bonded labourers to Mauritius. The main characters who embark on the ship include a widow saved from enforced Sati by a man of lower caste, the daughter of a famous French botanist and a former aristocrat sentenced to penal transportation after going bankrupt. It also describes the devastation of the farming community in the region by the monopolistic British East India Company. According to the book, many small land owners were forced to cultivate poppies to produce the opium that was trafficked to China. This created a supply of hungry and impoverished Bihari migrants who were desperate enough to brave the hellish journey to Mauritius and even more distant colonies of the empire. Navin Ramgoolam, the former Prime Minister of Mauritius is from a Bihari Mauritian family. Social stratification Though the island is divided on ethnic and religious grounds, 'Hindu' Mauritians follow a number of original custom and tradition, quite different from those seen in the Indian subcontinent. Some castes in 'Mauritius' in particular are quite unrecognizable from a subcontinental perspective, and may incorporate mutually antagonistic castes from Indian setting into a single group.The title 'Rajput' is primarily of Shudra castes in Mauritius , which was usurped by this group in nineteenth century.The 'vaish' are the largest and most influential caste group on the island , in which Koeris, Kurmi, Yadav, Teli, Bania etc are included.The former Brahmin elites together with former Kshatriya are called 'Babuji' and enjoy prestige conferred by high caste status , though politically they are marginalized and their place has been taken by the castes who identify themselves as 'vaish'.

Each time a reference is made to that block the counter is increased by one. When the cache reaches capacity and has a new block waiting to be inserted the system will search for the block with the lowest counter and remove it from the cache.Silvano Maffeis.

ACM SIGMETRICS Performance Evaluation Review, Vol. 21, No. 3 * Ideal LFU: there is a counter for each item in the catalogue * Practical LFU: there is a counter for the items stored in cache. The counter is forgotten if the item is evicted. Problems While the LFU method may seem like an intuitive approach to memory management it is not without faults. Consider an item in memory which is referenced repeatedly for a short period of time and is not accessed again for an extended period of time. Due to how rapidly it was just accessed its counter has increased drastically even though it will not be used again for a decent amount of time. This leaves other blocks which may actually be used more frequently susceptible to purging simply because they were accessed through a different method.William Stallings. Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles 7th Edition. 2012 Moreover, new items that just entered the cache are subject to being removed very soon again, because they start with a low counter, even though they might be used very frequently after that.

Location The temple is from the city centre. Sree Bhuvaneswary Temple is surrounded by the sacred river Achankovil, which has its origin in the Achankovil mountain ranges. The name \\"Valamchuzy\\" is derived from the fact that the river circumvents the temple on three sides. Due to the action of the river over the past 3,000 years, large tracts of land belonging to the temple have been washed away. The temple presently is well protected from floods. Formerly this area was under dense forests, and remnants can still be seen in the Sarpakavu (sacred serpent grove). The Sarpakavu is home to a large variety of rare medicinal herbs. Illegal sand mining from the river is posing a danger to the Sarpakavu. As elsewhere, the great floods of 1096 had repercussions in Pathanamthitta, and they caused severe damage to the temple. However, after the floods had receded much reclamation and maintenance work were undertaken by the temple authorities with the active participation of the government and the landlords near the temple. A bund was constructed to make access to the Sree Bhuvaneswary Temple easier. The temple continued to be under the patronage of the Velluvettuvelil Madam family until 1974. They served as the priests. Later on, the temple administration passed to the senior members of the 14 Karas hailing from Pathanamthitta municipality, Pramadam, and Mylapra Panchayats. A Devasom council and a team of 14 executives are elected every two years from these 14 Karas. The administration is on the lines of the Indian Parliament. Legend Legend has it that a devotee brought a flower from Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple that was the incarnation of the goddess Bhuvaneswary. The devotee received a divine inspiration that he should install the flower at Valamchuzy, where the river Achankovil circumvents the place from three sides. The residents of the surrounding area gathered together and decided that a temple should be built there to install the goddess Bhuvanaswary. The devotee and his long line of successive generations continued to act as the torch bearers of the temple. The sword and the Chilambu brought from Kodungalloor are displayed at the temple. The Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple and Valamchuzy temple are similar in several aspects. It is believed that animal sacrifice existed here at one point. Festivals Rudrapongala, held in the Malayalam calendar month of Kumbham on the Bharani days, constitutes the main offering to the deity. Many devotees from all over the country throng to this shrine during the Makarabharani festival. It is believed that if appindy is ceremoniously carried by the devotees, it will cure them from all forms of incurable diseases and sorrows. The Padayani, held in the Malayalam calendar month of Meenam, is celebrated with utmost devotion and fervor. Newborn babies are brought in cradles and placed in front of the goddess. This ritual is specific to this temple, and it attracts devotees from every corner of Kerala and beyond. The birthday of the Goddess is celebrated on the Bharani day, in the Malayalam calendar month of Makaram. The flag hoisting signalling the start of the festival is held on the Pururuttathy day of Makaram, and concludes with the Aaraattu on the tenth day. The most auspicious day is on the fifth day of the festival, which coincides with the birthday of the goddess Bhuvanaswary. This particular day is marked by a lot of celebrations and festivities.

History The Designated Providers of the US Family Health Plan have been delivering healthcare to military beneficiaries for over 30 years. In 1981, Congress enacted the Omnibus Reconciliation Act designating certain former U.S. Public Health Service facilities as Uniformed Services Treatment Facilities (USTFs). The following year, the Department of Defense assumed responsibility for the USTF program from the Department of Health and Human Services. In 1993, the USTFs developed a managed care plan, called the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan, and in 1996, became “TRICARE Designated Providers”—the first DoD-sponsored, full-risk managed health care plan and the first to serve the military 65 and older population (other than on a limited demonstration basis). The Plan began offering the TRICARE Prime benefit the following year. In 2001, the name was shortened to US Family Health Plan. Awards Having long served military families, the US Family Health Plan in 2008 was awarded an Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences for a 2007 public service announcement series, “Now is Our Time to Serve”. This joint public service initiative with the non- profit National Military Family Association (NMFA) urged viewers to “support, befriend, remember and appreciate” America's military family members.

The album was released on 6 September 1985 in Japan. Its release was preceded by the pop single \\"Suteki ni Dancing\\" (trans. Dancing Is Great), used for an advertising campaign by Coca-Cola. Overview The single \\"Suteki ni Dancing\\", used for the TV spots of the Coca-Cola campaign, gave the band a wide and immediate visibility all over Japan. A Coca-Cola can is depicted on the back cover of the album to remind the link to the band's sponsor. The album, mixed at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London by Haydn Bendall (Camel, Alan Parsons Project, Kate Bush, Toyah) and the Japanese media coverage of the event, pushed the band to an even higher level of popularity. During their sojourn in London, Show-Ya had the occasion to play live in the clubs that usually hosted bands from the new wave of British heavy metal scene, making their name known to the British musical press. The album presents a large variety of compositions, ranging from pop rock to hard rock, showing the classic rock influences of the young musicians but a sound not yet distinctive. Mixing the album, a large emphasis was generally given to vocals and keyboards, keeping the volume of the guitars very low. The result is a distinctly soft tone, quite different from the loud live performances of the band. \\"Talon of King\\" is an adaptation of a song from Japanese metal band Helen and \\"Touch Me\\" is a cover of The Doors' song from the album The Soft Parade. The title of the song \\"Touch Down\\" was adopted by Show-Ya's official fan club.

He served in King William's War, helped found and govern Williamsburg and several times served as a vestryman of Bruton Parish Church. Early and family life Born in James City County to the former Sarah Lucy Bullock and her husband, George Augustus Norvell, Hugh Norvell married multiple women named Sarah. The former Sarah Besouth (1674-1704) gave birth to sons George (1693-1786), Hugh Jr. (1699-1759) and William Norvell (1695-1757) as well as daughters who married and became Elizabeth (Mrs. George) Baskerville (1692-1732) and Mary (Mrs. William) Lightfoot, and Sarah and James who died without having children (probably as children).https://ancestors.familysearch.org/en/LVCY-HB7/capt.-hugh- norvell-1669-1719 The family descends from Thomas Norvell, born about 1591 and who died in Warwick County, Virginia before August 17, 1635, where he was an original proprietor. Thomas is thought to have married Mary Frye, either the sister or daughter of William Frye of James City County; they lived on Skiff's Creek in 1630. The Norvells were of Scots origin. Norvell is a shortened form of the name de Normanville. It dates to 1190 when John de Normanville was recorded on a grant of land by Bernard de Hauden. The family coat of arms as described in Burke's General Armory depicts three black martlets (swallows or swifts) on a silver diagonal band across a black shield. In the 17th century there were many spelling variations of the name: NORWELL, NOVELL, NOEL, NORVILL, NEVILL, and NORVELLE; but by the 18th century, it was generally spelled NORVELL. The earliest Norvell in the New World appears to be William Norvell, who in 1619 had a plantation on land that became Isle of Wight County, Virginia. A plantation called \\"Oyster Banks\\" was owned by William Norvell near the boundary of Isle of Wight and Nansemond counties in 1656, when the boundary line between the counties was run. Other early arrivals included: Richard Norvell, 1638; William Norvell, 1639; Peeter Norrell, 1647; Walter Norrell, 1650; Mary Norvell, 1653; in Warwick County; and Thomas Nowell in 1654 in Charles City. Planter Norvell ran tobacco plantations using enslaved labor across the York County boundary near Williamsburg. His name appears in a patent from the Virginia Land Office, June 16, 1714, as adjoining the lands of Nicholas Valentine. In James City County he is listed on the quit rent roll of 1704 as owning of land.Today called \\"McLaws Circle\\"; located immediately southwest of the intersection of routes 199 and 60. See Grace Norvell, \\"Maps of Norvell Neighborhoods,\\" Mss1N8296, The Library of Virginia. Norvell appeared as the guardian (prochain ami) of his daughter Elizabeth in a 1694 lawsuit against Mr. Robert Harrison and Mrs. Elizabeth Archer over the payment due to Elizabeth for an enslaved woman. Civic and political activities Hugh Norvell was named as a trustee of the land on which Williamsburg was to be built, under an \\"Act Directing the Building of the Capitol and the City of Williamsburg\\" passed by The General Assembly of Virginia on June 7, 1699. One of the clauses of this Act appointed Lewis Burwell, Phil Ludwell, Junr., Benjamin Harrison, Junr., James Waley, Hugh Norwell [sic], and Mongo Ingles, Gentleman-Feofees or Trustees for land appropriated to the uses of the City. These gentlemen sold the half-acre lots into which the city had been laid out. Norvell was still a Feofee/Trustee in 1705 when the Act Directing the Building of the Capitol and the City of Williamsburg with additions was passed. In 1703 he served on the Grand Jury of the Virginia Admiralty Court and later became a county officer. He is mentioned as a juror in a 1710 trial involving eight Tuscarora Indians. He was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses about 1719. Church activities Norvell served on the Vestry of Bruton Parish Church several times beginning in 1694, especially in 1710-1715, during which time he was President of the Vestry and on December 5, 1710 conveyed the call to Rev. Dr. James Blair as the parish's Rector (an invitation that was accepted). Norvell also served on a committee to welcome Rev. Dr. Blair as President of the College of William and Mary. Norvell also served on the committee that between 1710 and 1715 oversaw building of the new church that remains today as a National Historic Landmark. Death and legacy Hugh Norvell died at his Williamsburg home on October 25, 1719 and is buried at the Bruton Parish Church cemetery. The historic church displays two plaques honoring his service. The plaque on Pew No. 7 honors \\"Hugh Norvell, Vestryman, 1710-1715, George Norvell, vestryman, and William Norvell, vestryman, 1775.\\" The other plaque names Hugh Norvell as one of the members of the vestry who erected the church building from 1710-1715. His son George Norvell moved to Hanover County, Virginia and also served on the vestry of St. Paul's parish. His grandson William Norvell served as a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, as well as served multiple terms in the Virginia House of Delegates before becoming a Virginia judge and later revived the law school at the College of William and Mary.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Encyclopedia_of_Virginia_Biography_volume_1.djvu/333 Some of Captain Hugh Norvell's descendants include U.S. Senator John Norvell of Michigan, William Walker, the Filibusterer in Nicaragua; and Oliver Hardy, the actor-comedian and movie star, son of Emily Norvell Hardy.

Location Located on the Western Ghats of the Sahyadri Range, Perunthenaruvi is famous for the waterfalls there. The waterfalls are known for their wide area, rather than their height. It is located in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala state. The stream later unites with the Pamba River. It is beautiful and dangerous at the same time.

In fact, the arrangements and compositions are tighter as the result of a real group effort, while the sound of the album is very similar to what could be heard at a Show-Ya's live show at that time.

It was never put on for an audience and is Fielding's single print-only play. As in The Welsh Opera, the author of the play is identified as Scriblerus Secundus. Secundus also appears in the play and speaks of his role in composing the plays. In The Grub Street Opera the main storyline involves two men and their rival pursuit of women. The play is Fielding's first truly political play and first ballad opera. Unlike The Welsh Opera, the play deals with morality from the beginning. Additionally, it linked to Fielding's previous attacks on the London theatre and inept writers. Fielding also used the virtue of female servants as a point of humour and to discuss morality, while using the effeminacy and dominance by women to mock various characters and discuss the issue of gender roles. Critics viewed The Grub Street Opera positively, noting it to be a definite improvement on The Welsh Opera. Background Fielding created three theatrical versions of The Grub Street Opera.Rivero 1989 p. 76 Of these, one was performed at a Haymarket theatre, but only in rehearsals. The play originates as an expanded version of The Welsh Opera. The revision had a puff piece in the 21 May 1731 Daily Post saying, \\"We hear that the Grubstreet Opera, written by Scriblerus Secundus, which was to have been postponed till next Season, will, at the particular Request of several Persons of Quality, be perform'd within a Fortnight, being now in Rehearsal at the New Theatre in the Hay-market.\\"Hume 1988 qtd p. 96 Later, it was advertised again in the 5 June 1731 Daily Post as being rehearsed, but the 11 June edition stated that one of the performers was sick and the 14 June edition said that the play would be postponed indefinitely.Hume 1988 pp. 96–97 It was never produced, and The Grub-Street Opera is the only play by Fielding that existed only as a printed play.Rivero 1989 p. 88 It is unknown as to why the play was never put on for an audience, but it is possible that it was not performed because Fielding was either legally prevented to perform it by the British government or he was bribed to not perform it.Goldgar 1976 p. 113 John Henley, a defender of Robert Walpole and Walpole's government, discussed the incident in his poem \\"Hay- Market Actors of the design'd Grub-street Opera\\" (published in the 8–15 June 1731 edition of his newspaper, Hyp-Doctor). In it, he gloated over the play being kept from performance and stated that the government did not accept the play. He followed this in the 15–22 June edition with an attack upon Fielding.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 118–119 Like E. Rayner's printing of The Welsh Opera, Rayner printed The Genuine Grub-Street Opera without Fielding's knowledge in August 1731. The print edition was based on the second script. Fielding responded with claims of piracy and was upset that his satirical attack, primarily upon Walpole's administration, became public knowledge. Fielding eventually printed his own version of the play, dated 1731.Rivero 1989 pp. 88–89 However, it is possible that it was not actually printed until June 1755, shortly after Fielding's death, by his friend Andrew Millar. Regardless of the date, the connection of Fielding to the edition establishes this later version as the only authoritative edition.Morrissey 1973 pp. 19–23 Cast The cast, according to the printed version, is as follows:Fielding 2004 II p. 69 * Sir Owen Apshinken – a gentleman of Wales, in love with tobacco. Played by Mr. Furnival. * Master Owen Apshinken – his son, in love with woman kind. Played by Mr Stopler. * Mr. Apshones – his tenant. Played by Mr. Wathan. * Puzzletext – his chaplain, in love with women, tobacco, drink, and backgammon. Played by Mr. Reynolds. * Robin – his butler, in love with Sweetissa. Played by Mr. Mullart. * William – his coachman, enemy to Robin, in love with Susan. Played by Mr. Jones. * John – his groom, in love with Margery. Played by Mr. Dove. * Thomas – the gardener. Played by Mr. Hicks. * Lady Apshinken – wife to sir Owen, a great housewife, governante to her husband, a zealous advocate for the church. Played by Mrs. Furnival. * Molly Apshones – daughter to Mr. Apshones, a woman of strict virtue. Played by Miss Patty Vaughan. * Sweetissa – waiting-woman, – Women of strict virtue, in love with – Robin. Played by Mrs. Nokes. * Susan – cook, – Women of strict virtue, in love with – Will. Played by Mrs. Mullart. * Margery – housemaid – Women of strict virtue, in love with – John. Played by Mrs. Lacy. * Scriblerus – Introduces the play, not cast.Fielding 2004 II p. 70 Plot In The Welsh Opera, Fielding incorporated his editorial persona, Scriblerus Secundus, as a figure to connect the play with its companion piece, The Tragedy of Tragedies. However, in The Grub Street Opera Fielding drops all connections with The Tragedy of Tragedies.Rivero 1989 pp. 94–95 Scriblerus does introduce the play, as in the original, but he describes the moral purpose that motivates the play instead of being a comical connection with another work. After revealing Fielding's design in the play, Scriblerus leaves the stage.Rivero 1989 pp. 103–104 The play describes the Apshinken family and the pursuits in love of Owen and his butler, Robin. Owen pursues four women and Robin pursues only one. However, Robin is pursuing Sweetissa, whom Owen wishes to have for himself. To separate the two, Owen forges a letter which works until Robin's virtue proves his own devotion to Sweetissa. Although Robin lacks virtue in most regards, such as his stealing from his master, he is able to marry Sweetissa and,Rivero 1989 p. 104 at the end of the play, Fielding breaks from his own tradition of comedic marriages by having Owen and Molly marry.Rivero 1989 p. 98 Themes The Grub Street Opera is the first truly political play and also Fielding's first ballad opera. As such it owes a lot to Fielding's model, John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Unlike his other Scriblerus plays, Fielding's Scriblerus persona in The Grub-Street Opera is deeply connected to Gay instead of Gay's fellow members of the Scriblerus Club, Alexander Pope or Jonathan Swift. As in The Welsh Opera, this connection served as a means to put forth a general political view and deal with politics in a more critical way unlike any of Fielding's previous plays. The play is a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy.Rivero 1989 pp. 90–92 However, the play does not pick a side but pokes fun at everyone. He also kept his personal political views out of the play.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 115–116 Fielding hoped to remove any moral ambiguity found within The Beggar's Opera. Unlike The Welsh Opera, the rewrite deals with morality at the very beginning.Rivero 1989 p. 101 Similarly, the play focuses on problems within the literary community; the title links the play with the Grub Street Journal, a periodical that satirised inept writers that frequent Grub Street. It also links the play with Fielding's previous attacks on the London theatre and inept writers. In particular, Fielding satirises bad imitations of Gay's The Beggar's Opera and those who do not understand what Gay's play was originally about especially in regards to its mockery of the Italian opera tradition.Rivero 1989 pp. 95–97 The virtue of the female servants is a point of humour in the play. Traditionally, female servants were depicted in comedic works as those lacking virtue and sexually willing towards their masters. The constant discussion of virtue and the upholding of virtue on the part of the servants is used in juxtaposition of that tradition to amuse an audience. However, their discussion also serves as a means for Fielding to discuss morality in a manner similar to Daniel Defoe's use of Moll Flanders or Samuel Richardson's use of Pamela. Unlike those later novelists, Fielding incorporates the humorous juxtaposition to allow for a mixture of humour and truth.Rivero 1989 pp. 105–106 The issue of gender roles and the virtue of various characters is extended further within The Grub Street Opera to include the use of effeminacy and dominance by women to mock various characters. In particular, the way the men are dominated by their wives is made fun of and shown as problematic.Campbell 1995 p. 21 Sources Betrand Godgar believed that, in the play, \\"Fielding unambiguously jeered at politicians and court figures, reducing them to the level of a Welsh family with its domestic squabbles.\\"Godgar 1976 p. 110 Fielding transitioned from the Pulteney and Walpole feud (see discussion at The Welsh Opera -Sources) to parodying the royal family when he expanded The Welsh Opera into The Grub-Street Opera. Unlike the feud, the depiction of the royal family was risky, especially seeing as how Fielding had no direct knowledge of any actual actions taking place with the royal family. Instead, he based his knowledge on rumours.Fielding 2004 pp. 4–5 As for specific characters, Sir Owen Apshinken represents George II of Great Britain, Lady Apshinken represents queen consort Caroline of Ansbach, and the Apshinken son represents Frederick, Prince of Wales. The help also represent individuals involved in politics, for example, the gardener, Thomas, represents Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, their groom, John, represents John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, the butler, Robin, represents Sir Robert Walpole, and the coachman, William, represents William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. Although these depictions may have caused problems for Fielding, the Battestins believe that \\"Fielding's satire is fairly innocuous when compared to the egregious standard of scandal-mongering and vituperation current at the time. And – an important circumstance often overlooked – his satire is even-handed in roasting both parties alike.\\"Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 115 Response Although the play was never performed, its revisions reflect how Fielding sought to cater to what the audiences saw was popular in the earlier version, The Welsh Opera, which including adding more songs. Although not performed on stage, the songs became popular on their own. This was especially true in the case of \\"The Roast Beef of Old England\\".Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 113 Edgar Roberts, when examining the quality of the songs of the play, declared that \\"it is fair to say that The Grub-Street Opera is musically the most satisfactory of all the ballad operas written in the decade following The Beggar's Opera.\\"Roberts 1968 p. 75 Likewise, Robert Hume determined that The Grub-Street Opera was \\"one of the finest ballad operas of its time\\".Hume 1988 p. 104 Other views focused on other aspects, including the possible topical statements; John Loftis argues that \\"this afterpiece in the form of ballad opera seems, in its rendering of Court gossip, to be a dramatization of Lord Hervey's Memoirs\\".Loftis 1963 p. 105 Thomas Cleary wrote that the \\"Grub-Street Opera is a much better play than the two-act Welsh Opera. It is so much improved that the impossibility of staging it [...] must have infuriated Fielding.Cleary 1984 p. 51 Thomas Lockwood believes that both The Welsh Opera and The Grub-Street Opera are characterized by a \\"spirit of fun\\" but are complicated by the 18th-century politics that gave them birth.Fielding 2004 II p. 1 See also * The Roast Beef of Old England – song from the Grub Street Opera * The Welsh Opera – a precursor to The Grub Street Opera, also by Fielding * Scriblerus Club – an informal club of satirists NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

As a ballad opera, it contained 19 songs and was a collaboration with Mr Seedo, a musician. It first ran on 1 January 1732 at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. The play tells the story of a man in love with a girl. She claims she has won a lottery, however, making another man pursue her for the fortune and forcing her original suitor to pay off the other for her hand in marriage, though she does not win. The Lottery mocks the excitement of the lottery and those who sell, rent, or purchase tickets. It was highly successful and set the tone for Fielding's later ballad operas. The play was altered on 1 February 1732 and this revised edition was seen as a great improvement. Background After Fielding returned to work for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery. It was a companion piece, in the form of ballad opera, that first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside of Addison's Cato. The piece contained 19 songs and was a collaboration with \\"Mr Seedo\\", a musician.Hume 1988 pp. 118–119 It is uncertain as to when Seedo first started working with Fielding, but he may have started with Fielding during 1730 at the Little Haymarket theatre.Roberts 1966 pp. 179–190 The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. Fielding altered the play on 1 February 1732 by removing four songs and adding seven midway through the play. The revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783.Hume 1988 pp. 119–120 The play was published 7 January 1732 by Watts.Paulson 2000 p. 35 Cast Cast of characters:Hume 1988 p. 199 * Lovemore – Charles Stoppelar * Chloe – played by Kitty Clive * Jack Stocks – played by Theophilus Cibber * Ticket Renter – played by John Harper Plot Fielding's prologue begins with his definition of various genres and his understanding of \\"Farce\\", even though many of his works are more ballad opera than actual farce:Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 106 :As Tragedy prescribes to Passion Rules, :So Comedy delights to punish Fools; :And while at nobler Game she boldly flies, :Farce challenges the Vulgar as her Prize. :Some Follies scarce perceptible appear :In that just Glass, which shews you as you are. :But Farce still claims a magnifying Right, :To raise the Object larger to the Sight, :And shew her Insect Fools in stronger Light. Lovemore loves a girl named Chloe. Instead of accepting him as a suitor, Chloe travels into London with the hope that she will win a 10,000 pound lottery prize.Pagliaro 1998 p. 81 She convinces herself so much of this fate that she begins to boast of having a fortune already. Jack Stocks, a man wanting that fortune, takes on the identity of Lord Lace and seeks her in marriage. It is revealed that the ticket was not a winner. Lovemore, a man who has romantically pursued her through the play, offers Stocks 1,000 pounds for Chloe's hand, and the deal is made. In the revised edition of the play, more characters are added who desire to win the lottery and there is a stronger connection made between Chloe and Lovemore. The revised version ends with Jack, her husband at the time, being paid off to no longer have claim to Chloe as his wife even though everyone knows that she did not win. Themes The Lottery pokes fun at the excitement surrounding the lottery held during the fall of 1731. In particular, Fielding mocks both those who sell or rent tickets and those who purchase the tickets. The portrayal of the ticket vendors emphasised the potential for deceit and the amount of scams that were possible. It also attacked how the vendors interacted with each other in a competitive spirit.Dudden 1966 pp. 98–99 Fielding expects that his audience understands how the lottery operated and focused on how gambling cannot benefit gamblers. Others, such as Hogarth in The Lottery (1724), rely on similar images of Fortune as in Fielding's plays. However, Fielding differs from Hogarth by adding a happy ending to the portrayal of the lottery system.Paulson 2000 pp. 92–93 This was not the only time Fielding relies on the lottery system; he also includes ticket vendors in his play Miss Lucy in Town and in his novel Tom Jones.Dudden 1966 pp. 97, 99 Sources The lottery that the play is directly connected to took place during November–December 1731. It was part of the State Lottery that was in place since 1694. The system continued to be lucrative for the British Parliament over the 18th-century. The system in place during 1731 consisted of 80,000 tickets sold with only 8,000 connected to prizes. The top prize, of which there were two available, was 10,000 pounds. The drawing of the numbers lasted for forty days and consisted of numbers being picked from a large container that are then determined as either a winner or a \\"blank\\", which means that no prize would be received. This lottery system came under fire because, it was argued, they promoted gambling and took advantage of people. Problems grew worse when second hand vendors began to sell the tickets at high prices.Dudden 1966 pp. 96–97 Response The play was a success and earned Fielding a great deal of money.Paulson 2000 p. 71 F. Homes Dudden believed that \\"The Lottery, with its well-drawn leading character, its clever little songs, and its humorous yet biting criticism of lottery abuses, scored an immediate success, and, indeed, for many years continued to be a favourite with the public.\\"Dudden 1966 p. 99 Edgar Roberts emphasises the importance of The Lottery as the play that \\"set the pattern for his ballad operas during the next three years at Drury Lane: happy, lightly satirical, and for the most part nonpolitical.\\"Roberts 1963 39–52 Robert Hume believes that the play was a \\"rollicking little ballad\\" and that the revised version \\"is a major improvement\\".Hume 1988 pp. 118–120 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

She was influential in the American Divine Healing Movement in the late 19th century. Additionally, she played a significant role in promoting Faith healing and Pentecostalism throughout her writings. She was the first to open a healing home on the West Coast.  Childhood  Montgomery, the fourth of eight children, was born on April 8, 1858, and spent her early days in Buffalo, New York, where the revival of 1857-1858 was underway. The family were Episcopalians and Montgomery was confirmed to the church in 1869. During her childhood years, she lost two of her siblings to severe illnesses. Because of her own deteriorating health, at fifteen years old, her brother invited her to live with him in another area of New York which had a better climate. During her time there, she worked for an editor of a health magazine. After a return home to help care for several sick family members, she moved to another part of New York with the same brother. During her year stay, she started up a Sunday school with the neighborhood children. When she returned home, she was healthy enough to return to her own schooling. Introduction to faith healing One cold winter day in 1876 as she was walking to school, she slipped and fell hard on the icy ground. She continued to school that day but shortly after her health began to rapidly deteriorate. Soon after the accident, on January 6, 1877, Carrie found out that she had spinal fever. What \\"seemed to be tuberculosis of the spine\\" developed into \\"tuberculosis of the blood\\" which forced Carrie to give up school and her aspirations of becoming a school teacher. Her days in bed grew into months and then years. Being \\"prostrated with spinal complaint…the trouble extended to all the large joints. Her hips, knees, and ankles could not be touched, even by herself without great suffering.\\" For over eleven months she could not even sit up on her own. She could not even handle light or much time with people. A small pillow under her head felt \\"like a block of stone.\\" Her days in bed grew into months and then years. At a time when those around her were expecting her death at any moment, even her mother allowing friends into her room to say their last goodbyes, her father came across a unique article in the local newspaper. The article told of the account of Mrs. Edward Mix, a \\"colored woman\\" named Sarah from Connecticut, being healed of tuberculosis through the prayers of Mr. Ethan Allan. Sarah Freeman Mix is the first recorded African- American female healing evangelist in the U.S. Upon hearing about Mix's healing, Carrie asked her sister Eva to send Mrs. Mix a letter requesting healing prayer from her. To their surprise, the Judd family received a quick response from Mrs. Mix. The prayer found in James 5:15 was central to the letter as well as an encouragement to act in faith regardless of how she felt. In the letter was also a specific set apart time where both sides would pray at the same time for Carrie’s healing. Even though no one showed up to Mrs. Mix’s regular prayer meeting that day due to poor weather, she and her husband prayed for Carrie nonetheless. During their set apart time of prayer, on February 26, 1879, Carrie engaged in a spiritual battle. Finally, she felt it was time to act in faith and get up out of bed. Unassisted, she walked over to the nearby chair. Her healing process was ignited from that day forward. By April of that same year, she was well enough to use the stairs and go outside to visit the neighbors. In the years that followed, she corresponded with Mrs. Mix. At one point Mrs. Mix even came to visit and they went out into the city to pray for healing of those who were sick.  Ministry  News of Carrie’s healing spread and she soon became the talk of the town. People heard of her story in newspapers and wrote letters to her asking if she was really healed. Many people came to her to hear of her story and to receive prayer. Her compassion was stirred and she opened up a room in her parents’ home to receive such people. Soon after, she decided to open up a healing home in Buffalo, New York in April, 1882. This was one of the first healing homes in New York and was used as a model for many future healing homes in the country. Carrie was also a prolific writer and her poetry was published in The Magazine of Poetry and Literary Review in 1894.\\"The Magazine of poetry and literary review, 1894, page 65. Accessed on July 2, 2015] Based on the prayer found in James 5 and her own healing experience, she wrote The Prayer of Faith (1880) to encourage others to embrace and take hold of their healing, despite receiving criticism and discouragement including from people she trusted. This book was significant because it was among some of first prominent books written on the subject of divine healing in her time. In 1881, she also initiated a magazine called Triumphs of Faith which emphasized holiness and divine healing. She continued to write and edit this journal for over 60 years and Sarah Mix also contributed to the journal. Carrie became an itinerant preacher and teacher and traveled internationally throughout her life to share her story of healing and encourage people in their faith. Her zeal to spread the somewhat unpopular message of divine healing at that time put her in a category of a radical evangelical. Through her close friendship with Albert Benjamin Simpson she eventually became a part of the forming of the Christian and Missionary Alliance (CMA). Simpson continually encouraged and created space for her to step out and share her story. Carrie transcended denominational barriers as she shared her story, speaking at Baptist (including The Temple in Old Orchard Beach, Maine in 1910), Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Salvation Army, Alliance, and other gatherings. Not too long after the Civil War and in a time before Martin Luther Ling Jr. came to the scene, she also preached to African Americans. In 1889 Carrie experienced some persecution and even some churches shutting their doors to her, first because she was a woman preacher and second because she spoke to African Americans.  Marriage  In 1890, Carrie married a successful businessman, George S. Montgomery, who was previously healed of diabetes and afterwards had \\"consecrated himself to the Lord’s service.\\" He brought her from Buffalo, New York to Oakland, California. With her husband’s constant support and great provision of resources, she opened up an orphanage and a training center there and also worked in Beulah Heights, California. Then she worked in Cazadero, California, where she formed Shalom Training School in 1894 and Cazadero Camp in 1927, which was leased to neighboring cities. The Montgomerys also owned and operated a public utility water system in Cazadero. She also worked closely with the Salvation Army. The Montgomery’s also built The Home of Peace which is still there to this day. This was the first healing home on the West Coast and through Carrie’s move to California, she was one of the first early advocates of divine healing on the west side of the nation. In several histories of the Divine Healing Movement, Carrie is the only woman listed among the other key shapers in the movement of Charles Cullis, A. B. Simpson, A. J. Gordon, William E. Boardman, Andrew Murray, and other men. She and her husband also became honorary officers in the Salvation Army before the turn of the 20th century.  Pentecostalism  When birth of American Pentecostalism arose through the Azusa Street Revival in California in 1906, Carrie, although hesitantly at first, eventually received her what Pentecostalism refers to as \\"Spirit baptism\\" in 1908, at age 50. Evangelist Francisco Olazábal was converted to Pentecostalism by the Montgomerys in 1916. This experience deeply impacted her life and spirituality and the theme of Spirit baptism became integrated into her magazine and her teaching. Because of her great reputation, she was used as a bridge between Evangelicals and Pentecostals. To the Evangelicals, she had a voice to introduce Spirit baptism to them without all the fanaticism and to the Pentecostals, she remained balanced and didn’t overemphasize the practice of speaking in tongues. By 1914, she was part of what would later be called the Assemblies of God, starting as a charter member before becoming an assemblies minister in 1917. Throughout her life, Carrie became personal friends with Charles Cullis, A.B. Simpson, William Booth, Minnie Abrams, Pandita Ramabai, Elizabeth Baxter, Maria Woodworth-Etter, and William J. Seymour. She was connected to Smith Wigglesworth, Aimee Semple McPherson, John G. Lake, Finis E. Yoakum, George Peck, and many other prominent Christian leaders in her time. In 1922, she published Heart Melody and her autobiography in 1936. She continued her ministry including involvement with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union until her death on July 26, 1946 and was succeeded by her only child, Faith Berry. She was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland, California.

The Mk F3 is the smallest and lightest 155 mm motorized gun carriage ever produced, and because of its size and low cost it has found considerable success on the export market. Constructed on a modified AMX-13 light tank chassis, the Mk F3 is novel in incorporating room inside for only two of the eight required crewmen (the others riding in support vehicles). This allows the 155 mm gun to be placed on a smaller chassis than that employed by other armies, but exposes the outside crew members to arms fire. Design A French Army Mk F3 in battery, with a Berliet GBC 8KT support truck, during a military exercice in 1980. The Mk F3 is essentially a modified AMX-13 light tank chassis with the rear idler removed and the hull modified to accept a 155 mm cannon and its recoil, elevating and traversing mechanisms, including two rear spades which reversed into the ground to give added stability when firing. The gun is accompanied by a 6x6 truck or an AMX-VCA that carries the rest of the 8-men gun crew and 25 projectiles. The F3 fired the standard 155 mm high-explosive projectile, and is also capable of firing the smoke, illumination and rocket- assisted rounds. The effective range is 20,050 m with 43.75 kg HE rounds. The hull of the Mk F3 is of all-welded steel armour measuring 10 to 20 mm, providing the two occupants with protection from small arms fire and shell splinters. The layout is conventional, with the driver's compartment at the front on the left, engine compartment to the right and the 155 mm gun above at the rear. A splashboard is mounted at the front of the hull to stop water from rushing up the glacis plate when the vehicle is fording streams. A replacement road wheel is often carried on the glacis plate. The driver has a single-piece hatch that opens to the left, and is provided with three daylight periscopes, the centre one of which is replaceable by an image intensification (or thermal) periscope for night driving. The commander is seated behind the driver and has a two-piece hatch that opens to either side. The commander is also provided with three daylight periscopes. The Mk F3 design lacks of nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) protection for its crew. The torsion bar suspension consists of five single rubber-tyred road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and the fifth roadwheel acting as the idler. There are three track-return rollers. The first and last road wheel stations have hydraulic shock-absorbers. The steel tracks can be fitted with rubber pads if required. Stowage containers are provided along each side of the upper part of the hull. Standard equipment includes a loudspeaker and a cable reel with 400 m of cable.  Variants  *The Mk F3 has been offered by GIAT with Detroit Diesel 6V-53T and Baudouin 6F 11 SRY engines. *RDM Technology upgraded variant: in 1991, the Dutch company RDM Technology was contracted to upgrade 22 Mk F3s in service with Qatar. They were fitted with a Detroit Diesel Model 6V-53T turbocharged diesel engine and a new transmission. * The CITER 155mm L33 gun reused many components of the Mk F3. *155 mm Mk F3 with 155 mm/39 calibre ordnance: proposed design with a longer gun. History AMX-13 Mk F3 155mm of Kuwaiti Army in Syria 1973. In the early 1950s the French Army desired to replace their aging American M41 howitzers with an indigenous design, based on the AMX-13 light tank chassis. The Mk F3 entered production in 1959. Its low cost and light weight made it a very popular weapon system on the export market. It was exported to a number of South American and Middle Eastern countries, and remained in production until the early 1980s, long after the French Army had themselves converted to the fully enclosed GCT 155mm self-propelled artillery system. =Production= The 155 mm gun was designed by the Atelier de Construction de Tarbes (ATS), and the chassis by the Atelier de Construction Roanne (ARE). Integration of the gun with the chassis and all firing trials were undertaken by the Etablissement d'Etudes et de Fabrications d'Armement de Bourges (EFAB). Because the ARE was tooling up for production of the AMX-30 main battle tank, production of the whole AMX-13 tank family, including the F3 155 mm self-propelled gun, was transferred to Mécanique Creusot-Loire. Total production of the Mk F3 amounted 621 guns. Beginning in 1993, Mécanique Creusot-Loire became Giat Industries, and in 2006 was renamed Nexter. In 1997 France supplied the last 10 155 mm Mk F3 systems to Morocco. = Combat history = It was used by Al Jahra Force during Kippur War on Syrian front. Morocco used its mk F3 during Western Sahara War.

The Old Norwegian Homily Book (AM 619 4to) is one of two main collections of Old West Norse sermons. The manuscript was written around 1200, contemporary with the other principal collection of sermons, the Old Icelandic Homily Book; together they represent some of the earliest Old West Norse prose. The two homily books have 11 texts in common, all of which are based on earlier exemplars. Two of these texts, the 'Stave-church Homily' and a St. Michael’s Day sermon, are also found in one of the oldest Icelandic manuscript fragments, AM 237a fol., which was written around 1150.McDougall, David (1993) \\"Homilies (West Norse)\\" in Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia ed. Pulsiano, Phillip and Wolf, Kirsten, pp. 290-2 Linguistic features suggest that the manuscript was written in Western Norway. The Benedictine monasteries of Sancti Albani at Selja and Munkalíf in Bergen, and the Augustinian house of Jónskirkja, also in Bergen, have been proposed as possible candidates for producing the manuscript. The latest publication on the Norwegian homily book, however, argues that it belongs to a group of Old Norwegian and Latin books which were presumably not intended for a Benedictine community, and that it most likely was written in the town of Bergen itself, either at Jónskirkja or the Cathedral Chapter.Haugen, Odd Einar, and Ommundsen, Åslaug, eds. (2010) Vår eldste bok. Skrift, miljø og biletbruk i den norske homilieboka. Bibliotheca Nordica, vol. 3. Oslo: Novus. The core of the Old Norwegian Homily Book is a series of homilies ordered according to the church year, but it also contains material which is not homiletic in character, such as a complete translation of Alcuin’s De virtutibus et vitiis, as well as commentaries on the Lord’s Prayer and the service of the mass. For this reason, it is better considered a homiletic hand-book rather than a homiliary. Further, despite its name, the ‘homilies’ it contains are closer in character to the definition of sermons.Óskarsdóttir, Svanhildur (2007) \\"Prose of Christian Instruction\\" in McTurk, Rory, ed.

Contributions His most significant contributions are 1. development of the field of ecological engineering as an author of the first book on this subject and the founder (in 1992) and editor-in-chief of the scientific journal Ecological Engineering, 2\\\\. creation of the Olentangy River Wetland Research Park, a unique 20-hectare (50-acre) wetland research laboratory and now Ramsar Wetland of International Importance at The Ohio State University, 3. major contributions toward the development of the field of wetland ecology, particularly as first author of five editions of the standard textbook Wetlands, a book that continues to be used around the world to teach wetland ecology. That book has educated several generations of wetland scientists since it was first introduced in 1986. Dr. Mitsch's research has emphasized wetlands for nutrient removal in the agricultural Mississippi-Ohio-Missouri (MOM) River Basin (Mitsch et al. 2001, 2012, 2014) and more recently to protect the Florida Everglades (Mitsch et al. 2015; Marois and Mitsch 2015a; Mitsch 2016a; Mitsch et al., 2018) and Lake Erie in the Laurentian Great Lakes (Mitsch et al., 2017). His recent research continues to focus on solving harmful algal blooms, including red tide, with treatment wetlands and restored landscapes (Griffiths and Mitsch, 2017; Nesbit and Mitsch, 2018; Mitsch, 2018) and also on the ecosystem service of natural and restored/created wetlands in mitigating climate change (Mitsch et al. 2010, 2013; Villa and Mitsch, 2015; Marois and Mitsch 2015b; Li and Mitsch, 2016; Mitsch 2016b; Mitsch and Mander, 2018). Mitsch is currently Eminent Scholar and Director, Everglades Wetland Research Park, Florida Gulf Coast University, Naples, Florida. Before October 2012 he was Distinguished Professor of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University and Director of the University's Wilma H. Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park. His research and teaching has focused on wetland biogeochemistry, wetland creation and restoration, ecological engineering, and ecosystem modeling. Dr. Mitsch has authored or co-authored over 600 papers, books, published abstracts and other publications in ecological and environmental science. He is co-author or co-editor of 20 books including senior author of Ecological Engineering (1989), Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration (2004), 5 editions of Wetlands (1986–2015), and Wetland Ecosystems (2009). Mitsch has served on committees of the Science Advisory Board (SAB) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2001–2011) and on several United States National Research Council (NRC) committees of the National Academy of Sciences (1991–2004). His international activity includes serving as a Fulbright Senior Specialist at the Harry Oppenheimer Okavango Research Centre, University of Botswana in 2007 and at the Bialystok University of Technology in Poland in 2016, a Fulbright Fellow, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (1986–1987) and an advisor/researcher for several Chinese universities; United Nations Environmental Programme, Egypt and Jordan; EARTH University, Costa Rica; IAMZ (Mediterranean Agronomic Institute of Zaragoza), Spain; SCOPE (Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment), Paris, France; and MISTRA (Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research), Sweden, among other locations. He was chair of EcoSummit 2012 held in Columbus, Ohio, USA and is co-chair of EcoSummit 2016 held in Montpellier, France. Among his awards, Mitsch and his colleague and frequent co-author Sven Jørgensen of Denmark received the 2004 Stockholm Water Prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on August 19, 2004 in Stockholm, Sweden. He also received the National Wetland Research Award (1996) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Environmental Law Institute, the Theodore M. Sperry Award (2005)http://www.ser.org/content/ser_awards_program.asp for a career in ecosystem restoration from the Society for Ecological Restoration, a SWS Lifetime Achievement Award (2007)http://www.sws.org/awards_grants/index.mgi from the Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS), an Einstein Professorship from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2010), and The Ramsar Convention Award for Merit presented at Ramsar Committee of Party (COP) 12th Congress, Puenta del Este, Uruguay on June 3, 2015. His Olentangy River Wetland Research Park at Ohio State University became the 24th USA Ramsar Wetland of International Importance in June 2008 from the Ramsar Convention in Switzerland.http://www.ramsar.org/cda/ramsar/display/main/main.jsp?zn=ramsar&cp;=1-26-45-85^22668_4000_0__ In 2010, he was awarded Doctorate honoris causa by the University of Tartu in Estonia.

It is usually considered a subspecies of the sharp-shinned hawk by most taxonomists, including the American Ornithological Society, but the taxonomy is far from resolved, with some authorities considering the southern taxa to represent three separate species: white- breasted hawk (A. chionogaster), plain-breasted hawk (A. ventralis), and rufous-thighed hawk (A. erythronemius). Taxonomy The breeding range of the groups are entirely allopatric, although the wintering range of the nominate group partially overlaps with the range of chionogaster (as is also the case with certain taxa within the nominate group). This allopatry combined with differences in plumage (see appearance) and, apparently, certain measurements, has been the background for the split, but hard scientific data are presently lacking (AOU). Disregarding field guides, most material published in recent years (e.g. AOU, Ferguson-Lees et al. p. 586, and Dickinson et al.) has therefore considered all to be members of a single widespread species – but not without equivocation: Ferguson-Lees et al. say that if they were to make a world list, they would include the three taxa as separate species (p. 75), and the AOU's comment includes the note \\"split almost certainly good\\". In Bolivia, ventralis and erythronemius approach each other, but no evidence of intergradation is known – something that, without actual specimens, also would be hard to prove due to the variability in the plumage of ventralis. Description This is a small Accipiter hawk, with males long, with a wingspan of and weight from . As common in Accipiter hawks, females are distinctly larger in size, averaging some 30% longer, and with a weight advantage of more than 50% being common. The female measures in length, has a wingspan of and weighs . The wings measure each, the tail is long and the tarsus is . Measurements given here are for sharp-shinned hawk, but they are comparable for the remaining species.Raptors of the World by Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead, and Burton. Houghton Mifflin (2001), Adults have short broad wings and a medium-length tail banded in blackish and gray with the tip varying among individuals from slightly notched through square to slightly rounded (often narrowly tipped white). The remiges (typically only visible in flight) are whitish barred blackish. The legs are long and very slender (hence the common name) and yellow. The hooked bill is black and the cere is yellowish. Birds can be Polymorphic. The most common morph has dark grey upperparts (often appears almost black) and white underparts variably barred, shaded, or mottled with rufous or tawny-buff (extensively marked individuals may appear almost entirely rufous or tawny-buff below). Occasionally, the barring to the lower belly and flanks may appear duskier. The white morph has bluish-grey upperparts (similar to sharp-shinned hawk), but its underparts are all white except for its rufous thighs. The rare dark morph, the only morph which sometimes lacks rufous thighs, is entirely sooty (occasionally with slight white barring to belly and faint grey bands in tail). The underparts of the females average paler than males of the same morph. The iris is typically yellow (contra illustrations in some books), but individuals (mainly sub-adults?) with a darker iris are occasionally seen. Juveniles have dark brownish or dusky upperparts with each feather typically edged rufous, giving a rather scaly appearance. The underparts are white streaked brown, and the thighs are rufous barred white. Occasionally, juveniles with underparts extensively rufous streaked blackish are seen. Distribution It occurs in the coastal mountains of northern Venezuela and Colombia, south through the Andes from western Venezuela, through Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, to central Bolivia. A disjunct population occurs in the Tepuis of southern Venezuela (likely to extend into adjacent parts of Roraima in far northern Brazil, but this remains unconfirmed). It is, as far as known, resident, but some local movements may occur. Habitat The plain-breasted hawk is found in upper tropical to temperate highlands; mainly at altitudes of , but occasionally down to near sea-level and up to . =Diet= These birds surprise and capture most of their prey from cover or while flying quickly through dense vegetation. They are adept at navigating dense thickets, although this hunting method is often hazardous to the hawk. The great majority of this hawk's prey are small birds, especially various songbirds such as sparrows, wood-warblers, finches, wrens, nuthatches, tits, icterids and thrushes. Typically, males will target smaller birds, such as sparrows and wood-warblers, and females will pursue larger prey, such as thrushes and flickers, leading to a lack of conflict between the sexes for prey. These hawks often exploit backyard bird feeders in order to target congregations of ideal prey. They often pluck the feathers off their prey on a post or other perch. Rarely, sharp-shinned hawks will also eat rodents, lizards, frogs, snakes, and large insects. =Reproduction= Sharp-shinned hawks construct a stick nest. Clutches of 3 to 8 eggs have been recorded, but 4 to 5 eggs is the typical clutch size. The eggs measure and weigh about . The incubation period is thought to average at about 30 days. After hatching, the young are brooded for 16 to 23 days by the female, while the male defends the territory and catches prey. The young fledge at the age of about a month and rely on their parents for feeding and protection another four weeks. The breeding behavior of the plain-breasted hawk is comparably poorly known, but based on the available knowledge they appear to differ little from that of the sharp- shinned hawk. Conservation The plain-breasted hawk is fairly common (but easily overlooked due to their secretive behavior) and presently considered safe. References * Dickinson, E. (2003).

Residing in the town of Kotka, closer to the Russian Border than to Sweden, the Anderson clan likely contrived their family name because it meant \\"evergreen hill\\" (or spruce hill), and not because of any personal connection to the small hamlet. Nonetheless, several prominent individuals have borne this name, including renowned psychology professor Sulo Havumäki, who, while working at Bemidji State College in Minnesota, popularized the made-up legend of St. Urho. The legend honors the (supposed) patron saint of Finland, who drove the infamous grape-crop destroying grasshoppers out of Finland. Another prominent bearer of this surname is Kalle Havumäki - a promising young rap artist.

Original location  The building was designed by Alexander Cullen and built in 1905.Coatbridge Express, 17 May 1905. It is a Carnegie library; its construction was financed by money donated by the Scottish- American entrepreneur Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie officially opened the library on 7 June 1906 in person; he received the ceremonial freedom of burgh of Coatbridge in return. The building was category B listed by Historic Scotland in 1993. It is a large, two-storey building of pink Corsehill sandstone, in the Beaux-Arts style.The Monklands, an illustrated architectural guide (1992), p 40. The design was chosen by competition. Built on a steep hill on Academy Street, it has an imposing looming presence. The rear of the building can be seen on the Coatbridge skyline when approached from the west via the A89 road. In 2016, and after the relocation of the library services in 2010, permission was granted to the Clyde Valley Housing Association to convert the former Carnegie library into residential accommodation. Grant funded assistance came from Historic Environment Scotland, after the library was identified by the Coatbridge Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme as a funding priority.

Only one was built. Development The White Falcon was built by Blackburn during 1915 for the personal use of their chief test pilot, W. Rowland Ding. It was a mid-wing, wire-braced monoplane with open cockpits for pilot and passenger, powered by an uncowled 100 hp (75 kW) Anzani radial engine driving a four-blade 9 ft (2.74 m) diameter propeller. The wings were of parallel chord and generally like those of the Improved Type I, though 1 ft (31 cm) greater in span, similarly wire braced to an inverted V kingpost and to the undercarriage. The wing warping wires also ran via the kingpost. The White Falcon initially used a standard B.E.2c undercarriage (Blackburn was one company manufacturing these aircraft during the war) but this was replaced later with a simpler structure without skids. The fuselage was a standard Blackburn Warren girder structure, though of square rather than the company's previously favoured triangular cross-section. The decking was rounded. While the tailplane was like that of the Improved Type I, the fin and rudder formed a neat triangular shape with a vertical trailing edge. The first flight date is not known nor is there much information on its use. It has been suggested that it was used by Ding to communicate with RNAS stations that had received Blackburn built B.E.2c machines, and to collect their delivery pilots. In the winter of 1916-17 it wore RAF roundels but no serial number. Rowland Ding died in a B.E.2c crash in Leeds on 12 May 1917.

Design Ordered under the Naval Defence Act of 1889, which established the \\"Two-Power Standard\\", the class was contemporary with the first torpedo boat destroyers. With a length overall of ,Winfield (2004), p.306 a beam of and a displacement of 1,070 tons, these torpedo gunboats were not small ships by the standard of the time; they were larger than the majority of World War I destroyers.

He served in private practice, litigated before the Supreme Court of the United States, and served as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Early life and career Adams was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Though under the minimum age, he enlisted in a Pennsylvania regiment in the United States Army in 1861, and served for three months before returning to school. He reenlisted in 1863 when Robert E. Lee's forces invaded Pennsylvania, and afterwards entered the Quartermaster's Department of the Army, where he served until 1871. He then worked as a merchant for several years. He read law and became a lawyer in Philadelphia in 1878. He was thereafter in private practice in New York City, New York from 1883 to 1901, specializing in admiralty law at the firm of Beebe & Wilcox; after the death of Judge Beebe in 1884, he became a name partner and the firm was renamed Wilcox, Adams & Green. There, he litigated before the Supreme Court of the United States in admiralty cases such as The Kate.164 U.S. 512 (1896). Adams was Secretary of the Union League Club of New York in 1894 and 1895. Federal judicial service When Judge Addison Brown resigned his seat on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the members of the Admiralty Bar adopted a resolution in July 1901 asking the president to appoint Adams. He received a recess appointment to that seat from President William McKinley on August 30, 1901, and, following McKinley's assassination on September 14, 1901, was formally nominated to the seat by President Theodore Roosevelt on December 5, 1901. The United States Senate confirmed Adams on December 17, 1901, and he received his commission the same day. When appointed, Adams was the only judge in the district. The workload resulting from new federal bankruptcy laws caused his health to break down two years later; though three other judges were appointed to the district, Adams's health never fully recovered, but he served until his death, focusing on the maritime cases that were his specialty. Family and death In 1904, Adams married the former Helen Jean Balfour. Adams died in Hague, New York on October 9, 1911, after two years' illness. His will was fifteen words long: \\"I give and bequeath all my estate to my wife and appoint her my executrix.\\" There were no children. Mrs. Adams served the cause of the New York Women's League for Animals for decades after her husband's death—despite being bitten by animals 71 times over the course of her service. She died in 1950 at the age of 101. ReferencesExternal links * * Portrait of Judge Adams at New York Public Library web site.

Later on, composer Elliott Carter, in the fifties, began polymetric experiments in his string quartets that inevitably amounted to polytempic behavior by nature of several competing lines at different surface speeds. At around the same time, composer Henry Brant expanded on Ives's The Unanswered Question to create a spatial music in which entire ensembles, separated by vast distances, play in distinct simultaneous tempi. Some types of African drumming exhibit this phenomenon. Today's composers are employing polytempi as a compositional strategy to create total and complete independence of line in polyphonic music. Composers such as Conlon Nancarrow, David A. Jaffe, Evgeni Kostitsyn, Kyle Gann, Kenneth Jonsson, John Arrigo-Nelson, Brian Ferneyhough, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Frank Zappa, and Peter Thoegersen have used various methods in achieving polytempic effects in their music. Polytempic music also harkens to the rhythmic practices of some Renaissance and medieval composers (see hemiola). Multitemporal music Multitemporal music is composed using sound streams that have different internal tempi or pulse speed, for example one part at 115 bpm and at 105 bpm at the same time. Multitemporal music was first heard in US-Mexican composer Conlon Nancarrow's work, discovered by Hungarian György Ligeti, who undertook the task of bringing Nancarrow's music to the fore. To overcome the limits posed by a human performer in playing a multitemporal score Nancarrow used two modified player-pianos, punching the rolls by hand. One of the few recordings of this composer's work is found in Wergo's \\"Studies for Player Piano\\" series. The idea was then proposed by Iannis Xenakis in the early seventies and more recently by Italian born composer Valerio Camporini Faggioni Valerio Camporini F., Multitemporal Designs, (Line)using synthetic and software devices. A similar technique, with the tempi similar to each other is rhythm phasing – a technique introduced by Steve Reich and used especially in minimalist and post-minimalist music.

It was first isolated from a strain of Penicillium roqueforti, a species commercially used as a source of proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes during maturation of the blue-veined cheeses, Roquefort, Danish Blue, Stilton and Gorgonzola. Roquefortine C is a cyclodipeptide mycotoxin derived from the diketopiperazine cyclo(Trp-dehydro-His) and is a relatively common fungal metabolite produced by a number of Penicillium species. It is also considered as one of the most important fungal contaminants of carbonated beverages, beer, wine, meats, cheese and bread. At high doses roquefortine C is classified as a toxic compound. Although it is a potent neurotoxin at high doses, at low concentrations of 0.05 to 1.47 mg/kg that occur in domestic cheeses, it was found to be \\"safe for the consumer\\". The mechanisms underlying its toxicity and metabolism have been investigated by studying its interaction with mammalian cytochrome P450 enzymes. In addition to these toxic properties, roquefortine C reportedly possesses bacteriostatic activity against gram-positive bacteria, but only in those organisms containing haemoproteins. Roquefortine C contains the unusual E-dehydrohistidine moiety, a system that typically undergoes facile isomerization under acidic, basic, or photochemical conditions to isoroquefortine C, the 3,12 double-bond Z-isomer of roquefortine C. Isomerisation of Roquefortine C to Isoroquefortine C However isoroquefortine C is not a natural product and in contrast to roquefortine C does not bind iron. Both have been synthesised.

Plot summary A young priest decides to leave the church because disillusioned by the worldliness and minor cruelty of the clergy. This decision coincides with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. The rebels accuse priests of indoctrinating their followers against them, and many get beaten up and tortured. The priest discovers that the clergy he had despised are capable of heroism under terrible torture. He interprets this as holiness, and this prompts him to rejoin the church, in a state of great fear and personal confusion. This means that he, himself, has to go on the run. He goes into a cabaret to hide and meets a young girl, an entertainer in the club and an illiterate prostitute. She and her mother shelter him. They become lovers while he thinks of himself as an atheist. Later, when he reconverts to Christianity, he preaches purity to her. Both of them wind up being arrested, and she gets shot protecting him. As she dies in his arms, he suddenly recognises that this little prostitute has shown him a depth of pure love and acceptance that puts him, the intellectual, professional clergyman, to deep shame. Meanwhile, both sides are searching for a sacred relic that is believed to have miraculous powers - it is said to have helped defeat Napoleon. Because the ordinary people believe that the side that has the relic is going to win, both sides obviously want to have it. The relic ends up in the priest's possession, and he recognises its power as a morale-booster so doesn't want it to fall into the wrong hands. We watch this priest growing up and learning about the subtle depths of human motivation. Analysis The Spanish Republicans have been lionized for decades for their struggle against Francisco Franco’s pre-war alliance with fascism. The novel reveals an under- publicized truth - that the Spanish Republicans singled out religious targets and many harmless middle class targets and killed or persecuted them. It depicts the Republicans running areas under their control along Stalinist lines.Marshall, Bruce. The Fair Bride, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1953.

The parish of Emneth in the 2001 census, has a population of 2,466, increasing to 2,617 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Governance Emneth parish council has 12 members. The councillors elect a chair. Emneth is part of the electoral ward called Emneth with Outwell. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 4,700. Description This fenland village and parish is on the border with the county of Cambridgeshire in the south west of Norfolk. The village is located south of Walsoken and north of Outwell. Within the parish boundaries of Emneth there are also the settlements of Emneth Hungate and Holly End. Over the years the meaning of the name EmnethA Popular Guide to Norfolk Place-names: by James Rye: Published by Larks press, Dereham, Norfolk, 2000 ; has been debated. It is derived from old English and therefore probably has Saxon origins, and may have the meanings of smooth meadow, junction of streams on the River Aemenan, river confluence belonging to Eana or mowing grass meadow. The Hungate suffix suggests this area may have been associated with the keeping or rearing of hounds. The village is not mentioned in the Domesday Book. This may well be because the village was valued with another parish and not named. There is evidence for activity in the parish from the Roman period and metal detectorists have found many medieval and post medieval finds. History The earliest mention of Emneth is in documents dating back to 1170 giving proof that a village was settled in the parish by this date. The parish church of Saint Edmund's was built in the 12th centuryNorfolk 2: Norfolk: North-west and South, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, Emneth entry. 0-300-09657-7 and extended dramatically in the 13th century. It remains a large and imposing building. Other buildings from the medieval period which stood in the parish have been demolished. Hagbeach Hall a medieval hall was demolished in 1887, although its 17th-century stables remain and has been converted into a house. The medieval hall on the site of 17th-century Oxburgh Hall was also demolished when the new hall was built. Other buildings have disappeared. Emneth was also recorded in a document in 1389 but this document's location has since been lost. Other sites have lost their names and sense of importance. A medieval moated site has been recorded and a seal used by Pope Innocent III to secure documents was found there along with other finds which included a medieval seals matrices, a horse harness pendant and medieval coins. Within the parish other more domestic sites with less status have also been identified. Medieval hearths were excavated along with many medieval finds including pottery, coins and personal objects. These include a spectacular strap end with the initials S and J. The number of items recovered at this site suggests that this was an area of substantial medieval settlement. LandmarksSaint Edmund Parish Church= This parish church built of stone sits on the bend of the main road. The tower, porch, and nave with its aisles and clerestory are all built in the perpendicular style.The King's England series, NORFOLK, by Arthur Mee,Pub:Hodder and Stoughton,1972, page 87 Emneth, There is a sanctus bellcote which has six bells,church bells on the east gable of the nave. Crowning the nave, with its arcades of six bays is a 15th-century roof. Angels adorn its tiebeams and hammerbeams, and figures of the apostles with others carved in the wall posts. The chancel screen dates from the 15th century and has the remains of old painting and gilding and in the north aisle windows in glass as old as the screen are of more angels. The chancel is 13th century and the east window is a fine trinity of lancets reaching up to the roof. The rood-stairs are in a turret by the chancel arch, and there is a simple 15th- century font. The oldest memorials are coffin-lids, one with a border and a cross of leaves. Only the matrix is left of the brass of a cross-legged knight dressed in chain mail of about 1300. Sir Thomas Hewar, who died in 1631, planned for himself the fine alabaster tomb on which he lies in gold and white armour and a ruff, with his wife in a black gown and ruff. He had paid Nicholas Stone a London Mason the huge sum of £95 for the tomb in 1617. At their feet lies a sleeping child. =War Memorial= Emneth war memorial is located in the graveyard opposite the parish church. =Emneth railway station= Emneth had a railway station which served the village, situated in Station Road and accessed from the village via Ladys Drove. The station was opened in 1848 as an extension of the East Anglian Railway's line from Magdalen Road station (now known as Watlington) to Wisbech East. The station's location, like that of the neighbouring Middle Drove station, was fairly rural and the line eventually closed in 1968, a casualty of the Beeching Axe. In October 1942, a hoard of Roman silver coins together with fragments of an urn in which they were stored was found near the station. Emneth's station building survived closure, and has since been converted into a private residence.

Features The style combines curves with straight lines to create a design that balances masculine and feminine attributes, aiming to create a comfortable and relaxing style. A lack of ornamentation and decoration with minimal accessories keeps the focus on the simplicity and sophistication of the design. Color palettes are typically neutral and subtle and may be monochromatic, with color in art and accents rather than upholstery and floors. Unlike contemporary furniture, transitional style focuses on comfort and practicality, to meet the lifestyle of an active household. The scales of furniture pieces are ample but not overwhelming. Goose feather and down fill is typically used for upholstered furniture, wood species (maple, mahogany, walnut, etc.) and wood finishing is typically warm tones but can range from a natural finish to a high-gloss lacquer. Texture is important, and fabric selections can vary from durable materials to sophisticated, plush fabrics, with tone-on-tone or small scale graphics.

Adelman (born October 1, 1939) is a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin, serving since 1997. Education and early career Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Adelman received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Princeton University in 1961, and a Bachelor of Laws from Columbia Law School in 1965. He was a research assistant at Columbia from 1965 to 1966. He was a trial attorney for the Legal Aid Society of Wisconsin from 1967 to 1968, and then entered private practice in Milwaukee in 1968. Political career Adelman ran for Congress unsuccessfully three times, in 1974 in the general election, and in primaries in 1982 and in 1984 in a special election. \\"Adelman faces near-record campaign debts\\", The Milwaukee Journal, July 26, 1984. He was a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Senate from 1977-97.Wisconsin History - Lynn S. Adelman, wisconsinhistory.org. Retrieved November 24, 2019. Adelman was also on the Judiciary committee, Alcohol and Drug Abuse committee, and the Highway Safety committee for the Wisconsin State Senate. Federal judicial service Upon the recommendation of United States Senators from Wisconsin Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold, Adelman was nominated by President Bill Clinton on September 8, 1997, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin vacated by Judge Thomas John Curran. He received a hearing by the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on October 29, 1997. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on November 13, 1997, and received his commission on December 23, 1997. =Notable cases=Frank, et al vs Walker The Wisconsin Voter ID law was a law passed by then Wisconsin governor Scott Walker in 2011. This law made voters of Wisconsin to show a state-issue photo ID at the voters polls, before the Wisconsin voters can even photo. The reasoning behind this law was that Scott Walker wanted to stop the voter fraud that was allegedly happening within the state of Wisconsin. Adelman ruled, on April 29, 2014, that this law violated the fourteenth amendment and thus the law was unconstitutional. Adelman made this ruling because in the trial he saw no evidence of voter fraud and concluded that the law was unfair to minority voters because \\"Blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to lack an ID\\". Johnny Kimble vs Wisconsin's Department of Workforce Development, et al. In this case Johnny Kimble sued former Equal Rights Division Secretary Sheehan Donoghue for not giving him a pay raise based on his race and gender. The Equal Rights Division job is to investigate discrimination claims and to judge whether the claim of discrimination is true. Johnny Kimble is an ex employee of the Equal Rights Division and ran the office in Milwaukee. Sheehan Donoghue was appointed to this position in 1991 by then governor of Wisconsin Tommy Thompson. Adelman's ruling on this case was that Johnny Kimble was denied pay raises because of his race and that the Department of Workforce Development was to pay Johnny Kimble what he lost. This ruling was made on February 25, 2010. Adelman said that Sheehan Donoghue made statements that contradicted to what she said and what other witnesses said, she also got defensive and evasive during the questioning, and the evidence on the case did not support her claims. The evidence they found was when the Milwaukee office did well she credited the office, not Johnny, but when the Madison office did well she credited the section chief, who was white. Also, whenever Johnny said they need technical support she ignored him, but when it was a white employee, she promised help. St. Augustine School v. Evers In June 2017, Adelman found that Tony Evers, then Superintendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin, did not violate the Constitution’s Free Exercise Clause nor its Establishment Clause when he denied bussing to an independent catholic school because there was a nearby archdiocesan school. In his opinion, Adelman utilized references to the wikipedia articles on Traditionalist Catholic and Montessori education. His judgment was affirmed by a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in October 2018. United States vs. Sujata Sachdeva In this trial Koss Corporation's Chief Financial Advisor Sujata Sachdeva is charged with embezzling $34 million from the company. The other person involved on the embezzlement is Julie Mulvaney who was a senior accountant at Koss Corporation. The Koss Corporation is a manufacturer of headphones. Sachdeva used almost all of the $34 million she embezzled, from the Koss Corporation, to go on a wild shopping spree. The shopping spree consisted of shopping at designer, jewelry, department stores, and other high- end retailers. Sachdeva, along with Mulvaney, tried to cover up the embezzlement by creating false accounting records. Mulvaney created falsified journal records to cover Sachdeva's spending spree. Sachdeva's attorney's argued that Sachdeva was is mentally ill with alcoholism, diagnosed bipolar disorder, and a shopping addiction, when she went on the shopping spree. The sentence the federal prosecutor wanted was 15–20 years in prison, and the lawyers for Sachdeva wanted the sentenced reduce to 6–7 years in prison, because of her mental condition. Adelman sentenced Sachdeva to 11 years in federal prison on November 17, 2010. Adelman gave some leniency to Sachdeva because of her cooperation with the FBI. United States vs. William White This case is about William White, White is a Neo-Nazi who runs the Virginia-based American Nationalist Socialist Workers Party. White posted the address, name, and telephone numbers of a juror in Chicago who convicted a white supremacist, in 2004, to his website. The prosecutors claimed that White did this in hopes that the juror would be harmed for the conviction of the white supremacist. Adelman at first dismissed the indictment of White, because he did not threaten or actually caused harm to the man and he obtained the information legally, and that what White did was covered over the First Amendment. This judgement by Adelman was overturned and White went on to trail and was convicted by a jury in Chicago. After this sentencing Adelman reversed it for the same reasons he dismissed the case in the first place. Then on February 20, 2013, Adelman did sentence White to three and half years in prison for soliciting violence to a juror. When this sentencing happened, White was already in jail for other threats and intimidation practices. =Criticism of the Supreme Court under John Roberts= In February 2020, Adelman wrote an article criticizing the recent record of the Supreme Court of the United States under Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. The article singled out Chief Justice Roberts and accused him of actively participating in \\"undermining American democracy,\\" through activist decisions on voting rights and campaign finance by corporate interests. Adelman wrote, \\"Instead of doing what it can to ensure the maintenance of a robust democratic republic, the Court's decisions ally it with the most anti-democratic currents in American politics, forces that would be pleased if unlimited money could be spent on elections and if minorities could be deterred from voting.\\" The article specifically cited a number of partisan 5-4 decisions, such as Shelby County v. Holder, (which struck down part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965), Rucho v. Common Cause, (which decided that federal courts could not rule on cases of gerrymandering), Citizens United v. FEC, (which allowed unlimited corporate spending on elections), and Janus v. AFSCME (which held that it was unconstitutional for public employee unions to require collective bargaining fees). The article created waves in legal circles because of the unusually blunt criticism of the Court coming from a sitting federal judge. Legal scholar Jonathan Turley argued that the article makes \\"a better case of bias against himself than he does Chief Justice John Roberts\\" and noted previous articles where Adelman had also directly criticized conservatives while serving as a federal judge. The Judicial Counsel for the Seventh Circuit censured Judge Adelman for writing this article.Judicial Council of the Seventh Judicial Circuit June 22, 2020. Consideration for Seventh Circuit On January 22, 2010, United States Senators Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold forwarded four names to the Obama White House for consideration to fill the vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit created when Judge Terence T.

Built in 1878, the school was in operation between 1881 and 1988. The college closed in 1988 in part due to a teacher's strike. Primary school and music classes were still taught on campus until 1994. Following its closure the school building was used as a set for several movie productions; Silent Hill (interior shots), its image is included in the 2009 film Orphan and the made- for-TV movie, Mr. Headmistress (1997). The building was destroyed by a fire on May 28, 2008.  History (1877–1996)  Governor General Roland Michener attending the Alma College graduation ceremonies in 1972 With the economic boom of St. Thomas in the late 19th century, Bishop Albert Carmen proposed that a ladies' college be established. The school name derives from the late Alma Munro (Moore) (wife of then Sheriff Colin Munroe) and Mrs. Alma Munro Duffield, daughter of Colin and Alma. Alma college was officially opened in 1881 as a liberal arts college for women, teaching literature, arts and music. By 1883, it had 165 students. The school's traditional colors were chosen based on each of these subjects: blue (literature), gold (art), and crimson (music). James Balfour designed the Alma Ladies College building (1878–81) and the additions (1888-89). Construction was done by Henry Lindop of St. Thomas at an estimated total cost of about $50,000. Alma College's grounds featured a main building, a chapel, a hall cum gymnasium, and a unique outdoor amphitheater. In its later years the college was affiliated with the University of Western Ontario, and was the first college in Canada to organize a department of domestic science. Between 1918 and 1953 new athletic facilities, a chapel and the amphitheater were constructed. In 1959 a music building was constructed.Alma college fonds, Elgin county archives 1997 By 1973 the school began to experience a significant financial struggle to continue operation. In 1975 a portion of the residence was opened as a satellite seniors home for a local long term care facility.Alma college fonds, published 1997, Elgin county archives That same year a co-ed elementary school was established on campus. In October 1976 the college was designated a provincial historic site to celebrate the school's centennial.Alma college fonds, published 1997, Elgin county archives In 1987 Alma college teachers faced job security issues and were earning about half of what public high school teachers earned. After failed negotiations with Alma's board, the Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB) approved the private school bargaining unit of Alma's teachers. In February 1988 the first strike by members of a private school in Ontario was called and in March replacement workers were used to teach classes at the school. The strike lasted just over 3 months with the OLRB ruling that the Alma Board was guilty of unfair labor practices. At the end of the academic year all teachers were told that their services were no longer needed as the school was closing. (The Alma bargaining movement would continue to be active until as late as 1998.) Primary and music classes continued until 1994. In 1994 a last effort to reopen the school was unsuccessful due to low enrollment.  Building demise (1996–2008)  thumbright200pxAlma College amphitheatre as of Summer 2008 after restoration. The amphitheatre has since been vandalized and fallen to disrepair St Thomas Times Journal: Wednesday, Dec 17, 2008: p 1 & 3\\\\. By Kyle Rea The school grounds and buildings were sold to private developers in 1996 for $1.5 million (CAD). Alma College changed ownership several times after failed attempts to convert the grounds into a retirement home, a co-ed high school, or an otherwise general restoration of the buildings. Initially after closure the buildings were sold to Royal Cambridge in 1996. The developer initially planned to restore the buildings and open a co-ed school. Shortly after the production of Mr Headmistress, an ABC made-for-TV movie was made where various outdoor improvements were made to the building as well as restoration of ground work surrounding the structure. Nearly one month after production of the film, Royal Cambridge defaulted on the mortgage payments for the property. This caused the building to be for sale once again. A London development company led by Brian Squires purchased the College and developed plans to build a retirement community on the campus in 1998. Over the next 4 years he spent time preparing the site and arranging financing. At this point the school began to see a wave of vandalism due to general un-occupancy. By 2003 Squires applied for a demolition permit (suggested by the mayor and recorded) due to the fact that the Mayor at the time said the building could not be saved and the land is better suited for redevelopment. The Mayor commented the people of St.Thomas would eventually understand if the building was demolished. Brian Squires was devastated that the mayor would say such a thing after committing to help save it during the November elections. Brian Squires quickly filed for a demolition permit to prove the mayor was wrong in saying the people of St.Thomas would not be upset if such an action was able to take place.. At the same time Brian Squires hired a structural engineer to confirm that it could be saved. The Mayors office was swamped with calls proving Brian Squires was right in saying the people of St.Thomas will care and they also want the building saved. This demolition permit was swiftly denied by the local municipality because of the structural report provided by Brian Squires.A demolition permit was never issued and the building was saved. Brian Squires continued to try and save the building putting all his resources into it. Shortly after that, Brian Squires handed over control of the project to the Zubick family because of lack of interest from the family, municipality and bankers. The building was gutted; asbestos, general fixtures and walls were all removed leaving little but a timber frame inside the building. The ghostly innards were used for the film Silent Hill in 2005. Once again a demolition permit was issued for Alma college after more attempts to sell the building were unsuccessful. In 2006 the Municipal Heritage Committee recommended that the demolition permit be denied, that city council prescribe minimum standards for maintenance of the building under section 35.3 of the Ontario Heritage Act. They also recommended that the city seek further financial assistance from the provincial Ministry of Heritage. This report would subsequently be buried by the ministry of culture only to reappear under the freedom of information act two years later and after the buildings eventual demise.citation in next section the city denied the demolition permit and the building was placed on the National top ten endangered historic sites in Canada. By 2006 an offer was made by the Alma College foundation, a group of alumnae, university academics and community leaders in the hopes of reopening as a liberal arts college. Their offer was 750,000 dollars but was rejected by the Zubick family. With the building being allowed to fall into further disrepair the city council developed new property standards by laws in order to establish minimum standards. This new bylaw was protested and ruled to be too specific in wording and was overturned by the Ontario Supreme Court. The city eventually agreed to offer a demolition permit on the condition that the front driveway be preserved and the front façade, a sentiment that is still considered valid even though today the building was destroyed. In early 2008 The Ontario Municipal Board approved the demolition of Alma College. This would set off a rush to protect the building by many local activists. On May 28, 2008 a petition was set to be passed around at the Ontario Legislature to prevent the demolition of the building. In addition a rally to save the college was also planned that morning at the Main building of the school. Fire and grounds destruction (2008–present)  Fire at Alma College in May 2008. After the fire only a brick shell remained. It was subsequently demolished. Alma College caught fire on May 28, 2008. The fire was suspicious in nature. The smoke could be seen as far away as downtown London, Ontario. Shortly after the fire began the main building was completely engulfed. A significant amount of video coverage of the fire is available due to a student rally to save the building which took place shortly before the fire. After the fire, both a municipal and provincial investigation were commenced immediately. The fire took place shortly after the Ontario Municipal Board issued a final order that approved its demolition. Just prior to the time of the fire local residents met with officials of Premier Dalton McGuinty's office in hopes of postponing an eventual demolition. Local response was swift to place blame on Ontario minister of Culture, Aileen Carroll at the time for not working hard enough to protect the building from demolition. Documentation released through the Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act a month after the fire. This indicated a report from the Ontario Heritage Trust board addressed to the Ministry of Culture. The report outlined that the ministry should ensure that should Alma fall under the threat of demolition or alteration that would compromise the heritage character, integrity and attributes of the property, that it would be appropriate for the minister to designate Alma College, using the powers prescribed under the Ontario heritage Act, to protect the building. At the time of the fire the building was completely open and exposed to numerous fire hazards. Timber members within the structure had no fire protection and numerous broken windows allowed a proper flow of ventilation only to encourage the fire.St Thomas Times Journal, August 13th 2009 The main school building was destroyed by fire. An investigation by the St Thomas city fire department found the blaze, which began in the building's rear stairwell, was the result of arson. The music building and chapel were not destroyed immediately by the fire. The response to the fire was fast enough that the local fire department was able to save the music building. However weathering, vandalism, and neglect continue to further damaging the surviving structures since the fire. After the fire the remaining shell of the main building was torn down due to safety considerations by the municipal government of the city of St Thomas. Shortly after the fire two boys were arrested and charged with arson. The identity of both boys (aged 14 and 15 at the time of the fire) could not be revealed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The trial occurred on August 10–13 and September 2–3, 2009. In a ruling on September 24, 2009, the two boys were found guilty of arson and sentenced to 240 hours of community service and 2 years parole. After the fire a short speech was given at the Ontario legislature by speaker Steve Peters in memory of the building and loss to the culture of his home. The main building topped Heritages Canada's list for worst losses in 2008. One of the two arsonists who set Alma College on fire is Ivan Zinn.  Student life  Student run publications were always popular at Alma. In 1903 a quarterly magazine was developed entitled ALMA consisting of articles written by staff and students.Alma college fonds, Elgin county archives, 1997 The Almafilian was the colleges first student newspaper published monthly from 1886 to 1917, and then serving as the year book published annually until the schools closure. Various dramatic plays, banquets, recitals and dances were held annually on campus. In 1878 a metallic box time capsule was placed in a cornerstone of the building which would remain undisturbed until 2002. In the time capsule a copy of the local newspapers (St. Thomas and London) of the time were stored, church literature, photographs, postcards, and a list of people who contributed to the college's cornerstone. The time capsule today is housed in the Elgin County Archives. The amphitheater was a popular site for ceremonies including graduations and marriages. The school kept a marriage register from 1928 to 1994.Marriage register, Part of alma college fonds, Elgin county archives, 1997 Each May Day from 1931 until 1988 the amphitheater was used for musical and dramatic performances.  International Alumnae Association  Alma college's alumni association can be traced back to February 1901 as Alma's Daughters.Alma College Alumnae constitution The first organization of the alumnae consisted of former staff and students and was formed by Emma Sisk, a former governess of the College. In 1908 the charter of the school was amended to include Alma's Daughters as the official alumni of the school by allowing them to elect members to the Alma college Board of Management.Elgin County archives, Alma College International Alumnae Assoc. Fonds. pdf article Due to increasing membership the Alumnae officially changed its name in 1931 to the Alma College Alumnae. various local chapters began to appear throughout Ontario shortly after and eventually international chapters developed such as the Bermuda chapter in 1988 In its form today the Alma College International Alumnae association still gathers annually. The alumni has been very active in preserving the cultural heritage of artifacts related to the history of the building. These primarily are numerous artifacts and relics that were collected from previous alumni and from the school itself. In 1997 a group of Alumni investors purchased the remaining chattels and memorabilia. This was complemented by storage space being granted at the local community city hall by then mayor and past archivist, Steve Peters. The archives were stored safely in the City hall until Steve Peters took provincial office, upon which the archives were moved to a temporary home. In 2002 The alumnae decided to move the archives to a more permanent home at The Elgin County Museum, located just outside St Thomas. Many historical records and photographs were published online by the museum. To date a description of the records can be found on the web, as well as a collection of photographs of the school in its early years at the Museum's website. Role in film  Alma College was featured in three films after its closure in 1995. The first film was Mr HeadMistress, a made- for-TV movie by Disney which starred Katey Sagal in 1997.London free press, November 13th 1997 The film used the main building as a backdrop and surroundings grounds. Some building maintenance was performed at this time in order to bring the building up to par for filming. After significant portions of building were gutted the interior became an ideal set for the horror film Silent Hill. Even after its destruction, photographs and its likeness were included in the 2009 film Orphan. The film featured a painting of the building in flames.

The temple is of historical as well as architectural significance. Its oldest surviving buildings are two timber-frame structures, the front gate and the central hall (pavilion) that houses a colossal clay statue of the goddess Guanyin (Avalokiteśvara). Both structures date back to the Liao dynasty and are among the oldest surviving wooden buildings in China.Nancy Shatzman Steinhardt, Liao architecture, University of Hawaii Press, 1997  History  The origins of the Dule Temple date back at least to the early Tang Dynasty. However, no buildings from the Tang Dynasty era have survived on the site. The oldest buildings still in existence, the Shan Gate and the Guanyin Pavilion, were constructed during a renovation of the temple in the second year of Tonghe Emperor of the Liao Dynasty (984 AD). These buildings, both central features of the temple, were designed and constructed by local architects and craftsmen on the basis of the Tang architectural technology and carving techniques. In 755, An Lushan held a rally in the Dule Temple at the onset of his rebellion against the Tang emperor. The name of the temple could be a reference to An Lushan, who was also known as An Dule. However, the name could also have originated from the Dule River that flows to northwest of the city, although it is not clear if the river's name predates that of the temple. In 1928, a unit of soldiers commanded by warlord Sun Dianying was stationed in the Dule Temple and used the main hall as barracks. Sun Dianying and his troops were responsible for the looting of the nearby Eastern Qing Tombs. A leftover from the military occupation of the temple are bullet holes in the timber frames that were inflicted during target practice. In the early 1930s, Dule Temple was studied by Liang Sicheng, the author of the China's first modern history on Chinese architecture. In the same decade, the temple was converted into the Jixian Village Normal School.  Description  The grand temple complex is located in the north and faces the south. =Shanmen= The shanmen () is a single-story building that stands 10 meters tall and has three single-eaves Wudian roofs (, i.e., roofs with four slopes and five ridges). It functions as the front gate on the temple's south side and houses the statues of two guardian kings. The Chiwen on both ends of the main ridge are the origin structures made in the Liao dynasty (907-1125). Under the south eaves is a plaque which is said to be the handwriting of the prime minister Yan Song (1480-1567) in the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). Inside the hall are two colored clay statues of Heng and Ha made in the Liao dynasty and frescos of the Four Heavenly Kings drawn in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). =Guanyin Pavilion= The Guanyin Pavilion () is a three-story timber structure with five single- eaves Xieshan roofs (, i.e., half-hipped, half-gabled) roofs. The pavilion has a height of about 23 meters and consists of more than one thousand individual pieces. Inside the hall there is a clay statue of Guanyin with the heads of ten small Buddhas visible on its crown (). The statue, measuring 16 meters in height, is the biggest of its kind in ancient China.Dule Temple - UNESCO World Heritage Centre The statue of Guanyin which are kind and vivid in expression and elegant in deportment are made in the Liao dynasty (907-1125), but the artistic style is similar to that in the flourishing period of the Tang dynasty (618-907). On each side of the statue of Guanyin is a well designed and elegant statue of his attendant, which is the original one made in the Liao dynasty. The pavilion centers with the statue of Guanyin and has two rows of column pillars around. The design which sets dougong on the pillars and architraves on the dougong in each layer separates the pavilion into three stories and makes it easier for people to pay tribute to Guanyin from different angles. The architrave are placed around the statue and the patio formed in the center is covered with an octagonal caisson (), which closely integrates the entire interior space and the statue. The thousands of beams, columns and architraves in the pavilion are arranged in an ordered way with high technique, which shows the excellent wooden architecture technology and achievements in the Liao dynasty.  Location  The Dule Temple is located in the center of Jizhou District. Its address is 41 Wuding Street, Jizhou District, Tianjin ().

The album was released on 4 February 1987 in Japan. All the lyrics were written by Yasushi Akimoto and half of the music by Kyōhei Tsutsumi. The musical arrangements were done by Makoto Matsushita. Overview By the year 1987, the band had acquired a loyal fan base and was able to fill up mid-sized arenas with their live shows in Japan. Their TV appearances were also more frequent and demanding, requiring a more professional approach to the musical business. This important step in the band's career needed money to be invested in new stage sets, personnel, costumes and equipment, which came out of a two- album contract with Yasushi Akimoto's Sold Out Productions. Akimoto was already a well-known author, lyricist and TV producer, deeply involved in the Japanese idol phenomenon. He was executive producer of the album, providing both the lyrics for all the songs and the highly professional staff, including arranger Makoto Matsushita and composer Kyōhei Tsutsumi. For the first time lead singer Keiko Terada did not have any writing duty on the album, but sang only lyrics written by someone else and dealing with a larger range of topics than in the previous albums. For example, the song \\"Visconti no Shouzou\\" is centered on the figure of Italian movie director Luchino Visconti. The image of the band was largely refined with new costumes and choreography and in particular Terada's image changed, leaving behind her almost boyish look for a more feminine and seductive appearance. The top-notch production of the album preserved the strong points of the band's music, reserving great attention to vocal performances and enhancing the commercial appeal of the recording. The last track \\"Chikasuidou no Tsuki\\" is usually used as farewell song at the end of Show-Ya's live shows. During the tour supporting the album, the concert of 3 April 1987 at the Nakano Sun Plaza in Tokyo was recorded for Date Line, Show-Ya's first live VHS.

Plot summary James Garrett is the “Little Friend” of several young women. Whether or not this is a good thing for these ladies is the issue studied in this tragicomic novel. Garrett meets Effie, the lovely daughter of a local pastor, while studying for the ministry at St. Andrews, a university in Scotland. He falls in love with Effie only moments after meeting her. They are inseparable, until, just days before his graduation–ordination, and the day after their first sexual encounter, she is killed in a traffic accident. Despondent and disillusioned, he abandons his intended pastoral career and takes a job as an ad writer with Paloma, the American manufacturer of a very successful line of toothpaste. The company sends him to Paris where he meets Marjorie, a worldly, promiscuous and beautiful British expatriate. He quickly abandons her when his company assigns him to Barcelona. On the train to his new job, he meets an English family, the Nicholsons, also traveling to Barcelona. The daughter, Molly, becomes infatuated with Garrett. His feelings towards her are more ambiguous. The next player in this drama is Pepita. A fiery and lovely poor woman, Pepita works in a brothel since “I can’t keep body and soul together on what is paid by shoe stores.” Garrett meets her when he and his new coworkers end a drunken debauch by visiting her place of employment. Garrett is intrigued by both her attractiveness and the fact that, while she is willing to engage in a wide range of intimate sexual activities, she refuses to kiss him. Garrett shuffles between Molly and Pepita, keeping their existence a secret to the other. But Pepita also has another admirer, Miguelito, an up- and-coming young bullfighter. Pepita, however is frustrated by Miguelito’s many infidelities and eventually gives him up after he abandons and humiliates her for an assignation with Marjorie, who has come to Barcelona to attempt the consummation of her seduction of Garrett. After considerable reflection, Garrett offers to support Pepita if she will give up prostitution. She agrees and finds herself growing more committed and more in love with him. As her love for him grows, Pepita realizes that maintaining their unmarried sexual relationship is sinful and ends sexual activities with him. Garrett, however, has continued his flirtation with Molly all during his relationship with Pepita. Garrett now realizes that Molly is also hoping he will marry her. Weighing his two possibilities, Garrett decides that his chances of a happy life are higher with Molly, with whom he shares many cultural affinities, than with Pepita, whose habits and expectations are “foreign” to him. The novel ends with Pepita reentering the brothel. Garret has proven himself to be a “little” friend. His irresolute and selfish behavior has symbolically led to Effie’s death, Pepita’s return to immorality and Marjorie's continuation in a life of debauchery. The reader is left to contemplate what lies in wait for Molly. Marshall, B: The Little Friend The Macaulay Company 1929.

It appears to be declining in the east where it has lost habitat around Washington, D.C., and around West Virginia. Flight The golden banded-skipper flies in the east from June to August, from February to September in Florida, and in the southwest, from mid-June to early September in Arizona. Life cycle Golden banded-skippers have a strange mix of patrolling and perching in their courtship. Females lay their eggs on the underside of host plant leaves in clusters of two to nine in a row. The egg is yellow but turns tan just before hatching. The larva makes a nest out of leaves, attaching them together with silk. It comes out of its nest at night to feed.James A. Scott (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA. The larva is pine green with small yellow spots and has a yellow lateral stripe. The black head has two facial orange spots and a reddish collar.Thomas J. Allen, Jim P. Brock and Jeffrey Glassberg (2005). Caterpillars in the Field and Garden. Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY. The pupa is dark brown with a greenish hue. It overwinters as a pupa. The golden banded-skipper has one to three broods per year.

Mount James Walker is situated within Spray Valley Provincial Park, and its nearest higher peak is Mount Galatea, to the northwest. History The mountain was named in 1959 after Colonel James Walker (1846-1936), who was a Mountie, soldier, businessman, and postmaster of the Kananaskis Post Office. He was named Calgary's \\"Citizen of the Century\\" during the city's centennial year in 1975.Mount James Walker PeakFinder The mountain's name became official in 1977 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Mount James Walker is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The Lewis Overthrust extends over 450 km from Mount James Walker south to Steamboat Mountain, located west of Great Falls, Montana. Nearby Mount Kidd marks the northern end of the Lewis Thrust Fault. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount James Walker is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Kananaskis River which is a tributary of the Bow River, and thence the Saskatchewan River.

In 1977, district officials stated that the inability to determine attendance zones for the two comprehensive high schools after Thomas Jefferson High School opened in 1929 combined with the expansive shop facilities in the new building, led the district to decide to split students by sex, with girls at Battin and boys at Thomas Jefferson.

Ibanez guitars was another brand owned and manufactured by Hoshino Gakki. In the United States, Penco guitars were distributed by the Philadelphia Music Company. Penco line of products consisted of electric and acoustic guitars, most of them were copies (also known as \\"lawsuit guitars\\") of renowned US guitar like Fender or Gibson, produced by Japanese companies in the 1970s).Lawsuit guitars by Dick Laukenz on JazzGuitar website The term \\"lawsuit guitar\\" origininated after a lawsuit filed by Norlin (Gibson's parent company) against Elger (owner of Ibanez) over trademark infringent in 1977.Penco A-15-JD by Michael Wright on Vintage Guitar magazine, December 2009  History  The Penco brand was of relatively high quality. Their acoustics were usually but not always made with laminated back and sides and often laminated tops. Penco made Martin and Gibson style acoustic guitars. Reverse engineered and built to spec, Penco produced some of the closest replicas of the Martin D-28, D-41, D-45, and D-45 12 models in existence today. Penco also made bolt neck copies of Gibson's Les Paul and SG guitars and basses, Rickenbacker 4001 basses, Fender Stratocaster/Fender Telecaster copies, Fender Jazz Bass copies; and the odd mandolin and banjo. They also made 12-string acoustic guitars. The Penco brand was also put on \\"lawsuit\\" Korina-finished Gibson Explorer-styled guitars. These were identical to the Ibanez Destroyer and the Greco Destroyer of the same period. The Ibanez line was distributed on the West coast of the U.S., while the Greco was exclusively for Japan, and Penco was distributed on the East coast of the U.S. There is bit of variance between the Penco acoustic models depending on what year the guitar was manufactured. A Penco A22M may or may not have an adjustable saddle via thumbscrews. Also some of the models have book matched backs while others maybe tri-backed. Penco acoustics had solid spruce tops and laminated backs and sides of maple or rosewood depending on the model. The A24 is a 12 string acoustic guitar, with a solid –but relatively thin– spruce top, rosewood sides and back and a mahogany neck with rosewood fingerboard. They had a zero fret and a screw adjustable bridge modeled after the Gibson Heritage Jumbo bridge of that period. They sold new for around $140 in the mid 1970s. The A10 was a solid top AA or AAA size Rosewood Laminated back and possibly their first acoustic model.

Plot summary Lady Louise Eleanor Stromworth-Jenkins is \\"very much of the nineteen twenties.\\" The daughter of an English Baron and a French mother, Louise is young, wealthy, intelligent, well-educated and beautiful. An object of pursuit by many eligible young men in her London, England area, Louise feels herself not really capable of love. She meets Lord James Strathcrombie, a decorated war veteran and owner of Benhyter Motors, Limited, a successful automobile company. Eventually, despite her lack of deep love for James, they marry. While Strathcrombie is in Paris on a business trip, Louise travels to Roscoff, France to visit her good friend Veronica Ashley, who is staying there with her family and several friends. One of the friends is Robert Hewitt, a Scottish medical student and the author of one relatively unsuccessful novel. Although she believes in loyalty and is devoted to her husband, Louise feels an attraction to Robert which lasts through the visit. Soon all return to their respective endeavors. A few months later Louise travels to St. Andrews, Scotland to visit friends. There she encounters Robert again, this time just after he has published his second novel, The Silver Fleece, which has become a great success. Louise and Robert spend considerable time together and the encounters grow increasingly romantic. But again, nothing happens between them and soon they part. In London, the Strathcrombies entertain the Merrill family in their home. The family has two young daughters, Babs and Mavis. While talking with Louise the young women express their admiration for The Silver Fleece. Louise mentions that she knows the author and using their enthusiasm as an excuse, invites Robert for a visit. After meeting him, Babs also finds herself very attracted to Robert. During this visit, Louise and Robert discuss running off together. Louise still feels loyalty to James, but feels that this is her chance for love, a chance she did not believe was ever possible. Robert also expresses agreement with the idea, although he also feels an attraction to Babs. They determine to tell James, but he leaves on an emergency business trip before Louise can work up the courage to do so. They attempt to follow him to Bordeaux, France, but en route, while staying in a hotel, Robert encounters Babs. Desperate, Babs kisses Robert just as Louise, looking for him in the hotel, walks in on them.

His first name is not revealed. He was introduced in the Ipcress File when he led his department's efforts to recover leading scientists and ultimately expose a traitor in British intelligence. Due to his tendency to play his cards close to his chest, the hero Harry Palmer wrongly comes to suspect that it is Ross who is the traitor. Palmer soon realises his mistake, and shoots the real traitor Major Dalby. When Palmer complains to Ross that he has been using him, Ross coolly replies that is what he is being paid for. In Funeral in Berlin he is shown to be a keen gardener, briefing Palmer about his impending mission in Berlin while attending to his large suburban garden. His ruthless side is further revealed during this affair, when Palmer becomes aware that Ross has been sheltering a former Nazi and forcing him to work for British intelligence by means of blackmail. When the German ceases to be of use to Ross, and threatens British interests, he orders Palmer to kill him. Personality Ross is portrayed as an old-school military officer, fond of his London Gentleman's Club. He is both brilliant and duplicitous. He generally resorts to blackmail to achieve his goals, such as threatening to have Palmer returned to the military prison which he had had him prematurely released from. He uses Machiavellian methods to achieve his ends, which generally involve not telling things to his subordinates, something which frustrates Palmer. He is happily married and lives with his wife in a large house in the London suburbs.

He was the nephew of philosopher William James and novelist Henry James. Biography James was born in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, to Robertson James and Mary Lucinda Holton. He was the nephew of philosopher William James and novelist Henry James. He attended Harvard and graduated in 1896. On December 27, 1899, he married Mary Louisa Cushing, daughter of the Cushing family of Boston. They gave birth to three girls: Olivia, Mary, and Louisa. From 1900 to 1906 he practiced law in Seattle, Washington. Soon after, James moved to France and for the next six years was the owner and editor of The Liberator of Paris with E. F. Mylius. In 1915, at the outbreak of World War I, James met with various socialists in Berlin. The German authorities took him to the border of Holland and instructed him not to return to Germany, punishable by imprisonment. But, according to his nephew George Vaux, “By this time, he had developed another principle; namely that no one could tell him that he could not place his foot anywhere on the creator’s earth that he wished. Hence, early one morning before daylight, disguised as a day laborer and pushing a bicycle, but carrying still the two violins, he walked past a drunken sentry on the Belgium frontier and got back to Berlin. He was there for about two weeks before he was again discovered by the police, and rearrested.” This last time, he was not treated with the same restraint and was jailed as a political prisoner for the duration of the war.\\"James Again Jailed.\\" New York Times. July 13, 1915. Retrieved 2009-02-23. \\"Edward Holton James, an American, arrested recently for certain Socialistic propaganda, but later released through the efforts of James W. Gerard, the American Ambassador, on condition that he leave the country, has returned to Berlin and again has been placed in prison.\\" In 1927, James took part in a Sacco & Vanzetti meeting at the Boston Common during the trial. As one reporter expressed, \\"Before Governor Fuller granted a respite to Messrs. Sacco & Vanzetti the streets of Boston contained a number of persons who annoyed the police. Edward Holton James, nephew of the late famed Philosopher William James and Novelist Henry James, attended a Sacco & Vanzetti mass meeting on the Boston Common. Smartly dressed, neatly barbered, looking more like a distinguished professor emeritus than a boisterous radical nephew, James shouted: 'Down with the police!,' assaulted a bluecoat, was promptly arrested.\\"\\"Boston Disturbers.\\" Time magazine. August 22, 1927. In the early 1930s, James wrote two books on Mahatma Gandhi, and In March 1931, he traveled to India to confer with Gandhi and attend sessions of the All-India National Congress. In the 1940s, influenced by the ideas of American fascist writer Lawrence Dennis, James headed a nationalist group called the Yankee Freemen. In 1943, he wrote I Am a Yankee, a book published by the Yankee Freemen Movement. During the 1950s, he and the Duke of Bedford published The Word in Glasgow, edited by Guy A. Aldred. The worldwide exploits of James are many, but one particular incident speaks to the nature of his character. He was a devoted violinist, often practicing for hours at a time, yet his style of playing was unique. As remembered by his nephew Vaux: “Having very short fingers, he decided that he would develop a whole new system of music for the violin, and therefore cut down the necks of all his instruments, thereby shortening them materially so his fingers could reach the strings more easily…The music which he then subsequently played consisted of very high squeaks and he would practice for hours in his room on these principles which he developed.” As his son-in-law Alexander Calder, too, recalled in his Autobiography with Pictures, “Mr. James used to the play violin atrociously but assiduously.”Calder, Calder: An Autobiography with Pictures (New York: Pantheon Books, 1966), p. 150.

She was born as Elli L. Friedmann in Samorin, Czechoslovakia,Zeiger, Hanna B. \\"I Have Lived a Thousand Years: Growing Up in the Holocaust.\\" Horn Book Magazine 73.4 (July 1997): 472-473. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. [Library name], [City], [State abbreviation]. March 10, 2009 She was 13 years old when she, her mother, father, aunt and brother Bubi, were taken to Ghetto Nagymagyar. Eventually, they were transported to Auschwitz, the largest German concentration camp, where her brother and aunt were separated from Livia and her mother. Her aunt perished but her brother survived. She, her mother and brother were liberated in 1945. Bitton-Jackson came to the U.S. on a refugee boat in 1951 to join Bubi, who was studying in New York. She then studied at New York University, from which she received a Ph.D. in Hebrew Culture and Jewish History. She also wrote her 1997 memoir I Have Lived a Thousand Years. Early life Elli was born in Samorin, on February 28, 1931, the second child to Laura and Markus Friedman, but in 1938, Hungarian troops occupied Samorin, renaming it Somorja. In Somorja, the segregation of Jews began rapidly when the Germans invaded Hungary in 1944. Jews were prohibited from entering theaters, restaurants, grocery stores, and other public places. Two months into the German occupation, all the Jews in that area were moved to Ghetto Nagymagyar. In Ghetto Nagymagyar, all men between the ages of 18 and 45, her father included, were sent to a forced labor camp in Komárom, some from the ghetto. Two weeks after her father was taken, Bitton-Jackson, her aunt, mother, and brother were removed from the ghetto and taken to Dunajska Streda, a town in Slovakia and then to Auschwitz, the largest concentration camp built by the Germans in occupied Poland. She and her mother stayed there for ten days. In June 1944, Bitton-Jackson and her mother were transferred, along with 500 other women, to Plaszow, a forced labor camp near Kraków. There, their work consisted of planierung - leveling off a hilltop in preparation for construction. If they did not work properly, or violated any rule, they would be beaten by their Kapo or his assistants. After two months at Plaszow, they returned to Auschwitz. She was 13 at the time. In August 1944, Bitton-Jackson and her mother were taken from Auschwitz to a factory in the German city of Augsburg. In Augsburg, she was put to work in an assembly line in the factory, where they produced a \\"precision instrument that is supposed to control the distance and direction of the bomb ejected by a fighter plane\\". They stayed until April 1945. After this she and her mother were taken to a subsidiary camp of Dachau, in Germany, where she was reunited with her older brother Bubi, who was staying in the men's camp. Her stay here was shortened due to the Allies advance and the three surviving members of the family were taken by trains further into Germany. On the way the guards deserted and many of the prisoners mistook this to be the liberation. However, the guards returned and fired upon those who had left the train, and ordered the others back onto the carriages. During the rest of the journey, Bitton- Jackson was able to keep her brother with herself and her mother. At one point, she spotted through the cracks in the carriage Red Cross trucks, and the soldiers informed them that the charity would be giving out food. The surviving inmates lined up close to the carriage entrance whereupon they were shot at by the SS. Bubi received a shot to the forehead, but survived. It was only after a week of traveling that the Americans discovered the trains full of dead, injured and starving inmates. After the liberation, Bitton-Jackson, her mother and brother stayed in Seeshaupt where she helped to nurse her brother and fellow inmates back to health. Later life After the war she and her brother and mother returned to Šamorín, believing that her father would be waiting for them, only to discover that he was dead. Her brother then moved to New York on a visa from a school scholarship. Bitton-Jackson had the opportunity to go with her brother but chose to stay in Czechoslovakia with her mother. The two stayed in Šamorín until 1951, when they finally got visas to go to America.Bitton-Jackson, Livia, \\"Hello, America, A Refugee's Journey from Auschwitz to the New World\\", July 1, 2006, They traveled to America on a refugee boat, and Bitton-Jackson continued her education. She eventually enrolled in New York University, and got a degree there. Bitton-Jackson has a Ph.D. in Hebrew Culture and Jewish History obtained at New York University. She has been a professor of history at City University of New York for 37 years, and has won numerous awards, including the 1998 Christopher Award for her book, I Have Lived a Thousand Years. In 1977, Bitton-Jackson moved to Israel, where she has been living ever since. She continued teaching at CUNY for years thereafter, and still makes periodic trips to the U.S. for speaking engagements. In April 2009, Bitton-Jackson was invited to speak in Omaha, Nebraska, for Holocaust Remembrance Day at the Durham Museum, with videolinks to Pleasanton and at Millard West High School.

During this time his focus turned exclusively to botany, and in 1853 he became a professor of botany and director of the botanical gardens at Giessen. He maintained these positions until his death in 1891. Hoffmann was a pioneer of botanical phenology (plant climatology). He also did important studies in the fields of plant physiology and phytogeography. He conducted research involving the biological aspects of fungi in relation to fermentation, putrefaction and disease, and also performed early investigations in the field of bacteriology. In 1869, Hoffmann wrote a book on species and varieties that included a long excerpt from Gregor Mendel's genetics paper of 1865. The book attempted to refute Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.Keynes, Milo. (2002). Mendel—both ignored and forgotten.

The revolt gathered international attention. Background Indigenous people have been marginalized in Mexico since Spain colonized the region in 1519. Disease, enslavement, and exploitation have affected and devastated many American Indigenous communities, and the effects of colonization have continued to affect Mexican Indigenous communities. Indigenous people make up 15% of Mexico's population, and in 2011, the demographic also made up the majority of the 18% of Mexico's population living with food insecurity. Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas holds about 13% of the country's entire indigenous population and also has the second highest poverty rate following the state of Guerrero. About half of the Indigenous population in Chiapas reported no income in the 2010 census with another 42% of individuals earning less than $5 a day. Indigenous people in the state have also been impacted by malnutrition as well as restricted access to health and education services. Economic oppression was also visible during the 1950s when Indigenous people were prevented from entering San Cristobal city limits and instead had to sell some of their items to intermediaries at values much lower than the actual items' worth. Following the Tlatelolco massacre, the Mexican government continued to suppress instances of political mobilization and social organization as part of what is known as the Dirty War. Despite the threat of government persecution, campesino organizations as well as small armed groups began to form in Chiapas in the 1970s. In efforts to suppress Indigenous resistance in the region, farm and land owners created paramilitary forces sponsored by the Mexican government designed to violently reciprocate against potential Indigenous defiance. At the same time, many Indigenous individuals known as guerrilleros formed small armed militant groups in response to persecution, one of which became the EZLN. Carlos Salinas was elected president of Mexico in 1988, and while he promised to utilize government funding to assist poor states like Chiapas, residents never saw the money controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The catalyst for the EZLN's decision to revolt was the 1991 revision of Article 27 in Mexico's 1917 revolutionary constitution. Under Article 27, Native communal landholdings or ejidos were protected from sale or privatization. With the removal of Article 27, Native farmers feared the loss of their remaining lands and cheap imports from the US. In the year before the rebellion, the EZLN designated Sub-commandant Marcos as the ideological leader of the uprising and also made plans to declare war on the state of Mexico. Marcos was unique in his leadership because unlike most of the uprising's participants, his ethnicity was mestizo instead of indigenous. EZLN declared war on the Mexican state on January 1, 1994 to protest NAFTA's implementation.Subcommander Marcos, Ziga Voa! 10 Years of the Zapatista Uprising. AK Press 2004 Events On the day of the uprising, Tzotzil, Tzeltal, Tojolab'al, and Ch'ol individuals attacked civic centers such as city halls in many towns including San Cristóbal de las Casas, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, Ocosingo, and Chanal. Rebels wore ski masks and utilized furniture and other office materials to barricade themselves inside of buildings once they had taken them over. During the occupation of the city, rebels also painted pro-Zapatista statements on the walls of buildings.Miguel Angel Godínez Bravo era el Comandante de la Séptima Región Militar (sureste del país) y Gastón Menchaca Arias el Comandante de la 31a. Zona Militar. In San Cristóbal de las Casas, the Zapatistas released 230 predominantly Indigenous prisoners and also demolished land records. Soon after, Subcommandante Marcos stated the EZLN's declaration of war against the Mexican state. Hours later, the Zapatista rebels abandoned San Cristóbal de las Casas so the Mexican Army could later recapture it. Despite the lack of resistance in San Cristóbal de las Casas, when 600 Zapatista rebels overtook the town of Altamirano, a battle with government forces ensued. In Chanal, the Zapatistas stated the purpose of their uprising; days later the town would be recaptured. In Ocosingo, rebels were met by police forces who retaliated violently against Zapatista occupation. The Mexican army also responded to the attacks and by the end of that week all rebels had been driven out of occupied towns and into the Lacandon jungle where some fighting would continue for five more days. A ceasefire was finally called by the Mexican government on January 12, 1994. It was estimated that about 300 people died in the duration of the conflict. Aftermath After the ceasefire, Manuel Camacho was designated the government representative for peace relations between the Mexican state and the Zapatistas. On February 21, 1994, members of the EZLN, Manuel Camacho, and intermediary bishop Samuel Ruiz met in San Cristóbal de las Casas to discuss peace agreements. However, the EZLN rejected government propositions on June 12. Peace discussions were also further interrupted by the Mexican army's invasion of the land that Zapatistas had occupied in February 1995. The San Andrés Accords peace agreement was finally signed by the Zapatistas and Mexican government in February 1996. The San Andrés Accords provided the Zapatistas a level of autonomy in Chiapas for some time. The uprising had attracted worldwide media attention. While human rights organizations emphasized the marginalization of the indigenous population, Riordan Roett (adviser to the Emerging Markets Group of the Chase Manhattan Bank) stated in January 1995: > While Chiapas, in our opinion, does not pose a fundamental threat to Mexican > political stability, it is perceived to be so by many in the investment > community. The government will need to eliminate the Zapatistas to > demonstrate their effective control of the national territory and of > security policy.  Support  During the rebellion, a gathering of about 100,000 people in Mexico City protested against the attempted government suppression of the Zapatistas. Other protesters also engaged in marches, road blocks, sit-ins, and strikes even until the Indigenous Rights Bill became a law in 2001.

On the other side of the state border, the trail becomes the Spokane River Centennial Trail and extends for another out to Sontag Park in Nine Mile Falls, Washington. The trail passes through the towns of Post Falls, Idaho and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. History Following the World's Fair and Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington, the Washington state Parks and Recreation Commission started planning a trail along the Spokane River to celebrate their state's centennial in 1989. Coordination began with Idaho to extend the trail past the border and the northeast side of Lake Coeur d'Alene to celebrate Idaho's centennial as well in 1990.

Although Wraith first appears in the prologue as a vision,Annihilation: Conquest Prologue his first physical appearance was in Annihilation Conquest: Wraith #1 in \\"Annihilation Conquest\\"The Kree With No Name?: Grillo-Marxuach talks \\"Annihilation: Conquest - Wraith\\", Comic Book Resources, 16 April 2007. Publication history Wraith first appeared in Annihilation Conquest: Wraith #1 (2007) and was created by Javier Grillo- Marxuach and Kyle Hotz. Wraith returned in Donny Cates and Geoff Shaw's 2019 relaunch of Guardians of the Galaxy. Fictional character biography Wraith is the son of Kree scientist Sim-Del, who created a power source sufficient to \\"light an entire galaxy\\". Kree society banished him, but he continued his work, using the power source to turn the barren planetoid he inhabited into a paradise. The Kree then simply destroyed him, his wife, and all trace of his work. However, his son was sent off in an escape ship.Wraith #2 The ship drifted into The Exoteric Latitude, the space of the Nameless, an offshoot of the Kree who were once ancient Kree explorers lost thousands of years ago and their bodies were invaded by the Exolon, parasites that feed on the souls of living creatures. The Nameless made Zak-Del into one of their own and was promptly infected with the Exolon. Because he had become a Nameless, he was subjected to endless self-inflicted torture, as this is the only way a Nameless can remember their life before losing their soul. He was haunted by the image of the signet ring worn by the man who killed his parents, and that is what brings him to Kree space — to hunt down that man. Wraith defeated the leader of the Nameless and he stole their polymorphic weapon and a ship that transported to journeyed back into the galaxy to hunt down the man. Although his time with the Nameless made him rather cold and shows brutal efficiency as a fighter, Wraith retains some pragmatic yet moral standards. Wraith is first seen when he incapacitated an entire Phalanx battle-cruiser, drawing the attention of both the Phalanx and the Resistance forces led by Ra-Venn opposing them. Because he was able to make the Phalanx feel fear, both sides wished to add him to their ranks. He is tracked by the Phalanx to the resistance's base, and in allowing them to escape, he is captured and brought before Ronan the Accuser, head of the Kree empire since the end of the Annihilation War, now slave and Head Inquisitor of the Phalanx.Wraith #1 Though Ronan subjects Wraith to all manner of horrible torture, inflicting more pain than any Kree would be able to withstand, Wraith refuses to give up his origins, finally prompting an infuriated Ronan to attempt to impale him on a large spike. Wraith simply pulls himself off and immediately heals. Ronan states that due to his seeming immunity to pain, he is not Kree, he is something else, like a wraith. This amuses the son of Sim-Del, and he decides that Wraith is a suitable new name for himself. He then divulges his origins and indicates that he pities Ronan because he is a slave. The Accuser decides the greatest torture he could inflict would be to make Wraith a slave to the Phalanx for all time, and he promptly infects Wraith with Phalanx technology. Wraith does not succumb, however, and simply puts himself into a coma-like state, which infuriates Ronan personally and annoys the Phalanx. A vision of Sim-Del in Wraith's mind convinces him to continue fighting, as only the punishment of the man with the signet ring could set his and his wife's spirits free. His father also convinces him that he cannot find the man alone, and so Wraith enlists the help of Super-Skrull and Praxagora. The trio escape and meet up with the Resistance, saving them from a Phalanx warship. Although he has little interest in the war with the Phalanx, Wraith accepts the offer to join the Resistance and fight the Phalanx in return for their help in tracking down the people who murdered his family.Wraith #3 With Wraith and crew's assistance, the rebellion manages to capture a Phalanx scientist who has information on the Phalanx's super weapon. After determining the deployment point and the time of the attack, the fleet launches a suicide mission to deliver Wraith, Super-Skrull and Praxagora to the scene, where they infiltrate the Phalanx fleet and find the weapon, a Phalanx-infected Supreme Intelligence. Here Wraith again sees his father's spirit, speaking through the Supreme Intelligence, who instructs him not to stop the weapon, but to let it activate, and then to release the Exolon and absorb the Supreme Intelligence's soul, not only saving the Kree, but also dealing a massive blow to the Phalanx and freeing Ronan from the Phalanx's control. Wraith also convinces Ronan to overcome his shame and lead the Kree against their captors. He himself remains with the resistance, not revealing what he has truly done, to later use the Supreme Intelligence's soul to become a beacon of hope for the people.Wraith #4 Wraith and allies travels to the planet Kree-Lar, a ceded territory of the Kree that is home to Ravenous (the former right-hand man of Annihilus from \\"Annihilation\\" storyline) and enemies to the Kree, at Ronan's behest. Wraith makes his wariness and distrust of this mission clear to Ronan before their ship is attacked and are sent crashing into the planet.Annihilation: Conquest #1 The group land on the surface and found that the Phalanx engaging warfare with the Ravenous, but Wraith uses his Exolon parasites paralyze the Phalanx and stop the fighting. Recognizing Wraith being the key to dealing with the Phalanx, the Ravenous agreed to allow the group to see their leader.Annihilation: Conquest #2 During the audience, Wraith demonstrates his powers the Ravenous before subduing him, allowing Ronan to access the secret chamber underneath the throne.Annihilation: Conquest #3 Ronan leads Wraith the 15,000 Kree Sentries that lays dormant in the chamber, which Wraith and Praxagora reprogrammed to make the sentries immune to the Phalanx's abilities.Annihilation: Conquest #4 As Ronan launches the 15,000 Kree Sentries to Hala to destroy all Phalanx and Phalanx-infected Kree on the Kree homeworld Hala, Wraith stands quietly aside as he watches Ronan enacts his plans and orders Ravenous to get them a ship to travel to Hala.Annihilation: Conquest #5 Upon arriving in Hala's space system, the group notices other forces are fighting against the Phalanx, Praxagora is possessed by Ultron, who is the Phalanx Technarchy's primary director, and stuns Wraith so he can transfer his essence into the Sentries and adds them to his army. Ultron kills Praxagora and explodes the ship, but Wraith and the others are saved by the Super- Skrull' force field, who takes them Hala's surface. Upon seeing Adam Warlock and Phyla-Vell battling a giant-size Ultron, Wraith aids them by using the Exolon to trapped Ultron in his current body, allowing Phyla-Vell to finished him off. After the battle, Wraith uses his Exolon to purge any Phalanx- infected Kree citizens before continuing on his quest to find his family's killer.Annihilation: Conquest #6Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z Update #1 After Gamora killed Thanos in Infinity Wars, Wraith attended Thanos's funeral and witness Starfox showing all the guests a recording of Thanos stating that he uploaded his consciousness in a new body before his death.

Marvel Comics. Wraith and many others are saved by Gladiator and the Shi'ar Empire, allowing Starfox to continue recruit warriors to find Gamora, the most likely candidate to be Thanos's new body. Wraith brings up the issue of the Black Order, but Starfox assure they are searching for them and Nebula states that the team should track down Nova to find Gamora's location.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #2. Marvel Comics. The Dark Guardians found Nova and ambush him, wounding him enough to crash land onto a planet. Wraith demands Nova to tell Gamora's location, stating the fact he doesn't want to harm him if doesn't have to. Wraith also reveals his reason for helping Starfox is so he could find Knull, the ancient malevolent primordial deity who created the Klyntar and the Exolon. Wraith wants to have Knull free him from the Exolon parasites. When Gladiator and Cosmic Ghost Rider orders him to back off, Nova takes the chance to fly off again, but the team plans to track down again.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #3 As Nebula predicted, Nova leads them to Gamora, who was about Star-Lord's ship, and attack. Amidst the chaotic battle, Starfox and his team easily overwhelmed the Guardians and captured Gamora.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #4 After delivering Gamora to Starfox, Wraith demanded that Starfox uphold his part of their bargain. Starfox handed Wraith a flashdrive of all the information he collected on Knull, though he told Wraith the intel is not very much. When the Black Order and Hela appeared, Wraith didn't intervene since he already got what he needed.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 5 #5 Eventually Wraith tracked down Knull on Klyntar and discovered the Exelon were discarded offshoots created by Knull, and had them stripped from him. During this enounter he also discovered Knull has an opposite, a god of light, and transported to Earth to tell Eddie Brock.Web of Venom: Wraith #1 Powers and abilities Wraith is experienced fighter and possesses an unidentified polymorphic weapon which can take on a variety of forms, including a gun, a whip, a small blade, and devices like binoculars. As a Kree, Wraith possesses his species' unique physiology, having far greater natural attributes than a human and is resistant to poisons, toxins and diseases. Due to the Exolon parasites that infect and maintain his body, he possesses enhanced speed, strength and agility greater than a normal Kree, as well as an ability to heal himself from even the most egregious of wounds. He also does not age and cannot die, at least not in any way yet shown. By summoning swarms of Exolon, he can strike fear into his opponents, and, because the Exolon feed on souls, swarms of it appear—at least to the Phalanx— to eat the exposed soul of a living being. Due to the nature of the Nameless and their rituals of inflicting pain on themselves, he also has an unnaturally high tolerance for pain, not screaming or making any other negative reactions to it. Due to not being alive in conventional sense, Wraith also has an unspecific degree of immortality and is immune to scanners as he is not identify as a life-form. The Exolon also grants Wraith the ability to absorb energy blasts and the souls of other beings. In other mediaTelevision= Wraith appears in the Guardians of the Galaxy animated series, voiced by Jeff Bennett. In this series, he more resembled a member of the Kree before gradually becoming more like his comic book version in each of his appearances. Prior to the series, Gamora brought Zak-Del's scientist father and an invention of his to Ronan the Accuser so he could weaponize it, but the scientist threw himself and the invention into a black hole. Ever since, Zak-Del blamed Gamora for what happened and swore revenge. In the episode \\"Fox on the Run\\", Zak-Del served as Gamora's first opponent in a series of trials organized by Ronan and the Grandmaster, but was defeated. However, he learned Gamora was only acting on Ronan's orders, so he shifted his vengeance towards him and later confronted him. The episode \\"It's Tricky\\" delves into Zak-Del's reputation as an assassin and bounty hunter who specializes in polymorphic weapons after he is arrested by the Nova Corps. Star-Lord attempted to loot his abandoned hideout, only to accidentally trigger a Tactigon weapon's detonation program. He took it to the planet Xandar to put it in a time stasis container before it could explode, but Zak- Del had broken out by this time and fought Star-Lord's team, the Guardians, for stealing from him before Star-Lord froze him. In the episode \\"Money Changes Everything\\", Rocket Raccoon competes with an escaped Zak-Del to apprehend the alien con artist Ichthyo Pike. All the while, the Kree alludes to the Exolon parasites inhabiting his body and showcases the powers they grant him. While Rocket was able to turn Pike over to the Nova Corps, their leader Irani Rael could not find Zak-Del and tells Rocket to find more bounties to pay off his debt. While he hijacked a Nova Corps ship to do so, Zak-Del attempted to claim a bounty on Rocket's head. In the episode \\"Gotta Get Outta This Place\\", Zak-Del makes a cameo as one of many witnesses called in by Phyla-Vell to testify against the Guardians after they were framed for a crime at the Kree Monument of Justice. =Video games= * Wraith appears in Marvel: Avengers Alliance 2. * Wraith appears as a Toy Box townsperson in Disney Infinity 2.0 and Disney Infinity 3.0. * Wraith appears in Minecraft as a DLC skin in the Guardians of the Galaxy Skin Pack.

The original series was first published in 1915 and was out of print by World War II; it was revived from 2006 to 2014. Both the original series and revival were discovered to have published content based on fabricated New England communities. History The series was launched in 1915 as an advertising campaign by the White Pine Bureau, a joint venture of the Northern Pine Manufacturer's Association of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan and the Associated White Pine Manufacturers of Idaho. Architect Russell F. Whitehead was hired to supervise the series with Julian Buckly as photographer. During the first 10 years, the series was limited to the exterior details of residences constructed with Eastern white pine, as suited its advertising purpose. Often the notable structures of a single village would be documented together in one issue. By 1920, the editor's collection of unpublished photographs became so extensive that Whitehead and his colleague Hubert Ripley invented the fictional town of Stotham, Massachusetts, to justify their use. The fiction went undiscovered until the late 1940s when Leicester Bodine Holland, head of the Library of Congress' Department of Fine Arts related his inability to locate the town to Whitehead, eliciting an explanation of the subterfuge.Harbeson, J.F. (May, 1964). “Stotham, The Massachusetts Hoax, 1920.“ The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians. 23(2): 111-112. In 1924, the White Pine Bureau ceased its advertising campaign and Whitehead determined to continue the series independently, selling advertising space to Weyerhauser Forest Products. He also modified the focus of the series, including documentation of churches and public buildings and the recording of interiors and millwork details He also expanded the geographic scope of the project, documenting buildings in the southern states, many of which had been framed with Southern pine or Cypress. In 1932, the Monograph series became absorbed into the Pencil Points architectural journal as a regular feature. The documentation of historic structures with photographs and measured drawings complemented the \\"Comparative Details\\" feature which published construction details for contemporary projects. The Monograph series was ended abruptly in June 1940. Many of its contributors became involved in the Historic American Buildings Survey. =Re-issue and revival= Eagerly collected by architects and historians, the monographs have been re-issued in bound editions several times. In 1987, the National Historical Society of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, began publishing a series of hardbound books, the Architectural Treasures of Early America, drawn entirely from the White Pine Monographs. They reorganized the individual editions into geographic regions and re-set all the type in order to produce a consistent presentation. They were also able, in many cases, to make use of the original photographs which had been given to Weyerhauser by Whitehead's widow. In 2006, the Northeastern Lumber Manufacturers Association (NELMA) revived the title for a new series of publications documenting the production and use of Eastern white pine lumber in construction.\\"The Revitalization of a Historical Monograph Series.\\" (2006) Northeastern Lumber Manufacturers Association.

Moore was a pediatric nurse by training and, following humanitarian work in Germany and Morocco, she was one of the earliest volunteers for the Peace Corps. She served in Togo during the 1960s and was accompanied by her husband and fellow Peace Corps volunteer, Mike Moore, who had once been her French language teacher. After the birth of the couple's first daughter, Mandela, following their return to the United States, Ann attempted to carry her child in the style used in West Africa by using a long shawl as a sling to strap the infant to her back. Finding this method to be ineffective, as the child would slip, Moore and her mother, Agnes Lucille (Lucy) Auckerman, developed a backpack harness that would become the forerunner to the Snugli. Initial sales were through word-of-mouth contacts, though in 1966, the Snugli was advertised in the Whole Earth Catalog. The Snugli was patented in 1969. Moore's modifications to the infant carrier resulted in additional patents. In 1988 and 1989, she was issued patents for the Air Lift, a soft-sided backpack carrier for portable oxygen dispensers and high-tech instruments; the Moore's created a Colorado-based eponymous company to commercialize the invention. Moore grew up on a farm in Ohio and was raised in the Dunkard tradition. She taught for a time after completing her training in pediatric nursing at Columbia University's Babies Hospital in New York City. Moore has three daughters, the eldest of whom they named Mandela (aka Mande), after Nelson Mandela.

A modern wharf with electric cranes was constructed in the 1930s. This was used by the Dundee, Perth & London Shipping Company to operate a twice-weekly service between Leith and London. The wharf was destroyed during the blitz and reconstructed in the 1950s, going out of use in 1969. After demolition for construction of the Limehouse Link the current residential development by architects CZWG was built.Ellmers C and Werner A,\\"London's Riverscape Lost and Found\\", The London's Found Riverscape Partnership,2000, Dundee Wharf has a prominent position on the River Thames. It was built in 1997 by Ballymore Properties to designs by the architect Piers Gough, a partner at Campbell Zogolvich Wiltinson and Gough (CZWG). Gough additionally designed the bridge over Limekiln Dock. The name Limehouse comes from the lime oasts in Limekiln Dock in the 14th century and used to produce quick lime for building mortar. Pottery manufacture followed. In 1660 Samuel Pepys visited a porcelain factory in Duke’s Shore. Limekiln Wharf was established in 1740 as England’s first soft past porcelain factory. Industry moved into building barges and thrived well into the 19th century. Dundee Wharf is on the embankment known as the Dunbars. Dundee, Aberdeen, Caledonia and Dunbar Wharves were owned by Dundee Perth and London Shipping Company. Their office building stands today adjacent to the entrance to Dundee Wharf. In 1835 their passenger paddle steamers SS London and SS Perth carried passengers on a twice-weekly service to Dundee, Scotland. A first class cabin cost 42 shillings and sixpence. More or less opposite the main entrance were banana warehouses, to the right River Plate Wharf. The river ferry from Limehouse Pier left from Limehouse Stairs. Prior to its demolition Dundee Wharf was a \\"massive fortress like warehouse\\" trading in general goods. The air was scented by the juniper berries used for the manufacture of London gin and stored at St Dunstan’s Wharf on the opposite side of Limekiln. The Lockett Wilson was the last vessel that regularly used Dundee Wharf; it plied its trade between Dundee Wharf and up the Seine to Paris. The first voluntary emigrants to Australia left from the Dunbars - the involuntary emigrants from Wapping Old Stairs.

Raja Segar (born December 4, 1951) known as Segar, is a Sri Lankan artist and sculptor. He primarily does figure painting, with an interest in religious figures, such as Buddha and Ganesha, and everyday South Asian life. He describes his style as \\"refractive\\".  Early life  Segar was born to poor parents in the suburb of Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. He used to walk to school which was 5 km away from home to save bus fare so that he could eat something during the interval. After schooling at St Michael's College, Polwatte, Colombo-3 at the age of 19, he started working in a soft drinks manufacturing company in the field of accountancy. While studying for his accountancy examinations he spent most of his time in the reference sections of the British Council library in Colombo. There he was able to browse through a collection of books and periodicals on art and artists. In his news paper interviews he always states; British Council was my university of fine art.  Career  Segar with leftMonotonous work in the accountancy department started to bore him. Segar started to design his own greeting cards purely based on the day to day lifestyle of Sri Lankans. His cards became an instant hit as most of the greeting cards in Sri Lanka were copied from the paintings of western countries. The art lovers who saw his cards wanted him to make large paintings. Hence, comfortably he became a painter. To give his art a serious impact Segar started experimenting the refractive effect of light in his abstract and figurative cubism. Tangent in geometry played a part in his drawings. His overlapping figures in his paintings was influenced by the Venn diagrams in Statistics. He loves to work in watercolor, oil and mixed media. In sculpture he works in steel. He has had one man exhibitions in Australia, England, India and Sri Lanka in addition to group exhibitions. Though his paintings sometimes depict gods and religion, he remains an atheist. His art has appeared in newspapers, documentaries and periodicals including Reader's Digest. In 1988 he attempted suicide as a result of failed love affair but changed the idea as he thought of more than 20 of his unsigned paintings. In 1996, Segar had his 19th solo exhibition in Colombo and donated the sales proceed of more than US$5000 to the Neurosurgery Trust Fund of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka, in the year which his wife of 29 years, Vejeyashanthinie, died of brain stem cancer. The Housing Scheme 1977 and The Buddha 1987 are the two famous paintings in his career. In 2002, he represented Sri Lanka at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation artist meet up in Delhi. Segar participated in the Abu Dhabi Cultural Summit in April 2017. Personal life Segar was born to Hindu parents in Colombo Sri Lanka. His parents became Christians of catholic denomination after 3 years of their marriage, for the simple reason of getting Christian Schools for their Children. This was rather a common practice in Sri Lanka. Segar had to go to Sunday school in Anthony's Church Kollupitiya, in addition to going to church every Sundays. Until he was 13 he never missed a Sunday mass as he was told by the church that he would go to hell if he stop going to church and heaven is only possible only if he believes Jesus Christ as his only god. Segar noticed that hardly anyone read the Bible in his environment, may be reading the Bible was restricted among Catholics. Curious Segar started to read the Bible secretly. He read it again and he stopped going to Church ever since. When the congregation asked him he answered; It takes more than 8 minutes for the sun light to reach earth. Our next sun (star) is more than 4 light years away. Pl show me where the heaven is. Further, I am not interested in going to place where you can not communicate with your loved ones. However Segar was fascinated by the stories in both the religions Hinduism and Christianity. Religions became great art objects for his paintings. Segar's paintings on Gods were greatly admired and several of his paintings on Hindu god Ganesha adorned the shrine rooms of posh Hindus in several countries. He lives in a house architectured by Minnette De Silva. This house conceived from Segar's imagination when he was 12 years old.

According to his introduction, \\"When Zabdiel Podbury fled from Stoke-on-Tritham in the Spring of 1689 with Drusilla Ives, taking passage on the bark Promise, sailing for Massachusetts Bay, it was not realized at the time that, from this union, and the joint labors of the Penthesilean pair, the village of Stotham (so named by them in memory of their autochthonous abode) would in later days come to be regarded as a typical example, although, perhaps, not so well known, of the unspoiled New England Village.\\" Ripley, Hubert G.

Early life He was born in Cottesmore, Rutland where his father, Thomas Cattell, was the headmaster of the village school. He trained as a teacher. He was successively headmaster at schools at Woodford Bridge, Essex; Llanelli; and St Paul's Church Schools, Sheffield. When the Free Education Act (1891) was passed, he left teaching for business. Rugby career Cattell came to prominence as a rugby player representing first class Welsh team Llanelli. In 1882 Cattell was selected for the Welsh national team as part of the 1883 Home Nations Championship against England. This was the first match of the first Home Nations Championship and Cattell along with Thomas Judson and Harry Bowen became the first players to represent Llanelli in an international game. Under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, and played on Welsh soil for the first time, Wales were outclassed by an English team that had lost only three times in their first 21 matches. Although the Welsh were beaten by two goals and four tries to nil, it was seen as a far more promising result than the teams first meeting 22 months prior, and the selectors kept faith with the majority of the team. Cattell gained his second and final cap for Wales in a game away to Scotland at Raeburn Place. This was the first time the countries had faced each other in a rugby union match, and Wales lost by three goals to one.

Goulden came from a large family of musicians who owned the Goulden's shop in Canterbury, which at one time sold pianofortes, American organs and gramophones.Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879http://www.machadoink.com/Gouldens.htm Dr. Longhurst was organist of Canterbury Cathedral and was connected with the music there for 71 years.Memorial plaque to Dr. Longhurst in Canterbury Cathedral Pringuer was a chorister at the Cathedral before the age of 14, and in both 1911 and 1914, he attended the Cathedral Choristers' Association Reunion.Canterbury Cathedral Archives St. Matthew's, Redhill (1869–1879) In February 1869, Pringuer was appointed as organist of Emmanuel Church, Sidlow, Reigate, and choirmaster at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, Redhill. On the retirement of the organist at St. Matthew's, Redhill, Pringuer was unanimously elected to the post. In 1871, he formed the Redhill Harmonic Society, and went on to direct choir and orchestra in many performances where works included The Messiah, The Creation, Elijah, St. Paul, Mass in C minor K.258, The Woman of Samaria and Faust.Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 The inaugural concert took place in March 1872. Judas Maccabaeus was performed by a band and chorus of 113 performers, Pringuer being congratulated \\"on having brought the members of the society to such a great pitch of excellence as that displayed by them on this occasion\\".Surrey Advertiser, 23 March 1872, p.8 Pringuer married his first wife, Julia Griffin on 4 September 1872 at St. Saviour's, Pimlico; she was the daughter of David Griffin, an engineer.Henry Thomas Pringuer and Julia Griffin: Marriage Certificate, St, George Hanover Square, vol. 1a, p.682 Julia brought with her to the marriage, a daughter Beatrice Maud Griffin, born out of wedlock in 1871.Beatrice Maud Griffin: Birth Certificate, Q3 1871, Lambeth, vol. 1d, p.290 On his marriage, the people of Redhill presented the couple with a black marble clock; and to Pringuer they gave two volumes of organ music and a carved ivory baton mounted in gold.Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 Pringuer in his DMus robes (note that for an unknown reason, the hood is worn inside out)Pringuer was appointed Fellow of the College of Organists (FCO) on 30 January 1877. The examination which was conducted by Charles Joseph Frost and C. Warwick Jordan included four separate elements: organ playing, harmony, counterpoint and general knowledge of music. On 25 October in the same year he gained the degree of Bachelor of Music from New College, Oxford. The examiners were Sir Frederick Arthur Gore-Ouseley Bart. (Heather Professor of Music), Charles William Corfe (organist of Christ Church, and the Choragus) and Leighton George Hayne (organist of Queen's College, Oxford). The first examination was held in the Hilary term and the second in the Michaelmas term.Archive at New College, Oxford Candidates for the BMus were required to summit a composition in five-part harmony with at least five stringed instruments to which no more than four wind instruments could be added. Dr. Pringuer's setting was of Psalm 107 and was scored for flute, clarinet, violin, SATTB and double bass. It was performed by the Redhill Harmonic Society, and was \\"well-received\\".Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 One of Dr. Pringuer's first composition was titled Queen Bess's Solemne Daunce. Originally a piano solo, by special request, it was rescored for orchestra for the Covent Garden Promenade Concerts. Other piano pieces included Holiday Time and Evening on the Lake; and an orchestral march Invicta which has not survived.Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 Whilst in Redhill, in conjunction with Robert Hesketh, Pringuer founded the St. John's Amateur Musical Society who met occasionally to rehearse and perform orchestral works. Towards the end of his time in Redhill, Pringuer was also appointed to the post of music-master at Reigate Grammar School; however, the locals were well aware of the musical limitations of the local area, saying in 1879 Pringuer was \\"a musician of no mean capacity, whose early achievements foreshadow an honourable and prosperous professional career...Mr. Pringuer is far too young to have exhausted his opportunities\\".Surrey Record & Illustrated Journal, no. 22, vol. 2, October 1879 St. Mary's, Stoke Newington (1879–1919) Dr. Pringuer's DMus hood; despite its age, the cherry pink hasn't faded at allPringuer was appointed organist at St. Mary's, Stoke Newington in 1879. He remained there for 40 years, and during that time, he served under four rectors: Rev. Thomas Jackson, Preb. Leonard Shelford, Rev. W. Bryant Salmon and Preb. Patrick Cromie. During his time at the church, the choir became renowned throughout London, and the St. Mary's Choir dinners were considered the 'event of the year' in North London church life.North London Recorder, 31 October 1930 In 1885, Pringuer was examined for, and passed the DMus, again at New College, Oxford. The examination was conducted two eminent musicians in the form of composer Charles Hubert Hastings Parry and Sir. John Frederick Bridge (Organist and Master of the Choristers at Westminster Abbey). The requirements were for a public performance of a piece of vocal music of eight parts with accompaniment for full orchestra. Pringuer composed a setting of Psalm 48 \\"Great is the Lord\\", and it was performed at the Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford, on 16 October 1885. The text was taken from the Book of Common Prayer with the final verse being paraphrased by James Matthews and being sung to the melody of the Old Hundredth. Dr. Pringuer's native Canterbury were always ready to welcome him back, recognising in him \\"a young and gifted citizen who is making a distinguished position in the musical world\\" and he continued to give organ recitals in the city for many years. One such recital on 15 September 1886 included works by Henry Smart, Gustav Merkel, Alexandre Guilmant, J.S. Bach, William Sterndale Bennett and Louis Spohr. Also included was his own composition Evening on the Lake, subtitled Andante in G major. Another recital included a piece titled 'March of the Kings', and is listed as being from Pringuer's Oxford Cantata, though no details of this work are known. Newspaper reports described his performances as \\"much admired\\" and \\"exceedingly effective\\".Newspaper cuttings and posters; source unknown Pringuer married his second wife, Agnes Sarah Carter at the Parish Church of St. Andrew, Stoke Newington on 26 November 1892.Henry Thomas Pringuer and Agnes Sarah Carter: Marriage Certificate, Q4 1892, Hackney, vol. 1b, p.952 Baptised on 12 July 1857 at St. Peter's, Walworth,London Metropolitan Archives, Saint Peter, Walworth, Register of baptisms, P92/PET1, Item 013 she was the daughter of William Carter, a bank clerk of Tottenham, London, and his wife Hannah Hierous of Streatham, Surrey.Guildhall, St Andrew Holborn, Register of marriages, 1854 – 1856, P69/AND2/A/01/Ms 6672/19 Towards the end of the century, Pringuer remained much in demand as a recitalist. Recital venues included St. Stephen's, Walbrook and St. Peter-upon-Cornhill. Later recitals afforded opportunities for Pringuer to accompany a selection of vocalists, including Florence Oliver and Mrs. Harvey Thomas, in works by Sullivan, Mendelssohn and Rossini.Newspaper cuttings and posters; source unknown Around 1907, Pringuer penned the plans for a new organ to be built by Hill & Son. It turned out to be a large organ with four manuals, and was seen in its day to be the 'Rolls Royce' of instruments. Sadly, at the age of 56, Dr. Pringuer's second wife Agnes died on 18 November 1913 at Stamford Hill, London. The impressively named Dr. Theophelus Hoskim MRCS certified the death from cirrhosis of the liver.Agnes Sarah Carter: Death Certificate, Q4 1913, Hackney, vol. 1b, p.464 Just over 10 months after Agnes' death, Pringuer married his third wife, Florence Mildred Saltmarsh Challen, niece of the artist and painter of Mary Seacole, Albert Challen. Daughter of a land surveyor George Trimnell Challen of Islington, London and his wife Julia Pontifex, Henry and Mildred were married at The Cathedral Church of Christ, Canterbury, on 3 September 1914.Henry Thomas Pringuer and Florence Mildred Saltmarsh Challen, Q3 1914, Canterbury, vol. 2a, p.2118 All Saints, Lindfield (1919–1930) After a period of recuperation, possibly at Sidmouth, Devon, Pringuer was appointed organist in the small parish church of All Saints, Lindfield, West Sussex. On 26 October 1930, Pringuer was in the vestry preparing for the evening service at All Saints, Lindfield. The Vicar, Rev. Sidney Swann MA had just congratulated Pringuer on his rendering of the hymn 'When morning gilds the skies' at the morning service, and then while talking to a choirboy, Pringuer suddenly collapsed. Dr. Christopher William Lumley Dodd MRCS LRCP was summoned, but was only able to pronounce life to be extinct. The body was taken to Dr. Pringuer's home at Priory Cottage, and speaking at the service afterwards, Rev. Swann said that in the death, the parish had sustained a \\"great loss\\" although there was \\"some consolation in the fact that Pringuer had died as he would have wished to die – in his cassock, ready to go to the organ he loved so well\\". Dr. Pringuer's funeral took place on 30 October 1930 leaving the residence at 'The Priory', Lindfield for an impressive choral service at the parish church, and then burial at Horsted Keynes. There was \\"universal mourning\\", the event casting \\"a gloom over the whole hamlet\\"North London Recorder, 31 October 1930 Legacy In 1934, money was raised to erect a memorial tablet to Dr. Pringuer's memory. The tablet costing £30 was made of Hopton Wood stone with a blue glass mosaic border, and reads \\"Remember Henry Thomas Pringuer Mus.Doc.Oxon.

Shaare Zion typically has an estimated 1,500 worshipers who attend its services Fridays and Saturdays for Shabbat making it one of the largest Sephardic synagogues in North America. In its over fifty years of existence, the synagogue has hosted over ten thousand occasions including Brit milahs, Bar mitzvas, engagements and weddings.Rushefsky, Carolyn Shaare Zion: The Synagogue That Nearly Wasn't Built .

HistoryOrigins= The congregation was started in 1941 as a local minyan, led by several prominent Syrian Jewish families in home at 1756 Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York. Attendance was usually around 75 people, but the High Holidays, this increased to 750, and services were held at a nearby hall called Aperion Manor at 815 Kings Highway. In 1951 land was purchased on Ocean Parkway and between Avenues T and U. In 1953, architectural plans were drawn up for a synagogue building. =Construction= Soon after construction began, the building fund of $250,000 was used up, and several lawsuits followed over this issue. By 1957, additional funds had been raised or pledged, and the house sold for $90,000, allowing construction to resume. In September 1958, High Holy Day prayers were held in the unfinished social hall; construction was not completed until 1960. Designed by renowned architect Morris Lapidus and completed in 1960, the structure includes a main sanctuary that can seat over 400 worshipers.\\"Congregation Shaare Zion - Prints & Photographs Online Catalog\\". LOC Online Catalog. Retrieved April 22, 2009. =Design= The main sanctuary included a curved balcony, and central dome made of concrete reinforced with steel rods. The New York City Building Department department insisted that the balcony be supported by 20 columns. Feeling this would ruin the aesthetic appeal of the sanctuary, the congregation refused, based on assurances from the building engineers that the balcony's cantilevered design was more than sufficient to support its fully loaded weight. A hall was also built behind the sanctuary for social events, and to provide space for additional services during busy periods. The main sanctuary of Shaare Zion opened for 2,100 congregants on the High Holy Days in 1960. The dome, banquet room, terrace room in the basement, and midrash upstairs were all utilized. Since its construction the building has required very little exterior maintenance; the dome was repainted in 1993, and two glass panes have been replaced. =Expansion= In January 1990, the congregation bought the house next door, on the north side of the building. Renovations were completed a year later, in 1991. Known as the Annex Building, it is used for daily prayers and Torah study. The building also contains office space. In 1996, extensive renovations were done to Social Hall area of the building. The hall was demolished, and a new more modern banquet hall was built in its place. Additionally, a new synagogue building known as B'nei Shaare Zion capable of seating upwards of 250 worshipers, a Beth midrash with dual use as a prayer space on an upper level, and a secondary synagogue along with several meeting rooms on a lower level were built as well. During the 2000s, restoration work was carried out on the dome of the main sanctuary after forty years of continuous exposure to the elements. =Secondary proposed expansion= On December 20, 2011, a plan to expand the facilities of the synagogue was voted down by Brooklyn's Community Board 15, as congregants and nearby residents strongly opposed the development.Prominent Synagogue’s Expansion Plan Brings Civil War On First Night Of Chanukah .

Within the tower were plans to include classrooms, study rooms, multi-purpose rooms and prayer rooms. Opponents of the construction plan took turns voicing their opinions complaining about noise, garbage and parking, which they said would worsen with the enlargement. Immediate neighbors also feared that a taller structure would limit the amount of sunlight hitting their property.

Spence is a former Canadian educator, author, and former Canadian football player. He is the former Director of Education of the Toronto District School Board and former Director of Education of the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board. Biography Born in England to Jamaican parents, Spence has lived in Canada since he was three years old and received his early education in Windsor, Ontario. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in criminology from Simon Fraser University in 1985. A running back, he was drafted by the BC Lions in the third round of the 1985 CFL Draft, but his CFL career was ended in 1988 by an Achilles tendon injury. Spence received a Bachelor of Education degree from York University, a Master of Education degree from the University of Toronto in 1993 and a Doctor of Education degree from the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in 1996, which was later revoked due to plagiarism. He became Director of Education for the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board on September 1, 2004, and served until July 2009, when he became the Director of Education for the Toronto District School Board. Plagiarism, resignation and revoking of teaching license On January 9, 2013, Spence apologized for plagiarizing several passages in an op-ed piece he wrote for the Toronto Star on extracurricular activities. The plagiarism was verified by the Star's public editor. Among the plagiarized material was this paragraph lifted from a 1989 opinion piece in the New York Times: \\"We are challenged through sport to use our minds in guiding our bodies through the dimensions of time and space on the field of play. Learning the skills of sport provides opportunity to experience success.\\" On January 10, 2013, Spence tendered his resignation as director effective immediately after additional incidents of plagiarism in earlier articles and blog entries were uncovered. Passages of his 1996 Ed.D. dissertation were also revealed to have been copied from other sources without attribution; the University of Toronto investigated the allegations and found him guilty of academic dishonesty, stripping him of his doctorate. On December 20, 2016, the Ontario College of Teachers announced that Spence's teaching license had been revoked as a result of the findings of the investigation. His Doctor of Education has been recommended to be revoked by an independent tribunal due to 67 counts of plagiarism in his dissertation. On June 20, 2017, an independent tribunal at the University of Toronto recommended that Chris Spence be stripped of his Doctor of Education degree and that he be expelled from the university based on 67 instances of plagiarism in his 1996 doctorate dissertation that show a clear intention to plagiarize such as paragraph after paragraph and page after page of plagiarism that was edited from American to Canadian spelling and edited to appear as his own opinion. In 2018, Spence lost his fight to keep his PhD. The appeals tribunal stated that the \\"nature and extent [of plagiarism] found in Spence's thesis is a very serious offence.\\" The matter, however is not settled. His lawyer, Darryl Singer, wrote in an email that Spence intends to seek judicial review of the decision in Ontario divisional court. Spence successfully appealed the revocation of his teaching licence in 2018 on the grounds that his \\"'precarious' mental state was not adequately accounted for\\". A psychiatric report stated that Spence's ability to function had been affected by \\"depression and suicidal ideation, related to the evaporation of his marriage and career\\".

It was founded by Andrew Hilton in 1999, with the initial aim of producing two Shakespeare plays between mid February and May each year. The plan was to operate without subsidy, seeking instead sponsorship and using an ensemble of actors recruited or each season. Hilton, an established actor, had spent ten years teaching the craft of Shakespearean theatre at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. History In 2000, the company's first season consisted of productions of King Lear and A Midsummer Night's Dream. These were well received by critics such as Toby O'Connor Morse of The Independent, who commented on Lear: \\"One of the finest productions of Shakespeare – or any other playwright for that matter – seen in Bristol in years\\". On A Midsummer Night's Dream, Lyn Gardner of The Guardian commented: For the 2001 season, the company paired Measure for Measure with Coriolanus. Both productions were well received; Susannah Clapp of The Observer, reviewing Measure for Measure, stated: and on Coriolanus, Jeremy Kingston of The Times described the company as \\"one of the most exciting theatre companies in the land.\\" For their third season, The Winter's Tale accompanied Twelfth Night. John Peter of The Sunday Times said of The Winter's Tale, \\"The costumes are striking and the props are few. Hilton's production, with the audience on four sides, is clean, clear and swift.\\" and Lyn Gardner on Twelfth Night described the production style: The 2003 season productions of Troilus and Cressida and As You Like It were praised by critics, who noted that they \\"differ both from the RSC showcase efforts and the worthy but often laboured school curriculum ad-hoc companies.\\" and > It is tiresome to have to use a small, unsubsidised company in the suburbs > of Bristol to beat the great RSC about the head, but one lesson Boyd and his > team might learn from the Tobacco Factory's As You Like It is that it is > time to return to basics. Stop spending money on big, ugly sets. Concentrate > your (and the audience's) mind on the space, the actors, the words. If you > have spare money, spend it on costumes. Those were the priorities of the > Elizabethan managers. 2004 brought an end to the initial five-year plan, with productions of Macbeth and Middleton's The Changeling, which, after a spring run in Bristol, transferred to the Barbican Centre in London for a five-week run in the autumn. In May 2004 the company was reborn as a charity as it now continues, named Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory 2004 Limited. This new status allowed charitable donations and an element of subsidy to be sought. In subsequent years the company has produced many more Shakespeare plays, as well as Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and Uncle Vanya, and Molière's The Misanthrope. Jonathan Miller was guest director for a 2008 production of Hamlet. Polinina Kalinina joined the company as the second guest director in 2015 for the production of Romeo and Juliet.

The flag of Manor Farm after Napoleon takes full control. Napoleon is a fictional character and the main antagonist of George Orwell's 1945 novel Animal Farm. He is described as \\"a large, rather fierce-looking Berkshire boar\\" who is \\"not much of a talker\\" and has \\"a reputation for getting his own way\\". While he is at first a common farm pig, he exiles Snowball, another pig, who is his rival for power, and then takes advantage of the animals' uprising against their masters to eventually become the tyrannical \\"President\\" of Animal Farm, which he turns into a dictatorship. Napoleon's greatest crime, however, is his complete transformation into Mr. Jones (original owner of Animal Farm), although Napoleon is a much more harsh and stern master than Mr. Jones is made out to be. In some early French-language versions of Animal Farm, the pig is named César. More recent translations keep the original name.  Napoleon in the allegory  Napoleon was based on Joseph Stalin, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1953. He is presumed to be named after the French emperor Napoleon. Napoleon and Snowball mirror the relationship between Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Trotsky supported Permanent Revolution (just as Snowball advocated overthrowing other farm owners), while Stalin supported socialism in one country (similar to Napoleon's idea of teaching the animals to use firearms, instead). When it seems Snowball will win the election for his plans, Napoleon calls in the dogs he has raised to chase Snowball from the farm. This is the first time the dogs have been seen since Napoleon took them in and raised them to act as his secret police. Later on, after ostracizing Snowball, Napoleon orders the construction of the windmill, which had been designed by Snowball and which Napoleon had opposed vigorously (just as Stalin opposed Trotsky's push for large scale industrialization, then adopted it as a policy when Trotsky was in exile), so as to show the animals that he could be just as inventive as Snowball. The other animals are told it was Napoleon's idea and that Snowball had stolen it. When the primitive windmill collapses after a storm, due to Napoleon's poor planning (a reference to Stalin's backward approach to the Five-Year Plans), Napoleon blames Snowball and starts a wave of terror (a reference to the Great Purge). During this period, he orders the execution of several of the animals after coercing their \\"confessions\\" of wrongdoing. He then commands the building of a second, stronger windmill, while severely cutting rations of the animals, except those of the pigs and dogs. Napoleon later makes a deal with Frederick (similar to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact shortly before World War II). Frederick tricks Napoleon by paying him for a load of timber with counterfeit money and then invading the farm (much as Germany broke its pact and invaded the Soviet Union). During the Battle of the Windmill, the windmill is destroyed; although the animals win, they pay a high price. Napoleon attempts to cover the losses by stating it was a grand victory for the animals. Although Napoleon exhorts the other animals to fight and die for the good of the farm, he himself is a coward and a lazy one at that, in contrast to Snowball, who was more concerned with the welfare of his animal friends than his power. Napoleon uses corrupt historical revisionism to portray himself as a hero, claiming responsibility for the animals' victory in the Battle of the Cowshed, when in reality it was Snowball who had performed heroic acts in this battle. Snowball's acts are denigrated through baldfaced lies about him collaborating with Jones all along and openly supporting Jones during the battle. Snowball was wounded in the back by buckshot, but it is claimed Napoleon inflicted the wounds with his teeth. Napoleon spends most of his time inside, giving his orders through other pigs, like the cunning orator Squealer, who helps spread support for him and changes the commandments. Napoleon declares the farm a republic, and a president is elected; as the only candidate, Napoleon is elected unanimously. During his time in power he also, through Squealer, secretly changes the Seven Commandments' prohibition against killing, drinking, and sleeping in beds, allowing his followers and him to break the original commandments, because the other animals (except for Benjamin, the cynical donkey) are not clever enough to notice, or they blame their own memories if they think they have noticed. Ultimately, Napoleon becomes an oppressive dictator and begins to adopt many aspects of human behavior. The pigs start walking on their hind legs, drinking alcohol, wearing clothes, and carrying whips near the end of the book. The commandments are changed to say, famously, \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\\" The maxim, \\"Four legs good, two legs bad.\\" is changed to \\"Four legs good, two legs better.\\" The novel ends with Napoleon meeting with Pilkington of Foxwood farm and other farmers, who claim the animals here work longer for less food than on other farms they have seen. Napoleon tells the other farmers that he has decided to abolish the use of \\"comrade\\" and declares that the farm shall revert to its original name of Manor Farm. Pilkington and he, just after declaring their similarities, fight after they both draw an ace of spades at a card game. The pigs have become so much like humans, both in behavior and appearance, that the animals watching through a window from the outside cannot tell man and pig apart.Orwell, George.

History A mural at the Learning Enrichment Foundation In the late 1970s, The Borough of York (now a municipality of Toronto) was going through a major economic downturn with closed factories, high unemployment and vacancies. This caused a decline in both incomes and tax revenue, deflating rent prices. As a result, the region became attractive to a wave of recent immigrants. However, without the tax revenue, the Borough was unable to provide adequate social, education, and employment services.Pan-Canadian Community Development Learning Network Profile of Effective Practice: Learning Enrichment Foundation In response to these circumstances, a group of community stakeholders formed a charitable organization which incorporated itself as the Learning Enrichment Foundation in 1978. LEF started by providing multicultural theatre for children but quickly diversified into skill training and youth counseling.History of LEF Over the years, LEF has continued to initiate programs and services that reflect the needs of the local community. As a reception area for recent immigrants and as the part of the Greater Toronto Area with the highest levels of poverty indicators, there was much to be accomplished. LEF now is a leader in community economic development, particularly as it relates to human capital, and still serves the local community. However, poverty and unemployment are not unique to the former City of York, and LEF continues to attract people from across the GTA. In the early 1980s, LEF opened child care centers, launched employment services and skills training programs.History of LEF Programs and services include skill training in areas where there are local jobs, job search, counselling, recruitment service for employers, self- employment training and support, training enterprises including LEF Wood Works and Cooks Training for at risk youth, technology help desk, computer access sites, Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC) classes and literacy classes, a training loan fund, several social enterprises, 18 child care centres, 16 Before & After School Programs and a kitchen in which LEF prepares 500 meals a day, through a partnership with Second Harvest, to go to agencies which serve the homeless. LEF provides a hearty soup lunch to all clients in the building every Thursday, and to LINC nursery children (30 to 35) every day. By 1991, LEF outgrew its facility and moved into its current location on Industry Street.History of LEF LEF has developed many co- operative relationships with many different government departments as well as local organizations and networks in order to plan, improve and develop innovative solutions to local needs. These include: social service (e.g. Second Harvest), immigrant service (e.g. OCASI), child care (e.g. York Early Years), disadvantaged youth (e.g. The Court’s Diversionary Program) and ex- convicts, (Pardons Canada). In relation to local employment, the co-operative relationships include specific skill training and recruitment for local employers, sharing job leads with 300 community partners weekly, active networking with many other organizations, umbrella groups and individuals, through referrals, collaboration and regular meetings. LEF is a founding member of The Canadian Community Economic Development Network and active on membership and Human Capital Development Committees and on the Policy Council. LEF is also a founding member of the Ontario and the Canadian CAP Networks.

It had its roots in the desire of British horse breeders to halt the influx of American-bred racehorses of possibly impure bloodlines during the early 20th century. Many American-bred horses were exported to Europe to race and retire to a breeding career after a number of US states banned gambling, which depressed Thoroughbred racing as well as breeding in the United States. The loss of breeding records during the American Civil War and the late beginning of the registration of American Thoroughbreds led many in the British racing establishment to doubt that the American-bred horses were purebred. In 1913, the Jockey Club and the owners of the General Stud Book passed a regulation named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all of their ancestors had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry. Background Before the introduction in 1913 of what became popularly known—\\"with questionnable taste\\" according to a correspondent writing in The Times—as the Jersey Act, Thoroughbred horses in the United Kingdom were registered in the General Stud Book, the stud book for British and Irish Thoroughbreds. The rules allowed a horse to be registered if all of the horse's ancestors were registered in the General Stud Book or if it had been bred outside of Britain or Ireland and was registered in the stud book of its country of origin.Napier and Rasmussen Treasures of the Bloodstock Breeders' Review p. 642 Overall the General Stud Book had the most stringent rules for registration of Thoroughbreds at the time, around 1900; other countries, including the United States, France, Australia and Russia, were considered by the British and Irish to be much laxer and to have allowed some non- Thoroughbred horses into their national stud books.Leicester Bloodstock Breeding p. 78 The outlawing of race-track betting in parts of the United States between 1900 and 1913 led to a large influx of American-bred horses into Britain and Ireland, giving rise to fears among British breeders that they would be swamped by the American bloodlines and their own stock would become worthless. The biggest state to outlaw betting was New York, which passed the Hart–Agnew Law in 1908.Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America p. 196 By 1911, the average price for yearlings sold at auction was at a record low of $230 ($ as of ).Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America p. 198 Before 1900, most horses were imported into Britain to race, and rarely stayed for a breeding career. The outlawing of gambling resulted in large numbers of American horses that could no longer be supported, and many were shipped to Europe for racing. Because of the downturn in the horse market in the US, it was assumed that most of the horses sent to Europe would stay there permanently and, after retirement from the racetrack, would enter their breeding careers outside the US. Between 1908 and 1913, over 1500 Thoroughbreds were exported from the United States. Those exported included 24 horses who had been or would later become champions – among them Artful, Colin, Henry of Navarre, Peter Pan, and Ballot.Simon Racing Through the Century p. 55 The American Stud Book, the registration book for American Thoroughbreds, was not founded until 1873, much later than the General Stud Book, and the rules for registration required only that a horse have five generations of ancestors in the American Stud Book or other national stud books, unlike the General Stud Book rules.Leicester Bloodstock Breeding p. 79 In addition, many breeding records were destroyed during the American Civil War, as fighting during that conflict took place in noted American Thoroughbred breeding centers. The result was that most American Thoroughbreds in 1913 were unable to show an unblemished pedigree according to the General Stud Book rules. Adding to the problem was the fact that American horses were beginning to win the big horse races in England, starting with Iroquois, who won the 1881 Epsom Derby. J. B. Haggin, an American breeder and owner of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, including the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began to limit the number of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders.Robertson History of Thoroughbred Racing in America pp. 198–199 The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.Leicester Bloodstock Breeding pp. 79–80 Introduction The owners of the General Stud Book, Weatherbys, consulted with the Jockey Club, the United Kingdom's racing authority, and discussions were held about the problems in pedigrees recorded in the American Stud Book. At a meeting of the Jockey Club in spring 1913, Victor Child Villiers, Lord Jersey, the club's senior steward, proposed a resolution limiting the registration of American bloodlines. It passed unanimously in May,Wall Judging the Horse pp. 189–190 and a new regulation was placed in the General Stud Book, Volume 22:Willett Classic Racehorse pp. 71–74 Although named the Jersey Act by a critical foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation did not have the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government.Blood-Horse Staff Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments pp. 124–125 Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a horse that had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.Thoroughbred Times Staff \\"Racing Through the Century: 1911–1920\\" Thoroughbred Times Effects An 1857 engraving of Lexington, from Frank Forester's Horse and Horsemanship of the United States The new rule was not applied retroactively, therefore all American-bred horses registered before 1913 remained on the register, and their descendants were also eligible for registration. Of the 7,756 mares in Volume 27 of the General Stud Book, published in 1933, 930 would have been ineligible under the new rule.Staff \\"The General Stud Book, The Full Story\\" The Times The Jersey Act did have an immediate impact however, as the winner of the 1914 Epsom Derby, Durbar II, was ineligible for registration, as his dam, Armenia, was bred in the United States and was not herself eligible for the General Stud Book.Napier and Rasmussen Treasures of the Bloodstock Breeders' Review p. 648 The main problem for American breeders was the presence of the blood of Lexington in their breeding programs. Lexington's pedigree on his dam's side was suspect in the eyes of British racing authorities, and as he had been the leading sire of racehorses in the United States for 16 years, his descendants were numerous. Most American-bred Thoroughbreds traced to Lexington at least once,Willett Classic Racehorse p. 107 and he was not the only horse with suspect bloodlines registered in the American Stud Book. Most British breeders thought the regulation necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, and believed that it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States on the domestic horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913.Jockey Club Racing Calendar Meeting minutes for 1913. The entire year was searched and nothing on the new regulation was mentioned. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.Leicester Bloodstock Breeding pp. 80–81 The Jersey Act did not prevent the racing of horses containing the banned bloodlines, as horses with the suspect breeding raced and won in England, but they were considered to be \\"half-bred\\". A number of American-bred horses carrying the lines of Lexington had already been imported into England, including Americus, Rhoda B, and Sibola, and because they were grandfathered in, they and their descendants were allowed to be registered in the General Stud Book. Nor did it prevent the racing of horses that were not registered in the General Stud Book; it just prevented registration in the General Stud Book. American bloodlines, whether registered in the General Stud Book or not, dominated English racing in the 1920s and 1930s. Horses that were ineligible for General Stud Book registration, but were allowed to race, were identified with a Maltese cross in programs and auction listings. A number of American breeders, including the then-chairman of the American Jockey Club, William Woodward, Sr., lobbied hard throughout the 1930s to have the regulation removed.Sparkman \\"Errors\\" Thoroughbred Times Woodward, and other defenders of the American bloodlines, argued that the racing performance of the horses proved their purity, even if they could not produce papers that did so. Woodward declared in 1935 that \\"If we do not get together, we will grow apart.\\"Quoted in Simon Racing Through the Century p. 105 Those arguing for keeping the Jersey Act in effect pointed out that the General Stud Book is a record of bloodlines, not a work recording racing ability.Montgomery Thoroughbred p. 170 The Jersey Act's major effect was the opposite of what was intended. In the years before the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding.Staff \\"U.S. and General Stud Book\\" The Times Additionally, by the end of the war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate,Napier and Rasmussen Treasures of the Bloodstock Breeders' Review p. 664Simon Racing Through the Century p. 141 and harming the rebuilding of English racing.Williams \\"Juicy Steaks Decide Rickey's Camp Choice\\" The Pittsburgh Post There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the General Stud Book.Churchill \\"Today in Europe\\" The Palm Beach Post 1949 amendment Weatherbys, publishers of the Stud Book, approached the Jockey Club in 1948 to ask if it agreed that the Jersey Act was \\"too restrictive\\".Staff \\"Jersey Act and the Stud Book\\" The Times The rule was subsequently modified in June 1949, after the racing careers of a number of horses such as Tourbillon and Djebel persuaded the Jockey Club to reconsider. A number of French-bred Thoroughbreds began to race in England after the Second World War, but because they carried American lines they were considered half-breds. In 1948 two of England's five classic races were won by half-bred horses, My Babu and Black Tarquin, prompting the Jockey Club to amend the rule in the preface to the General Stud Book, to state that: The amendment removed the stigma of not being considered purebred from American-bred horses. A major consideration was that by the late 1940s most of the horses with suspect pedigrees were so far back in most horses' ancestry that it no longer made much sense to exclude them. Neither did it make much sense to exclude some of the most successful racehorses in Europe from registration. Weatherby's further amended its regulations in 1969, introducing the word \\"thoroughbred\\" to describe the horses registered in previous volumes of the General Stud Book. In 2006, Blood-Horse Publications, publisher of The Blood-Horse magazine, chose the \\"repeal\\" of the Jersey Act as the 39th most important moment in American Thoroughbred horse racing history.

In Search Of The La’s – A Secret Liverpool. p. 174. Helter Skelter Publishing 2003. Badger teamed up with locals Danny Dean on guitar, Hamish Cameron on piano and Colin Becket on drums. The first demo \\"Let's Go Home\\" can be found on the 2006 compilation CD, Lo Fi Electric Excursions by Mike Badger & Friends.  History  New Merseybeat Rock Family Tree featuring The Onset Their sound was heavily influenced by American bluegrass and country music merged with a dose of punky rock 'n' roll. On hearing the demo Geoff Davies of Liverpool's independent record label Probe Plus Records arranged for the band to record their first LP The Pool Of Life (Probe 19). The Pool Of Life was recorded at Ameritz Studios in Birkenhead during May 1988. Ten musicians contributed to the LP, but by the time of its release, the Onset's lineup had stabilised to just five. Mike and Danny being joined by Simon Cousins (from Wiltshire Folk Rock band Ophiuchus) on bass, Tony Russell on drums, and Paul Hemmings (from the La's) on guitar, slide and mandolin. The LP was greeted with rave reviews by the Music Press but failed to make any impression, with little radio or TV air play. The band made promotional videos for two tracks from the album, \\"Too Proud To Start\\" and \\"Precious Love\\". Recording Sessions followed in 1989 at various Liverpool Studios, however no further releases until 1990 when the Onset recorded in London with Dave Dix (of Black's \\"Wonderful Life\\" fame) as their producer. With Dave Dix they recorded three songs, \\"What Say You\\", \\"First I Feel You\\" and \\"Two Step Angels\\". These were released in 1990 as the What Say You EP (Onset 1) on the Furious Fish label. To promote the EP the Onset filmed a video for \\"First I Feel You\\", playing at Liverpool's Pier Head in the old Atlantic Liner Terminal. Cartoon portrait of the Onset by Roger Llewellyn used for the inner sleeve of \\"The Pool Of Life LP\\", 1988, showing the 10 musicians featured on the LP Left to Right - Mike Badger, Tony Russell, Paul Hemmings, Danny Dean, Simon Cousins, Hamish Cameron (front), Nick Hyrdowy, Bernard Nolan, Roger Llewellyn (front) and Sue Dring The musical styles on the What Say You EP had developed from the Country and Bluegrass sounds of The Pool Of Life. There was still a Country influence, but they had become more electric incorporating elements of Folk Rock and Pop, which gave them a rather distinctive sound. John Hodgkinson of Shout Magazine stated that \\"The title track (What Say You) is literate Rockabilly with synchronistic lyrical pointers to Mandella and Hendrix, 'First I Feel You' is a glorious slice of chiming, jangling pop ,that storms the brain and lays siege to the memory cells.\\" The Onset recorded three more tracks in 1991 at Liverpool's Pink Studios in the hope of producing a further EP. However, the record never materialised. There were changes to the band's line up at the end of 1991, which saw Paul Hemmings leave to join Ian Broudie and the Lightning Seeds and Si Cousins depart to play with Brian Morrow and former Onset musicians Roger Llewellyn and Nick Hrydowy, as the Catfish. Bernard Nolan rejoined the Onset on Bass Guitar and Double Bass and the band continued as a four piece. With Bernie's arrival the essence of the Onset's music became more acoustic, returning to its Rockabilly / Bluegrass roots. This acoustic roots feel was enhanced in 1993 when the band were joined by two ex-Catfish - Brian Morrow on percussion and the multi-talented Roger Llewellyn on guitar, vocal, banjo, fiddle and harmonica. In October 1993 the band recorded sessions for a new Probe Plus release. This was followed in by a further session in February 1994. The seven songs from these sessions were added to nine from the original The Pool Of Life LP and released as The Pool Of Life Revisited CD (Probe 40) in 1994.

The band recorded in late 1994 and early 1995 at Ian Broudie's Studio, with ex-Onseter Paul Hemmings as the Producer. These later recordings captured both the Country Bluegrass elements of the band's sound and the Indie / Pop feel. Piano, banjo, organ, fiddle and harmonica give a varied pallet of colour and texture. Many of the songs remain unreleased, but a few were included on the 2005 CD eponymously entitled The Onset (Gen10), released by Mike Badger on his Generator Label. The Onset CD contains a selection of the band's music from all it various incarnations, covering the period from 1989 to 1994. More Onset tracks were released in 2008 as part of Mike Badger's Country Side CD, which covers a twenty-year period of his career from 1988 to 2008. The Onsets final recording session was an acoustic session on Spencer Leigh's show On The Beat, for BBC Radio Merseyside in 1995. The band were broadcast playing an unplugged version of the song \\"Walking Tall\\".

He was educated at the Moses Brown School and Harvard College, class of 1977, where he led the Eliot House Crew to row at The Henley Regatta and played polo. As a cum laude biology graduate, he enrolled in the University of North Carolina School of Medicine graduating in 1981. He was trained at Harvard’s Beth Israel Hospital in internal medicine from 1981–82, then in general surgery at Stanford University Medical Center from 1982–83, and lastly in orthopaedic surgery at The Harvard Combined Orthopaedic Residency 1983-1986. He undertook a fellowship in research at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York under Steven Arnoczky, D.V.M. and in knee surgery in Lake Tahoe under Richard Steadman, M.D., from 1986 -1987.  Clinical practice  Stone founded The Stone Clinic, combining himself, an orthopaedic surgeon, with a team of nurses, physical therapists, imaging specialists, and patient coordinators, in 1988 to focus on caring for injured athletes and people experiencing arthritis pain. The clinical practice goal of rehabilitating all patients to a level higher than they were before they were injured set the tone. Surgical procedures were subjected to rigorous outcomes analysis with the results reported in peer reviewed journals. The surgical techniques have been taught to surgeons around the world, through lectures and videos. Stone is a physician for The Marin Ballet and The Smuin Ballet.

Research  Stone initiated his research career in high-altitude physiology under the direction of Ross McFarland, at the Harvard School of Public Health. Working with his associate Dr. Spengler, Stone searched for a high-altitude environment in a city and published the first paper on carbon monoxide in hockey rinks noting the effect of carbon monoxide on the hockey players' visual acuity was similar to that of hypoxia at altitude. =Meniscus research= In 1984, Stone, at the encouragement of his mentor Dr. Steadman, turned his focus to replacing the meniscus cartilage in the knee joint. After two years of research to understand the biomechanics and biology of the meniscus, Dr. Stone concluded that if he couldn’t replace the meniscus, possibly he could re-grow it. With this approach he entered his Fellowship in research under the direction of Dr. Arnoczky and proceeded to design the first collagen meniscus regeneration template. While a clinical fellow in Lake Tahoe, Stone initiated research at the Letterman Army Institute of Research in collaboration with Bill Rodkey, D.V.M., to test the collagen template in various animal models for meniscus, ligament, articular cartilage and intervertebral disc repair. These trials were subsequently published and led to several research awards including the Albert Trillat Young Investigator’s Award from the International Knee Society and the Cabaud Award in 1990 from the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine.The American Oprthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine :Cabaud Award recipients The FDA approved the first human clinical trial of the collagen meniscus scaffold which was carried out at The Stone Clinic from 1991-1994. Recent 15-year follow-ups on these patients revealed continuing successful outcomes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave U.S. approval for a collagen meniscus implant (CMI) device designed by Stone in 2008. Stone turned his attention to complete meniscus replacement with a biological implant(rather than re-growing the meniscus) in 1994. He published one of the first techniques for arthroscopic meniscus replacement in 1991 and conducted the first long-term study of meniscus replacement in knee joint arthritis which was published in 2006. The replacement of the meniscus permits the arthritic patient to have improved pain relief and knee joint function as well as delay or avoid the time for artificial joint replacement. In a 2 to 7 year follow-up study, 89.4% of meniscus transplantation patients were successful, having shown significant signs of improvement in pain, activity, and functioning.Stone, Walgenbach, et al. \\"Meniscus Allograft Survival in Patients with Moderate to Severe Unicompartmental Arthritis:2-7 Year Follow Up\\".Arthroscopy: Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, Vol 22, No. 3, May 2006, pp.469-478. A study on the outcomes of meniscus transplantation in active patients with severe cartilage damage found that the procedure provided significant improvements in pain and function levels for an average of 8.6 years with the majority of patients achieving their goal of participation in sporting activities.Stone, K. R., Pelsis, J. R., Surrette, S. T., Walgenbach, A. W., & Turek, T. J. (2015). Meniscus transplantation in an active population with moderate to severe cartilage damage. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy : Official Journal of the ESSKA, 23(1), 251–7. =Articular cartilage research= In addition to meniscus replacement, Stone focused on articular cartilage regeneration for the arthritic knee. His design of a “paste graft” technique with custom instrumentation was promoted by the DePuy- Orthotec orthopaedic company. The paste graft technique 2-12 year results were published in 2006 revealing 85% of the patients obtained improvement in pain and function scores.Stone, Walgenbach, et al. \\"Articular Cartilage Paste Grafting to Full-Thickness Articular Cartilage Knee Joint Lesions: A 2-12 year Follow Up\\". Arthroscopy: Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, Vol 22, No.3, March 2006, pp.291-299. A study on the efficacy of the paste graft procedure for patients with osteochondritis dissecans showed that patients were able to benefit from improvements in pain, activity, and function levels for an average of 7 years after the procedure, with some benefitting up to 13 years.Stone, K. R., Pelsis, J. R., Crues, J. V., Walgenbach, A. W., & Turek, T. J. (2014). Osteochondral grafting for failed knee osteochondritis dissecans repairs. The Knee, 21(6), 1145–1150. =Biologic joint replacement= The combination of meniscus replacement and articular cartilage grafting led to Stone’s pursuit of biologic knee replacement, a technique to fully replace the damaged cartilage in the knee with natural tissues. This program is underway at The Stone Clinic and includes a stem cell with shell graft approach to replacing the articular cartilage surface of the knee. Allison Gannet, a World Cup freeskier Champion, had had 7 previous knee surgeries before having a biological joint replacement, with Stone as her surgeon. This procedure included the articular cartilage paste grafting procedure, and following, Gannet reported being pain free for the first time in 8 years.\\"Knee Injuries, How to Prevent Them and Recover Quickly\\". Denver Post. June 2008. = Aperion Biologics, Inc = Xenograft ligament cartilage, bone, and tendon transplantation. FDA-Approved ACL Replacement Study 2003 - PRESENT CE Mark issued April 2014. Stone's experience with collagen scaffolds sourced from bovine Achilles tendons led him to focus on other animal tissues that might be useful for orthopaedic reconstruction. In 1996 he initiated a research program to determine if the carbohydrates that cause rejection of animal tissues could safely be removed without damaging the tissues. His research led him to the New York Blood Center where a technique for removing similar carbohydrates was developed for blood. Dr. Stone identified and collaborated with the leading immunologist in the field Prof. Uri Galili in order to transfer the blood technique to orthopaedic tissues. Their work led to multiple patents, animal trials and subsequently, a human clinical trial of a porcine bone-patellar tendon-bone graft for reconstructing the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee joint. In the surgical procedure, the proteins on the transplant ligament that would trigger rejection from the recipient's body are stripped off prior to transplantation. One recipient of this pig ligament ACL transplant went on to win the Canadian Master's Downhill Ski Championship, three times.\\"Saving Troubled Knees\\".

After Stone left in 1994, ReGen Biologics attracted controversy after the FDA initially rejected Menaflex, a device developed to replace knee cartilage. Regen Biologics enlisted four members of Congress, whom they had made significant campaign contributions to, to influence the evaluation process. The FDA then fast-tracked and approved the product despite serious concerns from the scientific community. ReGen Biologics was accused of \\"unduly\\" influencing federal agencies, and the FDA admitted it capitulated to political pressure for approving Menaflex, a device it had previously deemed unsafe because of its failure rate. *CrossCart Inc.,then Aperion Biologics Inc. a venture capital funded medical device xenotransplantation company.

She was eventually broken up in 1877. Service Ethalion entered service in 1803 under Captain Charles Stuart, operating in the North Sea. In May 1804 she captured the 16-gun Dutch brig Union off Bergen. In 1807, command passed to William Charles Fahie, who took Ethalion to the West Indies. In December 1807 Ethalion was part of the squadron under Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane that captured the Danish islands of St Thomas on 22 December and Santa Cruz on 25 December. The Danes did not resist and the invasion was bloodless. On 26 October 1808 Ethalion captured Washington. Ethalion also participated in the invasion of Martinique in 1809 under Captain Thomas John Cochrane. In April 1809, a strong French squadron arrived at the Îles des Saintes, south of Guadeloupe. There they were blockaded until 14 April, when a British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , invaded and captured the islands. Ethalion played a distant part in the Action of 14–17 April 1809. Even so, she was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands. In 1810, Ethalion briefly paid off, before returning to service in 1811 off Lisbon under Captain Heywood and then in the Baltic Sea. On 12 April 1812, Ethalion and captured the Opsloe.

It was fought between the United States and Japan from 18 May 1944 to 21 May 1944 in Dutch New Guinea (now Papua, in Indonesia). The operation involved an assault on the Japanese-held Wakde island group by a reinforced US infantry battalion, which was transported from a beachhead the Allied troops had established around Arara, on the mainland, the previous day. Following the capture of the island, fighting on the mainland continued until September as Allied troops advanced west towards Sarmi. In the aftermath, the island's airbase was expanded and used to support operations around Biak and in the Marianas. Background Wakde is an island group, which lies two miles off the northeastern coast of Western New Guinea. It consists of two islands: Insoemoar and Insoemanai. Of these, Insoemoar is the largest, although it is only long, and lies on the outer side of the smaller island, to the northeast. It is largely flat and at its largest point is wide. On the mainland shore, the nearest village at the time of the battle was Toem.Morison, pp. 92–93Futrell, p. 617 At the time of the battle, the area's strategic importance lay it is proximity along planned Allied avenues of advance through the southwest Pacific toward the Philippines, offering the Allies an airfield for land-based aircraft to attack facilities at Biak Island, about away.Morison, pp. 93–96Smith, p. 206–207 Initial Allied plans had called for the capture of Sarmi on the mainland, but aerial reconnaissance had later shown that it was unsuitable for heavy bombers. As a result, the Allied commander, General Douglas MacArthur had decided to focus on the capture of Wakde instead, followed by Biak. Allied aircraft operating from this area could also be used to support operations in the central Pacific, including those operations planned as part of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign.Keogh, p. 377 The Allies were able to move against Wadke after the successful completion on 26 April of the Battle of Hollandia, about to the east. The discovery that the airfields around Hollandia, on the Sentani plain, could not support heavy bombers, accelerated Allied plans to secure Wakde. For the Japanese, the area offered an important line of defense and since late 1943 they had begun developing the area, installing supply dumps and an airfield, and moving in sizeable concentrations of troops. The area had been occupied by the Japanese in 1942 and an airfield had been developed on Insoemoar, consisting of a coral runway as well as buildings and staging facilities. An anchorage suitable for flat or shallow-bottomed vessels lay on the southern side of the larger island, with a small jetty and an area suitable for a landing beach. Along the mainland, to the west, the Japanese were in the process of constructing an airfield around Maffin Bay (west of the Tor River) and had also built an airstrip at Sawar, about halfway between Maffin Bay and the village of Sarmi. The Japanese had installed antiaircraft guns around the three airfields, and had around 11,000 troops in the Sarmi–Sawar–Maffin area, centered around Sarmi where Lieutenant General Hachiro Tagami's 36th Division had established a command post.Morison, pp. 92–94 On Wakde itself, there were about 800 Japanese troops, including a company of infantry from the 224th Infantry Regiment, as well as naval troops, support personnel and a weaponless antiaircraft battery from the 53d Field Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion. There were several 75 mm artillery pieces, some mortars and machine guns, and over 100 bunkers.Smith, p. 222 Japanese air assets available to support the defense of Wakde and Sarmi were estimated at 282 fighters and 246 bombers, but the force was in the process of reorganization and was off balance; it was assessed that around half this force would remain in the Philippines and Palaus.Futrell, p. 619 Prelude Map depicting the Allied battle plan Initially, Allied planners had intended to launch the operation on 15 May; however, delays in concentrating logistics and shipping assets resulted in the Allies postponing the operation by several days. Nevertheless, the necessity to conform with plans in the central Pacific meant that it could be carried out no later than 17 May, with operations to capture Biak scheduled to take place 10 days later using most of the same landing craft. The beach frontage on Wakde was considered too narrow to support a full regimental combat team; as a result, it was decided to carry out the operation in three phases. The first phase would entail a landing on the mainland opposite the islands. This would be followed in phase two by a \\"shore-to-shore\\" operation across the bight to capture Insoemanai, to secure a base of fire to support the final phase of the assault on Insoemoar.Keogh, pp. 378–379 The main combat forces assigned to the Wakde–Sarmi operation were drawn from Brigadier General Jens A. Doe's 163rd Regimental Combat Team, consisting of 7,800 men,Morison, p. 96 of which about 1,500 took part in the landing on Wakde.Clodfelter, p. 508 This unit had previously taken part in the Landing at Aitape and had been relieved there by the 32nd Infantry Division on 4 May. After embarking at Aitape on 15 May, the troops were initially transported to Hollandia on 16 May in preparation for the operation. Meanwhile, Allied aircraft mounted airstrikes around the target area throughout late April and into May.Morison, pp. 72 & 96 The naval forces assigned to the operation were detached from Rear Admiral William Fechteler's Task Force 77. These forces were designated the Eastern Attack Group and were commanded by Captain Albert G. Noble, and consisted of three fire support groups, with two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers and 20 destroyers. Fourteen other support vessels were allocated included minesweepers, submarine chasers and several landing craft armed with rockets. The landing craft carrying the assault troops were operated by the 542nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, of the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade.Smith, pp. 213–214 The pre- invasion naval bombardment allocated to support the first phase of the operation involved two cruiser forces: Task Force 74 and Task Force 75. The first force was commanded by British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, and consisted of four Australian ships – the cruisers Australia and Shropshire and the destroyers Warramunga and Arunta – and two US destroyers, Mullany and Ammen. Task Force 75 was commanded by US Rear Admiral Russell Berkey, and consisted of the cruisers Phoenix, Boise and Nashville. While Crutchley's force shelled the mainland around Sawar and Sarmi, Berkley's ships hit Wakde. Ten destroyers under Captain Richard Stout also fired upon targets between Toem and Maffin Bay.Morison, p. 97 Early on 17 May, after a fifty minute bombardment, three battalions from the 163rd Infantry Regiment were landed at a beachhead on the mainland around Arara, to the east of the Tor River. Overhead a force of Allied fighters and medium bombers stood ready to provide close air support, but Japanese resistance was light, consisting of only rifle fire. The 3rd Battalion established the beachhead and then secured the western flank while the 2nd Battalion pushed east towards Tementoe Creek. These two battalions secured the coast and would later undertake heavy fighting during the Battle of Lone Tree Hill; meanwhile, a small force of heavy weapons troops built around a company from the 641st Tank Destroyer Battalion occupied Insoemanai. The 1st Battalion was held back around Toem, with orders to be prepared to undertake the landing on Wakde Island around the following day.Smith, pp. 213, 216, 219Morison, pp. 97 & 102 The British-led Eastern Fleet attacked Surabaya in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies on 17 May as a diversion from the landing at Wakde.Gill, p. 416 This attack, which was designated Operation Transom, was undertaken by aircraft flying from an American and a British aircraft carrier. The raid did not have any affect on the Japanese military's deployments as the Eastern Fleet was not seen as a serious threat.Kirby, pp. 382–384 Battle Landings at Wakde Throughout the afternoon of 17 May, the U.S. troops on Insoemanai were fired upon by Japanese mortars and machine guns from Insoemoar. In response, throughout the night of 17/18 May, U.S. artillery fired on Wakde from the mainland, while plans were hastily made by Allied commanders for the operation. Deliberate planning for the assault had been belayed as the operation was dependent upon the situation as it developed around Toem. In the end, the order to carry out the landing on Insoemoar, was given by Noble early on 18 May.Morison, p. 98 Three companies from the 1st Battalion (A, B and C) were allocated to make the crossing, along with one company from the 2nd Battalion (Company F). These were organized into six waves, each of which would be transported in LCVPs crewed by engineers from the 542nd EBSR. Four Sherman tanks from the 603rd Tank Company were also assigned, and would be transported across the bight to Insoemoar aboard several LCMs.Morison, pp. 97–98Smith, pp. 213, 216, 219 & 222 Naval gunfire support was provided by the destroyers Wilkes and Roe, which commenced bombardment around 08:30. Indirect fire support was also provided from mortars and machine guns operated by the troops that had landed on Insoemanai the previous day.Smith, pp. 220–222 The efforts of these forces destroyed the defending Japanese 75 mm gun emplacements and damaged several bunkers. Meanwhile, the landing craft began embarking the assault troops from the beach at Toem, away. Their objective was a stretch of beach in a sheltered bay south of the jetty in the southwestern part of the island, which was one of the few places around the island where the coral reef did not extend. Their route to the beach would take them to the west of Insoemanai, after which the landing craft would turn northeast for their run to the shore.Morison pp. 99–100Smith, p. 222 The first US troops landed on the Island at 9:10 on the 18th, coming ashore from their LCVPs on the south western side of the island near the jetty;Smith, p. 224 they were followed at five minute intervals by the other five waves.Morison, p. 101 Shortly after landing, the U.S. troops came under heavy fire from concealed positions. The fire, however, was predominantly aimed at the LCI gunboats and ultimately the Americans reached the beach with only light casualties. By 9:25, the invasion force was ashore with two tanks (one of the others had been lost at sea, while the other had damaged during loading) which the Americans used to secure the beachhead, despite heavy fire from Japanese defenders which killed one of the company commanders. Close air support was provided by a squadron of A-20 attack aircraft, under the direction of a controller in a B-25.Futrell, p. 628 The American companies then split up. Companies B and F took the tanks and headed west along the coast whilst Company A were sent south-west to clear out machine gun nests. Company C was then sent north towards the airfield where they endured heavy fighting coming up against well defended Japanese positions. Even so, the advance north went well for the Allies and by noon they reached the airfield. By 13:30, the Americans reached the northern part of the airfield but failed to take the eastern side where the majority of the remaining Japanese forces were located. Despite the delay in securing the island, throughout the afternoon stores and construction equipment were unloaded at the landing beach so that work could begin on the airfield. Meanwhile, fighting continued throughout the day until the attackers dug-in for the evening at 18:00.Smith, pp. 224–228 Map depicting movements following the landing Throughout the night, a small group of Japanese attacked the U.S. battalion's command post, but this was eventually repelled by elements of Company D after a firefight that resulted in 12 Japanese being killed and three Americans wounded. The following day, the U.S. attack continued at 9:15. Eventually, the rest of the airfield was captured despite strong resistance from well entrenched Japanese defenders. Following the capture of the airfield, the surviving Japanese made their way to coral caves on the coast, delaying the Americans for several hours before finally being overcome. The third day of the battle consisted mainly of mopping up operations by American forces who cleared up the last pockets of Japanese resistance in north-eastern corner of the island. The Japanese undertook several suicidal \\"banzai\\" charges over the course of the day but the U.S. troops were able to overcome the remaining Japanese resistance by nightfall.Smith, pp. 229–231 Airfield construction troops from the 836th Engineer Aviation Battalion arrived on 18 May, even while the fighting continued. The following day, they began construction work to repair and extend the airfield while fighting off attacking Japanese troops.Futrell, p. 629 The same day, the Kumamba Islands, to the northeast, were also occupied by Allied troops to install search radars to offer early warning to the base at Wakde.Morison, p. 101 After a three-day battle, the island was declared captured on 20 May. Several Japanese snipers still remained on the island; they were eventually cleared out by Company L, which had been detached from the 3rd Battalion, 163rd Infantry to assist with mopping up operations between 22 and 26 May.Smith, p. 231 The capture of Wakde cost the Americans 40 killed, and 107 wounded, while the Japanese lost 759 killed and 4 captured. Aftermath Following the capture, Wakde Airfield was quickly expanded to cover the whole island with the airfield being operational on 21 May despite it having only recently been captured and the following day personnel from the 348th Fighter Group arrived, establishing camp on Insoemanai; their aircraft arrived on 26 May. The same day, several PB4Ys (navalized B-24 Liberators) from VB-115 arrived and began conducting reconnaissance missions from Wakde the following day. Later in the month radar and control facilities were established and more aircraft, including day and night fighters and heavy bombers, were flown in. Area command initially fell to an element of the 308th Bombardment Wing before being passed to the 310th Bombardment Wing by the end of the month. Japanese air attacks against Wakde began on 27 May, but were largely ineffective.Futrell, pp. 629–630 Fighting on the mainland continued into early September as Allied troops advanced west along the coast towards Sarmi to clear Maffin Bay and capture the airfield around Sawar; this advance was resisted strongly by the Japanese defenders who were entrenched in strong positions in the Trier Mountains.Morison, p. 102 Developed into a staging area for subsequent operations, the base on Wakde was initially an extremely important airbase for the Allies, providing a landing and taking off base for attacks on the mainland and other islands throughout the rest of 1944, including the Battle of Biak.

Moore (born May 29, 1950) was the chairman and chief executive officer of Time Inc. until the fall of 2010. She became the company's first woman CEO when she was appointed to the position in July 2002. Biography Moore was a 1971 graduate of Vanderbilt University, where she received a B.A. in political science, and in 1978 she received an MBA from Harvard Business School.http://www.alumni.hbs.edu/awards/2006/moore.html She began her career at Time in 1978 as a financial analyst. She became the publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids in 1989 and publisher of People Magazine in 1991. She was named People's president in 1993. In 2001 she became vice-president of Time, Inc. She is a member of the board of directors of Avon Products, Inc. and she has been on the Fortune Magazine's 50 Most Powerful Women in American Business ten times. She also was listed among the 100 Most Powerful Women by Forbes. = Early life = In 1971 Moore graduated with a degree in mathematics from Vanderbilt University in Nashville and then worked in bookselling in Boston. In 1978 she graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School, where as one of only a handful of female MBA graduates she received 13 job offers. Moore was an avid magazine reader, and her ambition was to work in magazine publishing; she consequently accepted the lowest-paid job she had been offered, that of financial analyst at Time. In her early years at Time, Moore gained experience in circulation and marketing. An avid sports fan, her first executive role was as media manager of Sports Illustrated in 1979. Two years later she was appointed assistant circulation director of Fortune before moving on to become the circulation director of Money and then of Discover . Moore returned to Sports Illustrated as general manager in 1984, becoming the magazine's associate publisher four years later. Moore's ability to take a Time title to new readers was first demonstrated in 1989 when she was appointed founding publisher of Sports Illustrated for Kids . Drawing upon her existing client network, Moore paved the way for the new title by preselling advertising pages. She also established an unusually close working relationship between the magazine's editorial section and its marketing and circulation divisions. The founding editor of Sports Illustrated for Kids John Papanek later praised Moore's business model in which the metaphorical \\"church\\" and \\"state\\" were integrated in a highly effective manner. = Expanded description = Moore joined Time following her MBA. Her leadership potential showed early on in her career and she flew up the corporate ladder through a succession of key positions. In 1991, Moore became publisher, and later president, of People. Here she oversaw the launches of Australian Who weekly, In Style, People en Español, and Real Simple, giving Time a competitive edge in the women's magazine arena for the first time. Later, as executive vice-president, she ran the business and development operations for consumer magazines includingTime and People, while managing the company's consumer marketing division. She was nominated CEO in 2002. A major mission then was to take Time into the digital age, a project which has enjoyed increasing success. In 2007, digital traffic growth hit 72 percent; in 2008, despite an economic downturn, revenue for People.com rose 51 percent; and Time, Inc.’s US website has grown to be among the 20 largest online media properties. = Marriage and children = Daughter of Monty Sommovigo and Bea (maiden name unknown); married Donovan Moore (private wealth manager for Bessemer Trust); children: one.  Expansion of People  In 1991 Moore became the publisher of People , a title appealing primarily to women, and two years later became the magazine's president. Moore believed that the very successful publication could grow larger still if marketed more specifically to readers interested in women's fashion and popular journalism. In an interview withAdvertising Age in 2001 Moore referred to Time's \\"inability to understand you could make money marketing to women\\" (June 4, 2001). Until the 1990s Time published mainly financial and sporting magazines and marketed its titles almost entirely to an educated male readership. Moore added beauty and fashion sections to People and changed its format from black-and-white to color. She also increased the proportion of advertising pages and changed the magazine's issue day from Monday to Friday so as to coincide with weekend shopping trips. Although the new direction in which Moore was taking the magazine met with a cautious response from Time senior management, her innovations proved successful. From 1991 People surpassed Time's traditional leader, Time magazine, in advertising revenue; by 2001 the gap had become considerable, with People earning $723.7 million to Time 's $666 million. In 2002 People earned one-third of Time's total revenues. As president of People Moore established a pattern of successful magazine launches that further showed her all-around strengths in both the marketing and editorial aspects of magazine publishing. Along with spin-offs such as the Australian version of People , entitled WHO , Moore created four highly successful magazines at biyearly intervals between 1994 and 2000: In Style, People en Español, Teen People , and Real Simple . In Style , launched in 1994, was the first magazine of its kind to include fashion, celebrity lifestyles, and shelter (interior design, architecture, and gardening) content. In Style reflected Moore's belief, expressed in a Brandweek interview in 1999, that \\"runway fashion didn't work and it was celebrities who were the trend spotters in America\\" (March 8, 1999). The new title drew cautious responses from both Moore's higherups at Time and sponsors but, as with the revamped People , was immediately successful with readers. By 2000 In Style was Time's 15th-biggest-selling title, with a circulation of 1.4 million. In 1998 Moore was appointed president of the People group; in March 2001 she acquired responsibility for Time's Parenting group. Three months later she was appointed vice president to Time while still overseeing both the People and Parenting groups. Moore was appointed to the role of CEO and chairwoman of Time in July 2002, soon after the merger between Time Warner and AOL.  Published works  Publisher of People.

It was discovered in 1891, but was a lower grade copper deposit than the Rossland and Slocan deposits. The low grade and the nearest railroad being resulted in the Phoenix (and other new deposits) receiving less attention. Discovery & development The first claims in the Phoenix area were staked by Henry White and Matthew Hatter (of the Old Ironsides claim) on July 15, 1891, they were granted in 1896. In 1896, J.F.C. Miner, a rubber footwear manufacturer from Granby, Quebec, mining promoter J.P. Graves of Knob Hill Mining Company and A.L. Little of Old Ironsides formed the Miner-Graves Syndicate. In 1899, they incorporated The Granby Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company, Limited and, in 1901, consolidated as Granby Consolidated Mining, Smelting and Power Company, Limited. In spite of the low grade of the ore from the Phoenix deposit, it had the advantage of being self-fluxing (only requiring coke to be added for smelting), which resulted in a cheaper processing cost for a mining company interested in operating it. In 1896 development of the deposit began and in 1900 the Granby Smelter Company constructed a 700-ton-per-day smelter in Grand Forks, British Columbia, which would be the largest non-ferrous smelter in the British Empire, and the second largest in the world. Production1896–1919= Granby operated the Phoenix mine, which comprised both an underground mine and open pit mine. The underground operation used the square set mining method, but by 1901 had converted to an open stope and pillar method with considerable cost savings. The operation maintained a completely unsupported \\"show stope\\" with dimensions of high, wide, and long. In 1903 the mine operated three small steam shovels to work in the surface operations producing half of the mine's production, making this one of the earliest attempts at open-pit mining in the British Columbia. Ore was transported to the smelter via the Canadian Pacific Railway, which had built a line to the mining operation by the time the smelter was completed in 1900. =1959–1976= In 1956 Granby re-evaluated the property in light of recent success in their other open-pit operations in the province. There was an estimated 1,300,000 tons of ore readily available; a 600-ton-per-day concentrator was constructed and production began in 1959. The following year, when more ore per day became available, the concentrator was upgraded to handle 900 tons per day, 1,900 tons per day in 1964 and 2,750 in 1972 The Phoenix mine closed again in 1976.

Character Maria Bertram is the eldest daughter and third child in a wealthy family that owns the large country estate, Mansfield Park. Her father, Sir Thomas Bertram, is a baronet. She has two older brothers and one sister a year younger than herself. She grows up treated with stern distance by her father, kindly ignored by her indolent, self-centred mother, but spoiled and indulged by her Aunt Norris. When she is thirteen, her family brings a poor ten year-old cousin, Fanny Price, to live with them. She has little interest in Fanny and treats her with condescension, giving Fanny the toys of the least value to herself. She mocks Fanny for her ignorance and reports on Fanny's apparent deficiencies to her Aunt Norris. When she grows to adulthood, she is considered in the county to be a great beauty. Her attitude towards Fanny is little improved. Maria and Mr. Rushworth When Sir Thomas goes to Antigua to attend to problems on his plantations, Maria, being at the age to marry, is introduced by Aunt Norris to a young man named Mr. Rushworth. Although Mr. Rushworth is neither intelligent nor handsome, he does have a large estate of 700 acres and is worth about 12,000 pounds per annum, Maria, eager to escape her parental home, agrees to his proposal. Maria and Mr. Crawford Immediately after Maria's engagement to Mr. Rushworth, a young man named Henry Crawford comes to the neighbourhood with his sister, Mary. Because Maria has no real affection for Mr. Rushworth, she does not scruple to flirt with Henry, and she also befriends Mary. Henry also favours her over her unattached younger sister, Julia, even though (or perhaps because) her engagement makes her unavailable, Julia, too, is attracted to Crawford. This puts Maria and her sister in competition with one another. When Henry leaves without proposing to her, she insists on going through with her marriage to Mr. Rushworth, partly out of disappointment and partly to escape her stifling home life. She goes to Brighton on her honeymoon, taking Julia with her, and from there the party proceeds to Mr. Rushworth's new London home. Maria's disgrace In London, Maria encounters Henry and their flirtation begins anew. It proceeds to an affair, which becomes publicly known. The two elope, bringing shame to her family and disgrace on her. In fear, Julia also elopes and marries Mr. Yates. Henry, predictably, refuses to marry Maria, and Mr. Rushworth divorces her for adultery. She moves to \\"another country\\" (another rural area of England) with her Aunt Norris and they live together financially supported by Sir Thomas.

Kennedy who visited the area in June 1963. The 7.5 acre park is situated between Victoria Road and Monahan Road. Sports The park is associated with a number of sporting clubs. During the club's infancy, the park was the homestead of Nemo Rangers GAA club. More recently it has been used as the training base for the Cork Admirals American Football team. The park is also used for training by several amateur soccer sides, as well as tag rugby teams. Development Plaque marking 2012 improvements In the mid-2000s, at the height of the Celtic Tiger, the future of the park was cast in doubt after plans were unveiled to reduce the size of the park to allow for a new road to be constructed in conjunction with the Cork Docklands Development. This resulted in a petition by local residents and by the sporting clubs that used the park. The Cork Docklands developments, however, were ultimately halted due to economic constraints and the planned changes were not implemented. In 2012, as marked by a contemporary plaque, a number of improvements and developments to the park were unveiled - including a new walkway and planting. Funding was reportedly confirmed for additional improvements during 2018.

It was originally formed in 2005 by Quang Vinh Thang Le (known as Michael Le), Konaam Shirzad, Matthew Johnston and two other un-named young offenders. Michael Le testified at the Surrey Six trial that he and Shirzad initially formed the Red Scorpions after meeting in a youth detention centre facility. Le said the name Scorpions was a tribute to his \\"older brother who was killed and his nickname used to be Scorpion\\". The gang \\"used the word Red to symbolize blood\\" he said. Le said Jamie Bacon and his brothers were not founders but joined the gang a few years later. Red Scorpions have been running \\"dial-a-dope lines\\" – (drug trafficking operations) in the suburbs of Vancouver since 2000. Gang members can be identified by \\"RS\\" tattoos on their arms and necks; any forms of skull tattoos on the right arm indicate how many people that member has murdered. The Red Scorpions come from various cultural and linguistic backgrounds, as they consider race secondary to loyalty and respect. The Red Scorpions have been involved in an increasing number of well-publicized incidents of gang violence in the Vancouver area, in part due to their bitter rivalry with the United Nations gang. The Red Scorpions-United Nations relationship worsened after the infamous Bacon brothers left the UN to join forces with the Red Scorpions. Surrey Six murders The Balmoral Tower Highrise building The Red Scorpions have been linked to some of the bloodiest shootings in the region and were allegedly behind the October 19, 2007 killing of six people in a suite on 9800 East Whalley Ring Road, a condominium complex known as Balmoral Tower. The case is known as the Surrey Six murders. The principal target was Corey Lal, a 22-year-old alleged drug dealer who was selling drugs on the Red Scorpions' turf. Five other men were killed to eliminate them from becoming potential witnesses. They were Michael Lal, 26 (Corey Lal's older brother), Ryan Bartolomeo, 19, Eddie Narong, 22, and two innocent bystanders: the 55-year-old gas fitter Ed Schellenberg and 22-year-old student neighbour Christopher Mohan, who unknowingly got caught in the incident. Cody Haevischer and an associate who can only be identified as \\"Person X\\" were tried later. Matthew Johnston and Cody Haevischer were charged with six counts of first- degree murder in the case. Jamie Bacon, 23, was charged with one count of first-degree murder in the death of Corey Lal. Michael Le was charged with conspiracy to commit murder against Corey Lal. Founding membersMichael Le= Quang Vinh Thang Le (known as Michael Le), an immigrant from Vietnam grew up in Coquitlam and was a co-founder of the gang. He had earlier been convicted of manslaughter for being in a group of teens who fatally beat another boy in a Coquitlam karaoke club in 2000. He founded the gang with some other youth delinquents while he was serving time in the juvenile centre. Le named the gang Red Scorpions, red denoting blood and Scorpion being the name of his brother known by the nickname Scorpion. In March 2008, he fled to his native Vietnam fearing arrest on an ongoing investigation and a Vancouver police sting operation. Moving later to Thailand, Hong Kong and China, he was intercepted as he arrived in Manila, The Philippines on June 17, 2009 and was deported to Canada. Le signed a plea agreement with the Crown in November 2013 in the Surrey Six case and was sentenced to three years for \\"conspiracy to commit murder\\" in exchange for his testimony against other culprits in the gang including Red Scorpions members Cody Haevischer and Matthew Johnston, who were both convicted of all six murders. Michael Le entered a guilty plea to conspiracy to commit murder against Corey Lal. A joint submission by Crown prosecutor Peter Juk and Le's lawyer called for the 12-year term, minus almost nine years pre-trial credit for Le. The remaining sentence is just three years, one month. =Matthew JohnstonKonaam Shirzad= Konaam Shirzad (1983 – September 22, 2017) was a founding member when it started in mid 2000s although he was not as high-profile as other Red Scorpions. In 2005, Shirzad pleaded guilty to arranging a shooting he mistakenly linked to a man who had earlier testified against him. Accused of \\"mischief that endangered life\\", he was sentenced to 30 months in jail. In September 2009, Shirzad survived a shooting in West Vancouver. At an October 2010 court hearing, Shirzad claimed he had left the gang life.Parksville Qualicum Beach News: Red Scorpions co- founder killed in Kamloops shooting In February 2017, he was charged in Richmond to possession of a firearm contrary to a court order. In July, he pleaded guilty and got a 90-day sentence. Claiming he was no longer in the gang, he purchased the Heavy Metal Gym on Briar Avenue in Kamloops. The gym was raided by police in January 2017. Shirzad was shot and killed on the evening of September 22, 2017, just steps from his home on Hudson's Bay Trail.https://www.kamloopsthisweek.com/sounds-man-screaming-followed-gunshots- gangsters-murder-witness-tells-ktw/ Other main gang membersMatt Campbell= Matthew Gordon Campbell (1982 – January 2, 2014) was an alleged leader of the Red Scorpions at the time of his murder. Campbell was fatally stabbed in the neck on January 2, 2014 at the Abbotsford Auto Mall after an encounter with a member of a rival gang. Jimi Sandhu, 24, was charged with second degree murder of Campbell. Campbell was taken to hospital, where he died of his injuries. =Jonathan, Jarrod and Jamie Bacon= Jonathan (also known as Jon), Jarrod, and Jamie Bacon, were a trio of gangsters born in Abbotsford, British Columbia, suspected of multiple firearms and drug trafficking charges. Known as the Bacon Brothers, they were initially members of the United Nations gang. In 2006, the brothers partnered with the Red Scorpions, major rival to the United Nations. The aim of their association was to help the Bacons compete with the United Nations gang. The authorities believed that the brothers took leadership control of the Red Scorpions shortly thereafter. On April 3, 2009, Jamie Bacon was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Emergency response team for his alleged involvement in the October 19, 2007 slayings of the 'Surrey Six'. This development occurred after an associate of the Bacon brothers, Dennis Karbovanec, pleaded guilty to his participation in the slayings. On September 11, 2020, he plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit the murder of Corey Lal. He was sentenced to 18 years incarceration, and with credit for time served, he will serve an additional five years and seven months in prison. Jarrod Bacon, arrested in May 2009 on weapons charges, was found guilty on February 2, 2012 of several charges relating to cocaine trafficking. On May 4, 2012, Jarrod was sentenced to 12 years in prison for conspiracy to traffic cocaine. The sentence was then reduced to seven years and two months after time served was taken into consideration. In September 2009, the Integrated Gang Task Force reported that eight associates had been murdered since the public warning by police that those associated with Jon, Jarrod and Jamie Bacon avoid the trio or be potentially marked for death by rival criminals. In May 2010, the court convicted Jamie Bacon of all 11 charges related to the April 2007 discovery of a gun cache but acquitted the older brother Jarrod of all charges. On August 14, 2011, Jonathan Bacon was murdered via gunfire outside the Delta Grand Hotel in Kelowna, BC. Larry Amero, a full-patch member of the Hells Angels, was also critically injured in the attack. Jason McBride, Jujhar Khun-Khun and Michael Kerry Hunter Jones are now charged in connection with the shooting. =Dennis Karbovanec= On April 3, 2009, Karbovanec (born 1982) pleaded guilty in his role of Surrey Six high-rise slayings of October 19, 2007, after turning himself in. On April 9, 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 15 years.Karbovanec sentenced to life in Surrey slayings CBC News, April 9, 2009. He had earlier been the target of a gangland hit on New Year's Eve 2008 but due to his body armour had survived the murder attempt. =Cody Haevischer= One of the two alleged killers of the Surrey Six. Haevischer (born 1985) reportedly killed three of the victims and unidentified gang member \\"Person X\\" killed the other three. On the day of the murders, Michael Le attended a meeting at a Korean restaurant in Surrey with Haevischer, Johnston and \\"Person X\\" also attending. =\\"Person X\\"= The unidentified accomplice murderer of the Surrey Six, a Red Scorpion gang member and the alleged killer of three of the Surrey Six victims. For his direct involvement in the killing of three of the victims in the Surrey Six murders, he agreed to cooperate with police and pleaded guilty to shooting three of the Surrey Six victims. He was convinced to become a Crown witness at the trial against co-accused murderer and accomplice Cody Haevischer and against alleged instigator Matt Johnston. But the presiding judge on the case banned \\"Person X\\" from testifying after months of _in camera_ court proceedings. \\"Person X\\" is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole for 15 years. There is a ban on identifying him by his real name. Jamie Bacon is facing three new charges for an alleged plot to kill Person X. Bacon counseled another man, identified by police, to murder Person X on behalf of a criminal organization. =\\"Person Y\\"= Person Y is another unidentified accomplice. He was convicted of first-degree murder in two unrelated gang cases and is serving 25 years to life. He admitted to have played a role in the conspiracy to murder Corey Lal, and acted as a police informant in the Surrey Six case.

The 2011 Census recorded a parish population of 156, so that it has an annual parish meeting instead of a parish council. In 2018, it was reported that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had leased a property on the Great Tew estate. Archaeology Evidence that the area has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age includes a barrow about south of the village. Excavations of the site of a Roman villa south-east of the village at Beaconsfield Farm revealed a hypocaust and mosaic floors, pottery dating from the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, and evidence that occupation may have begun early in the 2nd century AD. Manor Great Tew was settled in the Anglo-Saxon era. Ælfric of Abingdon held the manor of Great Tew by 990 and became Archbishop of Canterbury in 995. Ælfric died in 1005, leaving Great Tew to Saint Alban's Abbey. In 1049–1052 the abbey leased Great Tew: > Leofstan, abbot, and St Albans Abbey, to Tova, widow of Wihtric, in return > for 3 marks of gold and an annual render of honey; lease, for her lifetime > and that of her son, Godwine, of land at Cyrictiwa, with reversion to St > Albans. In Old English the toponym Cyrictiwa means \\"Church Tew\\", distinguishing the village from neighbouring Little Tew, which lacked a church, and Nether Worton which seems not to have had its own place of worship until the 12th century. William the Conqueror granted the manor to his stepbrother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, and it was recorded among Odo's estates in the Domesday Book in 1086. Tew Great Park was created before the latter part of the 16th century. Sir Lawrence Tanfield, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer, bought Great Tew estate in 1611 from Edward Rainsford. He deprived the villagers of timber, causing some of the cottages to fall into disrepair. Tanfield enclosed part of Great Tew's lands in 1622. However, most of the parish's common lands remained unenclosed until an enclosure act for Great Tew was passed in 1767. Miniature of Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland After Tanfield died in 1626, followed by his wife Elizabeth in 1629, Great Tew passed to his young grandson Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland. In the 1630s Lucius gathered together a Great Tew circle of writers and scholars, who included Abraham Cowley, Ben Jonson and Edmund Waller. During the English Civil War the young Viscount fought on the Royalist side and was killed in 1643 at the First Battle of Newbury. Great Tew remained in the Cary family until the death of Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland in 1694. =Manor house and grounds= Viscount Cary lived in a large manor house that seems to have been built in or before the early part of the 17th century and to have been extended in the latter part of the 17th century. It was demolished in about 1800, but there are surviving structures from about 1700, including stables, a dovecote and stone gate piers. In 1780 and 1793 Great Tew estate was bought by George Stratton, who had made a fortune in the East India Company. He died in March 1800 and was succeeded by his son George Frederick Stratton. The manor house had evidently fallen into disrepair, as the Strattons lived in a smaller Georgian dower house slightly to the south of it, and had the manor house demolished in about 1803. In 1808 George Frederick Stratton engaged the Scots botanist and garden designer John Loudon, who laid out north and south drives in Great Tew Park and planted ornamental trees in and around the village, which still enhance its picturesque appearance. In 1815–1816, Matthew Robinson Boulton, the son of the manufacturer Matthew Boulton of Soho, Birmingham, bought Great Tew Estate. In 1834 Boulton added a Gothic Revival library to the east end of the house, and in 1856 the Boulton family added to the west end a large Tudor style section designed by F.S. Waller. Great Tew remained with the Boulton family until M. E. Boulton died without heirs in 1914. As of 2014, the house was largely unoccupied and clad in scaffolding and plastic sheeting. It is a restoration project for the estate owners, the Johnston family, who reopened the local ironstone quarry in 2000.Cotswold Homes Retrieved 3 June 2018. In recent years the Great Tew Estate has hosted events through the year, including the Cornbury Music Festival.http://www.greattewestate.com/Home/Events-at-Great- Tew.aspx?tags=great%20tew%20events,great%20tew%20activities Parish church 17th-century gateway leading to St Michael's parish church The Church of England parish church of St Michael and all Angels was originally Norman, and the south doorway from about 1170 survives from that period. It was rebuilt in the 13th century; the arcades of stone pillars inside the building and the south porch survive from that period. Early in the 14th century the aisles were enlarged and most of the present windows installed. The bell tower was built late in the 14th century in a transitional style between the Decorated Gothic and Perpendicular Gothic. Next the Perpendicular Gothic clerestory was added. The architect Thomas Rickman repaired St Michael's and restored its chancel in 1826–1827. The chancel has a monument to Mary Anne Boulton, which includes a reclining female figure sculpted in white marble by Francis Chantrey in 1834. The church is a Grade I listed building. The tower has a ring of eight bells. Six were cast in 1709 by Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester. A seventh was cast in 1785 by Abraham's grandsons Charles and John Rudhall of Gloucester. The youngest bell was cast in 1842 by W & J Taylor, presumably at their then foundry in Oxford. The organ, by Henry Williams of Cheltenham, dates from about 1863. It is a fine example of early Victorian organ building, the work of a maker who as a foreman of the London firm of Gray and Davison had been involved in building the organ for the Great Exhibition of 1851, now in St Anne's, Limehouse. The living of St Michael's was granted to the Benedictine Godstow Abbey in 1302 and remained under its control until the abbey was suppressed in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539. The villages of Nether Worton and Little Tew were part of the Great Tew church parish. Nether Worton became a separate parish again in the 17th century and Little Tew in the 1850s. Great Tew and Little Tew were reunited as a single Church of England benefice in 1930. Economic and social historyMills= Great Tew is stated to have two watermills by the 13th century. Both were still in use when the estate was surveyed in 1778. Mill Lane, about north of the village, is named after a mill that was built or rebuilt in the 17th century for wool processing. Traces of its mill pond, mill stream and wheel chamber were still visible in the early 1980s. Further north, about from the village, there was a mill on the stream near Cottenham Farm. Traces of its mill ponds, buildings and two water wheels were still visible in the early 1980s, and a small wood there is still called Pool Spinney. One mill had ceased to be used by the time G. F. Stratton sold the estate in 1815; the other was disused by 1837. One of J. C. Loudon's works for G. F. Stratton after 1808 was an elaborate watermill at Tracey Farm in the south of the parish. It was a bone mill, because the British Agricultural Revolution had identified lime as a fertiliser and bone meal as a source of it. The stream at Tracey Farm was dammed in a mill pond, and both the leat feeding the water wheel and the tail race downstream of it were in brick-lined tunnels, the latter below ground. Whereas most Oxfordshire watermills have an undershot or a breastshot wheel, Loudon adopted a more efficient backshot wheel. It was made of wood and iron and was in diameter. A sawmill powered by a beam engine was built in the middle of the 19th century. The beam engine has gone but the engine house and its tall chimney survive. One of the thatched cottages in Brook Road =Cottages= Many of the homes in the village seem to have been built in the 17th century, during the Great Rebuilding of England. Given the Tanfields' behaviour towards the villagers, they are more likely to have been built during the decades when the Cary family had the estate. Every cottage and house is built from the local ironstone from Great Tew's own quarry, and most have thatched roofs. Matthew Robinson Boulton had most of the village's old cottages and houses rebuilt and embellished from 1819 onwards. After M. E. Boulton's death in 1914 Great Tew estate was held in public trusteeship for nearly fifty years, during which time many of its historic cottages and houses were unoccupied and allowed to become derelict. In 1962 Major Eustace Robb, only son of Major-General Sir Frederick Spencer Robb, inherited the estate and declared he would restore its prosperity and buildings. However, a decade later many cottages were continuing to decay and Jennifer Sherwood and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner condemned their deterioration as \\"one of the most depressing sights in the whole county. Terraces of cottages lie derelict (1972) and will soon be beyond hope of restoration. A scheme of gradual rehabilitation is said to be in progress, but nothing has been done meanwhile to prevent the decay of unused cottages, some of which are completely ruinous and will need to be entirely rebuilt.\\" A cottage standing derelict in 1980 In 1978 another academic authority described Major Robb's treatment of Great Tew as a \\"notorious example\\" that had \\"demonstrated that a single-minded or neglectful owner can still cause both the community and the village fabric to die.\\" Also in 1978, Great Tew village was declared a conservation area. In 1985 Major Robb died, leaving Great Tew estate to the Johnston family, who have worked to restore the village. In 2000 they reopened Great Tew's historic quarry to supply ironstone for building.Great Tew Estate. Many of the cottages are Grade II listed buildings. One pair of 17th-century cottages, 57 and 58 The Lane, are Grade II* listed. Great Tew County Primary School, built in 1852 =School= In the 17th century, Lettice Cary, wife of the 2nd Viscount Falkland (see above), cared for the poor and sick of Great Tew and founded a village school. The village still had a school in the 18th century, but a schoolroom attached to the church was disused by 1738 and later in that century demolished. A school had been re-established by 1774 and its building was enlarged in 1815. In 1818, the village had also two dame schools. In 1852 M. R. Boulton moved the primary school to a new building on the village green. In 1923 this was enlarged to accommodate extra pupils from Little Tew. It has three classrooms and teaches pupils in classes of mixed age and ability. It is a county primary school controlled by Oxfordshire County Council. The Falkland Arms public house Amenities The Falkland Arms pub is mostly a late 17th- century building, in part possibly earlier. It had acquired its current name by 1830 and is now controlled by Wadworth Brewery. It offers accommodation, food and real ale, and is listed in a Michelin Guide.The Falkland Arms Great Tew has a village shop which is also a café. It was formerly the sub-post office. The Tew Centre,The Tew Centre between the village and Little Tew, also has a café and is the base for Great and Little Tew Cricket Club.Tew Cricket Club British piano rock band Keane played live on 6 July 2013 at the Great Tew Estate as part of their Strangeland Tour.

It was chaired by the Hon. D. Merlin Nunn, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. The Nunn Commission examined the events of October 14, 2004, in which Theresa McEvoy, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, a 52-year-old teacher's aide and mother of three boys, was killed when the car she was traveling was broadsided by another vehicle. The car was stolen and was being driven at high speeds by a serial young offender who had been mistakenly released from jail just two days previously. The 16-year-old had been released from jail despite the notable issue of having 38 outstanding criminal charges pending against him. The Commission convened on June 29, 2005. The Commissioner was charged with: * determining what happened * what the youth criminal justice policies and procedures were at the time and whether they were adequate * determining what actions of law enforcement and Justice officials took in relation to this incident * determining the reasons why the offender was released, and * judging the adequacy of legislation governing youth criminal justice in Canada Over 31 days of testimony, Commissioner Nunn heard from 47 witnesses, including the families of the principals, policing agencies, Government and court officials, educational officials, and the legal establishment. Chief commission counsel was Michael J. Messenger of Cox & Palmer. Nine parties were represented. The Commissioner tabled his final report on December 5, 2006. The report tabled 34 recommendations in the areas of youth justice administration and accountability, youth crime legislation, and prevention of youth crime. The Commissioner's findings focused much attention on the deficiencies of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, which was cited as an important factor that lead to the tragedy, along with improvements in responding to \\"at risk\\" children and youth in Nova Scotia. The Government of Nova Scotia accepted all of the Commissioner's recommendations, and published an official response. The Nunn Commission's findings have been cited as a significant factor in pending changes to the Act, currently before the Canadian Parliament, through Bill C-10 . However, Commissioner Nunn has made public comments disagreeing with some aspects of the proposed legislation.

He described it as two masses of land with a break, a strait, or an indentation between. The land was named for John R. Bradley, who had sponsored Cook's expedition. Cook published two photographs of the land and described it thus: \\"The lower coast resembled Heiberg Island, with mountains and high valleys.

It is located in Alameda, California, United States, and is part of the Alameda Unified School District. Island High only admits students who are at least sixteen years old. Summary Island High opened as a continuation school in the 1970s as an alternative high school to Alameda and Encinal High Schools. The original campus was located at 2437 Eagle Avenue in Alameda, near the Park Street and Fruitvale Bridges. In 2007, Island High moved to its second location at 250 Singleton Avenue, the site of the old George P. Miller Elementary School. The elementary school building was renovated to better suit a high school environment. The high school has since moved again to its current location. Island High is different from most traditional high schools in the state of California, in that it allows students to earn 7.5 credits every semester, instead of the usual five at a traditional high school. Island High splits its grading periods into six \\"Hexemesters\\" (Or \\"Hexes\\") rather than four Quarters. Hexes last approximately six weeks and allow students to earn 2.5 subject credits in a class, the amount normally earned in one nine week-long quarter at a traditional high school. Despite this non-traditional schedule, Island High still follows the same standard school calendar set by the district. Students may also earn additional subject credits through completion of Contracts and Challenge Exams. A Contract is an additional project taken on by a student in addition to their regular class workload that is to be completed outside of class time, subject credits vary by contract. Challenge Exams are tests that are administered once every Hex and if passed, applies five credits in the exam's subject area. Grading at Island High also differs from that of a traditional high school, namely with the absence of failing (F) grades. In lieu a F, students who do not meet a subject's passing requirements are given a No Mark (NM) grade which does not affect their grade point average in the way a F does. Both F and NM grades do not award any credit. Enrollment The student body of Island High has always been relatively small, with only approximately 200 students in the entire school. Most students at Island High are transfer students from Alameda and Encinal High Schools who are low on credits, with a small percentage of students transferring from outside the Alameda Unified School District. Once a student has a certain number of credits, he or she may choose to transfer out of Island and back to their original school. Few students actually choose to do this. Graduation requirements Despite its status as a continuation high school, diplomas awarded from Island High are recognized in the same manner as diplomas issued from any other California high school. Students require 230 credits, a minimum GPA of 1.75, and twenty hours of community service to graduate. A student is considered a graduate on the very day they meet all requirements and graduations at Island High commonly occur on regular school days in the middle of the year. All graduates regardless of graduation date are invited to participate in a commencement ceremony at the end of the school year.

Hoffman, Pat Hayes, Kenneth M. Ford, Jeffrey M. Bradshaw: 9780769547152: Amazon.com: Books Professional BackgroundEducation= Bradshaw did his undergraduate work in psychology at the University of Utah. After a year as a research assistant to Bruce L. Brown (cognitive psychology) and Allen E. Bergin (clinical psychology) at Brigham Young University, he entered the clinical psychology program at the University of Washington, under the supervision of Irwin G. Sarason. As Bradshaw began work on his dissertation, he became aware of the work of John H. Boose, inventor of the automated knowledge acquisition tool, ETSExpertise transfer for expert system design - John H. Boose - Google Boeken at the recently formed Artificial Intelligence Center at The Boeing Company. Given their mutual interest in the work of American psychologist George Kelly, he was invited by John to join the newly created organization. Within the knowledge acquisition community, he collaborated with colleagues that would be influential throughout his subsequent professional life, including Guy André Boy, William Clancey, Paul J. Feltovich, Kenneth M. Ford, Brian R. Gaines, Tom Gruber, Robert H. Hoffman, David Madigan, Enrico Motta, Mark Musen, Nigel Shadbolt, Mildred Shaw, Bob Wielinga, among many others. In harmony with his new professional direction, he switched his emphasis at the University of Washington and ultimately received his Ph.D. in cognitive science, with Earl B. Hunt as chair of his committee. =1985-2000: Boeing and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center= From 1985 to 2000, Bradshaw led various research groups at The Boeing Company. Though his earliest publications were focused on memory and language, his research focus soon turned to a wide variety of topics relating human and machine intelligence. With Ken Ford he edited Knowledge Acquisition as a Modeling ActivityKnowledge Acquisition As Modeling and became well known for his role in helping develop a suite of successful methodologies and tools for automated knowledge acquisition and for the simplification of complex modeling tasks (Aquinas, Axotl, Canard, DDUCKS). He led the development of eQuality, an interactive visual framework with an underlying ontology-based model for streamlining strategic corporate business processes that was used as the principal enterprise modeling tool for the Boeing 777 airplane program.eQuality Bradshaw has had a continuing interest in improving health care. For eight years he co-led a group at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and was co-principal investigator for an Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) computerized decision support systems (CDSS) grant to develop knowledge-based technology to provide better long-term post-transplant care of bone marrow transplantation patients scattered throughout the world. Learning technologies has been another area of focus for Bradshaw. He co-chaired The Fourth International Workshop on Human and Machine Cognition, \\"Education and Smart Machines.\\"Smart Machines in Education: Kenneth D. Forbus, Paul J. Feltovich: 9780262561419: Amazon.com: Books As co-chair of the Emerging Technologies subcommittee of the Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee (AICC) for several years, he coordinated cooperative research efforts by airlines, airframe manufacturers, and the computer industry to increase interoperability of advanced training and agent-based performance support tools.http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~gaines/BooseBradshaw/EmergingTech-CBT.doc In 1993, Bradshaw was selected as a Fulbright Senior Scholar. His project brought him to the European Institute for Cognitive Sciences and Engineering (EURISCO) in Toulouse, France.http://history.arc.nasa.gov/hist_pdfs/riacs_25anniversary_bklt- tmln_2008.pdf During his year in France, he drafted the manuscript of a book entitled Software Agents,Software Agents which became a classic in the field and a best-seller for The MIT Press. Bradshaw saw this new direction as a natural evolution from his early work on knowledge acquisition. =2000-Present: Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC)= In 1997, Bradshaw took a year-long leave-of-absence from Boeing to pursue research at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC), which was directed by his long-time colleague Ken Ford. In 2000, he joined IHMC full-time. Bradshaw continued to pioneer the research areas of multi- agent systems. He led the DARPA- and NASA-funded ITAC study team, Software Agents for the Warfighter.Three architectures for semantic integration of agents He served for over a decade on the Board of Directors of the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.http://www.aamas-conference.org/boardmembers.html In addition to his participation as an organizer in many agent-related conferences, he served as co-program chair for the IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conference on Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2011)Web Intelligence Consortium and was a co-program chair of the Third International Conference on Autonomous Agents (1999).Proceedings of the third annual conference on Autonomous Agents He served as co-program chair for Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2008),Intelligent User Interfaces as program vice chair of the 2008 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Human-Machine Systems (DHMS 2008),2008 IEEE International Conference on Distributed Human-Machine Systems and as co- general chair of the 2009 International Conference on Active Media Technologies (AMT).

Specifically, Luna software agents, KAoS security and teamwork policies, and visualizations based on an understanding of human perception and cognition are used to enable distributed sensemaking, rapid detection of threats, effective protection of critical resources, and resilient mission assurance. He collaborated with Sandia National Laboratories on the \\"Human Dimensions of Cyber Operations\\" initiative. In August 2012, he was an invited speaker at the Second Experimental Security Panoramas for Critical System Protection Workshop. Human-Agent-Robot Teamwork has been one of Bradshaw's central interests for many years. From 2002–2006, KAoS was used as part of a NASA series of annual two-week field tests of human-robot teams performing simulated planetary surface exploration at the Mars Desert Research Station in the Utah desert. Bradshaw was sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security to undertake detailed simulation studies of the use of human-robot teams to secure facilities at Port Everglades. He has also led the ONR-sponsored NAIMT and Coordinated Operations projects where a team of humans and heterogeneous robots performed field exercises at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, aimed at port reconnaissance, and robot-assisted detection and apprehension of intruders.

Soon after his return to El Salvador in December 1981, Calitto was assigned to become the founder Commander of the elite \\"Atonal\\" Battalion, an immediate reaction battalion in the department of Usulután, where he trained what was considered one of the best military groups in El Salvador. Calitto Arbaiza married Juanita Flores and had two sons, Herson Napoleon Calitto Jr and Ronnie Stanley Calitto. Herson Calitto Jr joined the Salvadorean army in 1983 and died in combat on 19 February 1984, when the helicopter he was traveling in was brought down by guerrilla forces. Ronnie Calitto joined the United Nations and served with the Department of Peace Keeping Operations in Liberia (UNMIL) and Sudan (UNMIS); and later he joined the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Afghanistan as Humanitarian Affairs and Civil-Military Coordination Officer. In May 1984 Colonel Calitto was made commander of the Commander and Instruction center of the Salvadorean Army, the position he held until the time of his death on 23 October 1984. Ironically, as his son, Colonel Calitto was killed while traveling in a helicopter after a FMLN bomb went off while he was on flight. The remnants of his helicopter can be found in El Museo de la Revolucion in Perquín, Morazán. Calitto also had a daughter out of wedlock in October 1967 with Leonor Herrera, and also married Frida Larreynaga in December 1975 and had another daughter. In 1985, the city of Usulatan named one of their main streets after him and raised a monument commemorating his life.

Following inflammation, the red areas start keratinization, eventually forming the definitive plaques that appear brownish, dry and scaled. Following quite a precise temporal pattern of evolution, the keratinized plaques last for weeks or months, eventually leading to periods of desquamation that leads to the uncovering of \\"normal\\" skin. Then, a new cycle usually begins, leaving a variable number of days of delay between the cycles. Though environmental causes are not well understood, it seems clear that factors like sun exposure, wind and air conditioning add to the degree of skin inflammation that sets the start of a new cycle.

Palliative treatment are intended to alleviate the itching that often accompanies the skin inflammation and to moisture the dry skin to prevent excessive dryness and scaling of the plaques.

They are named after Stål Aanderaa, Richard M. Karp, and Arnold L. Rosenberg. According to the conjecture, for a wide class of properties, no algorithm can guarantee that it will be able to skip any questions: any algorithm for determining whether the graph has the property, no matter how clever, might need to examine every pair of vertices before it can give its answer. A property satisfying this conjecture is called evasive. More precisely, the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture states that any deterministic algorithm must test at least a constant fraction of all possible pairs of vertices, in the worst case, to determine any non-trivial monotone graph property; in this context, a property is monotone if it remains true when edges are added (so planarity is not monotone, but non-planarity is monotone). A stronger version of this conjecture, called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture, states that exactly tests are needed. Versions of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been formulated and studied. The deterministic Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture was proven by , but the stronger Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture remains unproven. Additionally, there is a large gap between the conjectured lower bound and the best proven lower bound for randomized and quantum query complexity. Example The property of being non-empty (that is, having at least one edge) is monotone, because adding another edge to a non-empty graph produces another non-empty graph. There is a simple algorithm for testing whether a graph is non-empty: loop through all of the pairs of vertices, testing whether each pair is connected by an edge. If an edge is ever found in this way, break out of the loop, and report that the graph is non-empty, and if the loop completes without finding any edges, then report that the graph is empty. On some graphs (for instance the complete graphs) this algorithm will terminate quickly, without testing every pair of vertices, but on the empty graph it tests all possible pairs before terminating. Therefore, the query complexity of this algorithm is n(n − 1)/2: in the worst case, the algorithm performs n(n − 1)/2 tests. The algorithm described above is not the only possible method of testing for non-emptiness, but the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture implies that every deterministic algorithm for testing non-emptiness has the same query complexity, n(n − 1)/2. That is, the property of being non-empty is evasive. For this property, the result is easy to prove directly: if an algorithm does not perform n(n − 1)/2 tests, it cannot distinguish the empty graph from a graph that has one edge connecting one of the untested pairs of vertices, and must give an incorrect answer on one of these two graphs. Definitions In the context of this article, all graphs will be simple and undirected, unless stated otherwise. This means that the edges of the graph form a set (and not a multiset) and each edge is a pair of distinct vertices. Graphs are assumed to have an implicit representation in which each vertex has a unique identifier or label and in which it is possible to test the adjacency of any two vertices, but for which adjacency testing is the only allowed primitive operation. Informally, a graph property is a property of a graph that is independent of labeling. More formally, a graph property is a mapping from the set of all graphs to {0,1} such that isomorphic graphs are mapped to the same value. For example, the property of containing at least 1 vertex of degree 2 is a graph property, but the property that the first vertex has degree 2 is not, because it depends on the labeling of the graph (in particular, it depends on which vertex is the \\"first\\" vertex). A graph property is called non-trivial if it doesn't assign the same value to all graphs. For instance, the property of being a graph is a trivial property, since all graphs possess this property. On the other hand, the property of being empty is non-trivial, because the empty graph possesses this property, but non-empty graphs do not. A graph property is said to be monotone if the addition of edges does not destroy the property. Alternately, if a graph possesses a monotone property, then every supergraph of this graph on the same vertex set also possesses it. For instance, the property of being nonplanar is monotone: a supergraph of a nonplanar graph is itself nonplanar. However, the property of being regular is not monotone. The big O notation is often used for query complexity. In short, f(n) is O(g(n)) if for large enough n, f(n) ≤ c g(n) for some positive constant c. Similarly, f(n) is Ω(g(n)) if for large enough n, f(n) ≥ c g(n) for some positive constant c. Finally, f(n) is Θ(g(n)) if it is both O(g(n)) and Ω(g(n)). Query complexity The deterministic query complexity of evaluating a function on n bits (x1, x2, ..., xn) is the number of bits xi that have to be read in the worst case by a deterministic algorithm to determine the value of the function. For instance, if the function takes value 0 when all bits are 0 and takes value 1 otherwise (this is the OR function), then the deterministic query complexity is exactly n. In the worst case, the first bits read could all be 0, and the value of the function now depends on the last bit. If an algorithm doesn't read this bit, it might output an incorrect answer. (Such arguments are known as adversary arguments.) The number of bits read are also called the number of queries made to the input. One can imagine that the algorithm asks (or queries) the input for a particular bit and the input responds to this query. The randomized query complexity of evaluating a function is defined similarly, except the algorithm is allowed to be randomized, i.e., it can flip coins and use the outcome of these coin flips to decide which bits to query. However, the randomized algorithm must still output the correct answer for all inputs: it is not allowed to make errors. Such algorithms are called Las Vegas algorithms, which distinguishes them from Monte Carlo algorithms which are allowed to make some error. Randomized query complexity can also be defined in the Monte Carlo sense, but the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is about the Las Vegas query complexity of graph properties. Quantum query complexity is the natural generalization of randomized query complexity, of course allowing quantum queries and responses. Quantum query complexity can also be defined with respect to Monte Carlo algorithms or Las Vegas algorithms, but it is usually taken to mean Monte Carlo quantum algorithms. In the context of this conjecture, the function to be evaluated is the graph property, and the input is a string of size n(n − 1)/2, which gives the locations of the edges on an n vertex graph, since a graph can have at most n(n − 1)/2 possible edges. The query complexity of any function is upper bounded by n(n − 1)/2, since the whole input is read after making n(n − 1)/2 queries, thus determining the input graph completely. Deterministic query complexity For deterministic algorithms, originally conjectured that for all nontrivial graph properties on n vertices, deciding whether a graph possesses this property requires Ω(n2) queries. The non-triviality condition is clearly required because there are trivial properties like \\"is this a graph?\\" which can be answered with no queries at all. A scorpion graph. One of the three red path vertices is adjacent to all other vertices and the other two red vertices have no other adjacencies. The conjecture was disproved by Aanderaa, who exhibited a directed graph property (the property of containing a \\"sink\\") which required only O(n) queries to test. A sink, in a directed graph, is a vertex of indegree n-1 and outdegree 0. This property can be tested with less than 3n queries . An undirected graph property which can also be tested with O(n) queries is the property of being a scorpion graph, first described in . A scorpion graph is a graph containing a three-vertex path, such that one endpoint of the path is connected to all remaining vertices, while the other two path vertices have no incident edges other than the ones in the path. Then Aanderaa and Rosenberg formulated a new conjecture (the Aanderaa–Rosenberg conjecture) which says that deciding whether a graph possesses a non-trivial monotone graph property requires Ω(n2) queries. This conjecture was resolved by by showing that at least n2/16 queries are needed to test for any nontrivial monotone graph property. The bound was further improved to n2/9 by , then to n2/4 - o(n2) by , then to (8/25)n2 \\\\- o(n2) by , and then to n2/3 - o(n2) by . Richard Karp conjectured the stronger statement (which is now called the evasiveness conjecture or the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture) that \\"every nontrivial monotone graph property for graphs on n vertices is evasive.\\" A property is called evasive if determining whether a given graph has this property sometimes requires all n(n − 1)/2 queries. This conjecture says that the best algorithm for testing any nontrivial monotone property must (in the worst case) query all possible edges. This conjecture is still open, although several special graph properties have shown to be evasive for all n. The conjecture has been resolved for the case where n is a prime power by using a topological approach. The conjecture has also been resolved for all non-trivial monotone properties on bipartite graphs by . Minor-closed properties have also been shown to be evasive for large n . In the conjecture was generalized to properties of other (non-graph) functions too, conjecturing that any non-trivial monotone function that is weakly symmetric is evasive. This case is also solved when n is a prime power . Randomized query complexity Richard Karp also conjectured that Ω(n2) queries are required for testing nontrivial monotone properties even if randomized algorithms are permitted. No nontrivial monotone property is known which requires less than n2/4 queries to test. A linear lower bound (i.e., Ω(n)) on all monotone properties follows from a very general relationship between randomized and deterministic query complexities. The first superlinear lower bound for all monotone properties was given by who showed that Ω(n log1/12 n) queries are required. This was further improved by to Ω(n5/4), and then by to Ω(n4/3). This was subsequently improved to the current best known lower bound (among bounds that hold for all monotone properties) of Ω(n4/3 log1/3 n) by . Some recent results give lower bounds which are determined by the critical probability p of the monotone graph property under consideration. The critical probability p is defined as the unique p such that a random graph G(n, p) possesses this property with probability equal to 1/2. A random graph G(n, p) is a graph on n vertices where each edge is chosen to be present with probability p independent of all the other edges. showed that any monotone property with critical probability p requires \\\\Omega\\\\left(\\\\min\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{n}{\\\\min(p,1-p)},\\\\frac{n^2}{\\\\log n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right) queries. For the same problem, showed a lower bound of Ω(n4/3/p1/3). As in the deterministic case, there are many special properties for which an Ω(n2) lower bound is known. Moreover, better lower bounds are known for several classes of graph properties. For instance, for testing whether the graph has a subgraph isomorphic to any given graph (the so-called subgraph isomorphism problem), the best known lower bound is Ω(n3/2) due to . Quantum query complexity For bounded-error quantum query complexity, the best known lower bound is Ω(n2/3 log1/6 n) as observed by Andrew Yao.The result is unpublished, but mentioned in . It is obtained by combining the randomized lower bound with the quantum adversary method. The best possible lower bound one could hope to achieve is Ω(n), unlike the classical case, due to Grover's algorithm which gives an O(n) query algorithm for testing the monotone property of non-emptiness. Similar to the deterministic and randomized case, there are some properties which are known to have an Ω(n) lower bound, for example non-emptiness (which follows from the optimality of Grover's algorithm) and the property of containing a triangle. There are some graph properties which are known to have an Ω(n3/2) lower bound, and even some properties with an Ω(n2) lower bound. For example, the monotone property of nonplanarity requires Θ(n3/2) queries and the monotone property of containing more than half the possible number of edges (also called the majority function) requires Θ(n2) queries .

In mathematics, the Young–Fibonacci graph and Young–Fibonacci lattice, named after Alfred Young and Leonardo Fibonacci, are two closely related structures involving sequences of the digits 1 and 2. Any digit sequence of this type can be assigned a rank, the sum of its digits: for instance, the rank of 11212 is 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 7\\\\. As was already known in ancient India, the number of sequences with a given rank is a Fibonacci number. The Young–Fibonacci lattice is an infinite modular lattice having these digit sequences as its elements, compatible with this rank structure. The Young–Fibonacci graph is the graph of this lattice, and has a vertex for each digit sequence. As the graph of a modular lattice, it is a modular graph. The Young–Fibonacci graph and the Young–Fibonacci lattice were both initially studied in two papers by and . They are named after the closely related Young's lattice and after the Fibonacci number of their elements at any given rank. Digit sequences with a given rank A digit sequence with rank may be formed either by adding the digit 2 to a sequence with rank , or by adding the digit 1 to a sequence with rank . If is the function that maps to the number of different digit sequences of that rank, therefore, satisfies the recurrence relation defining the Fibonacci numbers, but with slightly different initial conditions: (there is one rank-0 string, the empty string, and one rank-1 string, consisting of the single digit 1). These initial conditions cause the sequence of values of to be shifted by one position from the Fibonacci numbers: where denotes the th Fibonacci number. In the ancient Indian study of prosody, the Fibonacci numbers were used to count the number of different sequences of short and long syllables with a given total length; if the digit 1 corresponds to a short syllable, and the digit 2 corresponds to a long syllable, the rank of a digit sequence measures the total length of the corresponding sequence of syllables. See the Fibonacci number article for details. Graphs of digit sequences The Young–Fibonacci graph is an infinite graph, with a vertex for each string of the digits “1” and “2” (including the empty string). The neighbors of a string s are the strings formed from s by one of the following operations: #Insert a “1” into s, prior to the leftmost “1” (or anywhere in s if it does not already contain a “1”). #Change the leftmost “1” of s into a “2”. #Remove the leftmost “1” from s. #Change a “2” that does not have a “1” to the left of it into a “1”. It is straightforward to verify that each operation can be inverted: operations 1 and 3 are inverse to each other, as are operations 2 and 4. Therefore, the resulting graph may be considered to be undirected. However, it is usually considered to be a directed acyclic graph in which each edge connects from a vertex of lower rank to a vertex of higher rank. As both and observe, this graph has the following properties: *It is connected: any nonempty string may have its rank reduced by some operation, so there is a sequence of operations leading from it to the empty string, reversing which gives a directed path in the graph from the empty string to every other vertex. *It is compatible with the rank structure: every directed path has length equal to the difference in ranks of its endpoints. *For every two distinct nodes u and v, the number of common immediate predecessors of u and v equals the number of common immediate successors of u and v; this number is either zero or one. *The out-degree of every vertex equals one plus its in- degree. calls a graph with these properties a Y-graph; calls a graph with a weaker version of these properties (in which the numbers of common predecessors and common successors of any pair of nodes must be equal but may be greater than one) the graph of a differential poset. Partial order and lattice structure The transitive closure of the Young–Fibonacci graph is a partial order. As shows, any two vertices x and y have a unique greatest common predecessor in this order (their meet) and a unique least common successor (their join); thus, this order is a lattice, called the Young–Fibonacci lattice. To find the meet of and , one may first test whether one of and is a predecessor of the other. A string is a predecessor of another string in this order exactly when the number of \\"2\\" digits remaining in , after removing the longest common suffix of and , is at least as large as the number of all digits remaining in after removing the common suffix. If is a predecessor of according to this test, then their meet is , and similarly if is a predecessor of then their meet is . In a second case, if neither nor is the predecessor of the other, but one or both of them begins with a “1” digit, the meet is unchanged if these initial digits are removed. And finally, if both and begin with the digit “2”, the meet of and may be found by removing this digit from both of them, finding the meet of the resulting suffixes, and adding the “2” back to the start. A common successor of and (though not necessarily the least common successor) may be found by taking a string of “2” digits with length equal to the longer of and . The least common successor is then the meet of the finitely many strings that are common successors of and and predecessors of this string of “2”s. As further observes, the Young–Fibonacci lattice is modular. incorrectly claims that it is distributive; however, the sublattice formed by the strings {21,22,121,211,221} forms a diamond sublattice, forbidden in distributive lattices.

It was the first bypass engine ever used on short haul aircraft in the USSR. The engine is still produced by Ukrainian based aircraft engine manufacturing company, Motor Sich. Development The AI-25 was designed to power the Yakovlev Yak-40 tri-jet airliner, often called the first regional jet transport aircraft, and is the starting point for the Lotarev DV-2 turbofan engine. The project was launched in 1965, with the AI-25s first test flight in 1966, and finally cleared for production in 1967. In 1972, the AI-25 was selected for the Polish PZL M-15 Belphegor, the world's only jet-powered biplane. Development of the AI-25 continued and the uprated AI-25TL was designed for use by the Czechoslovak Aero L-39 Albatros military trainer with the first flight occurring in 1968. The L-39, would go on to become one of the most popular, and widespread trainer aircraft in the world, with over 3,000 L-39s produced, and with 2,900 examples still in active service today. A smaller version of the AI-25TL, the AI-25TLK has equipped the People's Republic of Chinas Hongdu L-11 fighter-trainer. The AI-25TLK is also licensed built in the People's Republic of China as the WS-11. Another variant of the AI-25, is the AI-25TLSh in the 1990s, which underwent flight testing by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense in 2002. Ivchenko-Progress is currently marketing the AI-25TLSh as an upgrade to existing L-39 and JL-8 operators that would extend the service life of the aircraft and improve performance.

The ability of stratospheric aerosols to create a global dimming effect has made them a possible candidate for use in solar radiation management climate engineering projects to limit the effect and impact of climate change due to rising levels of greenhouse gases. Delivery of precursor sulfide gases such as sulfuric acid, hydrogen sulfide () or sulfur dioxide () by artillery, aircraft and balloons has been proposed. Non-sulfide substances such as calcite have also been proposed given their benefits to the ozone layer. It appears that this could counter most changes to temperature and precipitation, take effect rapidly, have low direct implementation costs, and be reversible in its direct climatic effects. However, it would do so imperfectly and other effects are possible. One study calculated the impact of injecting sulfate particles, or aerosols, every one to four years into the stratosphere in amounts equal to those lofted by the volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, but did not address the many technical and political challenges involved in potential solar radiation management (SRM) efforts. If found to be economically, environmentally and technologically viable, such injections could provide a \\"grace period\\" of up to 20 years by which time atmospheric greenhouse gas pollution would need to be reduced to safe levels. It has been suggested that the direct delivery of precursors could be achieved using sulfide gases such as dimethyl sulfide, sulfur dioxide (), carbonyl sulfide, or hydrogen sulfide (). These compounds would be delivered using artillery, aircraft (such as the high-flying F-15C) or balloons, and result in the formation of compounds with the sulfate anion SO42−. According to estimates, \\"one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide.\\" Arguments for the technique The arguments in favour of this approach in comparison to other possible means of solar radiation management are: * Mimics a natural process: Stratospheric sulfur aerosols are created by existing natural processes (especially volcanoes), whose impacts have been studied via observations. This contrasts with other, more speculative solar radiation management techniques which do not have natural analogs (e.g., space sunshade). * Technological feasibility: In contrast to other proposed solar radiation management techniques, such as marine cloud brightening and space sunshades, much of the required technology is pre-existing: chemical manufacturing, artillery shells, high-altitude aircraft, weather balloons, etc. * Cost: Numerous studies have concluded that SAI would cost less than many other interventions. Costs cannot be derived in a wholly objective fashion, as pricing can only be roughly estimated at an early stage. However, many sources suggest that it would be cheap relative to cutting emissions, capturing carbon dioxide, adapting to climate impacts, or suffering climate damages. The annual cost of delivering 5 million tons of an albedo enhancing aerosol to an altitude of 20 to 30 km is estimated at US$2 billion to 8 billion. Around 5 million tons of delivered annually is predicted to sufficiently offset the expected warming over the next century. can be purchased online for as little as US$500 per ton. In comparison, the annual cost estimates for climate damage or emission mitigation range from US$200 billion to 2 trillion. * Efficacy: Most proposed solar radiation management techniques can only provide a limited intervention in the climate—one cannot reduce the temperature by more than a certain amount with each technique. Research has suggested that this technique may have a high radiative 'forcing potential'. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concludes that \\"SAI is the most-researched SRM method, with high agreement that it could limit warming to below 1.5°C.\\" Efficacy issues It is uncertain how effective any solar radiation management technique would be, due to the difficulties modeling their impacts and the complex nature of the global climate system. Certain efficacy issues are specific to stratospheric aerosols. *Lifespan of aerosols: Tropospheric sulfur aerosols are short lived. Delivery of particles into the lower stratosphere in the arctic will typically ensure that they remain aloft only for a few weeks or months, as air in this region is predominantly descending. To ensure endurance, higher-altitude delivery is needed, ensuring a typical endurance of several years by enabling injection into the rising leg of the Brewer-Dobson circulation above the tropical tropopause. Further, sizing of particles is crucial to their endurance. *Aerosol delivery: There are two proposals for how to create a stratospheric sulfate aerosol cloud, either through release of a precursor gas () or the direct release of sulfuric acid () and these face different challenges. If gas is released it will oxidize to form and then condense to form droplets far from the injection site. Releasing would not allow control over the size of the particles that are formed but would not require a sophisticated release mechanism. Simulations suggest that as the release rate is increased there would be diminishing returns on the cooling effect, as larger particles would be formed which have a shorter lifetime and are less effective scatterers of light. If is released directly then the aerosol particles would form very quickly and in principle the particle size could be controlled although the engineering requirements for this are uncertain. As direct release would allow control over the particle size it could be possible to avoid some of the inefficiencies associated with release. Known side effects arguing against the technique *Ecosystem Light Deprivation: Photosynthesis is the basis of life on Earth. By uniformly dimming incoming shortwave radiation necessary for the growth of phytoplanktons, trees, and crops, deployment of the technology assures reduction in primary productivity by between 2-5% from now until the end of the century, proportional to the greenhouse gas levels at that time and their total radiative forcing. This effect would proportionally reduce human's ability to grow food and the ecosystem's ability to regenerate. *Inhibition of Solar Energy Technologies: Uniformly reduced net shortwave radiation would hurt solar photovoltaics by the same 2-5% as for plants . the increased scattering of collimated incoming sunlight would more drastically reduce the efficiencies (by 11% for RCP8.5) of concentrating solar thermal power for both electricity production and chemical reactions, such as solar cement production. Possible side effects Climate engineering and solar radiation management in general are controversial, and pose various problems and risks. However, certain problems are specific to, or more pronounced with stratospheric sulfide injection. The injection of other aerosols that may be safer such as calcite has therefore been proposed. *Health effects: While the sulfate particles are natural, if any sulfate particles returned to ground level in significant amounts it would affect asthma sufferers and have other potential health effects. Minimising these effects is principally achieved by ensuring the particles stay aloft as long as possible, thus reducing the tonnages returning into the lower atmosphere. *Ozone depletion: is a potential side effect of sulfur aerosols; and these concerns have been supported by modelling. However, this may only occur if high enough quantities of aerosols drift to, or are deposited in, Polar stratospheric clouds before the levels of CFCs and other ozone destroying gases fall naturally to safe levels because stratospheric aerosols, together with the ozone destroying gases, are responsible for ozone depletion. *Whitening of the sky: Stratospheric aerosols have the potential to whiten the sky and cause more colorful sunsets, dependent on the amount being sprayed. According to a study on cleaner air, the reduction of aerosol pollution has led to solar brightening in Europe and North America, which has been responsible for an increase in U.S. corn production over the past 30 years. * *Tropopause warming: and the humidification of the stratosphere. *Regional warming: Based on the results of the 2014-2015 Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, a model with a standard stratospheric aerosol injection scenario, temperatures in the tropics would cool, and higher latitudes warm, ice sheet, and Arctic sea ice decline would still continue, albeit at a reduced rate. Extreme temperature anomalies would also still increase, but to a lesser degree. In regards to these model results, the author of the study Alan Robock noted: * Stratospheric temperature change: Aerosols can also absorb some radiation from the Sun, the Earth and the surrounding atmosphere. This changes the surrounding air temperature and could potentially impact on the stratospheric circulation, which in turn may impact the surface circulation. * Regional hydrologic responses: Based on the results of the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project, there would be a reduction in the global average precipitation around the world, particularly in summer monsoon regions. The injection of non- sulfide aerosols like calcite (limestone) would also have a cooling effect while counteracting ozone depletion and would be expected to reduce other side effects. Regardless of worry, such atmospheric effects are similar to medication in that amount is key, as in dose makes the poison and/or cure, furthermore, random non-artificial injections will occur anyway. Aerosol formation Primary aerosol formation, also known as homogeneous aerosol formation, results when gaseous combines with oxygen and water to form aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This acidic liquid solution is in the form of a vapor and condenses onto particles of solid matter, either meteoritic in origin or from dust carried from the surface to the stratosphere. Secondary or heterogeneous aerosol formation occurs when H2SO4 vapor condenses onto existing aerosol particles. Existing aerosol particles or droplets also run into each other, creating larger particles or droplets in a process known as coagulation. Warmer atmospheric temperatures also lead to larger particles. These larger particles would be less effective at scattering sunlight because the peak light scattering is achieved by particles with a diameter of 0.3 μm. Methods Various techniques have been proposed for delivering the aerosol precursor gases (H2S and ). The required altitude to enter the stratosphere is the height of the tropopause, which varies from 11 kilometres (6.8 mi/36,000 ft) at the poles to 17 kilometres (11 mi/58,000 ft) at the equator. * Civilian aircraft including the Boeing 747-400 and Gulfstream G550/650, C-37A could be modified at relatively low cost to deliver sufficient amounts of required material. * Military aircraft such as the F15-C variant of the F-15 Eagle have the necessary flight ceiling, but limited payload. Military tanker aircraft such as the KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender also have the necessary ceiling and have greater payload capacity. * Modified artillery might have the necessary capability, but requires a polluting and expensive gunpowder charge to loft the payload. Railgun artillery could be a non-polluting alternative. *High-altitude balloons can be used to lift precursor gases, in tanks, bladders or in the balloons' envelope. Balloons can also be used to lift pipes and hoses, but no moored balloon has ever been deployed to the necessary altitude. =Material options= Precursor gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide have been considered. Use of gaseous sulfuric acid appears to reduce the problem of aerosol growth. Materials such as photophoretic particles, titanium dioxide, and diamond are also under consideration. =Injection system= The latitude and distribution of injection locations has been discussed by various authors. Whilst a near-equatorial injection regime will allow particles to enter the rising leg of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, several studies have concluded that a broader, and higher- latitude, injection regime will reduce injection mass flow rates and/or yield climatic benefits. Concentration of precursor injection in a single longitude appears to be beneficial, with condensation onto existing particles reduced, giving better control of the size distribution of aerosols resulting. The long residence time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may require a millennium- timescale commitment to SRM if aggressive emissions abatement is not pursued simultaneously. Outdoors research Almost all work to date on stratospheric sulfate injection has been limited to modelling and laboratory work. A Russian team tested aerosol formation in the lower troposphere using helicopters. The Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering (SPICE) project planned on a limited field test in order to evaluate a potential delivery system, but this component of the project was canceled. In 2015, a group based at Harvard University has described a potential field experiment to test the possible damage to stratospheric ozone from stratospheric sulfate injection, and a first test is scheduled for 2019, taking place in the Tucson desert. Governance Most of the existing governance of stratospheric sulfate aerosols is from that which is applicable to solar radiation management more broadly. However, some existing legal instruments would be relevant to stratospheric sulfate aerosols specifically. At the international level, the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP Convention) obligates those countries which have ratified it to reduce their emissions of particular transboundary air pollutants. Notably, both solar radiation management and climate change (as well as greenhouse gases) could satisfy the definition of \\"air pollution\\" which the signatories commit to reduce, depending on their actual negative effects.Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution art. 1, Nov. 13, 1979, 1302 U.N.T.S. 219, Article 1 Commitments to specific values of the pollutants, including sulfates, are made through protocols to the CLRTAP Convention. Full implementation or large scale climate response field tests of stratospheric sulfate aerosols could cause countries to exceed their limits. However, because stratospheric injections would be spread across the globe instead of concentrated in a few nearby countries, and could lead to net reductions in the \\"air pollution\\" which the CLRTAP Convention is to reduce, it is uncertain how the convention's Implementation Committee and Executive Body would respond to such event. The stratospheric injection of sulfate aerosols would cause the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer to be applicable, due to their possible deleterious effects on stratospheric ozone. That treaty generally obligates its Parties to enact policies to control activities which \\"have or are likely to have adverse effects resulting from modification or likely modification of the ozone layer.\\"Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, opened for signature Mar. 22, 1985, 1513 U.N.T.S. 293, Article 1 The Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention prohibits the production of certain ozone depleting substances, via phase outs. Sulfates are presently not among the prohibited substances. In the United States, the Clean Air Act might give the United States Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate stratospheric sulfate aerosols.

The band soon changed their name to Violent Work of Art, Anders Gyllensten (guitars) and Wincent Ek (guitars) joined. In 1994 they recorded the demo, titled \\"Aggressive\\", and sent it to various record labels, trying to get a record deal. In 1995 they released another demo, titled \\"Hard\\". In 1996 Download Records signed the band and they released Breeding Dance which contained all the songs on the Aggressive and Hard albums. The band lost their record deal with Download Records when the owner of the label committed suicide and the label was put out of business. In 1998 the band changed their musical style, and member line-up, and started to play Industrial metal music. They released their drummer and began using a Drum Machine. VWOA did a cover of AC/DC's song \\"Hells Bells\\", which was featured on the album A Salute To AC/DC, released by Tribute Records, which brought them a fair share of publicity. Another noteworthy cover they made was of Ozzy Osbourne's song \\"Bark at the Moon\\". In 1999 they released Promo '99, their first demo with their new style, and in 2000 they released Promo 2000. They remained unsigned by a label during this period. Violent Work Of Art gained a lot of notoriety from countries like France, U.S. and Germany by uploading their songs at Mp3.com, which was later transformed by Cnet into more of a commercial music website. In 2001, the demo titled \\"COMA\\" was released. In 2002 ,the demo titled \\"The Worst Is Yet To Come\\" was released. In 2002, VWOA played at the Elveblest festival in Arnes, Norway. Tobias Eng rejoined the band in 2004 to replace Wincent Ek, who had left the band due to personal reasons. After about 10 years unsigned the band made a new record deal, for two albums, with Swedmetal Records. They re- released The Worst Is Yet To Come together with the songs from the COMA demo. In 2006, Maria Simonsson (synth) joined the band. In 2007, the band released their 3rd studio album titled \\"Automated Species\\", in which half of the songs are written, or co-written by former member W.Persson. In January 2008, Tobias Eng left the band for the second time. In October 2009, one of the developers from iovon.com, who was a fan of the band, offered the band a free website that used their prototypical new systems, and to take over as webmaster for the band. On 2009-12-04 VWOA played at the Klubb Kalabalik, in Vaxjo, Sweden. In November 2009, Violent Work of Art's website was completely redone, and started featuring music downloads, blogs and articles, forums, and user/fan profiles. Shortly after, the band released a new album named Tales Of Distortion. In January 2010, their webmaster began working with TouchTunes, a major music distribution system in North America and Canada, to get VWOA listed in their Jukebox index, and on 2010-01-08, they were accepted. On 2010-06-25 VWOA played at AB Anfall, in Kungsor, Sweden. On 2010-08-21 VWOA played Pstereo Festival, in Trondheim, Norway. Shortly after, the band release a new album titled The Dark Within.

While it appeared possible that the ship was pulled under by a submarine, a specific submarine could not be identified from among the number of submarines of several nations operating in the general vicinity of the accident site. Moreover, the condition of the ship's recovered trawling equipment was reported by a technical inquiry to not be consistent with a submarine entanglement.http://www.bea-mer.developpement- durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/RET_BUGALED_BREIZH_En_Site.pdf The accident The motorized fishing vessel (MFV) was built in 1986 by the Bretagne Sud shipyard in Belz. Bugaled Breizh (Children of Brittany) capsized with five sailors about southwest of Lizard Point, Cornwall on 15 January 2004 at 12h25 UTC. Weather in the area at the time was southwesterly winds of 25-30 knots and 2-3 mile visibility. The ship briefly radioed that it was sinking, and disappeared apparently very quickly; only two bodies of the five sailors were recovered at the time, while a third body was recovered on 10 July 2004 during salvage operations in 90 meters of water depth.  Inquiry  Immediately investigations were started by the French authorities in Quimper. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a surface ship, rock or wreck, the presence of a sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine. In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The fish hold showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the absence of evidence of any ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a surface ship could be abandoned. =Submarine entanglement theory = Several hours after the sinking an announcement was made by the French Maritime Prefect for the Atlantic that a NATO naval exercise involving submarines was taking place in the area. The Dutch submarine was one of the first ships to reach the site of the sinking and was suspected to be involved in the accident. The British submarine was also suspect as it was sent for repair after the exercises. However, according to authorities Dolfijn was at least away and the Royal Navy indicated as well that its submarines were not at the site where Bugaled Breizh sank. Other reports mention that the , the British nuclear attack submarine , and two French nuclear attack submarines, and , were also present in the vicinity. Another submarine noted in the area was . Further, there was apparently a submarine of unknown origin that was observing the NATO maneuvers. The hypothesis that Bugaled Breizh was sunk by an accident with a submarine can explain a number of unusual observations. The ship apparently sank very rapidly, there was no launching of any rescue boat, and the help signal was brief, without giving the coordinates. The trawler line of the ship was drawn out on the port side in contrast to the starboard one. The long cable is also reported to have traces of titanium; it has been proposed that this originates from the surface of a submarine. NATO documents have been declassified and were released to the French judiciary. The Minister of Defense Michèle Alliot- Marie indicated to the National Assembly that the information she had did not allow her to suspect a submarine as the cause of the accident. She indicated that the British and French authorities had cooperated and provided a list of all their ships and submarines in the area of interest. Also, the titanium issue was considered trivial as titanium dioxide is a common pigment of marine paint including the one used for Bugaled Breizh. The report of the French Marine Accident Investigation Office (Bureau d'enquêtes sur les événements de mer or BEAmer) was published on 27 November 2006 and examined a number of possible causes; it rejected the proposition that fishing lines got entangled with a military submarine and concluded that \\"the hypothesis that the fishing line got buried in a sandbank is more consistent with the evidence.\\" However, the hypothesis of a fishing accident was received with skepticism by the fishing community. It believed that the governmental BEA — it is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transport — tried to avoid a diplomatic incident with the military and its allies. An analysis of the French Institute of Research for the Exploration of the Ocean subsequently rejected the proposition of BEAmer as impossible. Expert testimony indicated that a nuclear submarine that got entangled in the net of a trawler could pull down a vessel of about 250 tons within 80 seconds. A recent newspaper article states that an unnamed witness thought that British submarine Turbulent may have been involved in the ship's sinking. However Judge Brigette Lamy said she agreed with reports that the submarine was in Plymouth at the time. On 9 September 2015 the British Minister for the Armed Forces, Penny Mordaunt, recognised that a British submarine caught the trawl of the Irish fishing trawler \\"The Karen\\" on 15 April 2015, in an incident similar to that of the Bugaled Breizh.http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/38312 =Conclusion of inquiry without specific cause= On 31 July 2008, the judges Richard Foltzer and Muriel Corre, who had been charged with the inquiry into the sinking of Bugaled Breizh, after having received expert testimony, issued a statement that a \\"highly probable cause\\" that the vessel sank was as a result of an accident with a nuclear attack submarine.http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/fatal-trawler-probe-t-trace- culprit/story-11707990-detail/story.html However, they were unable to indicate which submarine was involved and indicated also the possibility that the accident may have been caused by the unidentified spy submarine or other technically feasible causes. As such the relatives of the dead sailors and the owner of the ship have not received any compensations. While other causes for the ship's loss are possible, this accident and others with a clearer attribution to nuclear submarines suggest that submarines operating in fishing zones represent a danger to fishing trawlers who when \\"catching\\" a submarine may be at significant risk of being pulled under. The Celtic League indicates that accidents with submarines may have accounted for the loss of more than 20 motorized fishing vessels since 1970 with the loss of over 150 sailors and demands better communication between the military and the civilian authorities.

In 1974, the monarchy was abolished by the Derg, a communist military junta. Early life and background Le'ul Dejazmach Mangasha Seyum was born in 1927 in Dengolat, a village in Enderta district, part of Tigray province of Ethiopia . He is the son of Ras Seyum Mangasha, the grandson of Ras Mangasha Yohannes, and the great grandson of Emperor Johannes IV. Yohannes IV was the only Emperor of the Tigrayan cadet branch of the Solomonic dynasty (being descended in female lines from Emperors Yohannes I and Eyasu I). Emperor Menelik II of Shoa came to power after the Battle of Metemma when Yohannes IV was killed and the male line of the Solomonic Dynasty was re-established on the Imperial throne. Mangasha Seyum is the heir to the Tigrean royal line and a rival to the Shoan emperor.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War, p. 396 Ras Mangasha Seyum's grandfather, Mangasha Yohannes was raised as the nephew of Yohannes IV. However Yohannes IV announced on his deathbed that Mangasha was his \\"natural\\" son and designated heir. It is still disputed among Tigrean royal descendants whether Mangasha Yohannes was indeed an actual son of Yohannes IV, or a nephew that Yohannes adopted on his deathbed in order to name him as his successor as his legitimate son Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes had died previously. There was a long-standing rivalry between the descendants of Ras Araya Selassie and Ras Mangasha Yohannes over the rule of Tigray and precedence. Her mother was Princess Adada (second wife of his father). In January 1949, Mangasha Seyum married one of Haile Selassie I's granddaughters, Princess Aida Desta. They are the parents of five sons Lij Michael Sehul, Lij Yohannes, Lij Stephanos, Lij Jalye, Lij Seyoum and a daughter Immabet Menen. Mengesha Seyum was also the father of the late Immabet Rebka from his first marriage to Abonesh Demisse cousin of Princess Atsede Asfaw who was also Mengesha Seyum's stepmother. Administrator and minister (1948–60) A photograph of Seyum Mangasha, second from left, taken on 18 April 1959 in Bonn, Germany. In 1948, at the age of 21, Mengesha, then known by the title of Leul Dejazmach, was appointed to his first government post as district governor of Ambo awrajja (then known as Hager Selam). As district governor Le'ul Dejazmach Mengesha developed the town's electricity supply, built the first secondary school, health clinics, bridges and roads, as well developing recreational and tourist infrastructure by building a road to Lake Wonchi, and modernizing the natural hot spring water baths in Ambo town. In 1952 he was appointed Governor-General of Arsi Province, serving until 1955. As governor he initiated the provision of potable water to the provincial capital of Asella, also modernized that city's hot water spring baths to increase tourism, and promoted the wool industry by organizing the distribution of the Merino breed of sheep and introducing modern wool weaving equipment. As Governor of Sidamo from 1955 to 1957, he promoted the coffee industry by establishing education and training programs for local farmers and enabling coffee merchants from Addis Ababa to set up processing plants in the province. In 1957 he was appointed Minister of Public Works in the cabinet of Prime Minister Ras Abebe Aregai. His tenure was marked in particular by progress in the aviation sector; he oversaw the construction of Bole International Airport, which replaced Lideta Airport as Addis Ababa's main international gateway. As Chairman of Ethiopian Airlines, he negotiated civil air transport agreements on behalf of Ethiopian Airlines with the governments of West Germany, Liberia, Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Guinea, and opened Africa's first jet maintenance facility as well as the first civilian Pilot Training School and Hostess Training Institute for flight attendants. He also played a major role in the establishment of the Ethiopian Tourism Organization, renegotiated the contract for the Franco-Ethiopian railway, and built an oil refinery in Asseb. During his tenure a bridge was built over the Blue Nile near Bahir Dar connecting the provinces of Begemder and Gojam. Governor of Tigray (1960–74) After his father was murdered during the unsuccessful 1960 coup against Emperor Haile Selassie Mengesha Seyoum was elevated to the title of Leul Ras and became Prince and Governor of Tigray. He governed from his capital in Mek'ele and held this position until 1974 when the monarchy was abolished. Bridge over Giba river, built by order of Mengesha Seyoum in the 1960s He kept strong connections with Tembien from where his family originated: he participated yearly in the annual patron’s day at Abune Aregawi church in Zeyi which his grandfather Yohannes IV had built. He also ordered to build a road and a bridge linking Dogu'a Tembien and Inderta. At the time of his reign he was much criticised for his authoritarianism. While nowadays public opinion remembers him by his road building activities or start of the first modern soil conservation, the rural people are well aware of the plight of their ancestors during feudality. Opposition, exile, and later life Leul Ras Mengesha and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in February 2019. In October 1974, after the monarchy was toppled, representatives of the Derg ordered Seyum Mangasha to the capital to face charges of corruption, but instead he fled to the hills. There Mengesha Seyoum helped to found a group that eventually became the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU). His wife, Princess Aida Desta, and his daughter were arrested by the Derg in 1974. Although his daughter would eventually escape abroad, his wife remained in prison for 14 years. The EDU was a conservative and pro-monarchy and is the oldest of the Ethiopian political parties. The EDU later merged with the Ethiopian Democratic Party and formed the Ethiopian Democratic Unity Party (EDUP), which later was one of the parties that joined to form the United Ethiopian Democratic Forces, one of the two largest opposition parties in Ethiopia. In 2000, the EDU reorganized in Addis Ababa as a legal opposition party after the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front led the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front to power. Leul Ras Mengesha has retreated from all involvement in the political affairs of this party and its successor organizations. Leul Ras Mengesha Seyoum lives partly in Addis Ababa, and partly in the Washington D.C. area of the USA. His wife of more than 60 years, Princess Aida died on January 15, 2013 in Alexandria, Virginia. He maintains a close relationship with his children, nine grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. He is regarded as the senior surviving nobleman of the Ethiopian Empire, and the senior Prince of a cadet branch of the Imperial dynasty. Although for a significant period during the 1970s and 1980s he was regarded as a possible candidate for the succession by many monarchists, in 1989 he accepted and recognized the proclamation of Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen as Emperor in Exile of Ethiopia under the name Amha Selassie. Leul Ras Mengesha was prominent at the funerals of Emperor in Exile Amha Selassie, the reburial of Emperor Haile Selassie, Princess Tenagnework (who was his mother- in-law) and Empress Medferiashwork. With the death of Emperor Amha Selassie, Leul Ras Mengesha is considered the elder member of the extended Imperial family, and at public events where members of the Imperial family appear, such as royal funerals, is given precedence over all male members of the family except Crown Prince Zera Yacob Amha Selassie. In February 2019 he was appointed to the National Reconciliation Commission.

Traditionally, a tent peg is improvised from a section of a small tree branch, if possible with a small side branch cut off to leave a hook, driven into the ground narrower end first. Tent peg use A wooden stake supporting a tent. Delta (dog-leg) Peg A tent will typically be pegged to the ground by a combination of both direct attachment to the tent's material and via ropes. Tent pegs are used to help maintain the tent's shape, and to hold the tent in place against wind. Tent pegs are preferably pushed into the ground by hand. However, hard ground, or bigger tent pegs, will require a tent peg mallet to drive them into the ground. A tent peg provides the greatest holding ability when it is inserted into the ground so that the point of attachment of the rope is at ground level. This minimises the rope's ability to apply leverage to the tent peg, which can loosen or pull the tent peg from the ground. Above, the emphasis is on leverage and in recent years a new type of tent peg has been developed which eliminates leverage. The addition of an arm at the top of the peg enables the tension to be directed to a point beneath the ground where the soil is firm. The peg is 'balanced' with little or no leverage (moment). This new peg style presents a greater surface area to resist tension in guys. Types of tent pegs A variety of tent pegs. Tent pegs come in wide variety of shapes, sizes, and materials. The type of tent peg best suited to a tent will be determined by several factors, such as: *the type of ground where the tent is to be used, for example, snow, soft soil, sand, hard or rocky soil, etc., and hence the gripping or holding strength of the ground versus the ease of penetrating the ground *the size of the tent, and hence the weight of material to be kept in shape, and the wind load *the weather conditions when the tent is to be used, primarily affecting the wind load on the tent *the weight of the tent peg, bearing on the ability for the tent to be transported, often in backpacks =Characteristics of tent pegs= Better quality tent pegs will have symmetrical tips, either conical or \\"V\\" shaped, to ensure that they can be driven into the ground without veering off alignment. They will also typically have hook extensions to allow the end of the hook to be also driven into the ground, providing a second ground contact point, to reduce the risk that the peg may turn in the ground under tension and allow the rope it is holding to slip off the hook. Other styles of tent pegs have fully formed eyes through which the rope is passed so that the rope cannot come off the peg no matter in which direction the peg is oriented. The Delta (or dog-leg) shape peg always points toward the tent and can never turn. The guy is partially buried and cannot slip off the hook. Delta shaped pegs lie level with the soil offering maximum safety. The rope pulls against the ground rather than levering a straight peg at one end. Metal delta pegs can be springy, absorbing wind shocks. File:Hering klein.jpgA light gauge pressed metal tent peg, with rope and mallet. File:Hering gross.jpgA heavy gauge pressed metal tent peg, with heavier rope and metal hatchet used as a mallet. File:Tältspik.svgA range of tent peg profiles. File:Zeltnagel.jpgA wire rod tent peg, with rope and mallet. File:Hering rot.jpgA narrower plastic tent peg in softer soil, with rope and mallet. Some types of tent pegs are made from flat material pressed into a shallow \\"V\\" shape cross section. This type of tent peg relies on the broadness of the section to not turn under tension. A wooden tent peg used in snow. Tent peg types and styles may typically vary in length from 150mm to 490mm, and in thickness from 1.6 mm to 3.2 mm for flat section tent pegs and from 4 mm to 11.2 mm for wire rod tent pegs. Smaller wire tent pegs are also available, especially where weight is critical. Plastic tent pegs are typically very wide and longer than metal pegs, and are used for softer ground types, sand and light soils. Ultralight U shaped aluminum alloy tent pegs used in snow and sand, each peg around 0.1 lbs. There are two ways to use this peg, one is to nail the tent peg into sand or snow, head outward towards your tent and at 45 degree to the ground, tie to the head area. The second is laying the tent peg flat and burying it into sand or snow, tie its cord to the middle hole. Heavy duty tent pegs may be made from angle iron from 2.5mm to 5mm thick, and have the hook welded into the open side of the angle, meaning that the open angle faces the tent, bracing the open angle of the tent peg against the tension. =Materials= Tent pegs may be manufactured from steel rod or wire, pressed flat steel, aluminium section, titanium alloy, angle iron, plastic, polycarbonate, polypropylene, polystyrene, or ABS plastic. Steel tent pegs are typically zinc plated or stainless steel. Untreated metal tent pegs are available. Carbon fibre metal tipped tent pegs are also manufactured. Wooden tent pegs are now not common, with higher strength to weight ratio, and high durability, materials being used instead. Tent pegs in history and society Roman iron tent pegs of 2nd/3rd century AD Armies on the move have often used tents for sleeping accommodation overnight. A tactic used by an opposing force was to initiate an attack by riding on horse back at speed through an army's tents knocking the tent pegs out of the ground thereby collapsing tents on the enemy as they slept providing a means to hinder the enemy while a more direct attack took place. This practice has now developed into a stylised equestrian sport in various forms called tent pegging. =Improvised use of tent pegs= The Book of Judges provides the story of Jael, the wife of Heber, a Kenite tentmaker in which Jael kills Sisera by driving a tent peg through his temple as he sleeps. (4:21) Tent pegs have also been used as murder weapons in recent history, for example in the murder of Billie-Jo Jenkins. Other uses of tent pegs are as improvised climbing pitons, for example in the siege of the Sogdian Rock and Jean-Christophe Lafaille's self rescue on Annapurna.

Mobius has produced hundreds of original works which have received favorable reviews in Boston, nationally and internationally. Works created at Mobius have been presented throughout the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. It has a long-standing commitment to artist-exchange projects, which bring artists from different regions together to work. International exchange projects with artists from Macedonia, Croatia, Poland, and Taiwan have focused on site-specific works in public places.Cate McQuaid, \\"Showcasing the unique world of performance art\\". Boston Globe, November 1, 2006 Retrieved 2011-10-08. Mobius has presented work involving thousands of artists over its 30-year history and is recognized as one of the seminal alternative, artist- run organizations in the U.S. It inspired the creation of other experimental artist-run performance spaces in Boston, including Bad Girrls Studios. The MAG has undergone several changes over its 30-year history, but has retained an experimental inter-media emphasis and continues to function as an artist- managed organization. The group's membership has changed, with new members joining and older members leaving every year or two (although several members have been with the group either from the beginning or from the 1980s. There are generally between 12 and 20 members, with performance art, new music/sound art, installation, dance/movement, and video/film the disciplines most often represented. Since the mid-1990s, site-specific performance and installation works have become an increasingly important element of MAG members’ works and the group has fostered international connections, serving as a locus for international exchange. History The company's theater pieces were directed by Marilyn Arsem (a faculty member of the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston),SMFA Boston Retrieved 2011-10-08. and were based on 1970s experimental theatre. They generally used texts written by others, but developed then collaboratively as a basis for structured improvisation. With a strong emphasis on the physical presence and stamina of their performers, the pieces were presented in the real (or actual) time shared with the audience (in contrast to “theatrical” time). The group's name came from a characteristic aspect of theater pieces of that era. “Audience-activated performance pieces” were those in which structured audience input was crucial in determining aspects of a performance, including its length. This differed from audience participation as it is usually understood. In Persephone and Hades, for example, performances could be as brief as one hour or as long as three hours (or more), depending on an audience's desire (and endurance). The cyclical nature of these early pieces suggested a Möbius strip. Between 1980 and 1983, Mobius Theater rented fifth-floor loft space on Kingston Street in Boston's Chinatown district. This space did not satisfy building-code requirements for public presentation; for example, it only had DC electricity, so in order to use any equipment, AC electricity was provided by an upstairs neighbor who ran an extension cord down to the space from his own loft. As a result, the Kingston Street space was used for workshop performances and audiences solicited privately by mail. Public performances were given at spaces such as the Helen Shlien Gallery in the nearby Fort Point neighborhood, the Massachusetts College of Art and Design’s Overland Street theater, and two spaces in Boston's Leather District Gallery East and the South Street Loft. The private workshop performances featured monthly works-in-progress in which members of the company and invited artists showed their own developing works and stages in the theater's group work, followed by an audience discussion (an uncommon presentation format during the early 1980s). MAG continued to present works-in-progress into the 21st century; the format expanded to include movement works-in-progress and student works, featuring pieces by area college students. By 1983 the above-mentioned public-performance spaces had all disappeared or were in danger of doing so. In response to this situation Helen Shlien, who was closing her Fort Point gallery space, offered to help Mobius Theater obtain a lease to that space. At that time the Fort Point neighborhood was an area of neglected warehouses, colonized by what became in its time the largest artists' community in New England. As often happens with such areas, artists turned empty lofts into live/work spaces (legally or illegally), with landlords turning a blind eye in return for increased neighborhood stability. Helen Shlien was a pioneer in the presentation of installation work and performance art; without her advocacy, the development of such art in the Boston area would have been impaired, and the Mobius Artists Group would not have enjoyed the longevity it achieved. Mobius Theater changed its name to Mobius, Inc. at this time, partly to avoid identifying the new space with a specific medium. Mobius, Inc. opened a performance/gallery space (named Mobius) in summer 1983. The move was celebrated by a five-hour, multi-location piece (Orpheus), which began in the Kingston Street loft and ended in the former Shlien gallery space. Mobius remained at 354 Congress Street in Fort Point for 20 years, closing in June 2003. In 1984, Mobius Inc. changed its name to Mobius Performing Group (MPG); its membership changed to include those self-identified as performance artists, in addition to those self-identified as experimental-theater artists. The work presented by MPG had already branched out to include works created and performed by individual group members, in addition to those conceived and directed by Arsem. In addition (due to relationships formed in the Orpheus project), collaborations with experimental artists from other disciplines were featured. In 1987, MPG decided to open its membership to artists outside the theater/performance art field and its name changed to Mobius Artists Group. MAG presented work in a wide range of media by artists ranging from local to international. Nevertheless, the group's primary focus was on the local/regional (Boston/eastern New England) experimental arts scene, with the Mobius space a resource for development. The space remained artist-run; although the group has had paid staff during its history, its directors have always been members of the artists' group. This has given the Group autonomy in organizational direction, at the cost of volunteer effort and personal responsibility. For many, being a MAG member meant hard work for long periods (especially during the group's 20 years in Fort Point. At its zenith Mobius presented performances and installation nearly every week, ten months out of the year. Staff and group members had extensive contact with guest artists, including liaison and the review of proposals. The ArtRages fundraising parties, which began in the late 1990s and continued through 2007, were the high point of the Mobius programming year. The parties featured multiple simultaneous performances and installations with music by area bands and musicians, and served as community events. Mobius published a print newsletter, in which the artists scheduled to present their work spoke for themselves. The ability of artists to communicate to a range of readers through writing varied widely, resulting in an unevenness in the quality of newsletter entries. Still, the newsletter allowed a direct presentation of artists’ voices. During the late 1980s, Mobius, Inc. developed exchange programs with other art spaces and artists’ organizations. In these programs, artists from the partner organizations would present work either at Mobius or at other spaces (in programs produced by Mobius). In turn, MAG members visited the partner organizations. The first exchanges in the United States included partnerships with the 911 Media Arts Center (Seattle), The LAB (San Francisco), the Pyramid Art Center (Rochester, NY) and NO BIAS (Bennington, Vermont). By the mid-1990s these exchanges had become global; many group members became part of an informal, extensive network of international performance artists. Major international exchange projects include: *1996–1997: Liquor Amnii—an exchange with women artists from Macedonia in cooperation with Skopsko Leto (Skopje, Macedonia) and the Convergence Festival (Providence, Rhode Island) *1999–2000: Usvajanje Slobode (\\"Taking Liberty\\"), an exchange with artists in Istria, Croatia *2001–2002: \\"Digging the Channel\\" (), an exchange with artists in Zadar, Croatia *2003: Juliiett 484, an exchange with artists in Ustka and Gdansk, Poland (in the United States, work was presented in Providence, Boston, and New York) These exchanges reached a high point with the Mobius International Festival of Performance Art, a five-night series of performances presented in Boston in November 2006. This festival featured over 20 international artists and the work of every member of the Artists Group (then numbering 15). In addition to organizational exchanges, individual group members have been invited to present work in over two dozen countries including Taiwan, Argentina, Canada and Germany. In 2003, Mobius Inc.’s lease with the Boston Wharf Company expired. Mobius had benefited from its membership in the Fort Point Artists Community and its relationship with Boston Wharf, receiving 20 years of below-market-rate leases in commercial space. In the meantime, however, the Fort Point area had become highly desirable for urban development. Despite many years of activism and organization, artists were forced out of the area; buildings were either commercially redeveloped or destroyed. Mobius concluded its tenure at 354 Congress Street with Mobius 25, a two-week festival of performances and exhibits of visual art work by MAG members and friends dating back to Mobius Theater. From 2003 to 2007, the Mobius Artists Group was itinerant. The group occupied two office/meeting spaces in Fort Point, but there was no full-time usable space available for the presentation of artwork. It continued to work in donated or affordable space in the Boston area and overseas, with individual and group projects presented regionally and internationally. The search for a new full-time, permanent space continued. While there was some benefit in discovering different places for the development of artwork, the hunt for space and negotiation of terms precluded long-term planning efforts. In summer 2007, Mobius moved to 725 Harrison Ave. (in Boston’s South End neighborhood) in the ArtBlock development, near the Boston Medical Center (formerly City Hospital), on the outskirts of a thriving artists’ neighborhood. In June 2011, Mobius moved to 55 Norfolk Street in Central Square, Cambridge. The Artists Group (which numbered 23 on January 1, 2012) retains its commitment to presenting new work in a variety of media. MAG also continues its relationship with area performance students, primarily through personal relationships with the Performance Area of the School of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In 2010, members of the Mobius Artists Group were invited By Grace Exhibition Space of Brooklyn, NY to take part in \\"INFILTRATE!\\", a festival of performance art at the Fountain NY Art Fair on Pier 66. In January 2012, the Mobius Artists Group were invited to perform for the opening reception and first two weeks of \\"100 Years (version #4 Boston, 2012)\\" organized by MoMA PS1 in collaboration with Performa. The Exhibition was curated by Klaus Biesenbach, MoMA PS1 Director and MoMA Chief Curator at Large; and RoseLee Goldberg, Performa Director and Curator. At the Boston University Art Gallery, the exhibition was coordinated by Director and Chief Curator Kate McNamara.

In medicine, desmoplasia is the growth of fibrous or connective tissue. It is also called desmoplastic reaction to emphasize that it is secondary to an insult. Desmoplasia may occur around a neoplasm, causing dense fibrosis around the tumor, or scar tissue (adhesions) within the abdomen after abdominal surgery. Desmoplasia is usually only associated with malignant neoplasms, which can evoke a fibrosis response by invading healthy tissue. Invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast often have a scirrhous, stellate appearance caused by desmoplastic formations. Terminology Desmoplasia originates from the Ancient Greek δεσμός desmos, \\"knot\\", \\"bond\\" and πλάσις plasis, \\"formation\\". It is usually used in the description of desmoplastic small round cell tumors. Neoplasia is the medical term used for both benign and malignant tumors, or any abnormal, excessive, uncoordinated, and autonomous cellular or tissue growth. Desmoplastic reaction to breast cancer Desmoplasia refers to growth of dense connective tissue or stroma. This growth is characterized by low cellularity with hyalinized or sclerotic stroma and disorganized blood vessel infiltration. This growth is called a desmoplastic response and occurs as result of injury or neoplasia. This response is coupled with malignancy in non-cutaneous neoplasias, and with benign or malignant tumors if associated with cutaneous pathologies. The heterogeneity of tumor cancer cells and stroma cells combined with the complexities of surrounding connective tissue suggest that understanding cancer by tumor cell genomic analysis is not sufficient; analyzing the cells together with the surrounding stromal tissue may provide more comprehensive and meaningful data. =Normal tissue structure and wound response= Normal tissues consist of parenchymal cells and stromal cells. The parenchymal cells are the functional units of an organ, whereas the stromal cells provide the structure of the organ and secrete extracellular matrix as supportive, connective tissue. In normal epithelial tissues, epithelial cells, or parenchymal cells of epithelia, are highly organized, polar cells. These cells are separated from stromal cells by a basement membrane that prevents these cell populations from mixing. A mixture of these cell types is recognized, normally, as a wound, as in the example of a cut to the skin. Metastasis is an example of a disease state in which a breach of the basement membrane barrier occurs. Cancer Micrographs of loose, moderate and dense desmoplastic stroma in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, as seen with H&E; stain (top row), Masson's trichrome stain (middle row) and α-smooth muscle actin. Cancer begins as cells that grow uncontrollably, usually as a result of an internal change or oncogenic mutations within the cell. Cancer develops and progresses as the microenvironment undergoes dynamic changes. The stromal reaction in cancer is similar to the stromal reaction induced by injury or wound repair: increased ECM and growth factor production and secretion, which consequently cause growth of the tissue. In other words, the body reacts similarly to a cancer as it does to a wound, causing scar-like tissue to be built around the cancer. As such, the surrounding stroma plays a very important role in the progression of cancer. The interaction between cancer cells and surrounding tumor stroma is thus bidirectional, and the mutual cellular support allows for the progression of the malignancy. =Growth factors for vascularization, migration, degradation, proliferation= Stroma contains extracellular matrix components such as proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans which are highly negatively charged, largely due to sulfated regions, and bind growth factors and cytokines, acting as a reservoir of these cytokines. In tumors, cancer cells secrete matrix degrading enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that, once cleaved and activated, degrade the matrix, thereby releasing growth factors that signal for the growth of cancer cells. MMPs also degrade ECM to provide space for vasculature to grow to the tumor, for the tumor cells to migrate, and for the tumor to continue to proliferate. =Underlying mechanisms= Desmoplasia is thought to have a number of underlying causes. In the reactive stroma hypothesis, tumor cells cause the proliferation of fibroblasts and subsequent secretion of collagen. The newly secreted collagen is similar to that of collagen in scar formation – acting as a scaffold for infiltration of cells to the site of injury. Furthermore, the cancer cells secrete matrix degrading enzymes to destroy normal tissue ECM thereby promoting growth and invasiveness of the tumor. Cancer associated with a reactive stroma is typically diagnostic of poor prognosis. The tumor-induced stromal change hypothesis claims that tumor cells can dedifferentiate into fibroblasts and, themselves, secrete more collagen. This was observed in desmoplastic melanoma, in which the tumor cells are phenotypically fibroblastic and positively express genes associated with ECM production. However, benign desmoplasias do not exhibit dedifferentiation of tumor cells. =Characteristics of desmoplastic stromal response= A desmoplastic response is characterized by larger stromal cells with increased extracellular fibers and immunohistochemically by transformation of fibroblastic-type cells to a myofibroblastic phenotype. Myofibroblastic cells in tumors are differentiated from fibroblasts for their positive staining of smooth-muscle actin (SMA). Furthermore, an increase in total fibrillar collagens, fibronectins, proteoglycans, and tenascin C are distinctive of the desmoplastic stromal response in several forms of cancer. Expression of tenascin C by breast cancer cells has been demonstrated to allow for metastasis to the lungs and cause the expression of tenascin C by the surrounding tumor stromal cells. In addition, tenascin C is found extensively in pancreatic tumor desmoplasia as well. Differentiation of scars While scars are associated with the desmoplastic response of various cancers, not all scars are associated with malignant neoplasms. Mature scars are usually thick, collagenous bundles arranged horizontally with paucicellularity, vertical blood vessels, and no appendages. This is distinguished from desmoplasia in the organization of the tissue, the appendages, and orientation of blood vessels. Immature scars are more difficult to distinguish due to their neoplastic origins. These scars are hypercellular with fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and some immune cells present. The immature scars can be distinguished from desmoplasia by immunohistochemical staining of biopsied tumors that will reveal the type and organization of cells present as well as whether recent trauma has occurred to the tissue. ExamplesBenign condition examples= Desmoplasia around surgical suture material. #Desmoplastic melanocytic naevus #Desmoplastic spitz naevus #Desmoplastic cellular blue naevi #Desmoplastic hairless hypopigmented naevus #Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma #Desmoplastic trichilemmoma #Desmoplastic tumor of the follicular infundibulum #Sclerotic dermatofibroma #Desmoplastic fibroblastoma #Desmoplastic cellular neurothekeoma #Sclerosing perineurioma #Microvenular haemangioma #Immature scars =Malignant condition examples= #Desmoplastic malignant melanoma #Desmoplastic squamous cell carcinoma #Morpheaform basal cell carcinoma #Microcystic adnexal carcinoma #Cutaneous leiomyosarcoma #Cutaneous metastasis =Prostate cancer= The stroma of the prostate is characteristically muscular. Due to this muscularity, detecting the myofibroblastic phenotypic change indicative of reactive stroma is difficult in an examination of patient pathologic slides. A diagnosis of reactive stroma associated with prostate cancer is one of poor prognosis. =Breast cancer= Clinical presentation of a lump in the breast is histologically viewed as a collagenous tumor or desmoplastic response created by myofibroblasts of the tumor stroma. Proposed mechanisms of activation of myofibroblasts are by immune cytokine signaling, microvascular injury, or paracrine signaling by tumor cells.

Supernova impostors are stellar explosions that appear at first to be a supernova but do not destroy their progenitor stars. As such, they are a class of extra-powerful novae. They are also known as Type V supernovae, Eta Carinae analogs, and giant eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBV).  Appearance, origin and mass loss  Supernova impostors appear as remarkably faint supernovae of spectral type IIn—which have hydrogen in their spectrum and narrow spectral lines that indicate relatively low gas speeds. These impostors exceed their pre-outburst states by several magnitudes, with typical peak absolute visual magnitudes of −11 to −14, making these outbursts as bright as the most luminous stars. The trigger mechanism of these outbursts remains unexplained, though it is thought to be caused by violating the classical Eddington luminosity limit, initiating severe mass loss. If the ratio of radiated energy to kinetic energy is near unity, as in Eta Carinae, then we might expect an ejected mass of about 0.16 solar masses.  Examples  Possible examples of supernova impostors include the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae, P Cygni, SN 1961V, SN 1954J, SN 1997bs, SN 2008S in NGC 6946, and SN 2010dn where detections of the surviving progenitor stars are claimed.

Plot Veer Pratap Singh (Salman Khan) is a Pindari prince and the son of the great Pindari warrior, Prithvi Singh (Mithun Chakraborty), who was known for his great battles to free India from British rule. Veer wishes to continue his father's legacy by leading a movement of Pindaris against the British in order to free both the Rajasthani Kingdom of Madhavghar and the rest of India from the great colonial power. Veer receives the help of his younger brother, Punya Singh (Sohail Khan) in gathering an army. However Veer finds opposition from the King of Madhavghar, Gyanendra Singh (Jackie Shroff), who sees Veer as a threat to Madhavghar and his rule and orders for Veer to be killed. Veer and Punya along with their supporters go into hiding within the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, while Singh makes an alliance with the British Governor of Rajasthan, James Fraser (Tim James Lawrence), saying that Madhavghar will support the British in crushing the Pindari movement and eliminating Veer. To keep stakes high, the Pindaris kidnap Singh's daughter Princess Yashodhara (Zareen Khan), who Veer finds himself in love with. The Pindaris then make a failed attempt to take down Singh's palace by surprise. However Singh's spies discover the plan and thousands of Pindari warriors are slaughtered. Veer fails to get his revenge on the corrupt King but knows that Punya has been captured by Yashodhara's brother Gajendra (Puru Raaj Kumar) as Veer runs in to save his brother and kills Gajendra's men but Gajendra is killed to when he gets punched by Veer and lands on a sword which Gyanendra seeks revenge for his son. In the meantime, Lady Angela Fraser (Lisa Lazarus), wife of James Fraser, begins to question her husband's actions as he supports the evil king in slaughtering members of the Pindari movement. Fraser refuses to back down from his campaign of crushing the movement. After Veer promises his father that he will finish Singh, he gatecrashes Yashodhara's Swayamvara. As he takes the princess away from the fort, Gyanendra Singh sees a vast army of Pindaris has surrounded his fort. He asks the British to help him but they refuse and make the Pindaris their ally in a bid to escape from Madhavghar.

At that time, Khan planned to direct the film himself and cast Sanjay Dutt in the lead role. Veer is also partly based on the Russian novel Taras Bulba by Nikolai Gogol. For his role as Veer, Salman Khan went on a special diet and worked out with a personal trainer. For her role as a 19th-century princess, Zarine Khan put on eight kilos of extra weight. Principal photography for Veer began on 1 December 2008. Portions of the film were originally scheduled to be shot at the College of Engineering and the Agricultural College in Pune, but due to the swine flu outbreak the locations were moved to Mumbai. Other location shooting took place in Jaipur and Bikaner. Location shooting at Amber Fort in Jaipur was also interrupted when several onlookers were injured and the Rajasthan High Court ordered a halt to filming. A case was filed against Anil Sharma accusing the film crew of damaging the fort, violating several conservation laws and causing the structure's 500-year-old roof to collapse. The crew finished their shoot after paying Rs. 2 million in damages. Rochester Castle appears as a backdrop for a musical sequence named 'Everytime I look into your eyes I see my paradise' featuring a horse and carriage. The Chatham Dockyard provided the setting for many of the montage shots used in the UK dance sequences as well as the location where Veer first meets Yuvraji Yashodhara. On 23 January 2010, author Pavan Chaudhary filed a Rs. 2 million suit against Khan, Anil Sharma and producer Vijay Kumar Galani, alleging that the film borrowed elements from his novel, Trilogy of Wisdom. The suit called for a halt of the film's screenings. Marketing The trailer of Veer was released on 27 November 2009 at the screening of Priyadarshan's De Dana Dan. ReceptionCritical reception= The movie was generally panned by critics. Taran Adarsh criticized the writing and direction of the movie, describing it as a colossal disappointment.

This monthly publication covers health, disability rights, adaptive technology and lifestyle topics such as recreation, travel, the arts, relationships, sexuality, parenting, employment and home modification. It also profiles successful wheelchair users, including John Hockenberry, Christopher Voelker, Brooke Ellison, Chantal Petitclerc and the late Christopher Reeve. New Mobility, currently edited by Tim Gilmer, received an Utne Independent Press Award for Lifestyle Coverage in 2006.Utne Reader Independent Press Awards 2006 History New Mobility was founded in 1989 in Boulder, Colorado, by Sam Maddox to provide information about life after spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, post-polio sequelae and other disabling conditions. Originally titled, Spinal Network Extra, the then-quarterly magazine was a spin-off of the 1987 book Spinal Network: The Total Resource for the Wheelchair Community. Maddox edited New Mobility until 1991, when Barry Corbet, a paraplegic from a spinal cord injury, took the helm. The title was changed to New Mobility for the Summer 1992 issue. In 1993, the magazine temporarily ceased publication. Miramar Publishing (later Miramar Communications) bought the title and relaunched it in 1994. It became bimonthly in 1995 and monthly in 1996. In 1998, No Limits Communications acquired the magazine. In 2000, Corbet retired, and Gilmer, also paraplegic, began his tenure. In 2010, United Spinal Association bought New Mobility and continues to publish it monthly. The Niche Early disability titles tended to reflect what is known as the medical model of disability, which emphasized the need for cures and referred to people with disabilities as \\"patients\\". New Mobility defined its social model of disability point of view with a lifestyle-oriented approach, inclusion mentality and people-first language. It was also one of the first periodicals to seriously address sexuality and disability, and its provocative role in this area has been recognized by the Los Angeles Times,John Young Lecture by Barry Corbet and subsequently the Associated Press.Sex and the Disabled: Still a Taboo Topic The magazine sums up its place in the field of disability journalism with the tagline \\"Life Beyond Wheels\\".

He has taught in elementary school, (New Haven CT), high school (New York, NY), and college (Wagner College, Staten Island, NY) and in the mid-1970s he also earned money playing his lute in a classical music restaurant/bar. He worked for six years (1981-1987) as a corporate strategist and product development director with the Boston Consulting Group, and six years (1993-1999) for Bankers Trust on Wall St., where he created game-based training for financial traders, and started an internal division, Corporate Gameware, later spun out as games2train.  Focus and research  Prensky's professional focus is on K-12 education reform. His books address tools (Digital Game-Based Learning), pedagogy (Teaching Digital Natives), curriculum (The World Needs a New Curriculum) and the entire k-12 system (Education to Better Their World.) Prensky is a strong advocate for listening more carefully to what students say about their own education. In his speaking engagements he has conducted approximately 100 student panels in 40 countries. He has been named a \\"guiding star of the new parenting movement\\" by Parental Intelligence Newsletter.  Criticism  Bax (2011) has written that Prensky's views are simplistic, that his terminology is open to challenge and that his claim that educators should simply alter their approach to suit young people who are 'digital natives' ignores essential elements of the nature of learning and good pedagogy. The Economist (2010) questioned whether the designation of the 'digital native' has any real-world usefulness. Prensky responds that: ”The distinction between digital natives and digital immigrants is important because it is more cultural than technology-knowledge-based. ‘Digital Immigrants’ grew up in a non-digital, pre-Internet culture before they experienced the digital one. ‘Digital Natives’ know only the digital culture.” Prensky further argues that “the fields of education and pedagogy have today become needlessly and painfully over-complicated, ignoring our students’ (and our world’s) real needs. It is time to reassess what good and effective teaching means in a digital age and how to combine what is important from the past with the tools of the future.\\" Prensky argues that “despite recent influxes of technology into schools, not enough attention is being paid to the full implications of all the important recent changes in our educational environment and context”.

It was recorded during four days in August 1976 and features a septet fronted by three reed players, which were in part multiplied through overdubs. On one track Tyner is heard picking a dulcimer backed by tablas, evoking the sound of an Indian sitar. \\"Parody\\" is a duo by McCoy Tyner and Eric Gravatt on drums. The album was digitally mastered at Fantasy Studios in 1999 and re-released on Original Jazz Classics. Reception \\"Focal Point looks to secure the firepower in the studio which the band generated in concert\\", write Cook and Morton in their Penguin Guide to Jazz, but arguing that the overdubbing of the horns would \\"sometimes lead[] to stiffness in the ensemble sound\\". Nevertheless they \\"were a little surprised to find how well it's aged\\". The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states \\"Because virtually all of McCoy Tyner's records are superior examples of modal-oriented jazz, this gem is merely an above-average effort\\".Yanow, S.

Most cases are characterised by GRM1 gene fusion or promoter swapping. It can be associated with a translocation at t(1;5)(p13;p13). A chondromyxoid fibroma (CMF) is an extremely rare benign cartilaginous neoplasm which accounts for < 1% bone tumours. Signs and symptoms Typically people present with progressive pain, often long standing and/or bony swelling and restricted range of movement in affected limb 3,12. The latter is most often the case in bones with little overlying soft tissues (e.g. short tubular bones of the hands and feet). Most chondromyxoid fibromas are located in the metaphyseal region of long bones (60%), and may extend to the epiphyseal line and even rarely abut the articular surface 3,12. They are almost never just epiphyseal 3. The classical site is the upper 1/3rd of tibia ( which accounts for 25% of all cases) with the small tubular bones of the foot, the distal femur and pelvis being other relatively common locations 12. Rarely occur in the skull or skull base. Pathology The tumor comprises a variable combination on chondroid, myxoid, and fibrous tissue components organized in a pseudolobulated architecture 20. On gross examination they are typically seen as solid glistening tan-gray intraosseous masses. Occasional osteoclast-like giant multinucleated cells are encountered particularly at the periphery. Most cells are morphologically bland, and mitotic figures are rare or absent 13. DiagnosisRadiographic features= Plain film often seen as a lobulated, eccentric radiolucent lesion long axis parallel to long axis of long bone no periosteal reaction (unless a complicating fracture present) geographic bone destruction: almost 100% well defined sclerotic margin: 86% there can be presence of septations (pseudotrabeculation): 57% 2 there can be presence of matrix calcification in a small proportion of cases: 12.5%1 MRI MR features are often not particularly specific. Signal characteristics include T1 - low signal T1 C+ (Gd) - the majority (~70%) tend to show peripheral nodular enhancement ~ 30% diffuse contrast enhancement and this can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous 19 T2 - high signal Bone scan A scintigraphic \\"doughnut sign\\" has been described in this tumour type 11. However, this is very non-specific and can be found in a plethora of other bone lesions. Treatment  They are benign lesions and malignant degeneration is rare. They are usually treated with curettage which however have a high recurrence rate of 25%. As such if an en-bloc resection is possible this is advisable Epidemiology The majority of cases occur in the second and third decades, with approximately 75% of cases occurring before the age of 30 years 1,12-15. There is no recognised gender predilection. Examples have however been seen in patients up to the age of 75 years. In some series there is a male predilection 12 whilst in others no such distribution is found 2 References External links  Category:Osseous and chondromatous neoplasia ","title":"Chondromyxoid fibroma"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉 your wikipedia🥳")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",R,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const I=d(P,[["render",H]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/24.md","filePath":"drive/24.md"}'),F={name:"drive/24.md"},N=Object.assign(F,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(I)]))}});export{x as __pageData,N as default};
