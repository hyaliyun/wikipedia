The story is told in third person, usually from the viewpoint of Kay Dutch (aka Kay Altos) ‚Äî a professional bodyguard living in a post-war galaxy. The names of races, planets, and several leaders are borrowed from the computer game Master of Orion, although everything else in the trilogy is original, even the physical descriptions of several races. These harsh novels are unusual for Lukyanenko ‚Äî although heroes may evoke sympathy sometimes, none of them could be called positive. Strained action intertwines with insights on psychology of people living and succeeding in a nightmare. Plot summary The first novel, Line of Delirium, takes place decades after a devastating interstellar conflict ‚Äî the Vague War. While the reason for and details of the war remain largely unexplained, it is clear that almost every alien race was at some point involved in hostilities with the humans. The war was going badly for Earth, until two Earth officers decided to take matters into their own hands. Disobeying orders, they turned their fleet and headed for Earth, demanding the government's surrender. One of the officers, a man named Grey, established the Human Empire and became the emperor. His co- conspirator Lemak became the supreme commander of all human forces. While it is not exactly clear how the tide was turned, it is known that all races opposing the new empire were eventually beaten. Two of which, the cyborg Meklar and the ursine Bulrathi formed a subsequent pact with the humans ‚Äî the Trinary Alliance, creating a nearly unbeatable force (humans excel at ship-to- ship combat, Meklar are master engineers, and Bulrathi are superb ground combatants). Close to the end of the war, a man named Curtis van Curtis acquires an alien device he calls \\"aTan\\" (from athanatos, \\"immortal\\" [Greek: ŒëŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, literally, \\"without death\\"] ) giving immortality to anyone who can afford it. He formed the aTan company, which quickly became almost as powerful as the Human Empire (as some characters in the novel call it, \\"an empire within an empire\\"). The secret of the device is coveted by many, as the aTan company holds exclusive rights, with Emperor Grey's grudging approval (in exchange he gets free reincarnations). Kay Altos is a professional bodyguard whose homeworld was destroyed by the imperial forces after it was invaded by the Sakkra ‚Äî a fast-multiplying frog-shaped race, which was subsequently exterminated by the Empire. One fine morning he wakes up to face a teenager holding a gun, trying to avenge his sister's accidental death at Kay's hands. Kay's main problem ‚Äî he did not have time to pay for his next reincarnation. He tries to trick the kid but ends up dying anyway. He is surprised to find himself in an aTan facility on Terra ‚Äî the capital of the Empire with none other than Curtis van Curtis himself greeting him. Van Curtis hires Altos to safely bring his only son Arthur to an obscure planet known as Grail. Van Curtis's main concern is anyone finding out that Arthur is his son and kidnapping him in order to find out his father's secrets. Kay's payment should he succeed ‚Äî unlimited free reincarnations. His payment in case of failure ‚Äî eternal torture and executions. Kay agrees, and a backstory is created where Kay Ovald is a space merchant, travelling with his son Arthur, when their ship explodes. After reincarnating on a planet in the middle of a civil war, Imperial Security officer Isabella Kal recognizes Arthur and begins to chase him all over the Empire, even going as far as asking Admiral Lemak for help. Unfortunately for Arthur van Curtis and his bodyguard, Kal is not the only one seeking to stop them. A mysterious race known as the Silicoids seem to know of Arthur's mission to Grail and wish to prevent him from reaching his goal in order to preserve the galactic balance. Kay and Arthur board a luxury liner to the next planet on their way to Grail. Altos knows that, in all likelihood, Imperial Security is waiting for them at their destination. They manage to get passage on a shuttle, dropping off several passengers on a world close to their course. By a stroke of misfortune, that shuttle is stopped by a quarantine ship, and all passengers are secretly taken to a planet belonging to the Darloks ‚Äî an ancient race exceptional at espionage and sabotage. Kay and Arthur soon discover that the Darloks plan to turn them into their agents and also manage to learn the Darloks' true form (unlike Master of Orion, Darloks here are not shapeshifters but Goa'uld-like snake parasites). It is there that Kay first meets Viacheslav Shegal ‚Äî an agent of \\"Shield\\", Emperor's special forces. He helps Shegal commit suicide (to be reincarnated on a human world), so that the true nature of Darloks is known to all. Meanwhile, a massive Silicoid fleet arrives and proceeds to bombard the planet from orbit. Troops are sent in to retrieve Kay and Arthur and bring them before Sedimin ‚Äî the Foot of the Silicoid Basis (a rank equal to emperor). Sedimin wants to know the true mission that van Curtis entrusted to Arthur. It is on the Silicoid ship that Arthur finally reveals to Kay an awful truth ‚Äî he is not Curtis van Curtis's son. Arthur is a clone and, as such, has no rights under Imperial law. As Arthur puts it, \\"immortals need no heirs.\\" Since Arthur is being honest, Kay reveals that his true name is Kay Dutch and that he is a super ‚Äî a genetically engineered being with increased speed, strength, memory, and other characteristics much higher than a normal human. By law, Kay also has no rights, but his past was covered up by a senator who adopted him. While Arthur still hides his true mission goal from Kay, he reveals it to Sedimin, who decides to let them go. They are dropped off on Tauri ‚Äî a paradise planet for retired Imperial officers and their families. While Kay is out purchasing a ship, Arthur is kidnapped by Isabella Kal. Kay's determination to free Arthur is guided less by his obligation to his client than his friendship with the boy. His first destination, however, is the planet where he was killed prior to being recruited by van Curtis. He finds his killer, a teenager named Tommy Arano, and, instead of killing him, takes him to his hypership that was left on the planet. The next morning, Kay explains to Tommy that he is, in fact, Arthur van Curtis, whose mind was wiped by the Silicoids on one of his previous attempts to reach Grail. The mind-wiped Arthur was given to a human family to raise as their son, while another Arthur was reincarnated by \\"aTan\\" back on Terra because the machine assumed he died. Kay and Tommy then head to an Imperial planet almost entirely ruled by a crime syndicate known as 'the Family'. The Mother of the Family is his genetic sister, also created in a test tube. She uses the Family's resources to locate Arthur on a heavily defended Imperial station. She agrees to given them all they need to retrieve the boy: outfit their ship with a masking device, provide them with advanced power armor and weapons (including an \\"Excalibur\\" tachion rifle for Kay that shoots a full second before the trigger is pulled), and four soldiers ‚Äî two conditioned humans, a human cyborg, and a Meklar. Kay has himself souped-up with artificial enhancements (drastically shortening his lifespan). The strike group manages to infiltrate the base and fight their way to the medical wing, where Arthur is being tortured. Once Arthur is retrieved, they fight back to the ship, losing the two conditioned soldiers. In the hangar bay, Kay faces off against a Meklar working for Isabella Kal and is probably the first human (or almost-human) to pose a challenge to a twelve-foot-long mechanized reptile. Kay's Meklar companion clashes with the Imperial Security Meklar, giving the others time to escape. Once aboard his ship, Kay finds out that, due to his torture, Arthur is dying. Their only hope is to make it to Grail before he dies. When they finally make it Grail's orbit, another obstacle awaits them ‚Äî Admiral Lemak and Isabella Kal on an Imperial destroyer. While Kay is trying to find a way out, his ship's illegal AI makes its own decision and the ship into the destroyer's shields. While Kay, Tommy, and Arthur are being reincarnated in Grail's branch of aTan, Kal forces Lemak to have her shot, so that she can follow them. The two clones and the bodyguard manage to make it to Grail's Dead Zone ‚Äî an area on the planet where most mechanical devices fail for no apparent reason. It is there that Arthur finally reveals to Kay his true mission and the reason for van Curtis to have a clone: Curtis van Curtis did not obtain the \\"aTan\\" device from aliens. Van Curtis discovered Grail during the Vague War. There he found God or rather a being/machine that created the universe. God made van Curtis an offer ‚Äî a universe created based on his subconscious desires, just like this universe was created for someone else. Van Curtis asked for more time to think about it. God then gave van Curtis the knowledge to create a device allowing him to live forever. Finally, after many decades, Curtis van Curtis decides to find out how new universes are created and sell these universes to the public. Kay realizes that this would destroy the Empire and attempts to stop them, but finds out that neither Tommy and Arthur nor Curtis van Curtis (who suddenly appears) can be killed in the Dead Zone. Van Curtis takes Arthur and Tommy and leads them to the Threshold, but Tommy refuses and opts to leave with Kay instead. The novel ends as they both walk towards an uncertain future. Emperors of Illusions Book Cover Emperors of Illusions is the second novel, continuing the story of Kay Dutch as he travels with Tommy Arano, trying to stop Curtis van Curtis from destroying the Human Empire. They believe he is trying to do that to get back at the person he believes responsible for the creation of this universe ‚Äî Emperor Grey. The only way Kay thinks he can stop van Curtis is by killing the Emperor, a virtual impossibility. \\"Shadows of Dreams\\" is a short prequel to \\"Line of Delirium\\" that describes life on a small quiet human colony that is turned upside down when a Psilon battleship enters the system, still believing that the Vague War is on. The Psilons are the most advanced race in the galaxy, with only two or three troopers wearing power armor necessary to destroy an entire city. As the colonists prepare for a hopeless battle, one man reflects on his life thus far. Characters *Kay Dutch (AKA Kay Altos, AKA Kay Ovald) ‚Äî a super (genetically engineered human with superior physical and mental abilities). Under Imperial law, he has no rights, or rather he would have no rights if anyone knew his true origins. Kay was created on the Second Colony of the Shedar system. A senator adopted and raised him, erasing all records of his \\"birth\\". When Shedar was invaded by the Sakkra, most women and children were evacuated. His adopted parents chose to stay and fight. They were killed when the Emperor ordered the colonies nuked. Kay's physical superiority did not manifest until he was 16 (just like it was supposed to). He ran away to the circus and, when he was old enough, joined the Bodyguard League. At some point, he purchased a hyperboat and installed an AI (illegal) on it. Kay is proficient in many alien languages and has knowledge of alien customs and rituals. He is currently on his seventh life (i.e. resurrected six times). *Arthur van Curtis (AKA Arthur Ovald) ‚Äî a clone of Curtis van Curtis. To prevent Arthur's extermination under Imperial law, van Curtis falsified the records and made it appear as though Arthur was his son. While officially 16 years old, biologically Arthur is only 12, due to the fact that he has died 73 times. Arthur is quite proficient in jen' ‚Äî a relaxation and fighting technique. It also allows Arthur to stop his heart at will, in case he is captured and needs to escape via \\"aTan\\". *Tommy Arano ‚Äî Arthur van Curtis's double created by \\"aTan\\" and the Silicoids' mind-wipe techniques. He has no memory of his life prior to his 12th birthday. Secretly adopted by a human family who passed him off as their son, he lived the life of a normal teenager until the accidental death of his sister at Kay's hands. He killed Kay with a pain-inducing weapon and was shocked when the bodyguard returned several months later. When Kay explained the truth behind his origins, Tommy left with Kay to go save his double from ISB. When they reached Grail, Tommy refused to go with Curtis van Curtis and chose to stay with Kay. While his memories were erased, he does retain subconsciously everything Arthur learned before the wipe (e.g. he can perform jen' moves but does not know how to use them properly). *Curtis van Curtis ‚Äî the founder and owner of the aTan Corporation. During the war, he was one of many given a small raider ship and sent to perform guerilla attacks against the enemy. He returned with designs for the aTan device, supposedly purchased from the Psilons. Van Curtis is currently the second most powerful man in the Empire, after the Emperor, of course. He also must tread carefully, as many would like to know the secret to immortality and would go to extreme lengths to get it. *Isabella Kal ‚Äî an officer of the Imperial Security Bureau attached to the planet Incedios (or Insidious). She is loyal to the Emperor and is hateful of van Curtis and his \\"empire within the Empire\\". She gets her chance to prove her worth when she finds out that Arthur van Curtis is on Incedios. Before she can catch him, Kay and Arthur leave the planet, forcing her to go on an insane chase across the Empire and beyond to find the \\"immortal heir\\" and force the secrets out of him. *Louis Nomachi - ISB officer attached to Incedios. Isabella Kal is his immediate superior. He is the one who figures out the identity of Arthur van Curtis and informs his boss. After initially supporting Kal's plan to go after the young van Curtis personally and reap the rewards of immortality, Nomachi begins to have second thoughts when he sees that Kal will go to any lengths to capture Arthur. *Viacheslav Shegal ‚Äî the top agent of \\"Shield\\", Emperor's Special Forces. Reports directly to the Emperor. Allows himself to be taken prisoner by Darlok agents in order to find out their true nature. Created the universe that the story takes place in. According to a fan-written short story, Shegal was a computer programmer on our Earth. Unlike van Curtis, who found God on another planet, Shegal found the being on the Internet. As it happens, he accepted the offer of a new universe after hours of playing Master of Orion. As such, his universe reflects that. *Emperor Grey ‚Äî the ruler of the Human Empire and one of the first people to use \\"aTan\\". As an officer during the war, he was disgusted with the way the Earth government was fighting it. When his fleet was sent to fight an unwinnable battle, Grey convinced his friend Lemak to turn the ships around and head for Earth. There, they forced the government's surrender, after which Grey became the first Emperor. In the later years, Grey has been almost apathetic to the happenings of the Empire. As expected, Grey is protected by the best minds and technology the Human Empire has to offer. When travelling, his shuttle is escorted by elite interceptors, each of which is capable of taking down a cruiser. His psyche is protected round-the-clock by a team of telepaths (while \\"aTan\\" can heal the body, it cannot do the same for the mind). *Admiral Karl Lemak ‚Äî promoted to admiral after helping Grey overthrow the inept Earth government. Like most officers during the war, Lemak distrusts aliens, even those under his command. His personal weapon is an Excalibur tachyon rifle, firing a full second before the trigger is pulled (does not break causality as it fires if and only if the trigger is pulled). *Wanda Kahowski ‚Äî the only female commander of a terror-group during the war. Nicknamed Wanda-Blood for her brutality in ending hundreds, if not thousands, of alien lives. One of the few humans with whom the aliens are still officially at war. Lives under the name of Henrietta Fiscalocci on the paradise planet Tauri. Her house is officially off-limits to ISB, a privilege granted by the Emperor himself. She has a numerous collection of wartime weapons (all in working condition) and engages in illegal neural growth of her cat, giving him an intelligence level of a teenage human. *Rachel Haney ‚Äî a teenage girl on the planet Tauri. She befriends Arthur while Kay and Arthur are on the planet and helps Kay defeat the ISB agents sent to kill him. After this, she has a crush on Kay and dreams of becoming a bodyguard in order to impress him. She has a younger sister named Lara. *Lyka Seiker ‚Äî the Mother of the Family, a powerful crime syndicate based on Gorra. Genetically related to Kay Dutch, as they were grown in the same test tube. Unlike Dutch, Lyka's mother survived the invasion and bombing of Shedar, so she was never sent to an orphanage. She can perform complex calculations in her head extremely fast, but her physical abilities are not as high as Dutch's. *Sedimin ‚Äî the leader of the Silicoids. His official title is the Foot of the Silicoid Basis, and every Foot is called Sedimin. Like all of his race, he is obsessed with universal balance. Sedimin became the Foot after challenging and killing the previous leader in a one-on- one combat. *Shivukim Ahhar - one of the few Bulrathi ISB agents. Unlike most of his race, wields a ranged weapon in addition to his hand-to-hand combat skills. Prefers the honor of a one-on-one combat to a senseless shootout. *Marjan Mohammadi - former bodyguard, now an ISB agent. She prefers cyber- enhancements to \\"aTan\\". Much of her body has been replaced with mechanical parts, but she is far from being a Meklar, whom she views as perfect. Marjan's body can take massive amounts of punishment and can partially regenerate afterwards. Familiar with Kay Dutch through her former line of work. *T'san - Meklar ISB agent. Serves Isabella Kal without question. Apparently, his walking transformation shows slight asynchronism during movement. According to another Meklar, this could mean one of 2 things: a bad surgeon or a deliberate lowering of the efficiency of one transformation in order to boost another, such as the combat transformation. *Kas's'is - Meklar at the employ of the Family. Faithful servant of Lyka Seiker. Given to Kay Dutch as a counter to T'san. *Andrey - human cyborg at the employ of the Family. Former lover of Lyka Seiker (when he was fully human). Given to Kay Dutch to help him storm an Imperial military station. *Vsevolod Martyzenski - famous weapon designer, currently employed by the Family. Created the Excalibur tachyon rifle, among many others. Ironically, he is a pacifist. When not creating tools of death, he attends peace rallies and debates. Usually, after each rally, Martyzenski returns to his lab upset and proceeds to design yet another gun. Whenever he has a \\"designer's block\\", the Family orchestrates a peace rally to jump-start his creativity. Differences from Master of Orion *There are no \\"precursor\\" races. No Antarans or Orions. *Silicoids are hovering columns of rock with few visible features. They are the only intelligent race without appendages. Instead, they generate focused EM fields which serve multiple purposes: allow them to hover and move, communicate with each other, manipulate physical objects, etc. They communicate with other races by vibrating their bodies to create speech, making them sound like a whispering choir. Their lives are centered around the idea of universal balance. The Silicoid Basis is ruled from the very bottom by the Foot of the Basis, a position equal to that of a human emperor. The reason the Foot rules from the bottom is because the entire Basis depends on the Foot for support. Each Foot is chosen between two candidates by the Balance. Translation: they fight to the death with the victor assuming the name Sedimin. Their philosophy of balance also dictates when they go to war. Until recently, Silicoid ships did not have external drives. Instead, they were moved by combined efforts of the crew. *Bulrathi are the only race known to be able to defeat Silicoids in hand-to-EM field combat. This is mostly due to a quirk of evolution that gave the massive ursine creatures extremely high-pitched voices. They are able to create a sustained high-pitched sound that resonates with the Silicoid organ that generates their EM fields. A simple punch is enough to disable the organ, leaving the Silicoid motionless and defenseless. After the war, the Bulrathi entered the Trinary Alliance with humans and the Meklar. They have a gland, which, if punched strongly enough, can kill them (ironically, if this gland is punched, the bulrathi dies of pleasure). *The Meklar are nearly impossible to defeat in hand-to-hand combat by a non-Meklar. Their origins are reptilian; however, they have long ago replaced much of their bodies with mechanical parts. Their weapons are usually built into their bodies, making them difficult to upgrade. Their mechanical parts can slightly change configuration and/or position to match a required action (e.g. walking transformation, combat transformation, resting transformation). They are capable of communicating with each other by a line-of-sight beam, which is nearly impossible to intercept. The Meklar are considered to be the best mechanics in the galaxy. Very little is revealed about their social or political structure, only that they are ruled by a being known as the Perfect One. *Darloks are the most secretive of all races and are rumored to be as old as the Silicoids. Their lack of a strong military is more than compensated by their extremely adept spy network. They are capable of turning even the most loyal citizens against their government. It was assumed that they used mind-control technology to gain new recruits; however, a successful human intelligence operation revealed the truth ‚Äî the Darloks are snake-like parasites, entering the host and taking over their mind (the original personality is destroyed). Silicoids seem to be the only race that the Darloks avoid, as the parasite is incapable of \\"infecting\\" a creature made of rock. The Darlok language has many complex levels and layers. The more proficient one is in speaking Darlok, the more respect that person gets. Very few non-Darloks are able to speak the language. Kay Dutch is one of them. *The Sakkra, often called \\"white frogs\\" by humans, have been completely exterminated by the Human Empire after their invasion of the human Shedar system. The Emperor justified the extermination by stating that the uncontrolled population growth of the \\"frogs\\", which led to their invasion of Shedar in search of more breeding grounds, was a danger to all other races. *The Alkari were the first to discover interstellar travel. Their ships are more maneuverable than other races' because the Alkari are the only avian race and, therefore, think in three-dimensional terms. Their ships also tend to be smaller to take full advantage of their inertialess drives and allow for the pilot to be linked with the ship via a neural net. As far as they are concerned, the galaxy should have been theirs. Instead, younger races (mainly humans) forced them back into their territory. Resigned to leave the galaxy to the other races, the Alkari are developing a way to leave for another galaxy, where they cay finally fulfil their destiny. The Alkari possess a purely visual memory. In order for something to be retained, an Alkari must first visualize it. They perceive their memories in terms of a tapestry. *The Psilons are the most technologically advanced race in the galaxy. Their grounds troops are especially feared. During the siege of Earth in the war, three Psilon troopers completely leveled the city of Vilnius. Psilon power armor allows a single soldier to take on an entire enemy division. In combat, Psilons take no prisoners. The only exception are those who demonstrate great prowess and are able to single-handedly kill many Psilon soldiers. Those are left alive and kept as slaves. Physically, the Psilons are extremely weak, forcing them to use their advanced technology to defend themselves. After the war, the Psilons retreated to their own space and stopped interacting with other races. According to Curtis van Curtis, their last interaction was the sale of the \\"aTan\\" device to him.

It focuses on the implicit values expressed within ethnographic studies and, therefore, on the unacknowledged biases that may result from such implicit values.Soyini Madison, D. (2005). Critical ethnography: method, ethics, and performance. Retrieved from http://www.sagepub.com/upm- data/4957_Madison_I_Proof_Chapter_1.pdf It has been called critical theory in practice.Thomas, J. (1993). Doing critical ethnography. Newbury Park, CA: Sage. of critical theory, this approach seeks to determine symbolic mechanisms, to extract ideology from action, and to understand the cognition and behaviour of research subjects within historical, cultural, and social frameworks. Critical ethnography incorporates reflexive inquiry into its methodology. Researchers employing this approach position themselves as being intrinsically linked to those being studied and thus inseparable from their context.Simon, R. I., & Dippo, D. (1986). On critical ethnographic work. Anthropology & Education Quarterly, 17(4), 195-202. In addition to speaking on behalf of subjects, critical ethnographers will also attempt to recognize and articulate their own perspective as a means of acknowledging the biases that their own limitations, histories, and institutional standpoints bear on their work. Further, critical ethnography is inherently political as well as pedagogical in its approach. There is no attempt to be purely detached and scientifically objective in reporting and analysis. In contrast to conventional ethnography which describes what is, critical ethnography also asks what could be in order to disrupt tacit power relationships and perceived social inequalities. History Critical ethnography stems from both anthropology and the Chicago school of sociology.Thomas, J. (2003). Musings on critical ethnography, meanings, and symbolic violence. In R.P. Clair (Ed.), Expressions of Ethnography. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, pp. 45-54. Following the movements for civil rights of the 1960s and 1970s some ethnographers became more politically active and experimented in various ways to incorporate emancipatory political projects into their research.Noblit, G.

For example, some ethnographers with political agendas for change chose to conduct fieldwork in unconventional environments such as modern workplaces that were not necessarily considered exotic, as previous anthropologists had typically done. Other ethnographers consciously attempted to conduct research on so-called deviant or suppressed groups from outside the paradigm of hegemonic cultural positionings to provide new avenues for dissent and dialogue on societal transformation.

Traditionally speaking, Rezua is founded by Rezua Lord (Rezua Bawi).U Bawi Sung's Audio Record, 1983 In the township Maran and Lotu tribes are also present. It is 6000 feet above sea level, located in the central part of Chin State. \\"Zotung Chin\\" is one of the ethnic groups in Chin State in Myanmar also known as Burma. It is located in the south in Chin State. Zotung Mingphuin is a very distinct ethnic people in Burma. It is very difficult to get historical records of this ethnic people as they didn't have a written language many years ago. But it still can be traced back as far to the year 1300 AD as there are the names of the places and traditional songs which can reveal the times being composed and the stories of ancient people. These people are from a Tibeto-Burman group and are familiar with all other Chin groups even though they have their own written language which is intelligible to others. These people called themselves \\"Zo Mingphuin\\" from the early times while others called them \\"Zotung\\" from during and after British rule. From 1931, their language was recorded using the Roman alphabet. It was called \\"Zo Ccaaw\\" (Zo Literature). Most of these people are farmers and prefer hunting animals for their meals like other Chin groups. In early history, the Zotung Mingphuin believed in Khozi as god and they used to pray to Khozi for their health, wealth and sins through Khuarum services. But when the western missionaries entered Chinland, the Zo people converted to Christianity between the 1930s and the present. Rezua has been a township since 2003. In the area of Rezua township, there are many villages: Rovaw village is very closed with Rezua. Lekan is Lotu tribe, one of chin.

Richard Smyth (or Smith) (1499/1500, Worcestershire, England ‚Äì 9 July 1563, Douai, France) was the first person to hold the office of Regius Professor of Divinity in the University of Oxford and the first Chancellor of the University of Douai. Life Educated at Merton College, Oxford, and taking his MA degree in 1530, he became Registrar of the University of Oxford in 1532 then (by royal appointment) its first Regius Professor of divinity in 1536. Taking his doctorate in divinity on 10 July 1536, he was subsequently made master of Whittington College, London, rector of St Dunstan-in-the-East and then Cuxham, Oxfordshire, principal of St. Alban's Hall, and divinity reader at Magdalen College. Some (possibly unreliable) accounts have him renouncing Catholicism and the authority of the Pope at Oxford and (on 15 May 1547) at St Paul's Cross on the accession of the Protestant Edward VI. However, even if the accounts are reliable, he soon afterwards he became a Catholic again and was thus replaced in his professorship with Peter Martyr. He and Martyr were to hold a public disputation in 1549, but fled to Leuven before it could be held. On release he left to become professor of divinity at Louvain, returning on the accession of Mary to become canon of Christ Church and royal chaplain and take a major part in proceedings against Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer. Regaining most of his benefices, he lost them all again when Elizabeth succeeded Mary, and was briefly imprisoned in the house of Archbishop Matthew Parker. On release, he again fled to the continent, this time to Douai, where Mary's widower Philip II of Spain appointed him dean of St. Peter's church and then (on Philip II's inauguration of University of Douai on 5 October 1562) the university's chancellor and professor of theology.

Completed in 1888, Benbow spent the majority of her career in reserve with only brief spurts as part of the active fleet. The battleship was scrapped in 1909. Design Starboard elevation and deck plan Right elevation of 16.25-inch gun mounting A starboard bow view of Benbow, prominently displaying her forward 110-ton breech-loading rifle mounted in an open-topped barbette. With the exception of her armament she was a repeat of and . The contract for her construction was awarded to Thames Ironworks, and stipulated delivery within three years. At the time of her construction and indeed for many years afterwards, the limiting factor in battleship construction was the great length of time taken to manufacture heavy artillery, and it was recognised that the gun of 13.5 inch calibre, scheduled to be installed in the other ships of the class, was and would remain in short supply. The shipyard was therefore faced with the choice of either reverting to armament of 12 inches calibre, which was available but which was seen as inferior to guns mounted in contemporary foreign ships, or mounting the new Elswick BL 16.25-inch gun. Although contemporary guns of 12 inches calibre were perfectly able to destroy any ship afloat, the larger guns were chosen, and mounted singly in barbettes positioned at either end of the superstructure. With the exception of the 18 inch armament mounted in and in some monitors, these were the largest calibre guns ever mounted in a ship of the Royal Navy. One of these pieces nevertheless weighed less than a pair of 13.5 inch guns, and the weight saved was used to increase the number of 6 inch guns in the broadside battery. The big guns were not a wholly satisfactory substitute for the armament in their sister-ships. They were slow to load, the rate of fire being only one round every four to five minutes; the chance of hitting the target, being a function of the number of guns in use, was reduced; there was a tendency for the muzzle to droop; and the barrel liner lasted only for some seventy-five rounds, when replacement was a difficult and time-consuming operation. Construction Benbow was laid down at Thames Iron Work's Blackwall shipyard on 1 November 1882. She was launched by Catherine Gladstone, wife of former Prime Minister William Gladstone, on 15 June 1885, and was completed in June 1888. Service history She was commissioned on 14 June 1888 for the Mediterranean Fleet, with which she served until October 1891. She was then held in the Reserve until March 1894, with two short commissions to take part in manoevres. From 1894 until April 1904, she served as guardship at Greenock. Captain Richard Penrose Humpage was in command from September 1899, succeeded by Captain Francis Raymond Pelly in June 1901. According to 1901 Census (2 April 1901)( RG13: Piece: 2114 Folio: 163) HMS Benbow was in the Reserve Fleet off Keyham Dockyard Devonport. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII. She remained in the Reserve until sold to Thos W Ward in 1909.

Highway 244 is also known as Wildwood Road, Mahtomedi Avenue, and Dellwood Avenue at various points throughout its route. The route is located in Washington County. Route description Highway 244 serves as a north‚Äìsouth route between the communities of Mahtomedi, Willernie, and Dellwood. The route forms an arc around the east side of White Bear Lake. The road runs primarily through a heavily wooded, residential area. That, combined with hilly terrain and numerous curves, results in a speed limit for most of its length. It becomes after the junction with County Road 12, and lowers to when it reaches the commercial area at its southern terminus with Highway 120 and County Road 15. The route is legally defined as Route 244 in the Minnesota Statutes. History Highway 244 was authorized on July 1, 1949. The route had been paved prior to it becoming a state highway. At one time, Highway 244 had continued farther west from its present-day junction with Highway 120 at the White Bear Lake / Mahtomedi boundary line. Before 2002, the route had continued west of Highway 120 on present day Ramsey County Road 15 (the south edge of the city of White Bear Lake) until reaching Highway 61 at the Vadnais Heights / Gem Lake boundary line. Highway 244 had previously formed an arc around both the south and east sides of White Bear Lake. The 2001 Minnesota Legislature approved removal of Route 244 from the state trunk highway system. The portion within Ramsey County was, and still is, also known as County Road E. In 2002, the Ramsey County portion was officially transferred to the county and the State Highway 244 signs were removed and it was re-signed as Ramsey County Road 15 (County E). The section of Highway 244 within Washington County remains part of the state trunk highway system. The Washington County draft 2040 Comprehensive Plan indicates that the segment of Highway 244 between Century Avenue and Washington County Road 12 is a candidate for jurisdictional transfer from the Minnesota Department of Transportation to Washington County. A transfer agreement for this segment has been proposed, which was discussed by the Washington County Board of Commissioners in an informational workshop on April 23rd, 2019 but no vote was taken. The segment of Highway 244 between County Road 12 and Highway 96 is not identified in the County's 2040 Comprehensive Plan as a candidate for jurisdictional transfer to Washington County.

The Rose Quarter is bounded on the west by NE Interstate Avenue, on the north by NE Broadway and NE Weidler Streets, on the east by Interstate 5, and on the south by NE Holliday Street. The site contains two multipurpose arenas, the Moda Center and the Memorial Coliseum. Nearby landmarks include the Steel and Broadway bridges, the Oregon Convention Center, and the Eastbank Esplanade. Facilities The Rose Quarter contains two multipurpose arenas and a large theatre, as well as a box office, four parking garages, a convention facility, several restaurants and bars, and a large public space, the Rose Quarter Commons. =Moda Center= The Moda Center is a , 19,980-seat multipurpose arena. The arena is divided into two major sections, an upper and lower bowl, separated by a level of luxury boxes. The arena opened in 1995, and is the current home of the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. The Moda Center also hosts games of the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League, and the Portland LumberJax of the National Lacrosse League. It is also used for concerts, circuses, rodeos, ice shows, and conventions. =Veterans Memorial Coliseum= The Veterans Memorial Coliseum The Veterans Memorial Coliseum is a 12,888-seat multipurpose arena located on the Rose Quarter campus. Built in 1960, it was the original home of the Portland Trail Blazers. Three NBA Finals have been played within its walls, and twice the Larry O'Brien Trophy has been secured on its hardwood, once by the Trail Blazers in 1977, and once by the opposing Detroit Pistons in 1990. It remained the Blazers home court until the team moved into the larger and more modern Rose Garden Arena (since renamed to Moda Center) in 1995. The arena is still actively used for Portland Winterhawks hockey games. The arena is also used for concerts, circuses, rodeos, ice shows, and conventions, and hosted the 2007 Davis Cup final between the United States and Russia. The Coliseum is known as the \\"Glass Palace\\". =Transportation and parking= Rose Quarter sign and event marquee, with a Biketown station in the foreground Two MAX Light Rail stations serve the Rose Quarter area. The Rose Quarter Transit Center is located on the Red, Blue and Green Lines, and is located south of the arena, in an underpass where the tracks cross under Interstate 5. A separate station, the Interstate/Rose Quarter station, is located on the western side of the Rose Quarter campus and serves riders on the Yellow Line. Tri-Met also operates several bus lines which serve the arena as well as C-Tran's express route 157. The Rose Quarter offers over 2,600 parking spaces for Rose Quarter patrons on the premises. The spaces are distributed among four parking garages and two uncovered parking lots. In addition, arena management operates a pair of off-site parking lots with 1,700 additional spaces, located several blocks from the arena. Both off-site facilities are located on the MAX Light Rail line, which provides service to the Rose Quarter. Parking prices vary depending on the event, typically between US$8 and US$15 per vehicle. The parking garages are operated by City Center Parking. On-street parking near the arena is also available. Ownership and management The Rose Quarter is jointly owned by the Vulcan Sports and Entertainment (VSE) and the City of Portland. (VSE) is a subsidiary of Vulcan Inc., a holding company owned by Paul Allen which manages Allen's various sports-related properties. Tod Leiweke is the current president of Vulcan Sports and Entertainment. VSE owns the Moda Center and the underlying land; the City owns the remainder of the Rose Quarter premises. VSE are responsible for managing all Rose Quarter properties. Management and operation of the Rose Quarter is contracted out to AEG. Who is under contract to run the Garden until August 2008. History The Moda Center, located in the Rose Quarter The Rose Quarter was created in 1993, when significant parts of the parking lot of the Memorial Coliseum were transferred to the Oregon Arena Corporation, an operating company owned by Paul Allen, to facilitate construction of the Rose Garden Arena, later renamed the Moda Center. As part of the agreement, the Oregon Arena Corporation would be given the right to jointly manage both the new arena and the existing Coliseum, as well as other facilities and amenities on the grounds. The new arena would soon be christened the \\"Rose Garden\\", and the grounds of the Coliseum would be reborn as the Rose Quarter. The City of Portland hoped that the building of the arena would lead to other renovation or development in the Rose Quarter district, but as of 2007 this has yet to materialize. Several restaurants and bars operate on the Rose Quarter property. Oregon Arena Corporation managed the entire Rose Quarter, including those portions still owned by the City, until it was dissolved in a 2004 bankruptcy. The arena creditors took possession of the Rose Garden and the underlying land, together with the rights to manage other Rose Garden properties; and formed a new corporation, Portland Arena Management LLC (\\"PAM\\") to manage the property acquired in the bankruptcy proceedings. PAM soon hired Global Spectrum to operate the arena and the remainder of the Rose Quarter. In 2007, Allen repurchased the arena from the creditors, along with the Rose Quarter management rights; Global Spectrum was retained as the site operator. Global Spectrum is under contract to operate the Rose Quarter until 2008.

Early life Schiller was born in Bonn, North Rhine-Westphalia in March 1948. She studied psychology in Bonn and Heidelberg and became a student member of the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK) and was one of the members who turned militant in 1970. After the SPK dissolved Schiller joined the Red Army Faction.Margrit Schiller ‚Äì wikipedia, 2001-01-27, Retrieved 2012-11-07 Militant leftist career On September 25, 1971, two policemen approached a wrongly parked vehicle on the Freiburg-Basel autobahn. However, before they reached the vehicle, two people jumped out and started firing guns at them. Both policemen were shot albeit only one was seriously injured. The policemen later identified Schiller and Holger Meins as their assailants. On October 22 of the same year, Schiller left a Hamburg train station around 10pm and realising she was being trailed by police she hid in a car park but the police were still tracking her. She ran into her comrades Irmgard Moeller and Gerhard M√ºller and when the police tried to approach her she ran, followed by the police, Moeller and M√ºller. One of the police men caught Schiller but there was a scuffle and he was shot six times and killed, the other police man was shot in the foot. Schiller later claimed that it was M√ºller that was responsible for the murder. Later that night around 2am, police approached a female suspect in a telephone booth who turned out to be Schiller. When she came out the police drew their weapons; ‚ÄúOh, and I thought you wanted to fuck me!‚Äù Schiller exclaimed. When they searched her they found a 9 mm pistol in her handbag. She was arrested and sentenced to 27 months in prison. Schiller was released in 1973 and went underground straight away. She was involved in the reorganised RAF following the arrests of leading members Ulrike Meinhof and Andreas Baader. During this time she took part in bank robberies. However, in January/February 1974 she was re-arrested after police carried out raids in Hamburg and Frankfurt. Whilst in prison Schiller took part, unsuccessfully, in some hunger strikes.

Since 1982, he has held the titular bishopric of Diokleia in Phrygia (), later made a titular metropolitan bishopric in 2007, under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. He is one of the best-known contemporary Eastern Orthodox hierarchs and theologians. From 1966 to 2001, he was Spalding Lecturer of Eastern Orthodox Studies at the University of Oxford. Early life and ordination Born Timothy Richard Ware in 1934 to an Anglican family in Bath, Somerset, England, he was educated at Westminster School in London (to which he had won a King's Scholarship) and Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a double first in classics as well as reading theology. On 14 April 1958, at the age of 24, he embraced the Orthodox Christian faith. He describes his first contacts with Orthodoxy and the growing attraction of the Orthodox Church in an autobiographical text entitled \\"My Journey to the Orthodox Church\\", While still a layman, he spent six months in Canada at a monastery of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad. Thoroughly conversant in modern Greek, Ware became an Orthodox monk at the Monastery of Saint John the Theologian in Patmos, Greece. He also frequented other major centres of Orthodoxy such as Jerusalem and Mount Athos. In 1966 he was ordained to the priesthood within the Ecumenical Patriarchate and was tonsured as a monk, receiving the name \\"K√°llistos\\". Professional and ecclesiastical life In 1966, Ware became Spalding Lecturer at the University of Oxford in Eastern Orthodox studies, a position he held for 35 years until his retirement. In 1970, he was appointed to a fellowship at Pembroke College, Oxford. In 1982 he was consecrated to the episcopacy as an auxiliary bishop with the title Bishop of Diokleia (in Phrygia) in the Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Following his consecration, Ware continued to teach at the University of Oxford and served in the Greek Orthodox parish in Oxford. On 30 March 2007, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate elevated the Diocese of Diokleia in Phrygia to a titular metropolitan diocese and Ware the rank of metropolitan. Since his retirement in 2001, Ware has continued to publish and to give lectures on Orthodox Christianity. He served as chairman of the board of directors of the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies in Cambridge, and is chairman of the Friends of Orthodoxy on Iona (Scotland) and of the Friends of Mount Athos. Honours In 2017, Ware was awarded the Lambeth Cross for Ecumenism by the Archbishop of Canterbury \\"for his outstanding contribution to Anglican-Orthodox theological dialogue\\". Publications Ware is a prolific author and lecturer. He has authored or edited over a dozen books, numerous articles in a wide range of periodicals, essays in books on many subjects, as well as providing prefaces, forwards or introductions to many other books. He is perhaps best known as the author of the book The Orthodox Church, published when he was a layman in 1963 and subsequently revised several times. In 1979 he produced a companion volume, The Orthodox Way. He has collaborated in the translation and publication of major Orthodox ascetic and liturgical texts. Together with G. E. H. Palmer and Philip Sherrard, he translated the Philokalia (four volumes of five published ); and with Mother Mary he produced the Lenten Triodion and Festal Menaion.

This is also sometimes called single-winner voting or winner takes all. The alternatives are multi-member districts or the election of a body by the whole electorate voting as one constituency. A number of electoral systems use single-member districts, including plurality voting (first past the post), two-round systems, instant-runoff voting (IRV), approval voting, range voting, Borda count, and Condorcet methods (such as the Minimax Condorcet, Schulze method, and Ranked Pairs). Of these, plurality and runoff voting are the most common. In some countries, such as Australia and India, members of the lower house of parliament are elected from single-member districts; and members of the upper house are elected from multi-member districts. In some other countries like Singapore, members of parliament can be elected from both single-member districts as well as multi-member districts. History in U.S. Single-member House districts became law on Dec 14, 1967. 2 U.S. Code ¬ß2c Aspects =Constituency link= It has been argued by proponents of single-member constituencies that it encourages a stronger connection between the representative and constituents and increases accountability and is a check on incompetence and corruption. In countries that have multi-member constituencies, it is argued that the constituency link is lost. For example, in Israel the whole country is a single constituency and representatives are selected by party-lists. On the other hand, today most voters tend to vote for a candidate because they are endorsed by a particular political party or because they are in favour of who would become or remain the leader of the government, more than their feelings for or against the actual candidate standing. Sometimes voters are in favor of a political party but do not like specific candidates. For example, voters in Canada re-elected the Alberta government in 1989 but, because of dissatisfaction with its leadership, the premier and leader of the governing party, Don Getty, lost his seat. =Fewer minority parties= It has been argued that single-member districts tend to promote two-party systems (with some regional parties). Called Duverger's law, this principle has also been empirically supported by the cube rule, which shows how the winning party in a first-past-the-post system is mathematically over-represented in the final chamber of representatives. Supporters view this effect as beneficial, as parliamentary governments are typically more stable in two-party systems, and minorities do not have undue power to break a coalition. First-past-the-post minimizes the influence of third parties and thus arguably keeps out opposition. Critics of two-party systems believe that two-party systems offer less choice to voters, create an exaggerated emphasis on issues that dominate more marginal seats, and does not completely remove the possibility of a balanced chamber (or hung parliament), which can also give undue power to independents and lead to even greater instability. =Safe seats= A safe seat is one in which a plurality or majority of voters, depending on the electoral system, support a particular candidate or party so strongly that the candidate's election is practically guaranteed in advance of the vote. This means all other voters in the constituency make no difference to the result. This results in feelings of disenfranchisement and to nonparticipation by some voters, both supporters of the dominant candidate as well as his or her detractors.

According to Google Earth, the name of the mountain is \\"Gebel Khashm El Tarif\\", its coordinates being near 29¬∞40'9.18\\"N and 34¬∞38'0.28\\"E. Mount Sinai claims Hashem El Tarif is one of several proposed locations of the biblical Mount Sinai. =The Exodus Decoded= The James Cameron-produced History Channel special, The Exodus Decoded, suggests that this location, now in an Egyptian military zone, is the best candidate for the biblical Mount Sinai. The program claims that it not only features \\"biblical geographical\\" clues, but that it also possesses three important traits described in the Book of Exodus: # A cleft that overlooks a natural amphitheatre, from which a speaker could have been observed and heard from a great distance. # A plateau below the clef large enough to have held several hundred thousand people and to have contained enough vegetation to sustain large flocks. The plateau also contains one of the largest concentrations of ancient open-air fire pits in the region (many still visible as ruins), as well as many graves. # Calcium deposits that provide evidence of an ancient spring (now dry) which was located on the top of the mountain - a fairly rare geological feature.Higgaion ¬ª The Exodus Decoded: An extended review, part 14 Another argument used in the documentary to strengthen the claim that Hashem El Tarif is the biblical Mount Sinai is that in the Bible Mount Sinai is described as a \\"holy mountain\\", and Hashem El Tarif contains several ancient stone shrines all around it, as well as graves of apparently prominent persons near its summit. The final argument in favor of Hashem El Tarif is the fact that the traditional Mount Sinai (Jebel Musa) is devoid of any of the above and surrounded by a granite plateau unsuitable for herding sheep. According to the documentary, though, despite all this evidence, permission for archeological excavation was not granted to them by the Egyptian military, which the documentary claims closely guards and restricts access to the mountain.Biblische Ausbildung: Where is Mount Sinai (Mt. Horeb)? Hashem El Tarif?? =The Naked Archaeologist= Simcha Jacobovici in an episode of The Naked Archaeologist explored several mountains as possible candidates for the biblical Mount Sinai. Potential candidates had to meet the following criteria: # The mountain must have at its base a large plateau that could accommodate hundreds of thousands of biblical Israelites. # It must have a water source to support the people camping at the foot of the mountain. #It must be accessible and easy to climb (due to the old age of Moses). # It must have symbols of worship; archaeological evidence proving that the mountain was \\"holy\\" even before the time of Moses. (He claims the plateau of Hashem El Tarif contains 33 open-air sanctuaries; the largest number of open-air sanctuaries next to a mountain in the eastern Sinai ever found.) # It must be located somewhere along the ancient route of the Exodus. # It must have a natural spring at its top. In addition to these criteria, Jacobovici claimed that, according to biblical text, the mountain must also: # Be a fourteen-day journey from \\"Elim\\" (). For a mass of people, a days journey was assumed to be 15 km per day. A fourteen-day journey would be about 210 km. # Be an eleven-day journey from Kadesh Barnea (), approximately 165 km. # Be within \\"goat grazing distance\\" of Midianite territory. Moses was tending his father-in-law's goats at the time of his first encounter on Mount Sinai (). Based on modern Bedouin practises, this was assumed to be 45 to 60 or 70 km from a camp (or further in the event of drought). Midianite pottery and art have been found at Timna, assumed to be the only Midianite enclave in the Sinai. Using these points of reference to triangulate possible locations, Jacobovici claims that Hashem El Tarif is the most likely candidate for the biblical Mount Sinai. Criticisms The hypothesis that this mountain is the original Mount Sinai has faced criticism. Some of the arguments against the proposal that Hashem El Tarif is Mount Sinai are as follows: # There is no mention in history of Hashem El Tarif, nor any well-known local tradition pointing to it as Mount Sinai. # There is no widespread Rabbinic-era Jewish tradition about the location of Mount Sinai. It does not seem to have been an important part of Jewish identity, and was a more distinctly Christian phenomenon.Allen Kerkeslager, ‚ÄúJewish Pilgrimage and Jewish Identity in Hellenistic and Early Roman Egypt,‚Äù in Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt, ed. David Frankfurter (Leiden: Koninklijke Brill, 1998), 207. (Dr. Kerkeslager does state that there is evidence of early Christian traditions for Mount Sinai in northwestern Saudi Arabia at Jabal al- Lawz and Jabal Maqla, though). # As a part of the greater criticism of the Peninsula location for Mount Sinai, another criticism is that the Peninsula was likely controlled by the ancient Egyptian Empire at the time of the Exodus, with garrisons being placed throughout the Peninsula to protect the valuable copper and turquoise mines. Further, according to the book of Exodus, Moses came to Mount Sinai at the burning bush when he still resided in Midian. The land of Midian is largely recognized as the northwest portion of modern Saudi Arabia.

She was known for her performances of khyal, thumri, and bhajan. She was the sister-in-law of sitar player Ravi Shankar and the mother-in-law of violinist L. Subramaniam (her daughter Viji (Vijayashree Shankar) Subramaniam being his first wife). Biography Born in 1921, Lakshmi started her career in dancing. Her father Bhimrao Shastri was a noted Sanskritist who took active participation in India's struggle for freedom and was a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. She was the co-editor of 'Harijan'. In 1939, when Uday Shankar brought his dance troupe to Madras (recently renamed Chennai), she joined the Almora Centre to learn Shankar's dance style based on the Indian classics, and became a part of the troupe. In 1941, she married Uday Shankar's younger brother, Rajendra (nicknamed Raju). Her sister Kamala was also a dancer at Uday Shankar's ballet troupe and later married film director Amiyo Chakraborty. Kamala had a long drawn affair and was in a live-in-relationship with her sister Lakshmi's brother-in-law sitarist Ravi Shankar. During a period of illness, Lakshmi had to give up dancing, and already having had a background of Carnatic music, she undertook learning Hindustani classical music for many years under Ustad Abdul Rehman Khan. Later, she also trained with Ravi Shankar, the sitar maestro and youngest brother of Rajendra and Uday. In 1974, Lakshmi performed in Europe as part of Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India. Late that same year, she toured North America with Shankar and George Harrison, who produced the Shankar Family & Friends album (1974), including the pop single \\"I Am Missing You\\" with vocals by Lakshmi. Following Ravi Shankar's heart attack during the tour, she conducted his ensemble of musicians. Lakshmi has shown her versatility and adaptability by composing music for Bharatanatyam for the leading dance company Shakti School of Bharatanatyam, located in Los Angeles. Shankar died on 30 December 2013 in California.

Examples include carbonyl reduction, nitro compound reduction, secondary amine production via nitrile reduction, and the production of saturated heterocycles from their respective aromatic compound precursors. Preparation An aqueous solution of activated carbon and chloroplatinic acid is heated on a water bath for a few hours at 50¬∞C, and after cooling, the solution is then made alkaline using sodium carbonate. The chloroplatinic acid is then reduced with hydrazine hydrate; however, this step is sometimes omitted in other preparations. After additional 2 hours of warming, the solution is filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried over calcium chloride to yield the catalyst. Platinum loading is typically between 5% and 10%.

Henderson said, \\"They assured me they are doing all they can, they take this matter extremely seriously, and we are looking for a very quick and peaceful resolution to this particular kidnapping. The Palestinian Authority has offered every cooperation. They are very upset. They have condemned the kidnapping, and they assured me they are doing everything they can for a quick and speedy resolution.\\" After meeting with Abbas, Prime Minister Clark said, \\"On hearing of the kidnapping he had instructed the security apparatus of the Palestinian Authority to work to locate the kidnappers and secure the release...

Senior diplomat Peter Rider is on his traveling to the Middle East and will replace Henderson, who is returning to New Zealand. =Hostages' families= During the ordeal, Wiig's ex-wife, Anita McNaught, told New Zealand radio from Gaza City that she had only heard \\"rumours, sons of rumours‚Ä¶none of which we give much credence to\\" and that kidnappings in the region were \\"local entrepreneurial banditry\\". McNaught had said that although it was unusual for so much time to pass without news, \\"every kidnapping is different. There is no handbook for how you do them.\\" She expressed hope for a breakthrough in the case in the following days and met with several senior officials. McNaught had said that it was unlikely they would leave the area soon after Wiig was released. On August 17 the United States State Department condemned the kidnappings and called for the journalists to be freed immediately. Clark phoned Wiig's family and offered her support and left a message with McNaught.

It is essential that we, the public, > understand the greater context within which the kidnapping has taken place. > Thousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of women and children, have > been kidnapped by Israeli forces as part of a campaign to murder a nation > under the aegis of the United States. I also call upon the media to fulfil > its obligations and report the reality of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and > desist from counter-productive speculation and commoditizing private trauma. > I wish the negotiating team, which includes New Zealand diplomats, success. Release On August 27, the Palestinian news service Ramattan and Fox News reported that Centanni and fellow captive Wiig were released unharmed, shortly after a new video was released. In the video, both journalists, wearing beige robes, read statements saying that they had converted to Islam, with Centanni stating \\"Islam is not just meant for some people; it is the true religion for all people at all times.\\" After being freed Steve Centanni stated \\"We were forced to convert to Islam at gunpoint, and don't get me wrong here, I have the highest respect for Islam, and learned a lot of very good things about it, but it was something we felt we had to do, because they had the guns, and we didn't know what the hell was going on.\\" After their return to New York, Centanni and Wiig gave an interview with Greta Van Susteren on her Fox program On the Record. According to Wiig, the kidnappers were convinced that Centanni worked for the CIA, in part because of his presence as a journalist at the deaths of Uday and Qusay Hussein in Iraq, and that they intended to kill him. Nevertheless, they also repeatedly promised both men they would soon be freed. Fox News denies paying any ransom,\\"We didn't pay ransom for Wiig and Centanni, says Fox\\", Nov 17, 2006, NZ Herald but there have been suggestions that someone paid $2 million USD, to those involved with the kidnappings.

It is an improvised film that premiered in 2006 at the South By Southwest Film Festival and was later released on DVD. Plot The movie follows three recent college graduates in Chicago: Tim, Chris and Alex. Tim watches the screen of his laptop as he makes out with his girlfriend. Chris conducts relationships by cellphone. Alex's preoccupation with chat rooms sabotages a potential face-to-face relationship with a girl he meets at a party. Videos called \\"noisehead\\" appear throughout the film. Within the film, the character Alex takes videos of people making noises and then edits those videos into music videos. Production Swanberg first thought of making the film in the summer of 2005, originally knowing that he wanted to direct a film that was based on relationships and technology although he had no ideas beyond that. With the help of his friend Chris Wells, they originally thought of creating a DVD that showed scenes at random and in a different order every viewing. During the filming, Swanberg and Wells came up with the film's plot. Kevin Bewersdorf, who starred in the film, also created all of the film's soundtrack and produced the \\"noisehead\\" videos which are interspersed throughout the film. Everything in the film was improvised and the plot had to be continually adjusted as the project progressed. Swanberg was the film's producer, director, editor, DP, and writer. He also had a role in the film and his friends were fine with working without compensation. Greta Gerwig was Wells' actual girlfriend. The two influences for the film were the comedians Larry David and Ricky Gervais. LOL was produced with a budget of $3,000 and it first premiered at the South By Southwest Film Festival in 2006. Reception Dennis Schwartz gave the film a B rating and wrote, \\"The actors were allowed to ad lib, and the result is that the characters talk like real people, it's keenly observant about social issues and offers a flippant comical look at relationships for the social media set.\\" Phil Bacharach of DVD Talk wrote, \\"LOL might be undermined by its overly relaxed aesthetic, but it absolutely nails how improved tools of communication don't translate into improved communication.\\" Scott Weinberg, in an eFilmCritic review wrote, \\"Stocked with low-key and entirely believable characters and a sly (but not nasty) sense of derision towards the modern tools that keep us apart, LOL is, by my estimation, a solid step up from the director's first flick, and I feel pretty confident that the guy has something even better lined up for his next outing.\\" Home media The film was released on DVD by Benten Films, in Dolby Digital 2.0 and full-frame 1.33:1, with liner notes from GreenCine Daily editor David Hudson. The DVD has two commentaries as special features, with one that features the filmmakers and another one that has to do with the acting. Podcasts by Bewersdorf, the complete \\"Noisehead\\" videos, a casting interview of Tipper Newton, a short video titled Hissy Fits, a slideshow of the film's artwork, and music performances round out the rest of the special features.

He was the editor of the Pakistan Times in the 1950s, when it was considered a 'progressive' newspaper. Early life  According to Dawn newspaper, \\"Mazhar Ali Khan (1917-1993) was well known in his college days as a star debater, a lover of sports (tennis and swimming) and as a leader of a nationalist-minded and non-communal students' union.\\" He served briefly as an officer in the British Indian Army. Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, then unionist Chief Minister of Punjab in British India, had made that a condition for Mazhar Ali Khan before he could marry his beautiful daughter, Tahira. So he fulfilled that condition to be able to marry Tahira. Despite his feudal background, young Mazhar Ali Khan started mobilizing peasants that were working on his extended family's lands due to the prevailing influence and trend towards socialist thinking in the late 1940s.  Career  He was first asked to join the editorial team of the Pakistan Times in Lahore by owner Mian Iftikharuddin after the 1947 independence of Pakistan. In 1951, when the then newspaper editor Faiz Ahmed Faiz was arrested due to his suspected involvement in the Rawalpindi conspiracy case, Mazhar Ali Khan replaced him.Profile of Tahira Mazhar Ali Khan (1925 - 2015), on The Friday Times newspaper, published 27 March 2015, Retrieved 30 July 2019Profile of Tahira Mazhar Ali on The Independent (UK newspaper), published 29 March 2015, Retrieved 30 July 2019 Mian Iftikharuddin had earlier launched The Pakistan Times to rally and win Punjab's support for the Pakistan Movement and its cause. He remained its editor until 19 April 1959, when Ayub Khan's military regime seized the newspaper and its sister publications, the Urdu-language newspaper Daily Imroze and the magazine Lail-o-Nahar. Iftikharuddin, Faiz Ahmed Faiz and later Mazhar Ali Khan developed the 'progressive' editorial viewpoint of their publications from 1947 to 1959. Neither Faiz nor Mazhar joined a major political party in Pakistan so as not to compromise their editorial independence. They both tried to give special emphasis to the rights of peasants and workers. Mazhar Ali Khan's professional career may be divided into three parts - for the first 12 years, he wrote for The Pakistan Times which flourished under his editorial control and won the respect of the people. Mazhar Ali Khan never joined a political party to be able to preserve his editorial independence. The owner of the newspaper, Mian Iftikharuddin, also deserves some credit here because he chose not to interfere in the editor's domain. Mazhar Ali Khan's emphasis was on truthfulness and objectivity Then he had a relatively inactive period of 16 years, where he wrote an occasional column for different publications in Pakistan. In the final period of his life, he brought out and wrote for his weekly magazine Viewpoint from 1975 to 1993, the year of his death. In 1981, while he was jailed at Kot Lakhpat Jail, he continued writing his editorial for Viewpoint. Personal life Mazhar Ali Khan married his cousin Tahira. According to The Friday Times newspaper, \\"She (Tahira) eloped with her charismatic, student leader cousin Mazhar when she was 17. Their marriage went on to become a fabled partnership.\\" Tahira was the daughter of Punjabi feudal landlord and Unionist Party (Punjab) politician Sikander Hayat Khan who had also served as provincial prime minister of Punjab in British India from 1937 to 1942. After their marriage, Tahira stayed active socially and politically and was publicly known as Tahira Mazhar Ali. In the 1960s and 1970s, their son Tariq Ali (born in 1943) also became well- known as a British-Pakistani writer and a political activist with a socialist and communist viewpoint.

The battle was fought at Maclodio (or Macalo), a small town near the River Oglio, fifteen kilometres (nine miles) south-west of Brescia. This battle, fought during the second campaign, was the only decisive victory for Venice in the Wars in Lombardy. This battle forced the Milanese into a treaty, conceding Brescia in 1428, though fighting of the wars in Lombardy was to resume later, continuing until the Treaty of Lodi in 1454. The war began with a pact between Venice and Florence to oppose Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and his territorial ambitions. The Venetian commander for the battle, Carmagnola, had recently been under the employ of Milan but defected to Venice when Filippo Maria gave him governorship of Genoa rather than further military duty in an attempt to lessen his power. The doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari, was seriously considering helping Florence in their conflict against Milan, and Carmagnola spurred this on, persuading the doge to name him general in a new war against Milan. Carmagnola quickly took Brescia for Venice, then made sure he campaigned very slowly, doing very little for a long time, forcing Venice to pay incredible amounts in upkeep for the almost useless army. Eventually the public was starting to catch on to this, so Carmagnola decided he needed another big victory to keep in command. He finally moved into enemy territory and met the army of Filippo Maria, under Carlo Malatesta, at Maclodio. The town itself was virtually destroyed in the battle, and the result was a decisive victory for Venice. Carmagnola was heavily praised and rewarded, being given a palace at San Stae that used to be the property of the Malatesta family, a fief in Bresciano, and a letter of appreciation from the doge. Public opinion of Carmagnola quickly soured again, however, as he released all 8,000 prisoners captured and decided not to advance on the defenceless Cremona. He then retired his army for the winter against Venetian wishes. A short truce was offered by Milan, eventually granted by Venice on 19 April 1428, on the condition that Milan cede Bergamo and the surrounding area to them. This was the largest permanent land holdings that Venice would have for the rest of its history.A History of Venice, First Vintage Books Edition, Vintage Books, 1989.

The uprising broke out in 1594, in the initial stage of the Long Turkish War, and was fought by local Serbs, numbering some 5,000, who managed to quickly take over several towns in the region before being crushed by the Ottoman army. The relics of Saint Sava were burnt by the Ottomans as a retaliation. Although short-lived, it inspired future rebellions. Background =Status of Serbs= =Ottoman crisis= The reign of Suleiman I has been described as the most famous period in Ottoman history. At the end of his reign, however, the constant wars had taken its toll, damaging the economy. The faulty economic policies that followed shook the economy and with that, the foundations of Ottoman society; state officials quickly became poor, their pay being worthless ak√ße, and corruption and bribes were common. Mutiny struck throughout the Ottoman Empire, the rebellion of the capital troops in January 1593 assuring the government to seek out a new war of conquest to get out of the crisis. The population (rayah, sr. raja) in the Sanjak of √áanad suffered in this period, since the 1560s. Impoverished sipahi forced peasants to overwork themselves, and the sipahis imposed their own taxes on the peasants, despite laws preventing such actions. Tax collectors, as well, abused their position, taking higher taxes. Beys and vojvode (Christian chiefs) used the population's houses, tools, and animals, and ate free of charge, which was eventually prevented by government order. A result of issues like these led to a massive migration of the population to Transylvania in 1583. Records show the worsening of the population's status, and deteriorating economy (inflation). It could be concluded from Ottoman sources that the main initiators and leaders of the uprising once belonged to the Christian layers in Ottoman military service. After the Ottoman conquest of Gyula in 1566, these began to lose their privileges and became part of the lower class (raja); a part moved to Transylvania and the frontier parts of the empire, a part stayed, while a large number joined hajduk bands. The defeat of the Ottomans at the Battle of Sisak (22 June 1593) and the uncertain outcome of fighting in Upper Hungary in the beginning of the Long Turkish War (1593‚Äì1606) woke up internal problems and also jeopardized Ottoman rule in the vassal principalities of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia. This also created conditions for the Serb uprising in Banat in 1594. Prelude Uprising in Banat Smaller groups of Ottoman Christian martolosi and some sipahi went rogue when Christian armies conquered Filek and N√≥gr√°d during the winter of 1593‚Äì94. They gathered in the frontier towards Transylvania (ruled by Ottoman vassal Sigismund B√°thory), where numerous hajduk bands were active before the war, and received help from ƒêorƒëe Palotiƒá, the Ban of Lugos, and Ferenc Geszti, one of the main Transylvanian commanders. At the beginning the group raided merchant caravans, until their numbers grew and they started attacking lone towers and chardaks. The raja approached only when the group arrived in their areas, while in several places they were forced to join as the rebels threatened to take their properties, and even death (which is contrary to stereotypes of the folk character of uprisal). In March, a group of rebels led by Petar Majzo≈° burnt down Vr≈°ac and robbed the population of neighbouring villages, then retreated to Transylvania. At the end of March, the rebels attacked and sacked Boc»ôa and Margina. In this period, it seems, the bandit forays turned into an uprising. The aims of the uprising were expressed by the Orthodox clergy, headed by the bishop of Vr≈°ac, Teodor. Uprising The rebels sought help from Transylvanian Prince Sigismund B√°thory. Vr≈°ac Fortress. After the operations in the Vr≈°ac area, a large Ottoman ship convoy with war material was attacked on the Syrmian side of the Danube, most likely by Syrmian hajduks. In April and May the rebels destroyed important Ottoman strongholds on the left waterside of the Danube, in southern Banat, and V. Krestiƒá notes that these conflicts were perhaps where the rebels had the greatest success. According to Ottoman chronicler Mustafa Selaniki, the rebellion began in Modava, led by an unnamed Christian (identified as the Serb \\"spahija Vukadin\\"), a ziamet-holder, who had a high rank in the sipahi organization; after losing his service and lands he went to Sigismund B√°thory, from where he quickly returned with several officers who would help in the uprising and establish military organization. In mid-May, Bishop Teodor led a mission which asked of aid from Sigismund B√°thory, and in return they offered him the rule of the Serbian throne, however, B√°thory insisted on submission to the Ottoman sultan and was unable to meet their demands., The first large success of the rebels was the attack on Modava on the Danube, where they killed the Ottoman crew and set the city fortress on fire. They then defeated the Ottoman security at the dock of Hram and crew of the wooden fortress (palanka) in Panƒçevo. The Ottoman government sent out an army of 1,000 cavalry and infantry when news about the attacks reached Belgrade and Smederevo. In the ensuing battle near Panƒçevo on 26 May 1594, the rebel leader Vukadin and 1,000 men were killed, an old Serbian record states that \\"Serbs and Turks fought ... many Serbs fell\\"., Immediately after the retreat of Ottoman troops, the remnants of defeated rebels, and rebel groups who had previously devastated the place of Ohat, attacked Be√ßkerek (Zrenjanin), the rich town built by Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (1506‚Äì1579) as his waqf (endowment). A Western source claims that the rebels had before Ohat conquered Ineu and Vil√°gosv√°r., At Zrenjanin, the rebels had the support of the local population, leading to a quick defeat of the Ottoman resistance. The rebels sought to leave as soon as spoils were collected, however, the locals opposed as they feared Ottoman reprisal., , V. Krestiƒá notes that the Ottomans believed that the rebellion would be easy to suppress, appointing a lesser official, emin-i n√ºz√ºl (grain procurer) Ali √áavu≈ü, who had up until then collected extraordinary war taxes, as commander of a detachment from the Sanjak of Smederevo. The Ottoman detachment was destroyed near Zrenjanin, and Ali √áavu≈ü was dismissed upon returning to Belgrade. The rebels sacked Titel, and many Muslim-inhabited villages in the surroundings, killing many Muslims, and had a large part held prisoner in a church, forcing them to convert to Christianity, according to Mustafa Selaniki. The Muslim population of neighbouring areas which were not caught up in the uprising withdrew to fortified cities. Cut off to the south and east, the few Muslims of the Kanji≈æa area most likely took to Csan√°d and Segedin. Anticipating an Ottoman attack, the rebels asked for help from Transylvania and the Austrians. Rebel requirements were sent from Vr≈°ac and Zrenjanin, which points to that there were two independent centres of the rebels. In early June, Bathory summoned a meeting at Gyulafeh√©rv√°r of his magnates regarding whether to support the Serb rebels; on 11 June the outcome was that they were not to break their subordinance to the Ottomans. The Transylvanian connection did however not stop; ƒêorƒëe Palotiƒá stole armament which he sent to the rebels, and encouraged them to continue to fight; he subsequently promised that B√°thory would soon appear to them. On 13 June from Vr≈°ac, Bishop Teodor, Ban Sava, and Velja Mironiƒá promised, in the name of all their sipahi, knezes, and \\"all of Serbdom\\", to faithfully serve the Transylvanian ruler, in a letter to M√≥zes Sz√©kely, who held the frontier at that time., Meanwhile, the Zrenjanin group sought protection from the Viennese court, their envoy ƒêorƒëe Rac arrived at Hatvan on 10 June, meeting with general Teuffenbach, and then also Archduke Matthias at Esztergom. The Austrians sent two small detachments, one of which was killed off by Crimean Tatars on the way, while Transylvania's support came down to continued support in the form of officers and moral support. Meanwhile, the war on the front switched noticeably in the favour of the Ottomans. The arrival of Crimean Tatars led by Khan ƒûazƒ± II Giray forced the Christian armies to raise the sieges of Esztergom and Hatvan and retreat into Upper Hungary. This led the Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha to devote attention to Banat. He appointed Mehmed Pasha, the Beylerbey of Anatolia, the commander of an army (consisting of troops from the eyalets of Anatolia and Karaman, and also 3,000 Janissaries) that was planned to deal with the rebels in Zrenjanin. As news arrived of spreading of the uprising in the Teme≈üvar (Timi»ôoara) area, Mustafa Pasha, the Beylerbey of Teme≈üvar, was ordered to immediately head from Buda for Banat. No serious resistance was given by the rebels, defeated by 10 July 1594. Aftermath Ottoman reprisal was daunting. After battles around Zrenjanin the army sacked and burnt villages all the way to the Mure»ô river (see also Pomori≈°je). Many settlements were abandoned, and never rebuilt, as the population was either killed or taken slaves, or fled to Transylvania and the Habsburg part of Hungary., The next year, Crimean Tatars wintered in the Eyalet of Teme≈üvar, which brought new pillage and slavery, and according to contemporary statements no living being could be seen for three days of walking. The longer the war lasted, extraordinary war taxes rose. In 1596 a Serb uprising broke out in the eastern part of the Sanjak of Herzegovina, organized by the regional Orthodox leadership. It was short-lived, the defeated rebels being forced to capitulate due to lack of foreign support, having likewise requested help from the Christian European states. Burning of St. Sava's remains The burning of Saint Sava's relics by the Ottomans. Painting by Stevan Aleksiƒá (1912) It remains unclear when St. Sava's remains were brought to Belgrade and incinerated. It was either during the uprising or a year after. In an act of retaliation, Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha ordered the green flag of the Prophet Muhammed to be brought from Damascus to counter the Serb flag, as well as the sarcophagus and relics of Saint Sava located in the Mile≈°eva monastery be brought by military convoy to Belgrade. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy had people killed in their path so that the rebels in the woods would hear of it. On 27 April, the Ottomans had the relics of Saint Sava publicly incinerated on a pyre on the Vraƒçar plateau, and the ashes scattered, made to discourage the Serbs. Archbishop Sava founded the Serbian Orthodox Church, Serbian ecclesiastical law and national literature, and has been compared to what Buddha is for Buddhism. He was canonized as a miracle- worker and his religious cult was assimilated into folk beliefs in Ottoman times. The veneration of his relics created tension between Serbs and the occupying Ottomans. In 1774, Sava was proclaimed the patron saint of all Serbs. In the 19th century the cult was revived in the context of nationalism with the prospect of independence from the Ottomans, \\"representing and reproducing powerful images of a national Golden Age, of national reconciliation and unification, and of martyrdom for the church and nation\\". After Serbia gained full independence, a cathedral dedicated to the saint was planned, part of modernization plans of Belgrade. Although the construction board for the church was established in 1895, the construction of the winning concept, based on Graƒçanica and Hagia Sophia, began in 1935. Construction stopped during World War II and the Communist rule, only to be restarted after permission in 1984; as of 2010, the exterior is finished and interior unfinished., The site where Saint Sava's relics were burnt, the Vraƒçar plateau, became the new grounds of the National Library of Serbia and the Church of Saint Sava dedicated to the saint, in the 20th century. From its location, the church dominates Belgrade's cityscape, and has become a national symbol. Legacy The size of the uprising is illustrated in a Serbian epic poem: \\"The whole land has rebelled, six hundred villages arose, everybody pointed his gun against the emperor\\". The coat of arms of Vr≈°ac, which was first recorded in 1804, includes a decapitated Turk head on a sabre above the Vr≈°ac Fortress, which is believed to signify Janko Halabura's duel victory in 1594. Bishop Teodor was canonized on 29 May 1994 as a hieromartyr (sve≈°tenomuƒçenik), with his feast day on . In 2009 the Vr≈°ac central square was named \\"St. Teodor of Vr≈°ac\\". On 28 October 2012, a memorial plaque was put up at the Church of the Holy Archangel Michael in Zrenjanin, honouring Teodor and the rebels. A memorial cross and a red flag with the figure of Saint Sava was erected by the church. A historical drama play titled Enchanted Castle surrounding the Vr≈°ac Castle includes the character of Janko Halabura.

According to The American Lawyer, Cahill's gross revenue was $348.5 million in 2013.http://www.americanlawyer.com/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202589810409 First Amendment advocate Floyd Abrams has been with Cahill since 1963 History Cahill opened its doors at 120 Broadway in 1919 as McAdoo, Cotton & Franklin. In 1921 William G. McAdoo moved out west and the firm was renamed Cotton & Franklin. It was as a small firm that quickly built a national reputation in the financial and corporate areas. By the end of the Depression, it had expanded to handle bankruptcies, reorganizations, and regulatory matters. During and after the Second World War, under the leadership of John T. Cahill, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the firm grew dramatically. As Cahill Gordon Reindel & Ohl, it moved to 80 Pine Street, where it remains. Partner John Ohl, a tax specialist, retired in 1976. The firm established its Paris office in 1928, though it closed in 2000 when the firm opened its London office. Today, Cahill maintains offices in London and Washington D.C., though by far its largest office is in New York City. Litigation work Cahill's litigation practice has handled high-profile securities, antitrust and first amendment litigation. The firm's partners have made appearances before the United States Supreme Court. For instance, National Broadcasting Co. v. United States helped establish the power and authority of the Federal Communications Commission. Another case, Times- Picayune v. United States, is among the Court's antitrust rulings. On behalf of Cahill, Floyd Abrams successfully defended The New York Times in the landmark New York Times Co. v. United States case. In that 1971 case the Supreme Court of the United States refused to permit the Nixon Administration to stop the publication of thousands of pages of Vietnam War-related government documents. Thereafter, Abrams and Cahill became prominent defenders of the media and First Amendment rights. On September 9, 2009, Abrams argued before the Supreme Court on behalf of Senator Mitch McConnell in the highly publicized re-argument ordered by the Court on the constitutionality of McCain-Feingold, defending the rights of corporations and unions to donate unlimited amounts of money to political allies in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. Corporate work Cahill's corporate practice has assisted in the development of numerous financial products and services. This firm is prominent in the US capital markets, the Euromarket and bank lending market, often advising the investment and commercial banks in their roles as underwriters, initial purchasers, arrangers, agents and dealer managers. It was Cahill that represented the financing sources in many of Wall Street's historic buyouts, beginning with the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1989, up through the mega-buyouts of TXU, Hospital Corporation of America, Kinder Morgan, Harrah‚Äôs, Alltel, First Data and Clear Channel in the 2006 and 2007 LBO boom, where the largest buyout records were set.

In the months leading up to the Revolution, Davis set unusually high standards for his company in terms of equipment, training, and preparedness. His company was selected to lead the advance on the British Regulars during the Battle of Concord because his men were entirely outfitted with bayonets.Ryan, \\"The Concord Fight and a Fearless Isaac Davis.\\"French, 188-189. During the American advance on the British at the Old North Bridge, Davis was among the first killed and was the first American officer to die in the Revolution.Fischer, 213. Davis is memorialized through the Isaac Davis Monument on the Acton Town Common. He was also the inspiration behind The Minute Man (1875), the sculpture at the Old North Bridge by Daniel Chester French. The sculpture, which French attempted to model after Davis using photographs of Davis's descendants,Robbins, 20. is now an iconic national symbol. Biography =Early life and family= Davis was born February 23, 1745 in the village of West Acton to Ezekial Davis (b. 1717) and Mary (nee Gibson) Davis (1725-1773). He married Hannah Brown (born 1746) on October 24, 1764. They had four children‚Äîtwo boys and two girls.Fletcher, 261‚Äì262. =Preparations for war= During the early 1770s, many inhabitants of the Province of Massachusetts Bay protested taxation policies established by British Parliament. These protests eventually resulted in the military occupation of the provincial capital of Boston, Massachusetts which, consequently caused further unrest. In September 1774, the military governor, General Thomas Gage, dissolved the Massachusetts General Court, placing the province under martial law.Galvin, 52‚Äì53. Citizens of Massachusetts formed an extra-legal Massachusetts Provincial Congress to govern the province outside of the rule of the King. In October 1774, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress recommended that each town establish a company of Minutemen‚Äîspecially trained militia who could be ready at short notice in the event that the British Regulars in Boston attempted any warlike movements.Galvin, 54. In November 1774, Acton formed a company of Minutemen, and Davis was elected captain.Husbands, 5. He was determined that his company be as well-equipped as the British soldiers. Most provincial Minuteman companies, unlike professional soldiers, were not equipped with bayonets for use in close combat and they typically re-loaded using powder horns, a slow method more suited to hunting than to battle. Davis employed his skills as a gunsmith to outfit nearly every man in his company with a bayonet and saw that his men were supplied with cartridge boxes, allowing his company to re-load as quickly as the British. Finally, Davis emphasized marksmanship, training his company on an improvised shooting range behind his house. These high standards in terms of equipment and training made the Acton company one of the best prepared in Massachusetts. According to tradition, Davis was a superstitious man who believed he had seen numerous omens that indicated that he would die if forced into battle. In 1851, Rev. James Woodbury, Acton's representative to the Massachusetts General Court, delivered a speech about Davis to the House of Representatives. During this speech, Woodbury described an incident that allegedly took place a few days before the Battle of Concord in which Davis and his family returned home to find an owl perched on Davis's musket. According to Woodbury, \\"It was an ill omen, a bad sign. The sober conclusion was that the first time that Davis went into battle, he would lose his life.\\"Hurd, quoting Woodbury, 260. =Battle of Concord= Old North Bridge in Concord. The British position was on the left bank of the river and the provincial position to the right.During the early spring of 1775, Gage planned an expedition to confiscate a large stockpile of gunpowder and weapons kept by the provincials in Concord, Massachusetts. On April 15, he issued orders to hand-picked companies of British Regulars in Boston, relieving them from their usual duties. Concluding that a British movement was imminent, Paul Revere, a messenger for the provincial Sons of Liberty, was sent to Concord on April 16 to warn the inhabitants. Most of the supplies were removed from Concord, and the Minuteman companies were on alert days before the British marched from Boston.Langguth, 227. On the night of April 18, 1775, Gage dispatched approximately 800 British Regulars under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith.Fischer, 114. The Sons of Liberty in Boston were convinced that the British troops would also attempt to capture the provincial leaders, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, who were in Lexington, Massachusetts. Messengers Paul Revere and William Dawes therefore rode again on the night of April 18 to warn Hancock and Adams that the soldiers were marching from Boston.Fischer, 95. In Lexington, the British force encountered resistance from the Lexington militia, and a skirmish ensued on Lexington Green; eight provincials were killed, and one British soldier was wounded.Langguth, 240. Following the action on Lexington Green, the British marched on to Concord.Fischer, 200. Word of the British movement reached Acton just before dawn on April 19, most likely delivered by Dr. Samuel Prescott, a resident of Concord and one of the Sons of Liberty.Fischer, 145. As the alarm spread, the Acton Minutemen began to gather at Davis's home. While waiting for others to arrive, the men made paper cartridges and some powdered their hair with flour so as to appear more like gentlemen when they met the British in battle.Bracken, \\"Minuteman Isaac Davis.\\" As the Minutemen prepared, Davis's wife noticed that he seemed especially somber and said very little.Fischer, 166. As some of his men joked about getting shot at by a British soldier, Davis rebuked them, reminding them that some of them would soon be killed. Davis formed up his company and ordered them to march at about 7 a.m.Husbands, 9. According to his wife and other witnesses, shortly after stepping off, Davis ordered his company to halt, then returned to his front door to tell his wife, \\"Take good care of the children.\\" Soon after crossing into Concord, the Acton company passed the farm of Colonel James Barrett who commanded the provincial troops in Concord that morning. A small detachment of British soldiers were searching Barrett's farm for supplies, and Davis considered attacking them. His orders, however, were to muster with the rest of the provincial militia and Minutemen near the Old North Bridge by the Concord River. He then diverted his company off the road, avoiding the British at Barrett's farm and marching past a tavern belonging to a Widow Brown. A boy named Charles Handley, who lived at Widow Brown's Tavern, saw Davis's company pass the tavern. He recalled many years later that a fifer and drummer played a song called \\"The White Cockade\\", a reference to the white ribbon worn on their bonnets by Scots revolutionaries during The '45. Tradition persists that this was Davis's favorite marching song, but there is little evidence to support this notion. There is also a tradition that the Acton musicians played the White Cockade later when Davis's company led the advance on the British at the Old North Bridge, although this too is not supported by primary source accounts.Ryan, \\"Grand Musick and the Concord Conflict.\\" Davis's company reached the area of the Old North Bridge at approximately 9 a.m. Several other companies of militia and Minutemen, consisting of about 500 men from Concord, Lincoln, and Bedford, had already gathered on a small hill overlooking the bridge.Fischer, 209. Approximately 100 British Regulars occupied the bridge.Fischer, 212. Shortly after Davis arrived, Barrett called a council of the officers present to determine whether or not to attack the Regulars at the bridge. In Concord, the majority of the British force was searching for supplies, but they found little. When they decided to burn some wooden gun carriages they discovered, the provincials near the Old North Bridge saw the smoke and thought the British were burning the town. Barrett then made the decision to attack the soldiers holding the bridge. Davis's company had taken their designated position at the left of the provincial line. This would have placed the Acton company in the rear of the attack when the line advanced. The company in the lead would have been Captain David Brown's company from Concord. When Barrett asked Brown if he would lead the attack, Brown responded that he would rather not. Knowing that Davis's company was well equipped with bayonets and cartridge boxes, Barrett asked Davis if his company would lead the advance. Several slight variations of Davis's response have been recorded. His response is most often given as, \\"I have not a man that is afraid to go.\\" Following Barrett's orders, Davis then moved his company to the right of the line. Around 10:30, the provincials faced to the right and advanced on the Old North Bridge in a column of two men abreast. At the head of the column was Davis, Major John Buttrick of Concord, and Lt. Col. John Robinson of Westford. Barrett remained behind on the hill, cautioning his men as they marched by him not to fire first.Galvin, 150. The British at the bridge, watching the provincials approach, were surprised to see, as one soldier later said, that they \\"advanced with the greatest regularity\\".Fischer, 211. When the provincials were within about 75 yards of the bridge, the Regulars fired a few warning shots. Luther Blanchard, the fifer from Acton, was hit and wounded by one of these warning shots. The British then fired a disorganized volley. Isaac Davis was shot through the heart.Hurd, 261. Private Abner Hosmer of Acton was also killed in this volley. Seeing these casualties, Buttrick commanded, \\"Fire, fellow soldiers, for God's sake fire!\\" and the provincials returned fire, causing the British to immediately retreat back to Concord.Fischer, 214. Legacy Isaac Davis Monument, gravesite of Abner Hosmer and Isaac Davis on the Acton Town Common In February 1851, shortly after the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Concord, Rev. James Woodbury of Acton petitioned the Massachusetts General Court for funds to build a large monument to Isaac Davis in Acton. After the legislature appropriated $2,000 for the project, the 75-foot tall stone obelisk was completed that fall and dedicated on October 29, 1851. The remains of Davis, Hosmer, and James Hayward (an Acton soldier who was killed in Lexington later in the battle) were moved and re-interred beneath the monument. At the base of the monument is a stone brought from the vicinity of the Old North Bridge in Concord which is, according to an inscription, the stone upon which Davis's head fell when he was killed.Phalen, 165‚Äì167 In 1875, on the centennial of the Battle of Concord, a statue called The Minute Man was placed on the approximate site of Isaac Davis's death. The statue was the first public work of sculptor Daniel Chester French, best known for his 1920 statue, \\"Abraham Lincoln\\", in the Lincoln Memorial. Although commissioned to sculpt a generic provincial soldier, French was inspired by the story of Isaac Davis and modeled the facial features of his statue after photographs of Isaac Davis's descendants. Davis's plow, which is currently on display in Acton's Town Hall, was used as the model for the plow on the statue.Cresson, 66‚Äì68. On the base of the statue is inscribed the first stanza of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Concord Hymn written in 1836: By the rude bridge that arched the flood, Their flag to April's breeze unfurled, Here once the embattled farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world. National Guard logo Representing Davis, the statue of \\"The Minute Man\\" with a musket in one hand and the other resting on a plow remains an iconic symbol,Encyclopedia Americana, vol. 12, p. 56 and can be found on the Massachusetts state quarter, corporate logos, and the seal of the National Guard of the United States. The route of the Acton Minutemen is retraced every Patriots' Day in April by today's recreated company of Acton Minutemen, and by citizens and visitors. Now called the Isaac Davis Trail, the seven mile route from Acton to Concord traverses roads still in use as well as woodland trails. The path was established in 1957 by a group of Acton Boy Scouts who researched the historic route, cleared the portions of the path no longer in use, and placed markers. The trail was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.Powers, \\"Marching the Isaac Davis Trail.\\" Notes  References        External links  * Acton Minutemen Website * Isaac Davis Trail Scout Camporee * Category:1745 births Category:1775 deaths Category:Military personnel killed in the American Revolutionary War Category:Massachusetts militiamen in the American Revolution Category:People from Concord, Massachusetts Category:People of colonial Massachusetts Category:Deaths by firearm in Massachusetts Category:People from Acton, Massachusetts ","title":"Isaac Davis (soldier)"},{"id":"6643418","text":"Lake Wenatchee is a glacier- and snowmelt-fed lake situated in the Wenatchee National Forest on the eastern slopes of the Cascades Mountain Range in the state of Washington.

The main stone was erected in memory of Henry Liston who was minister of the parish for 43 years. Henry Liston (30 June 1771 ‚Äì 24 February 1836) was a Scottish minister and inventor. Life Born on 30 June 1771, he was the oldest son of Robert Liston, minister of Aberdour, Fifeshire. He studied for the ministry and in 1793 became minister to the parish of Ecclesmachan, Linlithgowshire, and was clerk of its presbytery and in 1820 he became conjunct clerk of the synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. Liston died suddenly on 24 February 1836 at Merchison Hall, Falkirk. Works Liston invented a special pipe organ he called the \\"Euharmonic Organ.\\" It had a tuning with 58 pitches in the space of an octave for performing music in just intonation and was championed by John Farey, Sr., who also directed attention to instruments developed for similar purposes by David Loeschman and William Hawkes. Liston used a series of pedals to change the pitch assigned to the keys of an ordinary keyboard, changing sharps and flats, as well as raising or lowering pitches by a major comma as required by the key of the music being performed. The first instrument was built in Edinburgh and had a separate pipe for each pitch. The second instrument was built by Flight and Robson in London, and used moveable shaders close to the mouth of the pipes in order to lower their pitch temporarily by one or two commas which reduced its cost and size, and with an improved bellows the system it was the subject of a patent granted to Liston and Charles Broughton on 3 July 1810. After introducing the instrument in a session at the builder's showrooms in 1811, Liston published his \\"Essay on Perfect Intonation\\" (Edinburgh, 1812) describing its tuning, construction and operation along with a treatise on music theory and 40 pages of music . Liston also patented an improved plow on 23 September 1813, claiming a special shape and an inclined wheel, which was locally used. He wrote the article \\"Music\\" for the Edinburgh Encyclopedia, and edited 'Horatii Flacei Opera Selecta' (1819) and the sixth book of Caesar for use in schools.

Six volumes have been released in English by Dark Horse Comics, translated by Michael Gombos. However, according to Dark Horse, the series' English publication has been discontinued. Summary =Volume One= Reiko is introduced as a schoolgirl and a \\"zombie shop\\"; a professional necromancer who, for a substantial fee, reanimates the dead, for the purpose of obtaining information from them. This offers her an opportunity to work as a detective and solve murder cases by temporarily reviving the victim and asking them who killed them. In the introductory acts of the book, for instance, she resurrects a girl who committed suicide, who, unbeknownst to her mother, was being molested by her father. The zombified girl kills the father, and, in a black-humour twist common to the series, the mother pays Reiko double her prior fee to reanimate the father so she can torture him. This volume mostly follows an unconnected episodic format, with each successive act or chapter being a recounting of a separate case. These include a jealous killing among her circle of friends, an obsessive biology teacher attempting to bring back a beloved student, a tussle with bank robbers, and a stint as an unusual bodyguard for a dying goth-rock star. However, acts not featuring Reiko begin to appear, which cut away to the exploits of teenage serial killer Saki Yurikawa. Driven by a fanatical desire to have a younger sister to care for, Yurikawa kidnaps young girls and tries to force them into a sisterly role, but they inevitably end up fearing and hating her, causing her to become enraged and murder them. In the final chapters, Reiko and Yurikawa's paths converge when Reiko is called in to a hospital by the police to revive one of Yurikawa's victims. The young zombie goes berserk and tracks down Yurikawa, who happens to be in the hospital at the time with another girl. Reiko and Yurikawa fight; Reiko is killed, but, having anticipated this, manages to zombify herself with a tape-recorded incantation. She defeats Yurikawa, but not before being reduced herself to only a severed head, apparently lifeless. Yurikawa eventually becomes her \\"contract\\" zombie as the series furthers. =Volume Two= After a chance confrontation between two opposing factions of necromancers, Reiko manages to attach her head to a freshly killed body, returning her to non-zombie status. She joins forces with a group of young zombie summoners, Yuki and Rudoh, who oppose the more malevolent majority consisting of a cult of necromancers led by Reiko's elder sister Riruka, who seek \\"global zombification\\". In this volume, a Shin Megami Tensei-like element is introduced, whereby summoners each have a \\"faithful zombie\\" they can call forth to fight on their side. Reiko's faithful is a zombified (and significantly more scantily-clad) Yurikawa, now mindlessly and speechlessly bound to Reiko's will. Along with the adversary Riruka, a new major ally is introduced in this volume - a mercenary named Jasmine, a somewhat vapid and heartless but talented fighter, who interrupts a climactic fight scene to offer her skills to the highest bidder. Reiko rejects her steep asking price, but saves her life, thereby indebting her to her cause. The volume ends with Reiko and Jasmine fighting their way through Riruka's mansion, one of Riruka's assistants having tricked Reiko's summoner friends into killing one another. Characters *Reiko Himezono: Reiko is the main character of the manga. She is a \\"Zombie Shop,\\" a necromancer-for-hire who brings the dead back to life, for a price. Reiko manages to keep her business ethics and her personal feelings separate, following out her contracts with her clients word by word. If by any chance her client has violated his end of the bargain, such as skimping on the bill, is engaging in criminal activity (such as an incident where Reiko encountered two kidnappers who assaulted her once their plan was discovered) or keeping any details about her job secret, she voids the contract and leaves them to the mess they have made. Reiko is very down-to-earth and miserly, being almost always driven by money. She even goes as far as to charge her friend for a job. In the first volume, when she becomes hired by a famous rock star named Shilaw to re-animate him on stage if anything should happen, he offers to pay her over 3,000,000 yen, and she hopes throughout the story that he does die so she can collect the money. She is reduced to a severed head by the end of the first volume due to Saki Yurikawa, but her head is then attached to the body of a recently killed teenage girl. *Riruka Himezono: Riruka is Reiko's psychotic and megalomaniacal twin sister, introduced in the second volume. While Riruka appears to have an unlimited number of zombies at her disposal, Holy Mithras is the only one that is given a name. Riruka dreams of ruling the world with a zombie army at her command, but the one thorn in her side has been her sister. Her backstory was given in the third volume. Since she was a child, Riruka had taken great pleasure in causing fear in her sister, and used her summoning powers on small animals which she butchered and sewed together. Her parents, who had given both girls equal love and attention, considered sending Riruka away and chose Reiko to be the Zombie Shop's successor, so Riruka orchestrated their death in an airplane crash using a zombified rat hidden in their luggage. Reiko and Riruka were then sent to separate orphanages and did not see one another for years. During Riruka's time in an orphanage, her abilities caught the eye of a group of summoners, whom quickly fell under her control as she began dreaming of world conquest. It is also revealed that she was shot in the head by a shell of fate and was made into a zombie slave at some point. However, because she was looking in the mirror prior to being shot, Riruka retained her free will and brutally mutilated her servant Shiroko as punishment for her betrayal before becoming obsessed with the superhuman powers the Shell of Fate had given her and going on a murderous rampage to hunt down the Star Collector. At this point, she becomes more of an antihero rather than a villain. She is killed at the beginning of Volume 7 during a battle with a zombie created from one of the shells of fate when said zombie impaled her with a katana, but Riruka manages to redeem herself by killing the zombie and her soul is taken into Hell by a limbless psychopomp after Riruka makes peace with Reiko. Riruka later returns as the zombie servant of Chigusa, only appearing when her summoner is endangered. The Shell of Fate granted Riruka immense superhuman strength, impressive regeneration abilities, and the ability to resist pain, even when her body was destroyed by gunfire. While possessing the shell of fate, Riruka was also capable of producing a series of lethal tentacles that she could use to impale her enemies on. A notable trait about Riruka is that despite her knowledge of summoning and her incredible power, she is shown to be illiterate and completely uneducated without her summoning powers, much to the annoyance of her assistant Shiroko. *Shiroko Zeromoto: Dr. Zero's manipulative, cowardly daughter. Shiroko is a slightly masculine woman who acts as the assistant of Riruka. After obtaining the shells of fate, she attempted to use them to make Riruka a zombie slave. However, since Riruka was looking in a hand mirror prior to being shot, Riruka retained her free will and using her newly acquired superhuman strength, brutally tore Shiroko's leg off. Just as Shiroko was about to be finished off by her master, Shiroko was gunned down by a member of a militant group while Riruka survived the shooting. *Jasmine Mendosa: A friend of Reiko, and the self-proclaimed \\"Beautiful Mercenary.\\" Her faithful zombie is Victory Katana. She is introduced in the second volume when she helps Reiko, Yuki, Rudoh, and Mayo against Suipin and her four compatriots during the bus ride to Riruka's mansion. Jasmine is the only survivor of the events that occurred in Riruka's mansion besides Reiko, and has since joined her on other adventures later on in the series. Jasmine is the first black character introduced in the series. As the story progresses during Volume seven and onwards, Jasmine becomes more muscular in physique. *Yuki Tohdoh: A friend of Reiko's, and the elder brother of Mayo Tohdoh. His faithful zombie is Jack Guns. Yuki was originally a friend of Ryoka Amano (along with Rudoh Mishima) before Reiko grafted her head onto Ryoka's body. When he was younger, he took his sister Mayo's doll and ran across a busy street with it. When Mayo attempted to give chase, her legs were torn apart by an oncoming car, and she was permanently crippled. This experience has haunted Yuki for his entire life, and was revealed during the second volume when Sinner's Nightmare (the faithful zombie of Riruka's servant Tracy), spat its non-lethal venom onto the protagonists. Ultimately, Yuki was tempted with the promise of having Mayo's legs fixed by Dr. Zero under the condition that he kill Rudoh. After killing Rudoh (much to Mayo's dismay), Yuki discovers Dr. Zero's deception and attacks him. However, Yuki eviscerated with a claymore by Dr. Zero, one of Riruka's most trusted servants. However, in his dying moments, Yuki orders Jack Guns to impale Dr. Zero with a large cross Jack had been tied to. *Tracey: A frail young woman who serves as a guard of Riruka's mansion. She is shot dead by Jack Guns after she used her zombie Sinner's Nightmare to cause Yuki to remember his sister being hit by a car. *Risa Nekogami: A young necromancer who worked alongside Ideto Tanii to kill Reiko and her friends. Despite possessing the cruelty of a child, she is extremely cowardly. After Chameleon Model Six was destroyed by Jack and Robin, Nekogami becomes desperate and attempts to make peace with Reiko by offering her information after Riruka disowned her for not being able to summon any other zombies. However, Saki beheads Nekogami while Reiko zombifies her severed head to get information on Riruka's current location. *Roses Killmister: A particularly cruel necromancer fully devoted to Riruka. She does not allow anybody but her master to touch her, and she retaliates with extreme violence towards anybody who does not act in accordance to her expectations. She ultimately commits suicide upon losing her zombie, Black Widow. *Mayo Todoh: A friend of Reiko's, and the younger sister of Yuki Todoh. Her faithful zombie (revealed to exist at the end of the Riruka's mansion arc) is Eddie, King of Aces. Mayo is paraplegic, as a result of her legs being torn apart by an oncoming car after attempting to cross the street to get her doll back from her brother Yuki, who had taken it as a prank. Ultimately, Mayo was disemboweled by Riruka. *Rudoh Mishima: A friend of Reiko's. His faithful zombie is General Robin Davis. He was originally the friend of both Ryoka Amano and Yuki Todoh. Yuki dislikes his \\"friends die, so keep going\\" attitude. Ultimately, he is shot dead by Jack Guns after Yuki betrayed Rudoh. *Dr. Zero: A scientist responsible for the creation of several zombies. He is known for his violent temper, often assaulting his servants for trivial reasons. Later, he tempts Yuki with the promise of restoring Mayo's legs to working condition if he killed Rudoh. However, Dr. Zero had been deceiving Yuki and later attempted to kill Yuki with a claymore Robin left behind after being torn to pieces by Dr. Zero's zombie, Medical Death. Dr. Zero is finally killed by Jack Guns in retaliation for Yuki being betrayed by him. Dr. Zero is later revealed to be the father of Shiroko and his real last name is Zeromoto. *Ryoka Amano: A summoner and friend of Yuki and Rudoh. Her faithful zombie is Rickhart Heidrich. Her origins are never explained, as she is abruptly introduced at the beginning of volume two and soon thereafter is beheaded. However, later on, Ryoka's head is zombified by Reiko, and she appears to help battle in Riruka's mansion with Rickhart. *Star Collector: A flamboyant, foul-mouthed summoner with the ability to steal the summoning powers of other summoners. He does this for no other reason other than for pleasure, yet admits he is afraid of people taking revenge on him. Despite his muscular, intimidating appearance and having a mass number of zombies under his command, The Star Collector is in reality a weak coward who goes into a state of fear and panic in a second, preferring to run away from confrontations rather than try to kill his opponents. He manages to steal the powers of Reiko and Riruka, but was forced to return the summoning powers of Reiko in order to forge an alliance with her. However, this alliance is soon short lived after he was shot in the head by an assailant from a militant group who had been pursuing Reiko and Riruka, much to Reiko's horror. It is unclear whether or not the summoning powers he had stolen returned to their respective owners after he was killed. *Ideto Tanii: A sadomasochistic necromancer with a goth like appearance reminiscent of Cradle of Filth vocalist Daniel Filth. He is commonly seen wearing various finger armour on his hands, which he uses to harm himself or others. Tanii also has a habit of placing his hands over his face when he becomes annoyed with his colleagues. He is capable of controlling people via he zombie servant Mudo Kalambra, often sending out those he curses to commit murder and leaving the victim to blame for the crime. Tanii attempts to possess Azusa as a hostage and has her commit various murders. He later reveals that any pain inflicted on him or Mudo will be inflicted on the possessed. However, he is killed by Saki Yurikawa, taking Azusa with him as a result of the possession. Zombies *Saki Yurikawa: Introduced in the first volume's side-stories, titled Dead Sister, Saki is a teenaged serial killer, a homicidal maniac who forces young girls to be her \\"little sister\\", and then brutally murders them when they refuse. When she was younger her original little sister, Midori ended up comatose after a younger Saki knocked her down a flight of stairs while trying to imitate the character of a magical girl anime series Saki use to watch. Since then, she's murdered over thirty young girls, and others who have gotten in her way. Saki meets her demise when she crosses paths with Reiko who, even reduced to a severed head, manages to kill Saki by summoning the souls of the people she's killed, leaving Saki to be forever tormented in Hell. From that point in the series, Saki serves the role as Reiko's faithful zombie, silently following Reiko's orders. It is unknown whether or not Saki's mute personality was a side-effect of the zombification or a result of post- traumatic stress disorder while she was imprisoned in Hell. Despite her murderous intentions, Saki has a fondness of sweets to the point where she once skipped school to get a sundae. *Midori Yurikawa: Midori is Saki's sixteen-year-old sister. She is shown as a generally weak, timid, but friendly young girl who goes into a berserker like state when angered. Ten years prior to the main storyline, Saki would frequently torment her as a child and would force her into playing different games with her (most of which ended in Midori getting beaten or injured). After being kicked down the stairs by Saki, she ended up in a coma and awoke ten years later with the mind of a six-year-old in a sixteen-year-old body. It was then that Midori was rehabilitated by Dr. Akiyama, who shared a mother-daughter type relationship with her (some scenes show Akiyama protecting Midori from the press, praising Midori for completing her kanji drills, and at one point reprimanding her for blaming a broken window on someone). After meeting Akiyama's daughter Natsumi, the two of them started to become friends. However, this friendship ended when a vengeful waitress mistook Midori for Saki and exposed Midori's relation to Saki, which caused Natsumi to hate her and eventually assaulting Midori. This incident (and the memories of the abuse Midori endured)caused Midori to finally snap and kill Natsumi. Her death attracted the unwanted attention of her Yakuza father, whom Midori quickly killed along with all his men. Midori was soon discovered by Reiko and was informed that Akiyama had committed suicide and needed a carrier of bombay blood type which Midori happened to be a carrier of. Midori donated her blood to save Akiyama's life, only to be murdered by the doctor, much to Reiko's chagrin. Midori later returns as the zombie servant of Reiko Himezono and proves to be a stronger zombie compared to Saki, preferring to use her fists in combat instead of a melee weapon. *Victory Katana: The faithful zombie of Jasmine. It is unknown what the zombie did during its life, but it is possible it may have been an illegal arms dealer. In death it serves Jasmine by providing her with a large array of melee weapons that Jasmine can use to defend herself. Victory Katana appears as a short masculine figure wearing what appears to be a poncho and a gas mask, with a huge backpack full of weapons on its back. *Mudo Kalambra: The zombie servant of Ideto Tanii. In life, Mudo was a former witch doctor of a South American tribe who would curse his victims and have them commit various crimes, then leave the cursed victim to blame for the crimes. Also, any pain that is inflicted on Mudo or his summoner will be inflicted onto the cursed. Mudo is shown dressed in tribal wear with his eyes sewn together, reflecting Tanii's masochistic behavior. *Jack Guns: The faithful zombie of Yuki. In life, Jack was an outlaw in the old west who was ambushed and killed by the local sheriff during a train robbery. He carries a large wooden crucifix on his back and fights with two pistols. Jack Guns is one of the only zombies capable of actually speaking. *Artificial Being No. 8: A zombie servant of Dr. Zero. Unlike other zombies, she is shown to have been artificially created (much like the bio weapons in Resident Evil or House of the Dead). She is shown to be capable of tearing her body apart to reveal numerous sharp teeth and tentacles. One notable running gag is that she is frequently assaulted by other necromancers, much to No. 8's chagrin. *Black Widow: A zombie servant of Killmister. She's an artificially created zombie made out of at least three pairs of arms, three heads and the remnants of several female victims. Black Widow's body is completely hollow; this allows her to be extremely fast. In spite of being highly skilled at surprise attacks and assassinations, she's mediocre at best at hand-to-hand combat; any attack will most likely decimate her body as she has no internal organs. Black Widow was ultimately defeated by a well-connected kick, which exposed her spine. *Chameleon Model Six: The zombie servant of Nekogami. It is unknown what he did in a past life, but it is implied he may be a creation of Dr. Zero as Artificial being No. 8 was shown to possess similar characteristics to his body. Chameleon appears as an androgynous young man who was at first mistaken for a summoner. However, he is revealed to be a shapeshifting zombie with a large right arm composed of the flesh of various animal corpses. He is killed by Jack and Robin when he attempted to assault Reiko. So far Chameleon is one of the only zombies capable of speaking normally. *Eddie, King of Aces: The faithful zombie of Mayo. In life, Eddie was a World War II pilot who fought in the Battle of Great Britain, his heart coincidentally stopping as his plain was overpowered by several German pilots. In death, Eddie appears only once, piloting his plane the Supermarine Spitfire. He wears only military fatigues. *General Robin Davis: The faithful zombie of Rudoh. In life, Robin was a knight who fought and died during the Wars of the Roses in 1455. In death, he defends Rudoh with a large claymore. He wears a suit of shining armor. *Rickhart Heidrich: The faithful zombie of Ryoka. In life, Rickhart was a soldier in the armored division of Nazi Germany who was killed in 1941 by friendly fire during the Invasion of the Soviet Union. In death, he protects Ryoka with a random hail of gunfire from a machine gun. Rickhart has a large gash in his face, which impairs his speech and wears military fatigues.

(The final novel in the trilogy, The City in Stone, was completed by Eisenstein; when Meisha Merlin suddenly ceased operations in 2007, it was left orphaned and remains unpublished.) Plot Spurned by a rejected offer of marriage, the demon sorcerer Smada Rezhyk begins imagining that the sorceress Lady Delivev Ormoru of Castle Spinweb is plotting to bring him down. He sends his most faithful demon servant, Gildrum, to take the form of a handsome knight, who has been injured in battle and comes to Castle Spinweb for refuge with the plan to impregnate Delivev with a child. For this purpose, Rezhyk gives the demon his seed; once Delivev is with child, Rezhyk imagines that he has eleven days to prepare his defenses until Delivev discovers the weakening of her powers and aborts the child. What he does not imagine is that the sorceress will not abort her son, or that his faithful demon servant will fall in love with his mortal enemy. Once the son, Cray Ormoru, reaches maturity, he starts on a journey as a knight to discover what became of his mysterious father. Cray gains a few clues to the real identity of his father; he eventually realizes that he will be unable to complete his quest as a knight. Consequently, he decides to take up an apprenticeship as a sorcerer instead, following in his mother's footsteps. Rezhyk volunteers to play the role of master to Cray, but secretly seeks to sabotage his magical education. Cray is discouraged, although this turns to anger when Gildrum reveals Rezhyk's falsehood. Gildrum secretly teaches Cray demon summoning. He learns that Rezhyk is his father and abandons his apprenticeship; Rezhyk tires of his duplicity and orders Cray's death. Gildrum manages to twist his orders from Rezhyk and hides Cray in the demon realms and continues to teach him sorcery. Cray befriends several demons and realizes that he will gain easier success by using demon allies instead of demon slaves. As freed demon slaves cannot be re-enslaved, he offers to free demons permanently in return for their service. With an army of demons he returns to defeat Rezhyk, who is already seeking to destroy Delivev. With Rezhyk finally vanquished, Gildrum is able to reveal his hidden passion for Delivev.

The team was based in Toledo, Ohio, and formed part of the Tri-State League for one season. Their home games were played at Speranza Park in Toledo. In 1889, the Maumees moved to the International Association, where they were also known as the Toledo Black Pirates. Managed by former player Charlie Morton, the team finished in fourth place with a 54-51 record. Toledo first baseman Perry Werden won the batting title with a .394 average while leading the league in hits (167). In 1890 the team joined the American Association. Again with Morton at the helm, the Maumees won 68 games, lost 64, and finished fourth in the nine-team league.

He was noted for designing Messerschmitt's Kabinenroller (cabinscooter) KR175 and KR200 microcars, for co-founding FMR, the company that took over production of the Kabinenrollers in 1956, and for designing the FMR Tg500, a sports microcar based on the Kabinenroller. Fend continued his career as an inventor and designer after the KR200 ended production. Fend was working on another lightweight vehicle project shortly before his death. Rosenheim workshop After the Second World War, Fend, who had been a technical officer with the Luftwaffe, opened a workshop in Rosenheim, Germany. In 1948, he devised an invalid carriage in the form of a tricycle. The front wheel of the tricycle was powered by pushing the handlebars back and forth. Originally designed with bicycle wheels, it was redesigned with scooter wheels in order to make the carriage lower. Fend later made a version that was powered by a Victoria two-stroke engine.Wagner, p.164 =Fend Flitzer= Fend Flitzer 101 Fend then designed and built the Fend Flitzer, an invalid carriage designed from the start to be powered by an engine. He reversed the layout of his original tricycle, giving the Flitzer two front wheels and one rear wheel. As with usual convention, the front wheels were steered while the rear wheel was powered. About 250 Flitzers were built between 1948 and the end of production in 1951. =Utility vehicles= In addition to the invalid carriages, Fend designed and built the Fend Lastenroller, a three-wheeled forecar moped with a cargo platform or trunk between the front wheels. Messerschmitt 1954 Messerschmitt KR175 1955 Messerschmitt KR200 Many Flitzer buyers were not invalids but healthy people seeking basic personal transportation. This led Fend to design the Fend 150, a larger, two-passenger car based on the concepts of the Flitzer. With mass production in mind, Fend approached Willy Messerschmitt with a proposal for Messerschmitt AG to build a more developed version of the Fend 150.Fritz Fend's Marvelous Micro-cars Messerschmitt, needing products to build to keep his factories working, accepted the Fend 150, which was still being developed, and the Lastenroller, which was put into production. =KR175= The development of the Fend 150 led to the production of the Messerschmitt KR175, which began in February 1953. Development continued after production began, resulting in 70 modifications of the design by June 1953.Microcar Museum: 1954 Messerschmitt KR175 However, the KR175's excellent road manners and relative lack of width made it a good city commuter.Wagner, p.167 =KR200= In 1955, Messerschmitt replaced the KR175 with the KR200. Apart from a larger engine, the KR200 had improved suspension (introducing shock absorbers to the design), improved engine mounting, larger tires, improved controls, and a means by which to reverse the car. Reverse was accomplished not by including a reverse gear in the transmission but by reversing the rotation of the engine itself.Wagner, p.168 KR200 production expanded to three models in 1957 with the introduction of the \\"Kabrio\\" convertible and the KR201 Roadster.Wagner, p.169 Production of the KR200 was heavily reduced in 1962 and ceased in 1964 FMR FMR Mokuli 130 In 1956, Messerschmitt was allowed to manufacture aircraft again and lost interest in Fend's microcars. Messerschmitt sold the Regenburg works to Fend, who, with brake and hub supplier Valentin Knott, formed Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau GmbH, Regensburg (FMR) to continue production of the KR200 and his other vehicles. FMR was allowed to continue using the Messerschmitt name and logo on the KR200. The Fend Lastenroller was developed into the FMR Mokuli, versions of which were manufactured by FMR until 1972, after which the production line was shipped of to Morocco. The Mokuli was originally capable of carrying later versions thereof had stronger and smaller front wheels and either capacities. The name is a portmanteau of moped and kuli (coolie). =Tg500= FMR Tg500 Fend developed the four- wheeled, twin-cylinder FMR Tg500 from the platform that had begun with the KR175. The front suspension, monocoque, and bodywork ahead of the rear sub- frame was derived from the KR200, but the rear sub-frame bore a suspension and drivetrain with twice the number of wheels and an engine with twice the number of cylinders and more than twice the displacement. The Tg500 was aimed primarily at sporting enthusiasts and was built from 1958 to 1961.Wagner, p.169-171 About 320 were made.Microcar Museum: 1959 FMR Tg500 After FMR Fritz Fend left FMR after they stopped building the KR200.Wagner, p.171 Fend continued his career as a technical designer and an inventor. He invented an alarm that went on if the key was removed from a car ignition while the lights were still on, a feature that became popular after his patent ran out. =Last project and death= In the 1990s, Fend began working on the F2000, a modern low-weight low-drag vehicle reminiscent of the Kabinenroller. The project had reached the prototype stage, and a four-wheeled vehicle was built. The project ended when Fend died on 22 November 2000 after a massive stroke.

A maqam (), which in Arabic literally means 'place', is a standard melody type and set of related tunes. The melodies used in a given maqam aims effectively to express the emotional state of the reader throughout the set liturgy (without changing the text). This article primarily describes the musical practices of Syrian Jews, though the musical traditions of other Mizrahi Jews communities are also based on the maqam system. Ashkenazi nusach includes a simplified system including three main modes or steyger and several minor variants. Muslims share the same practice of conducting services using the maqam, but differ substantially in many ways. Application of the maqam system The maqam that is used each Shabbat depends on the theme, story, or main message of the Sabbath weekly Torah portion. The cantor, or hazzan, of the congregation leads the worshippers with the melodies of the particular maqam, which is preset and standardized on an official list. Widely different lists of maqam are found in different communities, e.g. the Aleppo list does not always agree with the Damascus and Beirut lists, and the Egyptian and Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Sephardic) lists are different again. Even within the Aleppo tradition there is not total agreement among the written sources, though the underlying pattern of the lists is usually the same. Other determinants of the maqam include whether or not there is a holiday approaching in the upcoming week: when this is the case, or there are two Torah portions for the week, the hazzan has some discretion which maqam to use. As a general rule, the same maqam will never be used two weeks in a row. Also, the list tries to rotate the maqamot in such a fashion that the ten maqams are spread out almost equally in time as to avoid the redundancy of hearing the same maqam within a short period of time. Most of the prayers in the Shabbat morning service are rendered in a prose recitative, the exact tune of which varies with the maqam of the week. However, certain important passages, such as Nishmat and Kaddish, are sung to the tunes of specific Pizmonim, which are chosen according to a rota so as to fit the maqam of the week. The cantillation of the Torah does not follow the maqam of the week, but is almost invariably performed in maqam Sigah. Similarly the Friday night service is usually in maqam Nawa or Nahawand. Thematic Patterns There are a few patterns that determine which maqam will be used on a given week. There are some very obvious patterns and some not so obvious ones (which are disputed as a result). =Maqam Rast= *Maqam Rast is used to mark the beginning of something new, such as the beginning of reading a new book of Torah (ras, in Arabic, means \\"head\\"). For the first parasha of each book of the Humash, Bereshit, Shemot, Vayiqra, Bemidbar, and (theoretically, but see under Hijaz) Devarim, this maqam is applied. Another application of Rast is for the Afternoon Services of the Sabbath when Jews read the new parasha of the upcoming week; thus beginning a new week. =Maqam Mahour= *Maqam Mahour, which is related to Maqam Rast, is applied when someone is angry and there is a feeling of emotional instability. The only two parashiot to have this maqam applied is Toledot and Balak when the main characters, Esau and Balak respectively, are angered. This maqam is used in other instances according to the manuscripts of Hakham Moshe Ashear and Cantor Gabriel A. Shrem. =Maqam Ajam= *Maqam Ajam, named after the Arabic word for \\"Iranian\\", is used to mark happy occasions such as holidays, weddings, and other joyous occasions. This maqam is used on Beshallach (Shabbat Shirah), Vayetze and Shoftim due to the happy occasions mentioned in those parashas. Ajam is also used on the second days of the Shalosh Regalim holidays. Ajam resembles a Western major scale, and is sometimes looked down upon as facile and obvious, in much the same way that the Ionian or major mode was described as modus lascivus and not favoured in medieval church music. =Maqam Nahwand= *Maqam Nahwand, named after NahƒÅwand/NahƒÅvand, a city in Iranian Hamadan province, is applied when there is disharmony between parties and fights, in general. A related maqam is Rahawi Nawa (see below), but this has sunk in popularity and therefore most cantors almost always replace Rahawi Nawa with Maqam Nahwand, due to the surplus and variety of more Western- oriented songs in Nahwand, which closely resembles the western minor scale. Until the 20th century, this maqam was never used for the purpose of prayers by either Jews or Muslims. (Similarly in the Middle Ages the minor or Aeolian mode, though acknowledged to exist, was never used in Gregorian chant.) =Maqam Bayat= *Maqam Bayat is a somber or dull sounding maqam and doesn't necessarily imply a given theme. It is commonly recited in a low pitch to express darkness. As a general rule, this maqam is applied to all Bar Mitzvahs and to Saturday Night services, due to the abundance of related pizmonim in those maqams. Some say that Bayat symbolizes an oath between two parties (as is the case with Bar Mitzvah- an oath between man and God). =Maqam Hoseni= *Maqam Hoseni, which is closely related to Maqam Bayat in sound, is used to express the beauty of something.·∏§asan in Arabic means fine or beautiful, and ·∏•usayn is the diminutive of that, as well as being a personal name. For example, when the Ten Commandments are given, in Parashat Yitro and Va'ethanan, this maqam is applied to show its beauty. The same is the case to show the erection of the Tabernacle, in parashat Terumah, Vayaqhel, and Shemini. This maqam is used on the Shabbat preceding Shavuot, when the Torah is given to Israel (though not on Shavuot itself). =Maqam Rahawi Nawa= *Maqam Rahawi Nawa is applied at the end of most books. Among many things, it symbolizes the end of something. This maqam is applied every Friday night during the Kabbalat Shabbat services. At the present, this maqam is rarely used for Shabbat morning services, as it is usually replaced by maqam Nahwand. Strictly speaking, Rahawi and Nawa are two separate maqamat: Rahawi is used in the Passover Haggadah (Seder), while Nawa is used for reciting the Mishnah (hence its use for Friday night, as this service contains a long excerpt from the Mishnah known as Bammeh madliqin.). =Maqam Sabah= *Maqam Sabah, literally in Arabic, sadness and utopia, and literally in Hebrew, army, is used to mark 'berit' or covenant. A covenant, or circumcision is performed on all Jewish male babies and therefore when there is a birth of a baby boy in the parasha (Lech Lecha or Tazria), this maqam is applied. Not only would 'berit milah' require this maqam, but also any reference to the word 'berit' or a strong reference to the number eight, which symbolizes covenant. Since the idea of 'berit' relates to the observance of mitzvot, wherever there is a parasha where there is a multitude of mitzvot, this maqam is applied (Mishpatim, Qedoshim, or Behar). Other uses of Sabah include any parasha that mentions the army (Masei, Ki Tetse), since the word 'Saba' in Hebrew means \\"army\\". Kligman notes that the Jewish association of Sabah with the aforementioned themes differs drastically from the rest of the Arab world, who associate Sabah with sadness. =Maqam Sigah= *Maqam Sigah, or Sikah, from the Persian for \\"third place\\",So called because the scale is an inversion of maqam rast, starting on the third note of that scale: that note is itself called sigah. is applied when there are special readings in the parasha. It is also applied on holidays. This maqam is linked to the holiday of Purim due to the abundance of pizmonim related to the holiday in this maqam (no doubt because the maqam is of Persian origin, and the events of the book of Esther take place in Persia). This maqam is also of importance because it is the maqam that is used for the cantillation of the Torah. For Parashas Bo, Beha'alotecha, and Eqeb, parashas that are the \\"third\\" in their respective books, maqam Sigah, which means \\"third [place],\\" is used. =Maqam Hijaz= *Maqam Hijaz, which is named after a Hijaz region in Arabia, is used to mark solemn occasions. When there is a death in the parasha (Sarah and Abraham in Chayei Sarah, Jacob and Joseph in Vayechi, or Nadab and Abihu in Acharei Mot), or a tragic episode (Golden Calf in Ki Tissa, Sin of the Spies in Shelach Lecha and the Temple's Destruction in the week of Devarim), then this maqam is applied. At funerals, this maqam is usually applied. As it corresponds to the Ashkenazi ahavah rabbah steiger, synagogues in Israel sometimes use it when there are Ashkenazi guests.

In 1790, Lady Niohuru became a secondary consort of Yongyan, the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. She gave birth on 2 August 1793 to his seventh daughter, who would die prematurely in July or August 1795, and on 6 August 1795 to his third son, Miankai. =Jiaqing era= On 9 February 1796, the Qianlong Emperor abdicated in favour of Yongyan and became a Retired Emperor, while Yongyan was enthroned as the Jiaqing Emperor. On 12 February 1796, Lady Niohuru was granted the title \\"Noble Consort\\". When the Jiaqing Emperor's primary consort, Empress Xiaoshurui, died of illness on 5 March 1797, Lady Niohuru was placed in charge of the emperor's harem, making her a de facto Empress, and was elevated to \\"Imperial Noble Consort\\". The Jiaqing Emperor wanted to make Lady Niohuru his new Empress but had to wait until the mourning period for Empress Xiaoshurui was over. The Qianlong Emperor died on 7 February 1799 so Lady Niohuru's promotion to Empress was delayed until 27 May 1801. Lady Niohuru was put in charge of the upbringing of Minning, the Jiaqing Emperor's second son who was born to Empress Xiaoshurui. She took care of Minning and treated him well, and they shared a close and harmonious relationship.Weng (1998). On 9 March 1805, Lady Niohuru gave birth to the emperor's fourth son, Mianxin. =Daoguang era= When the Jiaqing Emperor died on 2 September 1820 before designating one of his sons as Crown Prince, the decision on the succession was left to Lady Niohuru, who became Empress Dowager. Lady Niohuru proclaimed Minning the new emperor before an imperial edict was officially issued. She ordered her servants to deliver the message to Minning, who was away in Chengde at the time. Minning rushed back to the Forbidden City and was enthroned as the Daoguang Emperor. The Daoguang Emperor was extremely pleased with Lady Niohuru's decision to make him emperor, claiming that she was broad-minded because she did not misuse her power to name either of her two sons as the new emperor. The Daoguang Emperor also granted Lady Niohuru the title \\"Empress Dowager Gongci\\". Lady Niohuru moved to the Forbidden City's Palace of Longevity and Health, which was traditionally a residence of the emperor's mother. In 1836, Lady Niohuru celebrated her 60th birthday. The Daoguang Emperor donned his formal court regalia for the occasion. He first went to the Hall of Central Harmony, where he read a memorial for the Empress Dowager to wish her well. He then mounted a cart and rode through the right Wing Gate to the left Gate of Eternal Health, where he disembarked. Carrying the memorial in his hands, the emperor was accompanied by an entourage of nobles and high-ranking officials. After the emperor delivered his message and birthday gifts, the retinue jointly presented Lady Niohuru with a court scepter.Veritable Records of Emperor Xuanzong of Qing. DG272:66-7.

After guiding Luton through their first post-war season, he was appointed as Newcastle United's first manager since the end of World War II in May 1947. One of his decisions at the club was surprisingly to sell prolific goalscorer and fans' favourite Len Shackleton to Sunderland for ¬£13,000. This concerned some supporters and Martin was at first criticised for making this move.Manager Profile: George Martin, Toon1892 However the protests were short-lived as Newcastle gained promotion without Shackleton and other popular players were introduced ‚Äì these included the club's current second highest all-time goal-scorer, Jackie Milburn. He resigned from Newcastle in 1950 after establishing them as a top six side in the First Division and took over at struggling Aston Villa. He later returned to Luton for a short-lived spell in 1965; he left a year later.

Early life and career Brochu was born on October 29, 1944 in Quebec City, Quebec. He was employed by Adams Distilleries from 1976 to 1978, then by the Seagram distillery from 1978 to 1985, where he served as the executive vice-president from 1982 to 1985. Montreal Expos He was named president of the Montreal Expos baseball club by Charles Bronfman in 1986, replacing John McHale. On June 14, 1991, he formed a public-private partnership of 13 investors to buy the team and prevent a threatened move to Arizona or to Miami, where retired Miami banker Lou Poller had attempted to purchase and move them.https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1991-06-11-9103030265-story.html Brochu used C$2 million from his own funds to make this purchase. He was the largest shareholder, with 7% of the shares, and became managing general partner. However, the team's other partners considered their investments to be the equivalent of charitable donations. They let it be known to Brochu that they would not commit any more money beyond their initial investment. As a result, even though Montreal was the fifth-largest market in baseball, Brochu was forced to run the Expos on a shoestring budget. Despite this, the Expos managed to assemble a core of players that included Mois√©s Alou, Marquis Grissom, Larry Walker and John Wetteland. In 1994, those players, led by manager Felipe Alou, had the best record in the majors when the strike cut the season short. They were poised to run away with the National League East, with most projections having them winning as many as 105 games. In the 1994-95 offseason, Brochu ordered general manager Kevin Malone to cut ties with several of the stars of that season. In a series of transactions that took place between April 5‚Äì8, Wetteland was traded to the New York Yankees, Ken Hill to the St. Louis Cardinals, and Grissom to the Atlanta Braves. Walker was a free agent, and the Expos allowed him to go to the Colorado Rockies without getting anything in return. The fans and press were savage in their condemnation of the fire sale. Years later, Brochu told writer Jonah Keri that he didn't want to unload Wettland, Hill, Grissom and Walker, but had no choice because of a dangerous depletion of capital. Had the other partners been willing to put the necessary money in, he said, he would have kept the players. His plan to save the team from bankruptcy was to build a new Baseball park in downtown Montreal, which would be named Labatt Park. He asked for subsidies from the Canadian and Quebec governments of the time, but when this attempt failed, he resigned in 1998 and sold his shares to New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria. In 2001, he published the book My Turn at Bat: The Sad Saga of the Expos, which blamed Quebec ex-premier Lucien Bouchard for the sale of the baseball team. Bouchard had told him that he wasn't willing to authorize public funding for a new park when he was being forced to close hospitals.

Career Portuguese royal favourite who, as effective governor of Portugal from 1662 to 1667 during the reign of Afonso VI, was responsible for the successful prosecution of the war against Spain, which led, in 1668, to Spanish recognition of Portugal's new ruling dynasty. Shortly after Afonso VI's coming-of-age in 1662, Castelo Melhor saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the mentally unstable king. He managed to convince the king that his mother, Luisa of Medina-Sidonia, was out to steal his throne and exile him from Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent. The King appointed Castelo Melhor his secret notary (escriv√£o da puridade), a position in which the favourite was able to exercise the functions of first minister. Castelo Melhor overcame the difficulties which had hitherto beset Portugal in the war against Spain, reorganizing the troops (now reinforced by an English contingent by virtue of the English king Charles II's marriage to Catherine of Braganza) and entrusting their command to competent generals. Consequently the Portuguese Restoration War entered a victorious phase for Portugal (1663‚Äì65) and Spain began peace negotiations. Agreement proved difficult to attain and meanwhile the internal political situation in Portugal deteriorated. Castelo Melhor and his Francophile party were losing ground to the Anglophile party. The King was obliged to dismiss Castelo Melhor on 9 September 1667, in a palace coup organized by the king's wife Maria Francisca of Nemours and brother Pedro . Shortly afterwards, the king himself was also deprived of power. Castelo Melhor went into exile in Paris and then London, but in 1685 he was permitted to return to Portugal and, two years after that, to court. On the accession of John V (1706), he was appointed a councillor of state and he continued to occupy a position of distinction until his death in 1720. He was also the 12th captain-major of Santa Maria Island in the Azores from 1667 to 1720.

During the 1980s and 1990s it served dually as a railroad station and restaurant.Great American Stations. Accessed March 27, 2013. History Many pioneers of Illinois's Logan County tried to develop towns within the county that could become the county seat and business center for local farmers. Early plats and developments include the Postville Courthouse State Historic Site and the Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site. A final decision on the county seat was not reached until 1853, when a railroad, the predecessor of what was to become the Chicago & Alton, laid tracks through the county as part of a trunk line from Chicago to St. Louis. Railroad management selected a site along the tracks for development, and named the new town after the railroad's lawyer, Abraham Lincoln. On August 27, 1853, Mr. Lincoln arrived from Springfield and led a ceremony by the railroad tracks to mark the founding of the new town. The successful lawyer paid a farmer to bring a wagonload of watermelons, which were handed out to the celebrants. Lincoln cut into one of the melons and \\"christened\\" the railroad trackside with the juice. Today The spot where this celebration took place is the site of the Lincoln, Illinois railroad depot complex today, and a watermelon monument stands on the south lawn of the former 1911 depot. The 2017 depot primarily serves passengers for Chicago, St. Louis, and points in between, as its predecessor did when the railroad was built in 1853. The 2017 renovation of the depot complex re-purposed former freight space as an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant station for train passengers, while making historic passenger space available for other uses. The $4.1 million renovation project was funded through United States Department of Transportation High Speed Rail Initiative money.

One of the first techniques was bird banding, placing passive ID tags on birds legs, to identify the bird in a future catch-and-release. Radio tracking involves attaching a small radio transmitter to the animal and following the signal with a RDF receiver. Sophisticated modern techniques use satellites to track tagged animals, and GPS tags which keep a log of the animal's location. One of the many goals of animal migration research has been to determine where the animals are going; however, researchers also want to know why they are going \\"there\\". Researchers not only look at the animals' migration but also what is between the migration endpoints to determine if a species is moving to new locations based on food density, a change in water temperature, or other stimulus, and the animal's ability to adapt to these changes. Migration tracking is a vital tool in efforts to control the impact of human civilization on populations of wild animals, and prevent or mitigate the ongoing extinction of endangered species.  Technologies  A monarch butterfly shortly after tagging at the Cape May Bird Observatory Cape May Bird Observatory is one of the organizations that has a monarch identification tagging program. Plastic stickers are placed on the wing of the insect with identification information. Tracking information is used to study the migration patterns of monarchs, including how far and where they fly.thumb In the fall of 1803, American Naturalist John James Audubon wondered whether migrating birds returned to the same place each year. So he tied a string around the leg of a bird before it flew south. The following spring, Audubon saw the bird had indeed come back. Scientists today still attach tags, such as metal bands, to track movement of animals. Metal bands require the re-capture of animals for the scientists to gather data; the data is thus limited to the animal's release and destination points. Recent technologies have helped solve this problem. Some electronic tags give off repeating signals that are picked up by radio devices or satellites while other electronic tags could include archival tags (or data loggers). Scientists can track the locations and movement of the tagged animals without recapturing them using this RFID technology or satellites. These electronic tags can provide a great deal of data. Modern technologies are also smaller, minimizing the negative impact of the tag on the animal.  Radio tracking  brush-tailed rock-wallabies is wearing a radio tracking collar. Tracking an animal by radio telemetry involves two devices. Telemetry, in general, involves the use of a transmitter that is attached to an animal and sends out a signal in the form of radio waves, just as a radio station does. A scientist might place the transmitter around an animal's ankle, neck, wing, carapace, or dorsal fin. Alternatively, they may surgically implant it as internal radio transmitters have the advantage of remaining intact and functioning longer than traditional attachments, being protected from environmental variables and wear.Original text (in public domain):\\"Internal radio transmitters have the advantage of remaining intact and functioning longer than traditional attachments. Implanted transmitters also are protected from extrinsic variables such as environmental elements and wear (Eagle et al. 1984).\\" (Lander et al. 2005) http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&context;=usdeptcommercepub (accessed 29 November 2012) The transmitter typically uses a frequency in the VHF band as antennas in this band are conveniently small. To conserve battery power the transmitter usually transmits brief pulses, perhaps one per second. A specialized radio receiver called a radio direction finding (RDF) receiver picks up the signal. The receiver is usually in a truck, an ATV, or an airplane. The receiver has a directional antenna (usually a simple Yagi antenna) which receives most strongly from a single direction, and some means of indicating the strength of the received signal, either by a meter or by the loudness of the pulses in earphones. The antenna is rotated until the received radio signal is strongest; then the antenna is pointing toward the animal. To keep track of the signal, the scientist follows the animal using the receiver. This approach of using radio tracking can be used to track the animal manually but is also used when animals are equipped with other payloads. The receiver is used to home in on the animal to get the payload back. Another form of radio tracking that can be utilized, especially in the case of small bird migration, is the use of geolocators or \\"geologgers\\". This technology utilizes a light sensor that tracks the light-level data during regular intervals in order to determine a location based on the length of the day and the time of solar noon. While there are benefits and challenges with using this method of tracking, it is one of the only practical means of tracking small birds over long distances during migration. Passive integrated transponders (PIT) are another method of telemetry used to track the movements of a species Passive integrated transponders, or \\"PIT tags\\", are electronic tags that allow researchers to collect data from a specimen without the need to recapture and handle the animal. Data is captured and monitored via electronic interrogation antennae, which records the time and location of the individual. Pit tags are a humane method of tracking that has little risk of infection or mortality due to the limited contact necessary to monitor the specimens. They are also cost- efficient in that they can be used repeatedly should the need arise to remove the tag from the animal.  Satellite tracking  A saltwater crocodile with GPS-based satellite transmitter for migration tracking Receivers can be placed in Earth-orbiting satellites such as ARGOS. Networks, or groups, of satellites are used to track animals. Each satellite in a network picks up electronic signals from a transmitter on an animal. Together, the signals from all satellites determine the precise location of the animal. The satellites also track the animal's path as it moves. Satellite-received transmitters fitted to animals can also provide information about the animals' physiological characteristics (e.g. temperature and habitat use.) Satellite tracking is especially useful because the scientists do not have to follow after the animal nor do they have to recover the tag to get the data on where the animal is going or has gone. Satellite networks have tracked the migration and territorial movements of caribou, sea turtles,http://www.seaturtle.org/ whales, great white sharks, seals, elephants, bald eagles, ospreys and vultures. Additionally Pop-up satellite archival tags are used on marine mammals and various species of fish. There are two main systems, the above- mentioned Argos and the GPS.Northern Bald Ibis Project Thanks to these systems, conservationists can find the key sites for migratory species. Another form of satellite tracking would be the use of acoustic telemetry. This involves the use of electronic tags that emit sound in order for the researchers to track and monitor an animal within three dimensions, which is helpful in instances when large quantities of a species are being tracked at a time.  Stable isotopes  Sea turtle eggs being laid by the mother. Unhatched eggs can be used in stable isotope analysis. Stable isotopes are one of the intrinsic markers used for studying migration of animals. One of the benefits of intrinsic markers in general, including stable isotope analysis, is that it does not require an organism to be capture and tagged and then recaptured at a later time. Each capture of an organism provides information on where it has been based on diet. The three types of intrinsic markers that can be used as tools for animal migration studies are: (1) contaminants, parasites and pathogens, (2) trace elements, and (3) stable isotopes. Certain geographic regions have specific stable isotope ratios that affect the chemistry of organisms foraging in those locations, this creates \\"isoscapes\\" that scientists can use to understand where the organism has been eating. A couple prerequisites must be met in order to use stable isotope analysis successfully: (1) the animal must have at least one light isotope of interest in specific tissues that can be sampled (this condition is almost always met since these light isotopes are building blocks of most animal tissues), and (2) the organism needs to migrate between isotopically different regions and these isotopes must be retained in the tissue in order for the differences to be measured. Stable isotope analysis has a lot of benefits and has been used in terrestrial and aquatic organisms. For example, stable isotope analysis has been confirmed to work in determining foraging locations of nesting loggerhead sea turtles. Satellite telemetry was used to confirm that the location derived from the analysis were accurate to where these turtles actually traveled. This is important because it allows for greater sample sizes to be used in migration studies, since satellite telemetry is expensive and tissue, blood, and egg samples can be taken from the female turtles laying eggs.  Importance  SeaTag-GEO on a turtle carrier platform for turtle tagging Electronic tags are giving scientists a complete, accurate picture of migration patterns. For example, when scientists used radio transmitters to track one herd of caribou, they learned two important things. First, they learned that the herd moves much more than previously thought. Second, they learned that each year the herd returns to about the same place to give birth. This information would have been difficult or impossible to obtain with \\"low tech\\" tags. Tracking migrations is an important tool to better understand and protect species. For example, Florida manatees are an endangered species, and therefore they need protection. Radio tracking showed that Florida manatees may travel as far as Rhode Island when they migrate. This information suggests that the manatees may need protection along much of the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Previously, protection efforts focused mainly in the Florida area. In the wake of the BP oil spill, efforts in tracking animals has increased in the Gulf. Most researchers who use electronic tags have only a few options: pop-up satellite tags, archival tags, or satellite tags. Historically these tags were generally expensive and could cost several thousands of dollars per tag. However, with current advancements in technology prices are now allowing researchers to tag more animals. With this increase in the number of species and individuals that can be tagged it is important to record and acknowledge the potential negative effects these devices might have.

The second named storm and third tropical cyclone of the season, Beryl developed from an upper-level low pressure area over the northeastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, the system intensified into a tropical storm about 24 hours after forming. Beryl then moved slowly northeastward and peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) before making landfall near Panama City, Florida, early on August 16\\\\. Within 12 hours of moving inland, the storm weakened to a tropical depression, but persisted as a tropical cyclone for a few days while traversing the Eastern United States. Beryl was absorbed by a frontal system while situated over Connecticut early on August 19\\\\. In Florida, above normal tides in the panhandle caused erosion, damaged several boats, and drowned two people. Tropical storm force winds left about 20,000 people without electricity, while flooding from heavy rainfall damaged vehicles and roads. Property damage in the state reached about $5.9 million (1994 USD). Farther inland, Beryl spawned many tornadoes and resulted in flooding as far north of New England. In South Carolina, the state suffering the most damage, a total of 23 tornadoes were spawned, including three rated F3 on the Fujita scale. One tornado in Lexington damaged or destroyed 200 homes and 40 to 50 buildings and caused about 15,000 people to lose power after damaging five electrical substations. The state of New York experienced the worst of the flooding, with flash flooding in the Susquehanna and western Catskills regions. Two deaths and $12 million in damage occurred in New York. Overall, Beryl left five fatalities and at least $74.22 million in damage. Meteorological history A large upper-level low pressure area developed over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean to the north of Puerto Rico on August 9\\\\. The disturbance moved westward, and despite weakening to a trough in the upper levels of the atmosphere, there was evidence of a low- to mid-level circulation off the southwest coast of Florida on August 12\\\\. The next day, surface observations and ship reports suggested the presence of a weak surface low pressure system. Moving towards the north-northwest, a cloud-pattern was identified on satellite imagery, and Dvorak estimates were initiated at 00:00 UTC on August 14\\\\. Based on data from surface observations, satellite imagery, and information from reconnaissance aircraft, the system is estimated to have become a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on August 14; at the time, the depression was located approximately south of Pensacola, Florida. Initially, the depression was predicted to move inland within the next 24 hours and intensify only slightly. The depression drifted slowly towards the north after being designated, while its poorly defined center of circulation became better defined. Between 16:30 and 20:11 UTC on August 14, the system was nearly stationary; a few hours later, there were indications that the storm's center reformed to the east of its original location. The depression tracked slowly towards the east-northeast while producing rainfall throughout portions of Florida. By early on August 15, the cyclone was becoming further organized, with satellite imagery indicating better defined rainbands. Shortly thereafter, wind observations suggested that the cyclone was approaching tropical storm intensity. A reconnaissance aircraft flight recorded winds of to the southeast of the center, while offshore and coastal stations measured sustained winds of and gusts up to . At 12:00 UTC on August 15, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl, based on a reconnaissance aircraft flight observing at an altitude of . Possibly influenced by a mesoscale featured noted to the south of Beryl's circulation, the center of circulation began moving erratically after being upgraded. However, in response to an approaching trough, the storm turned towards the north. At 00:00 UTC on August 16, Beryl reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 60 mph (95 km/h) and then made landfall near Panama City, Florida. It is estimated that the storm attained its minimum barometric pressure of about three hours after moving inland. About 12 hours after moving ashore, around 12:00 UTC on August 16, Beryl weakened to a tropical depression. With increasing forward motion, the depression continued towards the north-northeast. At 21:00 UTC, the National Hurricane Center ceased issuing advisories on Beryl, transferring responsibility to the Weather Prediction Center. Despite weakening, the system maintained rainbands accompanied by thunderstorms and heavy rainfall. The low continued to track northeastward; after passing through Connecticut, the low was absorbed into a frontal trough on August 19. Preparations In advance of the storm, a tropical storm watch was posted along of the Gulf Coast of Florida from Pensacola to Cedar Key on August 15\\\\. Later that day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning that extended from Fort Walton Beach to Yankeetown. The warning was discontinued for areas west of Apalachicola, and by 12:00 UTC on August 16, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were lifted. Initially, the public advisories issued by the National Hurricane Center on the storm warned primarily of heavy rain, as Beryl was expected to remain a weak cyclone. However, when the storm slowed in forward motion and the potential for intensification increased, the advisories emphasized the potential for coastal flooding. Tornado watches were issued for parts of Florida. Flash flood watches and warnings were also declared for parts of the state. Flash flood watches, warnings, and tornado watches were posted for portions of Georgia as Beryl progressed inland. Flash flood watches and warnings were also initiated throughout parts of South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, and Maryland. A tornado watch was declared for central and eastern North Carolina on August 17; similar advisories were placed into effect over parts of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Flash flood advisories were also issued northward into New York. Impact Tropical Storm Beryl was a weak system, and unlike Alberto, its rapid motion up the Eastern Seaboard spread its heavy rainfall across a large area. Beryl caused inland flooding as it moved through Georgia, across the Carolinas, and all the way to Connecticut. Property damage reached at least $74.22 million, with $40 million in damage in South Carolina, $15 million in Virginia, $12 million in New York, $5.9 million in Florida, and at least $1.32 million in Georgia. Five deaths were reported, while a large number of people - 37 in Lexington County, South Carolina, alone - were injured by the tornadoes Beryl produced as it weakened. =Florida= NEXRAD imagery of Tropical Storm Beryl making landfall in Florida on August 16 Along the coast of the Florida Panhandle, tides ranging from above normal were reported. Two people drowned due to rip currents produced by Beryl. Several moored boats were damaged, while three people on a fishing boat offshore were rescued. Coastal flooding and erosion occurred, undermining roads and homes and damaging seawalls. The highest observed precipitation total in the state was in Apalachicola, though heavier rainfall likely occurred in areas to the east. In addition, precipitation from Tropical Storm Alberto earlier in the season and Beryl produced nearly 30 in (762 mm) of rain in some areas of the Florida Panhandle in the span of barely more than a month. Flooding occurred in low-lying areas, damaging cars and homes. Oysters in the Apalachicola Bay could not be harvested in the prime winter of 1994, due to runoff from the sediment of rivers, from of rain. At the Tallahassee International Airport, a sustained wind speed of and a wind gust of were observed. Wind caused minor damage to roofs and downed trees, signs, and power lines, leaving about 20,000 customers without electricity. Damage in the state as a result of Beryl was estimated at $5.9 million. =Georgia and the Carolinas= Beryl dropped heavy rainfall in parts of Georgia, with up to observed in Tallulah Falls. About of precipitation fell in Habersham County in less than six hours. Throughout northeastern Georgia, several roads were flooded or washed out, while numerous roads in that state were also effected by mudslides. Pressure from the floodwaters damaged a number of culverts and sewer lines. One death and three injuries occurred in the Chattooga River when a group of people went rafting in the rain-swollen river. The storm spawned at least two tornadoes in the state. The first, an F1 spawned near Hartwell, demolished two mobile homes, tossed two others, and uprooted several large trees, leaving about $320,000 in property damage. Near Lexington, the other tornado, rated F2, destroyed a two- story wood, wood-frame dwelling; three boiler homes; and two chicken houses, killing about 30,000 chickens. A number of pecan trees were uprooted. The tornado left about $700,000 in damage. The outer bands of Beryl spawned 23 tornadoes in South Carolina, the largest tornado outbreak on record in the state, until the remnants of Hurricane Frances in 2004 produced more twisters. Several of the tornadoes touched down in the vicinity of Lexington. An F3 tornado in the area damaged or destroyed 200 homes and 40 to 50 buildings, including a shopping center and five electrical substations, which left approximately 15,000 people without power. A total of 40 people were injured by the tornado before it lifted at Lake Murray, after traveling about . Another F3 tornado touched down south of Lexington, where it completely leveled a square stick frame home. Three other tornadoes touched down in Lexington County, one of which - rated F1 - overturned a mobile home, causing one serious injury. Outside of Lexington County, a few other tornadoes caused significant damage. A twister that moved along a path through parts of Union, Spartanburg, and Cherokee counties, deroofing a restaurant in Carlisle and damaging several homes and mobile homes, leaving nearly $80,000 in damage in Cowpens. The National Weather Service office in Columbia failed to detect a brief tornado in southwest Richland County after the WSR-88D radar went offline for about 22 minutes, while the backup WSR-74 radar did not spot the tornado either. Heavy rainfall was observed in some parts of South Carolina with about falling in the mountainous region of the state, including a peak precipitation total of near Lake Jocassee. The Saluda River north of Greenville experienced its worst flooding in at least 60 years, while the Reedy River reached moderate flood stage in Greenville. Several businesses and homes along the Saluda River and its tributaries were flooded or destroyed. Mudslides and flood waters in Oconee County damaged a number of bridges and roadways. Damage in South Carolina reached about $40 million, with $37 million of that total caused by tornadoes and thunderstorm winds. After the storm, then-Governor Carroll A. Campbell Jr. declared a state of emergency for Lexington County due to tornado damage and dispatched 100 South Carolina National Guard police to the area. The storm produced of precipitation in western North Carolina. Flashing flooding and rapidly rising streams forced hundreds of people to evacuate. The French Broad River at Rosman crested at , nearly short of the record height set during Hurricane Hilda in 1964. Floodwaters washed out bridges and roads and resulted the closure of businesses and schools in several counties. Farther east, Guilford County observed of rain in only 33 minutes, flooding numerous roads and causing 11 car accidents. Several tornadoes were also spawned in the state. The first tornado was an F1 twister that touched down near Earl. It destroyed a mobile home, severely damaged another home, and downed several trees and power lines. An F2 spawned in northern Catawba County near Hickory destroyed two mobile home and another home, damaged several chimneys and roofs, acutely damaged cars and trucks, and overturned a number of trailers. In Iredell County, an F0 tornado damaged six mobile homes, toppled a wall at a home under construction, and knocked over trees and power lines. Another F1 tornado in Harnett County near Buies Creek downed a number of trees and damaged several mobile homes, trapping some people inside. =Mid-Atlantic= Rainfall accumulations from Tropical Storm Beryl across the Eastern United States In Virginia, up to of rain fell in Carroll County. Flash flooding occurred in several counties, though high waters caused little impact other than inundating roads and low bridges. Thunderstorm winds knocked down some trees, with six falling on power lines in Cana, leaving about 500 people without electricity. A tornado touched down near Martinsville and remained on the ground for about . Throughout its path, the tornado damaged approximately 30 businesses and 100 homes, leaving about $8.7 million in damage. Ten people suffered injuries due to the twister. In West Virginia, of rainfall in a short period of time in some areas resulted in street flooding in Morgan and Pendleton. In the latter, two homes washed away. The remnants of Beryl spawned two tornadoes in the state. One tornado mainly left downed trees in Morgan County, while the damaged three homes, destroyed a shed, and uprooted trees in Berkeley County. Thunderstorms associated with Beryl's remnants dropped of rainfall in parts of Maryland. Creeks in the region rose to elevated levels, flooding roads, yards, and basements. Heavy rainfall was also recorded in some areas of Pennsylvania. In Bradford County, the worst of the flooding occurred in the western side of the county, especially in areas adjacent to Buck and Bentley creeks. At Wells Township, State Route 549 was washed out and flooding damaged 8 businesses and 17 homes. In Waverly, the basement of the Village Hall and annex building were both flooded, damaging village archives and police equipment. Throughout the county, about 30 roads, including U.S. Route 6 and state routes 14 and 4028, were closed because of high water or debris, while a bridge in Smithfield Township was washed out. A total of 35 people evacuated from their homes due to flooding. In Lycoming County, the Lycoming Creek crested at heights exceeding records set during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. Nearly all roads in the central and western portions of the county were shut down due to water inundation. About 350 people evacuated or were rescued from their homes, 178 of whom took refuge at Red Cross shelters. A total of 75 homes and 80 trailers were severely damaged or destroyed. All major streams in Tioga County exceeded their banks, including the Cowanesque and Tioga rivers. About 150 people throughout the county fled their homes due to rising water. Most roads in the county were flooded, including U.S. routes 6 and 15. A section of State Route 549 near Daggett was washed out, while two bridges along State Route 328 were damaged. An automotive dealership in Richmond Township suffered about $500,000 in losses after 60 cars were destroyed or severely damaged. A house burned down in Middlebury Township after flooding forced fire fighters to take of detours. In Clinton County, a few roads were closed due to flooding, while State Route 144 was shut down south of Renovo because of mudslides. Two boys were rescued from Kettle Creek. Similar flooding occurred in Union County. Along the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County, 15 to 20 farms were flooded, with an estimated $75,000 in damage to crops. At Shikellamy State Park, four docks and several boats at the marina were damaged, with some boats capsizing. =New York and New England= Beryl generally produced of rainfall throughout central and eastern New York, peaking at in Tully. The precipitation led to flash flooding in the Susquehanna and western Catskills regions of the state. Numerous streams and rivers overflowed their banks, resulting in extensive flood damage. Tioga, Steuben, and Chemung counties were the hardest hit areas. In Chemung County, damage from the storm is estimated at $5 million, over half of which was within the town of Southport. Several bridges and over 25 homes were damaged; between 60 and 70 residents in the county were forced to evacuate. Beryl's remnants inflicted $650,000 in municipal damage to Steuben County, where one man was rescued from flood waters by a local fire department. Tioga County received $1.5 million in damage; a woman in the town of Tioga drowned after she attempted to leave her stranded vehicle. Another death occurred in the state after a 2-year-old girl fell into the Tioughnioga River near DeRuyter. At least 14 homes were damaged in Otsego County; seven highways sustained severe damage, including portions of New York State Route 7, which was forced to close for several hours. Elsewhere in the state, flood waters reached in some locations, with roads and basements throughout the region flooded. Damage in New York totaled $12 million. Light to moderate rainfall extended into much of southern and central New England, particularly throughout portions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. The precipitation peaked at in West Hartford, Connecticut.

It was opened in 1911 and is today an important trade centre in the city. History The construction of the building, which spreads over 3,200 m¬≤, began in 1909 after the design of architect Naum Torbov was selected in 1907, and took two years to complete. Until the late 1940s the Sofia municipality let out about 170 shops and stalls in the Central Sofia Market Hall. The rents and the product quality were strictly regulated. The market hall building's interior was significantly altered after the 1950s and the market was closed in 1988 in order to be reconstructed, modernized and once again opened for Easter in 2000, after 75% of it was acquired by the Israeli company Ashtrom, who invested $7 million in it. Today the Central Sofia Market Hall employs over 1,000 people, has three storeys, and offers foodstuff stalls and shops, clothing, accessories and jewellery shops, fast food stalls, etc. Architecture The style of the building, which is regarded as Torbov's best work, is Neo-Renaissance, featuring also elements of Neo-Byzantine architecture and Neo-Baroque. The fa√ßade is known for its relief of the coat of arms of Sofia above the main entrance created by the artist Haralampi Tachev. The famous little clock tower with three dials tops the edifice. The building was originally constructed with four entrances, though not all are used today.

The film has been cited as a favorite by filmmaker John Waters, who presented it as his annual selection at the 2007 Maryland Film Festival. Plot In college, 18-year-old Amy impulsively gave her dog, Rufus, oral sex. Eight years later, she lives a seemingly ordinary life as a schoolteacher and is engaged to nice-guy John. When John suggests complete honesty, Amy lies and tells him that she had a lesbian experience with her best friend Linda. On a trip to her parents' house, Amy finally relents to John's badgering and tells him. The next morning, Dougie, Amy's drug addict brother who had overheard the conversation, spills the beans at the breakfast table and, much to her parents' shock, Amy admits that he is right. Amy and John leave as her father will not speak to her and her mother says that she is ashamed. Once back, Amy and John's relationship is strained. Despite all their attempts to fix things, one night while drunk, John calls her a \\"dog-blowing cunt\\" and Amy decides to leave. She shacks up with Linda and her boyfriend Carl, but leaves due to their noisy lovemaking. With the help of her co-worker Ed, Amy finds a new apartment and begins a relationship with Ed after he learns that his wife has been cheating on him. After Amy's mother dies of an aneurysm, Amy returns home and reconciles with her father, who gives her a letter her mother had written her prior to her death. Amy and Ed visit Dougie in prison to inform him of their mother's death. He instantly begins to blame Amy, who leaves quickly before Ed can figure out what Dougie is trying to say. Some time later, Ed and his wife are trying to work things out and Amy realizes her feelings for Ed. As it doesn't work out between Ed and his wife, he and Amy become a couple. Ed thinks he's discovered Amy's secret: she was pregnant and engaged to John, but got an abortion and her parents were incensed.

The game is based on the Disney ride of the same name, rather than the eponymous film, which was released shortly after the game.. However, some elements and set designs from the film are incorporated into the game. Plot A Renaissance influenced nineteenth-century antebellum/Dutch colonial revival mansion located in a bayou nearby New Orleans, Louisiana was a happy home to a family (presumably the Gracey family) as well as friendly resident ghosts until evil forces known as the Order of Shadows, led by Atticus Thorn, terrorized the mansion including the family, causing them to abandon the home and forcing all the resident ghosts of the mansion to serve his wills. Renowned author Ezekiel Halloway, who is also known as Zeke, spent most of his life in orphanages after his father's death and his mother's disappearance during the Civil War. Sometime later, he went on his own to pursue a career; his true passion was writing as he always dreamed of becoming an author. His desperation in a search for a job to help finance his passion leads him to discover a misleading newspaper advertisement about being a caretaker for the aforementioned mansion. Making the decision to take the job, he journeys to the mansion on October 17, 1879. Upon examining the mansion on arrival, he is greeted by six friendly ghosts, who are Atticus Thorn's slaves, causing him to faint in horror. When he awakes a spirit in a crystal ball named Madame Leota informs him that Atticus Thorn has trapped 999 souls in the mansion as part of his attempt to take over the Afterlife and should be sent into the Depths of the Afterdeath. She also informs him of how to use the Beacon of Souls: a magic lantern that fires bolts of light to fight off evil spirits. Leota also says that the Beacon is used to destroy the evil for good. Despite his fears, Zeke agrees to help them and is given the weapon. He travels around the mansion, freeing shriveled ghosts and collecting legendary Soul Gems‚Äîthe items that power up the Beacon‚Äîfrom the friendly ghosts. During the course of the events, Atticus Thorn, whom Zeke fights four times, watches with sadistic delight. After fighting dozens of enemies, Zeke eventually gains a pirate's ring that unlocks a passageway to the Vault of Shadows, Atticus Thorn's secret lair behind a painting in the Foyer. Atticus reveals his plan to take over both the Afterlife and the Land of the Living, and he steals the Beacon of Souls from Zeke. Zeke and Leota then face off against Thorn's true form: a giant, worm-like creature. After Atticus dies, Zeke emerges victorious and is thanked by the friendly ghosts. The Haunted Mansion is finally returned to light, and the 999 spirits are set free and move on to heaven. Zeke is employed as the caretaker of the estate and continues to live in harmony with the remaining ghosts along with Madame Leota. He then pursues his dream as a writer and a recognized author under Leota's and the other ghosts' guidance later on. Gameplay The gameplay follows a fairly linear path in which the player must collect souls as they explore the mansion, with each room or door having a specifically required number of souls. The various hallways give the player access to a large number of rooms, as well as save points in the form of grandfather clocks. As the player traverses these hallways they will always encounter enemies which opposes the player's ability to clear rooms permanently of enemies. Once the player has found and entered a new room, the lights will be out and their main goal is to find the power switch and turn on the lights. Each room will offer a variety of challenges through fighting increasingly difficult enemies and providing unique problem-solving opportunities and puzzles. The enemies the player encounters begin as simple ghosts and small spiders, but will progressively become more difficult deeper into the mansion. Oftentimes, a new enemy is unlocked after having fought them as a \\"mini-boss\\" in a particular room. These enemies are extremely varied in style: a giant spider which will shoot webs and pull in Zeke, Banshees which scream and deal damage from a distance, Gargoyles which pull smaller skeletons out of the ground to swarm and defeat the player, and more. Using their lantern, the player will fight the enemies with various attacks that they unlock from collecting the souls gems present throughout the mansion. Starting with a weak but fast attack, the player will slowly gain a charge shot, as well as an area of effect attack which are then all progressively upgraded a second time to more powerful versions. Additionally, the player has a \\"bravery\\" bar which represents their health, and throughout the mansion's rooms the player can find potion to restore it. Additionally, the player can collect permanent upgrades to their maximum bravery as well as playing cards which will provide one bonus life for every 10 collected. When the player's bravery bar is depleted, instead of returning a previous save, a life will be consumed and Zeke will be restored to full health. The room design throughout the mansion uses a variety of mechanics, but is often rooted in a 3d platforming aspect. There are many examples of this, such as rooms where the bookcases will move around or float, and the player must make a series of jumps in order to successfully reach the light switch. A more unique example is seen in the Observatory in which the player looks through the telescope and is transported in to space, having to make a series of jumps in low gravity traversing various pieces of rubble. When not focusing on platforming, the player can expect to see very unique puzzles or challenges such as being shrunk down and placed onto a billiards table, while a ghostly hand takes shots at them with the cue ball. The player then uses this to their advantage to successfully hit all the other billiards balls into pockets in order to escape this puzzle and continue on. Another example could be the kitchen, in which a stack of plates is steadily flinging themselves at the player. The player must then position themselves so the plates break various bottles of alcohol, at the end igniting and following the trail of alcohol to the fireplace which then lights the room. The mansion is often set up in a way where the player can access up to 4 rooms at a time, and while collecting the souls from each room they will receive fragments of death certificates. After having collected all these fragments, they will then have enough souls to access a room in which they encounter a difficult puzzle or combat scenario. Upon completion of this scenario, the main villain will appear and fight Zeke, disappearing after Zeke has drained his health bar. After his temporary defeat of the villain, a ghost will appear and Zeke will present the death certificate to them. A brief custcene will then occur in which the ghost will present Zeke with a new soul gem, unlocking a new type of attack with his lantern and providing 100 extra souls. This gameplay cycle will repeat until Zeke has collected all 6 soul gems and a ring, which allows him access to the final boss room. The final battle consists of 2 phases which function very similarly. As the main villain has turned himself into a worm-like creature by stealing the soul gems, Zeke puts his companion's crystal ball into the lantern and unlocks a rapid fire shot which will fire just by holding down the attack button. The villain will steadily launch fireballs at Zeke, and lean down to bite him if the player comes within range. After taking enough damage, the villain will then begin to reveal the gem on his abdomen, which will begin to charge and fire a deadly beam attack that can deal more than half the player's health. In order to stop this the player must target the gem, dealing extra damage as well as preventing the damaging attack. After having depleted the villain's health bar, the floor will break and the player will find themselves in lava filled cavern, having to jump from platform to platform around the villain. Additionally, the villain now has 2 extra attacks: he has 3 large tentacles which he will raise up and then slam down, and a sweeping fire breath. After the player has successfully dodged the attacks, and destroyed the villain, a custcene will ensue and the game will be over. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three sevens and one eight for a total of 29 out of 40.

Samuelson published in 1947 (Enlarged ed., 1983) by Harvard University Press. It is based on Samuelson's 1941 doctoral dissertation at Harvard University. The book sought to demonstrate a common mathematical structure underlying multiple branches of economics from two basic principles: maximizing behavior of agents (such as of utility by consumers and profits by firms) and stability of equilibrium as to economic systems (such as markets or economies). Among other contributions, it advanced the theory of index numbers and generalized welfare economics. It is especially known for definitively stating and formalizing qualitative and quantitative versions of the \\"comparative statics\\" method for calculating how a change in any parameter (say, a change in tax rates) affects an economic system. One of its key insights about comparative statics, called the correspondence principle, states that stability of equilibrium implies testable predictions about how the equilibrium changes when parameters are changed. Introduction The front page quotes the motto of J. Willard Gibbs: \\"Mathematics is a language.\\" The book begins with this statement: :The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to those central features. This fundamental principle of generalization by abstraction was enunciated by the eminent American mathematician E. H. Moore more than thirty years ago. It is the purpose of the pages that follow to work out its implications for theoretical and applied economics. Its other stated purpose (p. 3) is to show how operationally meaningful theorems can be described with a small number of analogous methods. Thus, \\"a general theory of economic theories\\" (1983, p. xxvi). Topical outline The body of the book is 353 pages. Topics and applications covered (all in terms of theory) include the following. : Part I * introduction * equilibrium systems (such as for a market or economy) * maximizing behavior (such as to profits by a firm and utility by a consumer) in the calculus : sales-tax increase on equilibrium for a firm * comparative statics (changes in prices and quantities and other equilibrium variables when underlying conditions change) * cost and production * consumer's behavior * transformations, elasticities, composite commodities, index numbers, and rationing * cardinal utility, constancy of the marginal utility of income, and consumer's surplus * welfare economics : Part II * stability of equilibrium systems, dynamics (disturbances in equilibrium), and comparative statics : the Keynesian system * linear and nonlinear systems : Malthusian and optimum population * dynamics : the business cycle : endogenous models : mixed exogenous-endogenous theories : mixed systems of a linear-stochastic type * conclusions (on neoclassical theory from Walras to hints of the future in comparative dynamics, the comparative-statics counterpart of dynamic systems) Methods and analysis Samuelson's Foundations demonstrates that economic analysis benefits from the parsimonious and fruitful language of mathematics. In its original version as a dissertation submitted to the David A. Wells Prize Committee of Harvard University in 1941, it was subtitled \\"The Observational Significance of Economic Theory\\" (p. ix). One unifying theme, on the striking formal similarities of analysis in seemingly diverse fields, occurred only in the course of writing on them‚Äîfrom consumer's behavior and production economics of the firm to international trade, business cycles, and income analysis. It dawned on the author that he was prodigal \\"in proving essentially the same theorems\\" over and over. His failure of initial intuition, so he suggests, might be less surprising in light of the few economic writings then extant concerned with formulating meaningful theorems ‚Äì hypotheses about empirical data‚Äîthat could conceivably be refuted by empirical data (pp. 3‚Äì5). Samuelson (pp. 5, 21‚Äì24) finds three sources of meaningful theorems sufficient to illuminate his purposes: * maximizing behavior of economic units (as to utility for a consumer and profit for a firm) * economic systems (including markets and economies) in stable equilibrium * qualitative properties between two or more variables, such as an alleged technological relation or psychological law (indexed by the sign of the relevant functional relationship). Part I conjectures that meaningful theorems for economic units and for their respective aggregates are almost all derivable from general conditions of equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions can in turn be stated as maximization conditions. So, meaningful theorems reduce to maximization conditions. The calculus of the relations is at a high level of abstraction but with the advantage of numerous applications. Finally, Part I illustrates that there are meaningful theorems in economics, which apply to diverse fields. Part II concentrates on aggregation of economic units into equilibrium of the system. But the symmetry conditions required for direct maximization of the system, whether a market or even the simplest model of the business cycle, are lacking, in contrast to an economic unit or its corresponding aggregate. What can be hypothetically derived (or rejected in some cases) is a stable equilibrium of the system. (This is an equilibrium of the system such that, if a variable disturbs equilibrium, the system converges to equilibrium.) Stability of equilibrium is proposed as the principal source of operationally meaningful theorems for economic systems (p. 5). Analogies from physics (and biology) are conspicuous, such as the Le Chatelier principle and correspondence principle, but they are given a nontrivially generalized formulation and application. They and mathematical constructions, such as Lagrangian multipliers, are given an operational economic interpretation. The generalized Le Chatelier principle is for a maximum condition of equilibrium: where all unknowns of the function are independently variable, auxiliary constraints (\\"just-binding\\" in leaving initial equilibrium unchanged) reduce the response to a parameter change. Thus, factor-demand and commodity-supply elasticities are hypothesized to be lower in the short run than in the long run because of the fixed-cost constraint in the short run.Eugene Silberberg, 2008. \\"Le Chatelier principle,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Abstract. In the course of analysis, comparative statics, changes in equilibrium of the system that result from a parameter change of the system, is formalized and most clearly stated (Kehoe, 1987, p. 517).Timothy Kehoe, 1987. \\"Comparative statics,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 1, pp. 517‚Äì20. The correspondence principle is that the stability of equilibrium for a system (such as a market or economy) implies meaningful theorems in comparative statics. Alternatively, the hypothesis of stability imposes directional restrictions on the movement of the system (Samuelson, pp. 258, 5). The correspondence is between comparative statics and the dynamics implied by stability of equilibrium. { style=\\"border:1px solid #999; text- align:leftcenter; margin: auto;\\" cellspacing=\\"20\\" The starting point of the analysis is the postulate of maximizing behavior. The point is not (or not only) that everyone is out to maximize (Stanley Fischer, p. 235, 1987. \\"Samuelson, Paul Anthony,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 4, pp. 234‚Äì41.) even if true. Rather, first- and in particular higher-order (derivative) conditions of equilibrium at the maximum imply local behavioral relations (Samuelson, p. 16). The stability of equilibrium with sufficient other hypothetical qualitative restrictions then generates testable hypotheses (pp. 16, 28‚Äì29). Even where there is no context for purposive maximizing behavior, reduction to a maximization problem may be a convenient device for developing properties of the equilibrium, from which, however, no \\"teleological or normative welfare significance\\" is warranted (pp. 52‚Äì53). } Chapter VIII on welfare economics is described as an attempt \\"to give a brief but fairly complete survey of the whole field of welfare economics\\" (p. 252). This Samuelson does in 51 pages, including his exposition of what became known as the Bergson‚ÄìSamuelson social welfare function. Theorems derived in welfare economics, he notes, are deductive implications of assumptions that are not refutable, thus not meaningful in a certain sense. Still, the social welfare function can represent any index (cardinal or not) of the economic measures of any logically possible ethical belief system that is required to order any (hypothetically) feasible social configurations as \\"better than\\", \\"worse than\\", or \\"indifferent to\\" each other (p. 221). It also definitively elucidates the notion of Pareto optimality and the \\"germ of truth in Adam Smith's doctrine of the invisible hand\\" (Samuelson, 1983, p. xxiv; Fischer, 1987, p. 236). The final pages of the book (pp. 354‚Äì55) outline possible directions analytical methods might take, including for example models that show how: * deficit financing could produce positive short-run effects on the economy that are swamped by adverse long-run effects on capital accumulation (seriously reconsidered later as crowding out) * declines in age-specific mortality affect the net reproductive rate (whose implications for population growth are less abstract than they might first appear). Samuelson closes by expressing hope in the future use of comparative dynamics to: : aid in the attack upon diverse problems ‚Äì from the trivial behavior of a single small commodity, to the fluctuations of important components of the business cycle, and even to the majestic problems of economic development. Appendices There are two mathematical appendices totalling 83 pages. The first gathers and develops \\"very briefly\\" and \\"without striving for rigor\\" results on maximization conditions and quadratic forms used in the book and not conveniently collected elsewhere (p. 389). The other is on difference equations (\\"for the dynamic economist\\") and other functional equations. Enlarged edition The 1983 enlarged edition includes an additional 12-page \\"Introduction\\" and a new 145-page appendix with some post-1947 developments in analytical economics, including how conclusions of the book are affected by them.

It has a surface area of 370 km ¬≤ with a population of 821 inhabitants; population density 2.22 inhabitants/km ¬≤. The town's municipal district includes the villages of Hoyo and Solanilla del Tamaral. It is located south of Puertollano, in the impressive valley of Alcudia, with the Montoro reservoir within the area, close to the Sierra Madrona mountain range. Major festivities are celebrated on the day of San Pantale√≥n, and also celebrated on July 25 to 29. The other great celebration in Mestanza is the day known as \\"El Voto\\" (literally the vow or oath to the Virgin Mary), an old traditional pilgrimage celebrated on the last Sunday of May every year. The image of the Virgin Mary is then taken to the chapel located on the outskirts of the town. Prehistory Various cultures have settled in this area from prehistoric times to present days. There are paleolithic paintings in the rock shelters of Fuencaliente and Solana del Pino. In the area near the village Mestanza itself there are archeological sites in La Tabernera, El Chup√≥n and Callejones de R√≠o Fr√≠o, with remains of schematic painting in Puente Mercedes (El Hoyo). Old age Roman presence became important due to the exploitation of mines in the town of Sisapo (La Bienvenida). This Roman mining complex was located in the western part of the Valley of Alcudia, and was connected with the Roman town of C√°stulo (now Linares) to facilitate transportation of raw materials from the mines. An example of mining exploitation from Roman times is Minas Di√≥genes, in operation until the nineteen seventies. Thus the landscape was modeled since Roman times, with overexploitation of forests in favor of intensive mining, documented from old time because Cayo Mario, brilliant strategist and 7 times consul during the last period of the Roman Republic, based his fortune on the mining concessions in the mountains called Sierras Mari√°nicas, named after him (Sierra Morena and Sierra Madrona). Middle Ages In the days of the Muslim kingdoms, in the location of the present town, there was an Arab castle, around which a mosque was built, and around them grew the town. The name Mestanza, of Berber origin, Mistasa, means mosque. The town was conquered by Christian king Alfonso VI in 1086. The Order of Calatrava made this area a Royal Dehesa (royal pastures), in recognition for having been for many centuries one of the largest spaces for receiving transhumant herds in the winter months. The cattle organization called Mesta, brought sheep here through a dense network of cattle paths. That is why the Cross of the Order of Calatrava, the mutton and the sheep are in the coat of arms of the village. This ancient custom of carrying the herds in winter to the valley of Alcudia, remains at a lower level today, as transhumance routes for livestock have been replaced by modern means of transportation such as rail or road. Families who live in the valley in winter are known as \\"Serranos\\" as they come from the mountains (sierras) in Guadalajara, Soria, Teruel and other provinces. Modern Age The economy in Mestanza was based on mining and grazing with occasional help from hunting. Mining is focused mainly on coal mining from the late nineteenth century until the mid-twentieth century (in nearby town Puertollano) and in the silver mineral galena (lead and silver) in the valley or El Hoyo and Solanilla del Tamaral, leading to the creation of a new parish district, Las Navas de Riofr√≠o, near the new mining locations, later abandoned in 1927. Due to international isolation, the government of General Franco decided to build an oil shale distillation plant in nearby Puertollano, requiring large amounts of water, so a dam was built, the Montoro Dam, which supply water to industrial plants through a tunnel in the mountains of Sierra de Mestanza, plus the necessary water pumping plants. The Montoro dam was opened by General Franco in 1950, and stores water from rivers Montoro and Tablillas. After the end of the international blockade, the distillation plant was replaced by the current oil-refining plant, proceeding to the gradual closure of the mines. Open coal mines in Puertollano are now only for power supply.

Biography Good Shoes was formed by lead singer Rhys Jones and guitarist Steve Leach who often wrote and played music together as a hobby. Rhys and Steve appeared as a two piece under the Good Shoes name for a friend's charity gig (Tom-Fest) at a venue in Kingston called The Peel in early January 2004. Eventually, they decided to formalise their hobby into a fully-fledged band, bringing in Rhys's brother Tom and then later Joel Cox (who was friends with Jones and Leach from secondary school - Raynes Park High School). The band started looking for gigs in January 2005, their first gig was put on by a friend at Fitzwilliam College Cambridge University on 1 February. Their second was at a secret party on Eel Pie Island with Mystery Jets and from then on they played as many gigs as possible in and around London. This led to them playing the Artrocker clubnight in August put on by Artrocker Magazine. At this gig, the band were recommended to their current label, Brille Records, by a member of the band FC Kahuna, and after playing In the City music festival in Manchester they signed with Brille in November 2005. John Kennedy (a DJ at London-based radio station Xfm) started to give the band airtime based on a demo which was recorded in the band's shed, and a new demo, recorded at Southern Studios started to get the band recognition from stations like Radio 1, 6 Music and other mainstream radio stations, with both Steve Lamacq and Zane Lowe playing the demo. The band travelled to Malm√∂, Sweden to record their first album, called Think Before You Speak, with Per Sunding at Tambourine Studios. It was released 26 March 2007. On 28 May 2007, the band performed a secret free gig at Morden Park bandstand. The bandstand and other landmarks from the local area are featured in the video for their single \\"Morden\\", which was released on 11 June 2007.On 23 October 2011 this band has performed at BITS Pilani campus. The band toured during 2007 with Kaiser Chiefs and The Rakes (other support bands included The Pigeon Detectives, Little Ones and We Are Scientists). In November 2007, they headlined a tour with support from Lightspeed Champion, also the band supported Max√Ømo Park at their homecoming arena show on 15 December 2007. The band stayed relatively low during 2008. They appeared for a small number of live shows, including a secret supporting slot to friends The Maccabees. Their main debut of new material was at their only UK festival appearance, Boring by the Sea Festival, which took place in Weymouth. They ended the year with two gigs at The Watershed in Wimbledon on 13 December, followed by an appearance at New Slang in Kingston upon Thames on 18 December 2008. Cox left the band as the band started writing their second album, and formed Lime Headed Dog. For the recording of the next album their friend, Bob Matthews, recorded the bass parts. Matthews is another South West Londoner. Born in Kingston, he played in various bands (Evil Twin, Iris) in local venues including the Peel, before becoming a founder of Right Turn Left while at Exeter University. After the recording sessions finished he went back to playing for Right Turn Left. The band released a free download of \\"The Way My Heart Beats\\" on 18 August 2009, as a first taste of the second album due for release in January 2010. On the same weekend they played Dockville Festival in Germany which saw the second appearance of their new bass player Will Church. He toured with the band for the whole second album and will work on all new material from now on. Church originally played in Vincent Vincent and the Villains until they split in 2009, and has been a friend of the band for a number of years.

It is part of Toledo Public Schools. It was named for a former editor of The Toledo Blade from 1844 to 1847. Scott was an entrepreneur, philanthropist and well-known civic leader who envisioned Toledo as the \\"Future Great City of the World.\\" The current high school building was built in 1913. After receiving a $1 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Scott High School began a transformation from a comprehensive high school to four small learning academies. Each academy, or \\"Small School\\" is based on a different career pathway. The Scott Bulldogs wear maroon and white for athletic events. Their basketball program has been historically known as a powerhouse in the Toledo City League with their biggest rivals being the Macomber Macmen and the Libbey Cowboys. Macomber was the big rivalry until that school's closure in 1991, and Libbey was the main rival until it was closed in 2010. Scott's oldest rivals are the Waite Indians, as their school was built a year after Scott and prompted an annual Thanksgiving Day football matchup that ran from 1914‚Äì1963 and generated the interest of many Midwestern newspapers. Scott is also known for its internationally known marching band the \\"Fantastic Dancing Machines,\\" having one of the premier marching bands in the mid-west, who have won numerous awards in band competitions throughout the United States. The band has performed all over the country. The band was directed by Florida A&M; University alum Gus Walker from 1970‚Äì1977, then rose to fame under the baton of Mr. Edward Dixon beginning in 1978. The actual school building on Collingwood Avenue was temporarily closed for a $42 million renovation that took place. It was finished in December 2011.

It is located in the northeast corner of the province of Ciudad Real, on the bank of the Z√°ncara river. It is in the La Mancha region, in the \\"Mancha Alta\\" sub-region. It was founded in 1284 by the Archdeacon of Alcaraz, Pero Mu√±oz (later adjusted to \\"Pedro\\" Mu√±oz in the municipality's name), as one of a series of defensible points in the La Mancha plains. The village was abandoned in 1410, due to a severe drought, and re-established in 1525. Since the late 19th century, Pedro Mu√±oz had been an important economic center in the region. The village has an important architectural heritage of manor houses, hermitages and the Renaissance and Baroque church of St Peter the Apostle. It also has a natural and ecological heritage composed of a protected complex of wetlands, visited by many species of migratory birds.  Geography  The municipality is bound to the north by El Toboso, to the west by Campo de Criptana, to the east by Mota del Cuervo and to the south by Socu√©llamos and Tomelloso. It has a total area of 101.3 km2 and is located 113 km from the provincial capital. Although it is at a comparatively high altitude, the region itself is flat, on an arid but fertile plateau. It is a typical village in La Mancha with a concentrated population and low-rise housing, typical of the region. Pedro Mu√±oz is located in the southern part of the Meseta Central (inner plateau) of the Iberian Peninsula, on the Z√°ncara River in the Guadiana River Basin. The municipality has a nature reserve surrounding a complex of seven lakes: La Vega or Laguna del Pueblo (Town Lake) wetland is considered \\"green\\"; Alcahozo, Manjavacas and Monte Chico are salt lakes; and Retamar and Navalafuente are endorheic lakes (not providing any outflow of water such as streams or rivers). = Hydrography and lakes = alt=a view of Vega lake surrounded by marshlands on flat, almost treeless terrain The boundaries of Pedro Mu√±oz are within the drainage basin of the Z√°ncara River, a tributary of the Guadiana, and host the wetland complex of Pedro Mu√±oz, made up of three principal lakes: Vega Lake, Retemar Lake and Navalafuente Lake. This wetland complex was declared a nature reserve in 2002, after receiving the following statements of protection: the wildlife refuge of Vega Lake in 1988, a special protection area for birds (ESPA) in 1989 and a wetland of international importance as a habitat for waterfowl (Ramsar Convention) in 1993. The biosphere reserve of the Wetlands Area was declared by UNESCO in 1981 and comprises a set of lakes and marshes in La Mancha. Vega Lake is the most important of the complex. It is a sweetwater lake which encourages the growth of non-halophytic vegetation. It has a surface area of 54 hectares and in summer is supplied with water from the treatment plant which alters its natural hydro-chemical composition from flooding and drought. The fauna is abundant with more than 23 species of waterfowl, most notably ducks and waders. Others can be found in the list of the Ramsar Convention. Navalafuente is an ephemeral or intermittent lake that is formed in very rainy years. Retemar is a purely endorheic lake. = Flora and fauna =  Flora  Salicornia, (Salicornia ramosissima) In the wetland areas there are halophytic plants that have adapted to the salty substrate where chlorides and sulphates have concentrated. In these areas the growth is sparse. In the permanent lakes there is abundant aquatic vegetation supported by the fertile mud on the floor of the lakes, attracting large numbers of waders. There is also vegetation rooted in the lake beds with leaves and flowers floating on or emergent from the surface. Typical plants around the lake are Salicornia, Juncaceae, glasswort (Arthrocnemum macrostachyum) and Phragmites species. alt=a drought- resistant tamarix tree pictured under storm clouds Halophytic rushes grow in the boggy areas. Also important are the sedges and sow thistles which reproduce easily in areas that are less salty. There are also saw-toothed sedge and bull rushes. Nearby in the salty meadows are plantains and grama grass, and a range of aromatic herbs such as rosemary, thyme and mint. The most common tree, particularly in the more saline areas, is the tamarisk or salt cedar. It forms little thickets around the edge of the lakes, and has a long taproot that is able to reach the water table and thus resist the summer drought. Other trees that thrive in the area are the evergreen or holly oak, poplar species, almond, Acacia species and pines.  Fauna  alt=a male mallard takes flight from the water The wetlands complex is an important natural element to assist the migration of birds between Africa and the north of Europe, despite the high salinity of the water and the summer drought. The presence of crustaceans that can resist the summer drought are fundamental for feeding many waterbirds. alt=a black-necked stilt stands on disproportionately long legs In the fringes of rushes and sedges there are many ducks, like the mallard. Sedentary birds who nest and winter on the lake are sometimes seen, including the black-necked grebe, the coot and the common pochard. Other more common birds which overwinter on the lakes are the shoveler duck, the northern pintail, the eurasian teal and the little grebe. In areas of thicker vegetation the purple heron nests during spring and migrates in August to over-winter in other places. In the salty areas are wading birds such as the black-winged stilt and the avocet. Among non-aquatic birds are plovers, great reed warblers, black-headed gulls and the hobby. There is in addition one of the more important predators of waterfowl, the marsh harrier, more common on the permanent lakes where there is denser vegetation. Beyond the wetlands are various other wild animals such as rodents, hares, pole cats, snakes, falcons, owls and partridges.  Demographics  Pedro Mu√±oz had a population of 8,711 inhabitants in 2009, declining slightly to 8,639 inhabitants according to the 2011 census. Its population density is 78.04 inhabitants per km2.  History  = Archaeological discoveries = Facing La Vega Lake, on a small promontory of marl clay, remnants of successive reconstructions of the Iberian type of adobe buildings were discovered. A subsidence area was found when the land was cleared, with approximately five feet of deposits similar to ancient clay pots. There were large animal teeth, and the skeleton of an animal that appeared to be a carnivore was found in one of the containers. There were also stones joined together with mud, forming Cyclopean walls. It appeared to be a Carpetani settlement, Celtic people living among Oretani, the Celtiberians, the Vaccaei and the Vettones. Archaeological excavations carried out at Cerro de La Nieve (Hill of the Snow), between 1984 and 1990, threw further light on the first inhabitants of Pedro Mu√±oz. In successive interventions made at the site numerous archaeological remains have been found, including: bone sculpture; small-scale metallurgy, possibly manufactured in a local copper foundry; handmade ceramics painted in a tradition of the Urnfield culture; bronze fibulae (ornamental pins), utensils and other brassware; Greek pottery (associated with fruit trade); and numerous Iberian cemeteries as well as a Roman and many medieval cemeteries. The settlement was probably part of a system of towns of Iberian contemporaries at the time, Las Mesas, Cuenca and Campo de Criptana, Ciudad Real being the closest neighbors. =Pre-Roman and ancient history = In pre-Roman times, the area had a population of about 100 people in the Cerro de La Nieve area. Several samples of Iberian sculptures have been found in this area. Founded in the late 6th or early 5th century BC, it was a semi-nomadic village of the early Iron Age with influences from the Urnfield and Iberian cultures. The village was abandoned c. 300 BC, possibly due to pressures from the Carthaginian conquest of the southern peninsula. This area was later occupied by the Romans. A Roman tomb was found at Cerro de la Nieve and a Roman road and bridge were built to cross the Z√°ncara river, suggesting that the Iberian fort was occupied by Romans. However, it is unknown if there was a village near or around them at that time. The region was conquered in the 4th century AD by the Visigoths. = Middle Ages= Scenes of the Spanish Reconquest by the Military Order of Santiago The region was conquered by Iberian Muslims in the 8th century before coming under the Castilians in the 13th century, who then founded the village under the priory of Ucl√©s. The village was founded through the efforts of the Archdeacon of Alcaraz, Pero Mu√±oz. He was looking to find high, defensible points in the La Mancha plains, close to his headquarters near Alcaraz, that were safe from the raids often carried out by the Muslim armies which caused great havoc among Christians. Alcaraz aimed to populate strategic locations resulting in the village being founded in 1284, the year of the death of King Alfonso X (the Wise) of Castile, whose son Sancho IV succeeded to the throne. The Archbishop of Toledo had asked permission to create churches throughout this region, expropriating land for this purpose. Realizing that the site was inhabited, he tried to make the villagers abandon the village so that he could to take it. The Archdeacon of Alcaraz (Pero Mu√±oz) petitioned the Archbishop of Toledo for permission to annex the inhabited land, and the Archdeacon became famous for the complicated lawsuit that ruled in his favour. The Archbishop of Toledo was forced to relinquish his rights to the town and concede it to Alcaraz. For this reason, the villagers honored the Archdeacon by putting his name to the village. Alfonso XI conceded the village in 1324, and in that same year the village council received a letter of privilege from the Military Order of Santiago. In 1410, a year of considerable drought in the region, the wetlands receded and divided the town lake into three. This made the land very prone to disease and also attracted pests from the surrounding barren lands. Faced with these plagues, residents were forced to abandon the village. =16th century= Queen Isabella gave the Privilege Ville to Pedro Mu√±oz, 10 August 1531. In 1525 the town was resettled by the Mayordomo family whose patriarch, Juan Mayordomo, had heard about the fertility of its lands - and also had to abandon their old village, Cervera del Llano, Cuenca, due to a confrontation with the Marquis de Villena over taxation. Juan Mayordomo later informed his relatives that it was a suitable and welcoming place and persuaded them to settle and encourage others to join them. Mayordomo's family was responsible for spreading this message and soon other families began to arrive until the town was reborn. Mayordomo became the first mayor of the municipality due to his leadership. Farmers residing in the neighbouring villages of Socu√©llamos, El Toboso, Campo de Criptana and Mota del Cuervo attempted to destroy the houses where the newcomers had settled. They were fearful that they would lose their new borders, forests and meadows they had gained when the village was abandoned in 1410. To avoid this, Mayordomo and other residents took their case to the courts of Oca√±a, Toledo, Avila and Madrid, asking for town powers to be granted. However the councils of Socu√©llamos, El Toboso, Campo de Criptana and Mota del Cuervo also filed a lawsuit to prevent this concession, vying for favor against Pedro Mu√±oz. Spain was at that time positioned as one of the major European powers, and Emperor Charles I had to leave Spain to resolve issues in its European territories. In his place, Queen Isabella of Portugal and Aragon granted town privileges to Pedro Mu√±oz on 10 August 1531, saving the town from future threats against its homes. For this reason there appears in the right lower quarter of the town's heraldic shield a crown in gratitude to the monarchy, specifically Isabel, for her decision to grant township privileges in a difficult time. =17th and 18th centuries= In 1691, Pedro Mu√±oz was included in the province of La Mancha, with Almagro as the capital, having been segregated from the province of Toledo. In the eighteenth century, a number of large mansions, such as \\"Paca's House-Palace\\", were built. In 1700, the construction of the Church of St. Peter the Apostle began. = 19th century = During the Carlist wars there was an agreement signed in this village between the conflicting parties. Acuerdo Street is named in reference to this agreement, which is also represented by two clasped right hands, under a crossed sword and baton, on a field of the town's shield. This is depicted on the genuine glass shield at the head of the stairs of the City Hall. =20th century= Pedro Mu√±oz has far to go to match the glory it achieved in the beginning of the twentieth century, with the beginnings of the vineyards and winemaking industry. It gained momentum for greater democracy and freedom for its enterprising citizens who created companies to meet the market needs of the people and to provide jobs for its neighbors and those in the region who, in turn, helped to maintain and grow this great municipality that is located in the heart of La Mancha.Tirado, 1984, p. 34-40. Resume: ¬´Don Manuel Fraile, era un ingeniero de caminos, puertos y canales que lleg√≥ a Pedro Mu√±oz a fines del siglo XIX y dio el primer impulso industrial a la poblaci√≥n, construyendo la f√°brica de harinas de la Cubeta, construyendo la carretera de Pedro Mu√±oz a Tomelloso, cuya autorizaci√≥n se firm√≥ el 23 de noviembre de 1885 y tambi√©n se encarg√≥ de la tra√≠da de la \\"luz\\" al pueblo entre 1906 y 1907¬ª.Tirado, 1984, p. 36. ¬´Otro grupo de familias, adem√°s de la familia Fraile, fueron fuente de riqueza para Pedro Mu√±oz; hacen que este pueblo se convierta en respetable y de gran potencial econ√≥mico, comparado con los de la zona, pese a ser el m√°s joven y de menos t√©rmino¬ª. During the Spanish Civil War (1936 1939) Pedro Mu√±oz came under the Republican zone and suffered repression from the two opposing sides. In 1940, a plague of locusts devastated cereal crops in Spain, causing starvation among the population. The advent of democracy and, in 1986, the entry of Spain into the European Union encouraged reinvestment and currently there are three industrial estates forming a fundamental basis of the town's economy. On 12 August 1994, at about 4 pm, a storm of mud and hail caused chaos in the town. It was of such magnitude that several hundred-year old cypress trees in the local cemetery were uprooted and fell on surrounding tombstones. There was a mass panic at the crowded swimming pool (minutes before the temperatures were above 40 ¬∞C). Nobody was injured as there was adequate shelter in the locker room. On 12 August 2007, a magnitude 5.1 earthquake occurred with its epicenter 10 km beneath the municipality of Pedro Mu√±oz. It could be felt in more than a dozen autonomous communities, though the only notable damage reported was the sinking of a portion of the 19th century Municipal Theater of Almagro, over ninety miles away.  Monuments and sites of interest  =City Hall= City Hall The City Hall is located in the Plaza de Espa√±a (Spain square), at the center of town, and has been remodeled several times to reach its current state. It emphasizes the tower Historicist-style while retaining the sole remnant of the original Old Town Hall, built in the early twentieth century in the neo-Mudejar style (a sixteenth century Spanish architectural style). In 1946 the current building was completed, a slender design capped with a cover dome. Its forms and curves contain eastern elements and it is ornamented with dovecotes and an upper turret. = Church of St. Peter the Apostle = Church of San Pedro Ap√≥stol As the inhabitants of Pedro Mu√±oz faced advancing wetlands, they had to abandon the old Church of San Antonio. The Pedrote√±os (demonym for the residents of Pedro Mu√±oz) then decided it was necessary to build a new church. On 8 September 1700, the foundation stone for the present church was laid and work was completed in 1722. The church is the best representation of Pedro Mu√±oz's architecture as a whole. Located in the Plaza de Espa√±a, it has a graceful style that blends Renaissance with the Baroque. The floorplan is a Latin cross with shallow townhouses in three corners of the block and a transept nave with a square tower. Rehabilitation work and mounting a bell tower were done to coincide with the celebration of the third centenary of the groundbreaking, and these upgrades have contributed to enhancing the church's beauty. =Chapel of the Madonna of Los Angeles= Chapel of the Madonna of Los Angeles. The hermitage of Our Lady of The Angels is on calle de la Virgen (Virgin Street) at the convergence of Avenida de Concordia (Concord Avenue), la calle Prim (Prim Street) and la calle Cervantes (Cervantes Street). The name of Our Lady of the Angels was probably devoted to the holy virgin and at the same time to the only daughter of the town's refounder, Juan Mayordomo. His daughter was born a short time after he resettled in the town and died a few years after her birth. When the construction of the new houses were begun in the second repopulation on Tahona Hill and in la calle del Campo (Country street) they began the construction of the Santa Ana hermitage and the hermitage of Our Lady of the Angels. It seems the latter was built over a construction that had been there previously, a rustic hermitage on a foundation of rock and soil. In 1769 work began on the new chapel, though it was suspended and did not resume until 1771. It was completed eight years later, with extensive arcades and seating throughout. The building was largely destroyed in the Civil War and was not rebuilt until the war ended. = Manor houses = Casa de la Paca Paca's House- Palace The Paca House or Menault House at 12 Tahoma Street is a mansion built in 1760 in the baroque style with a heraldic decoration on the facade and windows with iron railings. The heraldic decoration on the facade is above the main door, in a reddish sandstone which contrasts with the white wall (pictured). Inside the main door is an entrance porch and a security door. The bright inner courtyard has a rustic balustrade and gives access to the rooms. It was first called Casa de la Paca from the name of an early owner, Francisca Ram√≠rez Ca√±as, called \\"Paca\\", who donated the house to the church upon her death. From that time the house has been used for catechesis and other church- related activities. Casa Granero Graneros' House-Palace Casa Granero is in Carlos Garzar√°n Street, a mansion built by the Granero de Heredia family. It was constructed in the late 18th century by Don Juan Jos√© Granero de Heredia y Quiros Garc√©s de Marcilla. Above the central balcony is the family heraldic shield which carries just one field of red with five silver castles and a rampant lion of gold in the centre. It doesn't carry a crest but if so, an armed warrior with a sword and the cross of Santiago on his chest, a baroque border and a cartouche of eight bundles of arrows, the symbol of Fernando el Cat√≥lico. Fernandez Cuellar's House Fernandez Cu√©llar's House is in Tahons Street, it is a mansion of the 18th century with a heraldic decoration on the fa√ßade. Work has been carried out to renovate the fa√ßade and the interior, even so, it has kept its original shape except for the overhang of the roof where the shield is placed. Originally it was at a right angle and now it is diagonal to the architrave. Of the founder little is known, it is thought that he belonged to the Fern√°ndez Cuellar family, the name existed in that area but later disappeared. The shield is of one field which holds a single pine tree and a wolf lifted off its feet, symbolizing a city governor who after a long siege attacks the besiegers and returns victorious with a huge booty. The patio is characteristically Castellano, the main door is made of rustic wood with decorative ironwork. Casa del Prior The Prior's House is on the corner of Campo Street and Pizarro Street. It is decorated with the shield of the Order of Calatrava, preserved as it was. It appears that c. 1698 a senior ecclesiastical official or a prior resided there. It is known that a group of monks of the Cistercian order lived there during the time of the parish church's construction in the early 18th century. These monks wanted to found a monastery here that would be a dependent of the Monastery of San Clodio in Leiro, (Ourense) which was commissioned by the Pedrote≈ào (native of Pedro Mu≈àoz) Blas Garcia. It not known who built the house or when. Casa de la Torrecilla The Turret House is situated at 18 Virgen Street and was constructed in the 18th century. It is a manor house with a simple heraldic device on the fa√ßade founded by an unknown knight of the Order of Santiago. Above one of the windows (where previously there was a door), visible under the paintwork, is a shield with the cross of the Order of Santiago. La casa de la calle Dos de Mayo In the calle Dos de Mayo (2 May Street) there was another decorated house, again the founder is unknown. It showed a shield with the cross of the Military Order of St John, now the Order of Malta. The house had a typical castellano patio but it was demolished to build another house. = Plaza de toros = Bullring The bullring (constructed 1916--1919) was inaugurated in the town fair of 1919 with two bullfights. In the first the bullfighters Rafael Rubio \\"Rodalito\\", Corralfuente and Antonio Sanchez participated. In the second it was Corralfuente and \\"Rodalito\\". The builders of this structure used the diameter of the bullring of Quintanar de la Orden as a guide. During the Spanish Civil War the bullring was converted into a makeshift firing range and was seriously damaged. Afterwards, in 1945, local residents purchased and restored the bullring, and on 1 August 1964 it was ceded to the local council with certain conditions. = Roman bridge = Roman bridge in the Z√°ncara river A Roman bridge, known as the Molino de la Torre bridge (Mill Tower Bridge) (), carries the Serranos Way across the Z√°ncara River at the edge of the municipal boundary with Socu√©llamos. It is a stonework construction with three arches of equal size and a smaller blind arch. The Serranos Way has the remains of a Roman road of some 6 metres width which once linked Complutum (now Alcala de Henares) with Cartagonova (now Cartagena). The Roman road has become progressively destroyed by the cultivation of crops. = San Miguel Bridge = San Miguel bridge St Michael's Bridge () is similar to the Roman bridge, crossing the Z√°ncara River next to the hermitage of San Miguel. Recently there has been work to restore the bridge and improve the surroundings with greenways on both banks of the river. In the Middle Ages and for some time afterwards shepherds were taxed when crossing the bridge, two head of sheep per shepherd crossing. Culture = La Harinera = La Harinera cultural center. La Harinera (The flour factory) is a cultural project promoted by the Iberian American Foundation of Cultural and Creative Industries (FIBICC) and opened as a museum in 2015. It is an organization that focuses on cultural development where there is accommodation to artists to develop their work. It also has a hostel where students from around the world can live during their Spanish courses.

The princesas in the film are two prostitutes: Caye, a Spaniard who is hiding her profession from her family, and Zulema, who is saving money to send to her family in the Dominican Republic. The two women ply their trade on the streets of Madrid. The film's initial release was in 2005; it was released in the United States in August 2006 at the IFC Center in New York City and nationally to many digital cable subscribers via IFC OnDemand. Plot Caye (Candela Pe√±a) goes to Gloria's Hair Salon which she frequents and where she discusses with other customers everything from life to politics during her time off; they are also her friends. They share a dislike of the immigrant prostitutes they observe from the salon, because some of them, including Caye, are also prostitutes and believe the immigrants take clients and income they would otherwise have. Caye's point of view changes when she meets Zulema (Micaela Nev√°rez), an illegal immigrant prostitute working to send money home to her mother and her son Edward who she left in the Dominican Republic. They develop a bond and support each other with everything, including shopping, fashion tips and hair styles. Caye takes Zulema to her mother's house for dinner. Caye's phone constantly rings but she refuses to answer, something her mother is confused and bothered about. Zulema volunteers to teach sex education at Caye's sister-in-law's school, enabling her to send a toy truck to her son for his birthday. Caye meets Manuel, a computer programmer, outside a club. With some persuasion, Caye convinces him to go with her. Over beers at a caf√©, Caye confesses she is a prostitute. Manuel does not believe her and laughs it off and they begin a relationship. Zulema tells Caye about a man who physically abuses her but has promised her papers to legalize her status in Spain and allow her to bring her family to Spain. Caye is suspicious of the offer and begs Zulema not to go with him. Caye's theory proves true, the man wishes simply to use Zulema and never had any intentions of getting her legal status. Zulema escapes a first meeting with him when Caye comes to help, but is later lured to a hotel room, where the client turns out to be him, and she is beaten and presumably raped. After Zulema has consensual sex with a compassionate \\"volunteer\\", she goes to the hospital for a full medical examination, something she had not done for many years. When Zulema sees the test results, she collapses. While her medical status is not stated, it is implied that her condition is fatal and communicable and she arranges to meet with her abuser and has unprotected sex with him in an act of revenge. While at the hospital with Zulema, Caye receives a call from a client requesting her services for himself and his friends. Caye heads to the cafe where they have arranged to meet. There she runs into Manuel and a group of his co-workers and realizes that it was Manuel and his friends who are requesting her services and thus learns of Manuel's infidelity. Manuel meanwhile realizes that Caye was not joking about her profession. Without saying a word, they both understand the situation and go their separate ways. Devastated over her health issue, Zulema decides to return to the Dominican Republic. With a heartfelt but bittersweet good-bye, Caye gives Zulema a makeover and an envelope of cash and asks her to ‚Äúgo be happy‚Äù. That afternoon, while having dinner with her family, Caye announces that Zulema has returned to the Dominican Republic because she was a prostitute and could no longer bear the emotional burden of the profession and distance from her son. The film concludes with Caye's cellphone again incessantly ringing, her mom asking her whether she is going to answer or not and Caye simply retorting, ‚Äú¬°C√≥gelo t√∫ mam√°!‚Äù (\\"You answer it, mom\\").

Terra in Evanston, Illinois in 1980. The museum was relocated to Chicago, Illinois in 1987. During its tenure, the museum presented more than 200 exhibitions on American art and provided related programs and events for children, teachers, families, general adult audiences, and scholars. The museum closed on October 31, 2004 after 24 years of operation. Origins Daniel Terra began collecting in the 1940s, and by the early 1970s had turned his attention to American art, with a special focus on American Impressionism and the Hudson River School. Two years after establishing the Terra Foundation for American Art, Terra opened the Terra Museum of American Art in Evanston, Illinois in 1980. Initially, the museum housed Terra‚Äôs collection of some 700 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures, and photographs from the late eighteenth century to 1945. Two years later, in recognition of his efforts in promoting American art and culture, Daniel Terra was appointed Ambassador-at-Large for Cultural Affairs by President Ronald Reagan. Expansion In 1987, the Terra Museum of American Art moved from Evanston to an office building on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago. In 1992, Terra opened the Mus√©e d‚Äôart am√©ricain Giverny (or MAAG), which first exhibited paintings from the Terra collection by American artists who sojourned in France. Soon, however, the exhibition and education programs expanded their focus to encompass a wider range of American artists and topics with a transatlantic focus. Museum closing  In 2003, after conducting a comprehensive two-year study to plan the foundation‚Äôs future mission and goals, the board of directors of the Terra Foundation for American Art decided to expand the reach of the foundation and to close the Terra Museum in Chicago at the end of October 2004. Before the museum closed, Judith Terra, the founder's widow and his second wife, plus several board members, attempted to relocate the museum to Washington, D.C., but a 2004 legal settlement required the Foundation to stay in the state of Illinois for 50 years. The works formerly displayed at the museum continue to be owned by the Terra Foundation for American Art, and the Foundation continues to expand the collection. A selection of Terra Foundation paintings remains on long-term loan to the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Art Institute also houses the Foundation‚Äôs collection of works on paper. The Foundation also makes significant loans to institutions and exhibitions worldwide.

It has a population of 3,854 Main Square  History  Numerous archaeological remains from the Lower and Middle Paleolithic have been found in the Porzuna district. They are prehistoric tools such as cleavers and double-axes, which illuminate a site of the first settlers for a long period of time. Porzuna was the site of Romans and Visigoths, and it is from these civilizations that historical remains have been found such as those of a villa in La Porcuna Vieja, coins and carved stones of a Visigothic church (6th century) that are currently part of the archeology collection of the Ciudad Real Museum. It is probable that, in the Muslim period, the lands of Porzuna belonged to the Castle of Malag√≥n, and that the Bullaque river served as the natural eastern limit of the Kingdom of Badajoz until that kingdom disappeared. It is in the 12th century when the term of Porzuna becomes property of the Order of Calatrava. In 1245 a document from the Archbishopric of Toledo and the Order of Calatrava on the payment of taxes appears for the first time under the title of Fuente Porcuna. Such a name may have made reference to the existence of a spring used by wild boars for drinking. After numerous confrontations, the terms of Porzuna and El Robledo were dispossessed of the Order of Calatrava in favor of Villa Real (today Ciudad Real) and it would not be until 1329 when, by sentence of Alfonso XII, Villa Real was forced to return Porzuna source and indemnify the Malag√≥n Commander for the grievance. It was at this time that a demographic increase began to take place at the same time that Fuente Porzuna would be renamed Puebla de Padilla in reference to the master of the order. In the middle of the 16th century, Porzuna was sold to the Marshal of Castilla Ares Pardo de Saavedra. From there, civil conflicts arose that were resolved with the Deed of Concord of 1552, through which the neighbors, the Council and the Lord, had the Rights established. It continues like this until in 1769, by decree of Carlos III, it becomes an independent town of Malag√≥n. In 1901, the existence of the Commonwealth of Pastures in the Porzuna Lands was declared, and some time later, the Casa de Medinaceli decided to alienate its alleged rights to the Porzuna mountains and lands in 1906. The same rights are divided, due to the different owners of the same, until Law 5/1980 tries to solve the problem of the historical rights of Porzuna establishing a reorganization of the property that would favor the municipality and neighbors, beginning, in turn, the Porzuna Land Concentration with the development of the same law.

The family was first described by Charles Th√©ophile Bruand d'Uzelle in 1851. Most species have at least partially metallic patterns coloration and are diurnal, sometimes swarming around the tips of branches with an undulating flight. Others are crepuscular and have a drab coloration. Fairy longhorn moths have a wingspan of 4‚Äì28 millimeters, and males often have especially long antennae, 1‚Äì3 times as long as the forewing. They are widespread across the world and can be found over much of North America and Eurasia from April to June. About 50 species occur in Europe, of which most widely noted is the green longhorn (Adela reaumurella) which can sometimes reach great abundance; due to climate changeKuchlein & Ellis (2004) its peak flying season is shifting towards spring. In general, they are more plentiful in the Northern Hemisphere, but the family occurs in the Neotropics, sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia and Australia too.Edwards (2007), FE (2009) Adelidae are usually closely restricted to particular host plants, in which the females insert their eggs or just lay among leaf litter, and the caterpillars make a case, completing their development on the ground. Fairy longhorn moths feed in sunshine on nectar from the flowers of herbaceous (woody) plants. Systematics Fairy longhorn moths belong to the superfamily Adeloidea, one of the basal (\\"monotrysian\\") branches of the advanced moth infraorder Heteroneura. By lepidopteran standards, they are thus still rather primitive micromoths. But like other Heteroneura, they already possess the apomorphic sucking proboscis ‚Äì usually considered a defining feature of Lepidoptera, but the most ancestral moths still live on solid food which they chew.Davis (1999) The Adelidae were previously placed as the subfamily Adelinae within the family Incurvariidae. =Subfamilies= The Adelidae are usually divided into two subfamilies, but most genera are of uncertain or basal relationships. Selected species are also listed:Wikispecies (31 October 2008), FE (2009), and see references in Savela (2003) Subfamily Adelinae * Adela Latreille, 1796 ** Adela croesella ** Adela reaumurella ‚Äì green longhorn * Cauchas Zeller, 1839 ** Cauchas rufimitrella * Nemophora Illiger & Hoffmannsegg, 1798 (tentatively placed here) **Nemophora degeerella ‚Äì longhorn moth ** Nemophora metallica ** Nemophora ochsenheimerella Subfamily Nematopogoninae * Ceromitia Zeller, 1852 (tentatively placed here) ** Ceromitia iolampra * Nematopogon Incertae sedis * Subclemensia * Trichofrons The genus Tridentaforma is sometimes placed among the Adelidae incertae sedis too; others assign it to the closely related Prodoxidae.

Early life Allan Loughead was born in Niles, California, in 1889, the youngest son of Flora and John Loughead. He had a half-brother Victor, a sister Hope, and a brother Malcolm Loughead. Flora Haines Loughead was a well- known novelist and journalist. After separating from her husband, Flora took the children to Santa Barbara, California, where the brothers experimented with kites. Later, Flora moved them to a fruit ranch near Alma, California, where the brothers became interested in the gliding experiments of Professor John J. Montgomery. The Loughead brothers attended elementary school only, but were mechanically inclined from an early age. Victor Loughead, who was interested in automobiles and airplanes, moved to Chicago, where he became associated with James E. Plew, an automobile dealer. There, in 1909, Victor wrote a book, Vehicles of the Air, which became a popular treatise on aircraft design and aviation history. In 1904, Malcolm became a mechanic with the White Steam Car Company in San Francisco. Allan Loughead went to San Francisco in 1906 where he became a mechanic at $6 a week ($ in today dollars). By 1909, he was driving race cars. Early experience with aviation In Chicago, Victor Loughead convinced Plew to acquire rights to one of the Montgomery's gliders and to buy a Curtiss pusher biplane. Plew hired Allan Loughead to convert the Montgomery glider to a powered aircraft. When Allan left for Chicago, he said, \\"I expect to see the time when aviation will be the safest means of transportation at 40 to 50 miles per hour, and the cheapest, and I'm not going to have long white whiskers when that happens. The airplane will take over both land and water travel. Flying has no barriers.\\" Allan and Malcolm Loughead installed a 2-cylinder, 12 hp motor on the Montgomery glider with Victor as engineer. Allan Loughead's first flight was in Chicago in 1910 when he climbed aboard a home-made aircraft and operated its ailerons while its builder, George Gates, operated the rudder and elevators. When two of Plew's trained pilots could not get the Curtiss airborne, Allan said: \\"I've got a $20 gold piece that says I'll make it fly, and I'm offering three-to-one odds! Any takers?\\" There being none, he got the airplane airborne on his second try. Later he said of this flight, \\"It was partly nerve, partly confidence and partly damn foolishness. But now I was an aviator!\\" The Curtis pusher was powered by a 30 H.P. engine. When Plew withdrew from aviation after two of his planes were wrecked and a student killed, Loughead became a flight instructor with the International Aeroplane Manufacturing Company in Chicago, and put on aerial exhibitions for 25% of the gate receipts. Later he said: \\"I was really rich the first week out. I made something like $850.\\" Unfortunately, during an exhibition at Hoopeston, Illinois, his rain-soaked airplane failed to climb enough and was entangled in telephone wires. At that point, he decided to build a better aircraft so he could collect all of the gate receipts. Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company Loughead returned to San Francisco in 1912 and went to work as an auto mechanic. There, he and his brother Malcolm spent their spare time building a three-place seaplane to operate from San Francisco Bay. They constantly ran out of money until they convinced Max Mamlock of the Alco Cab Company to invest $4,000 in the plane. Finally, after 18 months, their Model G was christened the ALCO NO. 1 in 1913, and Allan Loughead made a successful flight in it from the waters of the Golden Gate entrance to San Francisco Bay. That first flight was on June 15, 1913. The flight reached an altitude of 300 feet and a speed of 60 miles per hour. Allan then returned to take Malcolm for a ride. The Model G made three flights that day. Allan Lockheed recalled in 1942 that the Model G was built mostly with hand tools and called the aircraft \\"one of the first successful three place tractor seaplanes in the United States.\\" While the Model G, the first plane to bear the Loughead (Lockheed) name, was far ahead of its time, few would pay $10 to fly in it. Mamlock soon lost his enthusiasm for aviation and seized the plane. He told the Lougheads if they wanted it back, they would have to repay his $4,000. Consequently, in the hopes of striking it rich, the Loughead brothers spent two unsuccessful years prospecting in California's gold country. With the financial aid of Alaskan pioneer Paul Meyer, Allan and Malcolm Loughead bought the Model G back in 1915 and opened a flying concession at the Panama- Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. In five months, they took 600 paying passengers aloft and netted $4,000. Henry Ford was one person who turned down a ride, saying, \\"I would not take even a straightaway flight four feet above the bay in anybody's aeroplane for all the money in California.\\" In early 1916, the Loughead brothers moved the operation to Santa Barbara, where they were swamped by people wanting to make their first flight. In addition, they made charter flights to the off-shore islands, and local movie companies used the plane to take aerial footage.  Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company  In 1916, the brothers founded Loughead Aircraft Manufacturing Company in Santa Barbara to build a 10-place, twin-engined F-1 flying boat for their aerial sightseeing business. They began construction in a rented garage, which attracted the attention of 20-year-old John K. \\"Jack\\" Northrop. Northrop was skilled in drafting and mathematics, and the Lougheads employed him in designing the F-1. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Allan Loughead went to Washington, D.C. to get a Navy contract to build the F-1 in quantity. The Navy informed Loughead that it would purchase only previously approved designs. Later, Loughead said of this visit, \\"Down there I lost all the patriotism I ever had.\\" He did return with a contract to build two Curtiss flying boats and an agreement for the Navy to test the F-1. When the F-1 was completed, Allan Loughead and a crew of three flew it from Santa Barbara to San Diego in April 1918, setting a record of 181 minutes for the 211-mile flight. After the Navy completed its tests, the F-1 was returned to Loughead Aircraft and was then converted into the F-lA land-plane. Loughead hoped to interest the Army in it as a long-range bomber or transport plane. The war ended before its conversion was completed. The Lougheads attempted to demonstrate the long-range potential of the F-lA by making the first flight from Santa Barbara to Washington, D.C. Their crew included pilot Orvar Meyerhoffer, co-pilot Aaron R. Ferneau, and mechanic Leo G. Flint. They departed Santa Barbara on November 23. En route they encountered severe weather, which cleared when they crossed the Colorado River at Yuma, Arizona. Near Tacna, Arizona, an engine failed and Meyerhoffer made a rough landing. Flint worked on the engine while Meyerhoffer and Ferneau took a train to Yuma to have the broken tailskid repaired. The trio cleared a makeshift runway, took off, and landed at Gila Bend, Arizona for fuel. On the second takeoff attempt, the engine quit, and the plane crashed nose first into the ground. That ended the F-lA's transcontinental flight. When Loughead Aircraft completed its two HS-2L flying boats for the Navy in early 1919, it then converted the damaged F-lA landplane back into the F-1 flying boat for its sightseeing flight operations. Among their most notable passengers were King Albert and Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, whom the Lougheads flew at the request of the US government. Albert and Elisabeth were so impressed with their flight to Santa Cruz Island that they presented Allan and Malcolm with the Belgian Order of the Golden Crown. Local movie studios paid $50 an hour for flight time in the F-1 and $50 an hour while on standby. In 1919, Loughead Aircraft entered the small aircraft market with the single-seat S-1 Sport Biplane. Intended to be \\"the poor man's airplane\\", it featured an innovative molded plywood monocoque fuselage for which the Lougheads, Northrop and Tony Stadlman received a patent. Its foldable wings allowed storage in a garage, and the lower wings could be rotated to act as ailerons and airbrakes. Because no suitable engines were available, the company designed and built a 25-horsepower water-cooled engine for the S-1. The S-1 was tested successfully at Redwood City, CA in 1919 by Gilbert Budwig and flew well. After the S-1 completed test flights, the pilot said it was the most flyable plane he had ever flown. The plane made hundreds of flights and proved to be a successful design. At an aircraft show in San Francisco, thousands admired the S-1, but no one ordered the $2,500 plane. Allan Loughead realized that the government's sale of war surplus aircraft for as little as $300 had killed the market for new aircraft. As a result, Loughead Aircraft closed in 1920 and its assets were liquidated in 1921. Malcolm Loughead formed the Lockheed Hydraulic Brake Company in 1919 to promote a revolutionary four-wheel hydraulic brake system that he had invented. Tired of his name being mispronounced \\"Log-head,\\" Malcolm changed the spelling to match its pronunciation. Walter Chrysler introduced the Lockheed brake system on the first Chrysler car in 1924. Malcolm sold his business to Bendix in 1932.  Real estate business  From 1920 to 1922, Allan Loughead was the Los Angeles sales manager for Lockheed brakes. In the summer of 1922, Allan Loughead operated a ride concession at Catalina Island. Called \\"The Thrill Of Avalon,\\" it consisted of a touring car body mounted on two seaplane floats and powered by an aircraft engine driving a pusher propeller. The skimmer proved to be too rough and noisy to be popular and lasted only a year. Later, when asked if he made any profit on the venture, Loughead laughed and said, \\"No, we went broke, which was not a new experience!\\" In 1922, Allan Loughead became a real estate salesman in the Hollywood area. He wrote in 1942 that the real estate business was \\"not interesting, but from a financial standpoint [it was] very successful.\\" Whenever possible, Loughead and Jack Northrop would get together and discuss ideas about new aircraft. By now Northrop was an engineer with the Douglas Aircraft Company. In 1926, Allan Loughead and Jack Northrop decided to build a high-speed monoplane with a capacity of four passengers and a pilot in a streamlined fuselage using their patented monocoque construction. Northrop created drawings of the plane at home. The plane was to be powered by the new Wright Whirlwind engine. The only disagreement arose over the wing. Northrop wanted to use a self-supporting cantilever design that eliminated wing struts. Loughead believed the public wouldn't want to fly in a plane without visible wing supports. In the end, Northrop won.  Lockheed Aircraft Corporation  Loughead and Northrop set out to form an aircraft company. Loughead's accountant friend, Kenneth Jay, introduced them to Fred S. Keeler, a successful brick and ceramics manufacturer. After reviewing their proposal, he agreed to help finance the project. As a result, using $22,500 from Keeler and $2,500 from Loughead, the four formed the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in December 1926, with Keeler as president, Loughead as vice president and general manager, Northrop as Chief Engineer and Stadlman as Factory Superintendent. They used the \\"Lockheed\\" spelling to associate themselves with Malcolm's successful brake company. The company established operations in a garage in Hollywood in January 1927. While Loughead continued his real estate business, he arrived every afternoon to help on the plane. The first major task was to build a concrete mold, shaped like an elongated bath tub, for molding half of the laminated wood fuselage. Two halves were made and then fastened to a skeleton framework of wood to form the fuselage. Next came the construction of the plywood-covered cantilever wing, the tail surfaces, the landing gear and mounting the engine. When completed, the company had invested nearly $17,500 in the plane, which was named the Vega. The result was a successful high-speed monoplane with a range of 1,000 miles, a cruising speed of 185 miles per hour, and capacity of six people.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 59-60, Cypress, CA, 2013. The timing of the Vega was propitious. In 1927, Charles Lindbergh's flight from New York to Paris renewed interest in aviation. Soon after, James D. Dole, president of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, offered a prize of $25,000 ($ in 2011) to the first person to fly from North America to Hawaii after August 12, 1927. As a result, George Hearst, publisher of the San Francisco Examiner, bought the Vega for $12,500 and entered it in the Dole Air Race under the name Golden Eagle. Later Loughead said, \\"The sales price represented a loss, but we were happy to absorb it. The prestige of selling the Vega to Hearst was tremendous.\\" Hearst also ordered a Vega seaplane for a flight to Australia. All the Lockheed personnel were present when the first Vega was trucked to a hayfield near Inglewood, California. Test pilot Eddie Bellande took it up on its first flight. Upon landing, he yelled, \\"Boys, she's a dandy, a real joy to fly!\\" =Dole Race= World War I flyer Jack Frost was chosen to pilot the Golden Eagle with Gordon Scott as his navigator. The plane was provided with many safety features and equipped for 30 days of survival at sea. At noon on August 16, the starter's flag dropped at Oakland's unfinished airport and the Travel Air Oklahoma departed first. Minutes later, the privately built El Encanto groundlooped off the runway. Then the Breese Pabco Pacific Flyer failed to get airborne. At 12:30 p.m. the Golden Eagle lifted off and headed out over the Golden Gate for Honolulu. It was followed by the Buhl Miss Doran, the Breese Aloha, the Travel Air Woolaroc, and the Swallow Dallas Spirit. The Miss Doran, Oklahoma and Dallas Spirit soon returned with difficulties. Only the Miss Doran was able to become airborne again, and by 2 p.m., Loughead knew the Lockheed Vega was the fastest plane in the race. None of the planes carried radio transmitters - all Loughead could do was to await news from Hawaii. The airplanes were supposed to arrive about 1 PM the next day. The next morning, Jim Dole and the Race Committee gathered on Wheeler Field at Honolulu. The Travel Air Woolaroc landed after 26 hours and 16 minutes aloft, and Art Goebel and Bill Davis crawled out to claim the $25,000 first prize. Two hours later, the Breese Aloha landed, and Martin Jensen and Paul Schluter claimed the $10,000 second prize. It became apparent that the Golden Eagle and Miss Doran were down in the Pacific. Despite an extensive air and sea search, no trace of either plane was found. =Arctic exploration= Gloom fell over the Lockheed factory, even though a factory demonstrator Vega was underway. Arctic explorer Captain George Hubert Wilkins had seen the Golden Eagle from his San Francisco hotel window during a test flight. He was so impressed that he went to the Oakland airport to learn more about it. Then he drove to Hollywood and met with Loughead, Northrop, and others and pored over its drawings. He placed an order for the third Vega equipped for Arctic exploration. After flight tests in January 1928, by Eddie Bellande, he said, \\"She's a pippin!\\". Wilkins selected Arctic flyer Carl Ben Eielson to pilot the Vega on a planned flight from Barrow Alaska, the northernmost settlement in Alaska, over the Arctic region to the island of Spitsbergen near Norway. After Eielson tested the plane, it was shipped to Fairbanks, Alaska. Eielson and Wilkins then flew it to Barrow. From there, after waiting three weeks for good weather, they took off from a crude ice runway and headed for the island of Spitsbergen. For the first , the weather was clear. Then dense clouds forced frequent course changes. They made landfall at Grant Land in Canada's Northern reaches. Then, as they edged around the northern tip of Greenland, they encountered more bad weather. Within of their goal, they encountered a raging blizzard. Fuel was dangerously low, but Eielson spun down through a hole in the clouds and landed safely on snow covered land. Unable to see anything in the blizzard, the men curled up in the cabin. The blizzard blew for four days. On the fifth day the weather cleared, and they spent six hours clearing a makeshift runway in the snow. When they became airborne they saw the radio masts of Gr√∏nfjorden, Spitsbergen ahead. In less than 30 minutes, they landed there after spending 20.5 hours airborne and five days on the ground within sight of their goal. Wilkin's flight across the Arctic was hailed as one of the greatest in aviation. Wilkins was knighted by King George V of the United Kingdom, while Eielson received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Harmon Trophy from President Herbert Hoover. Before he returned to the US, Wilkins began planning an expedition to Antarctica and ordered a low-wing Lockheed Explorer seaplane. He soon changed his order to a high-wing Vega seaplane. After he and Eielson arrived in Antarctica in December, 1928, they used the Vegas to make the first flights in history over the continent, and to explore much of its uncharted territory from the air. Thus the Vega became the first plane to discover new land, and Wilkins named many of its features after his friends and backers. He named the Lockheed Mountains after the builder of his plane. =Move to Burbank= The Wilkins expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic brought Lockheed Aircraft a flood of orders, which required a move to new facilities in Burbank, California, in March 1928. Lockheed received an order for 20 Vegas worth $250,000 ($ in 2011), the largest commercial aircraft order to date. The nation's fledgling airlines soon recognized the potential of the Vega as an airmail and passenger plane. Also, Northrop designed the parasol wing Air Express for Western Air Express as an airmail and a passenger plane. The Vega, Explorer and Air Express, and the variants that stemmed from them, were used by the biggest names in aviation, Art Goebel, Bob Cantwell, Frank Hawks, Amelia Earhart, Wiley Post, Roscoe Turner, Jimmy Doolittle, and others, to set a number of distance, speed and endurance records. This led Allan Loughead to coin the famous phrase, \\"It Takes a Lockheed to Beat a Lockheed.\\" In 1928 the company sales exceeded one million dollars. The Lockheed Vega remained the primary product of the Lockheed Corporation. The Vega was a high-wing, cantilever monoplane manufactured using the two-piece moulded-under-pressure streamlined plywood fuselage skin construction developed in Santa Barbara. The plane was manufactured in four-passenger and six-passenger variants. By April 1929, the company was producing five planes per week with less than 300 employees. The retail sales price of these planes averaged about $17,000 each. =Acquisition by Detroit Aircraft Corporation= In mid-1928, Jack Northrop left Lockheed Aircraft to start his own company. Gerald Vultee (later to found Vultee Aircraft) became the Lockheed chief engineer. Part of the reason Northrop left was that Lockheed's management refused to invest in developing new metal aircraft and chose to maximize revenue from its proven wood designs. Meanwhile, the Detroit Aircraft Corporation, a holding company with assets of $28 million, began acquiring a portfolio of aviation companies. In July 1929, Fred E. Keeler, an investor who owned 51 percent of Lockheed, decided to sell the company assets to Detroit Aircraft Company. The acquisition was through an exchange of stock. Unhappy with this situation, Allan Loughead resigned as president and general manager on June 3, 1929, and later sold his Detroit Aircraft stock for $23 a share. With the stock market crash in October 1929, Detroit Aircraft stock fell to 12.5 cents a share and by 1932 Lockheed Aircraft was bankrupt. =Receivership= A group of investors headed by brothers Robert Gross and Courtlandt S. Gross, and including Walter Varney bought the Lockheed company out of receivership in 1932. Allan Lockheed returned as a consultant but had no formal management role with his namesake company. The Lockheed Aircraft Company later became a major aerospace and defense company, and in 1995 merged with Martin Marietta to form Lockheed Martin.Lockheed Martin History, Lockheed Martin website Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 59-76, Cypress, CA, 2013.  Later career  In 1930, Loughead formed the Lockheed Brothers Aircraft Corporation in Glendale, California and developed the experimental Olympia Duo-four, a five-place high-wing monoplane with two engines mounted side by side in the wood monocoque fuselage nose.\\"Two Motors in Nose of Plane Make Safer Flying\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1934 excellent photo at top-left of pg 900 It had a plywood-covered wing and wheel pants. The fuselage was covered with a two-piece moulded-under-pressure plywood skin. He made numerous flights in this plane demonstrating its extremely safe single-engine performance. This fourth commercial aircraft venture by Loughead lasted until 1934. In 1934, Loughead, tired of the many mispronunciations of his name, legally changed it from Loughead to Lockheed. Lockheed spent the period from 1935 to 1936 as a consultant. In 1937, Lockheed formed the Alcor Aircraft Corporation in San Francisco and developed the Alcor C-6-1, an 8-place, low-wing plane that also had excellent single-engine performance. Unfortunately, the prototype C-6-1 was lost over San Francisco Bay. During a 1938 test flight, the Alcor prototype went out of control. A pilot and a passenger bailed out, \\"leaving the plane to descend in slow circles until it hit the waters of the Golden Gate and sank, as related in the 1957 Lockheed history, \\"Of Men and Stars.\\" The Alcor company folded in 1939. \\"I guess Alcor was the final burnout for Dad,\\" said his son, Allan Jr. \\"He got only enough money from the insurance to pay off the creditors and close the doors.\\" Afterwards, Lockheed continued to make design studies of aircraft, such as fighters and bombers, for war use. In 1941, Lockheed became Vice President of the Berkey & Gay Furniture Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where he served as general manager of the Aviation Division and Director of Aircraft Engineering. In August 1941, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. Jones appointed Lockheed to the Cargo Plane Committee, which also included Andre Preister, William Bushnell Stout, Luther Harris, and J.W. Crowley. The committee was charged with drawing up basic design recommendations for a cargo plane for the Aviation Division of the Defense Supplies Corporation. The committee's work was completed and accepted in January 1942. In October 1942, Lockheed became the general manager of the Aircraft Division of Grand Rapids Store Equipment Company, making parts for Navy fighters. After the war, Allan Lockheed continued his career as a real estate salesman in California, while also occasionally serving as an aviation consultant. In the mid-1950s, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation asked Allan Lockheed to return as a consultant, mainly to help on the \\"Of Men and Stars\\" history being prepared by Lockheed public relations writer Phil Juergens.\\" Lockheed's son John Lockheed said that \\"Dad was delighted to come back to Lockheed.\\" Allan Lockheed, Jr., said, \\"It was a tremendous boost to his morale to be able to rejoin the company.\\" In 1961, Allan Lockheed moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he lived in semi- retirement. He continued as a consultant for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Once, when someone asked Lockheed what he did in the early days of aviation, he answered, \\"I survived!\\"  Death  Allan Lockheed died of liver cancer in Tucson on May 28, 1969, at the age of 80.  Legacy  Lockheed was enshrined in the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, in 1986. His daughter, Beth, was present, and his son John accepted the award on Lockheed's behalf.

The highway starts at the Hansboro‚ÄìCartwright Border Crossing along the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and ends at the Saskatchewan boundary 13.6 kilometres west of Roblin. Along the way it passes through the communities of Cartwright, Glenboro, Carberry, Neepawa, McCreary, Ste. Rose Du Lac, Grandview, Gilbert Plains. The highway, running concurrently with PTH 10, bypasses the City of Dauphin (PTH 5A / 10A run through Dauphin). Between the western junction with PTH 10 and Ste. Rose Du Lac, this segment is called the Northern Woods and Water Route. The highway is also the main route through Spruce Woods Provincial Park between Glenboro and Carberry. PTH 5, along with PTH 20 and PTH 50, has the distinction of being both a north-south and east-west highway, although PTH 20 maintains its north-south designation for the entire route. From the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border to PTH 68 east of Ste. Rose du Lac, PTH 5 is designated as a north- south highway. From PTH 68 to the Saskatchewan border, the highway's designation changes to east-west. History Prior to 1980, the southern terminus for PTH 5 was at PTH 16 (PTH 4 prior to 1977) in Neepawa, making the original length of the highway . In 1980, the highway was extended to its current southbound terminus, replacing PR 258 between Neepawa and PTH 3 at Cartwright, via Glenboro and Carberry, and PTH 28 between the U.S. border and Cartwright.

The novel fits in the hard science fiction genre, describing the late-21st century Earth facing technological singularity. The novel received the prime Polish award for sci-fi literature, Janusz A. Zajdel Award, for 2001.  The world  The year is around 2060. The United States is still a leading power, but European and Asian powers are trailing close behind it. Technology has advanced, with biotechnological implants allowing people control over computers via brain-computer interfaces. Full immersion virtual reality is common, as well as 'Orto Virtual Reality' - mixing virtual reality with our reality, in effect 'skinning' our reality in a form of augmented reality. Much of the elite is genetically engineered as well, with AIs being increasingly common. In many ways this is a dark, cyberpunk-kind of a world. However, the conflicts of this future era rely more on economics and market forces than sophisticated military hardware. In this world the stock market is the new battleground for nations and megacorps. Technological trends are far from only ones explored by Dukaj in his book. He portrays the futuristic bureaucracy, political power struggles behind private sector, government and the military, and changes in culture. Dukaj extrapolates from the current trend of increasing lawsuits and political correctness: in his world many people willingly live under constant mass surveillance of the New Etiquette (NEti), which registers all their actions so that they couldn't be falsely accused of some \\"personal offense crime\\". Plot summary The main character, Nicholas Hunt, is an American politician and lobbyist, closely involved with some branches of secret military research including paranormal activities. He is not a hero: as Dukaj himself describes him, he is \\"a cynical, egoistic bureaucrat, whose main motivation for all of his decisions in his job is, it seems, covering his ass\\". Currently he has lost an internal power struggle and is assigned to oversee what seems like a dead-end, low-key project. Soon, however, his project starts to gain more importance, as scientists explore some promising theories from the borders of memetics and telepathy, including study of potential lifeforms that would use memes just as we use genes, and develop new sciences like psychomemetics. Suddenly a strange cataclysm takes place, with millions of people worldwide going insane and many densely populated areas becoming a 'no-go' zone. Is this an alien invasion? A result of military or corporate experiment? A new step in human evolution? Or are we seeing the painful transformation into a post-technological singularity world? Nicholas Hunt is not sure, but he knows one thing: the rat race is going on, and he will do everything he needs to survive.  Trivia  The novel was cut down at the publisher's request from over 1000 pages to fewer than 500. The first seven chapters as well as several extra chapters which were cut from the printed versions are published free on Dukaj's website.

It is located along PTH 16 and PTH 83, and is at the western terminus of PTH 45. Russell is approximately from the Saskatchewan border and northwest of Winnipeg. The community is home to 1,611 people (2011 census). Russell is the home of Manitoba's Beef and Barley Festival, which is held annually in October to celebrate the region's strong agricultural tradition. Grain farming and cattle ranching are extensive in the surrounding areas.  History  European-Canadians first settled the area around Russell around 1880. The first post office began operations at a site north of the present community in 1880, and was called \\"Shell River\\". The closest CPR (Canadian Pacific Railway) point was renamed to Russell in 1889. It was named after Lord Alexander Russell. Also in 1889, a Dr Barnardo's Home for boys was established. The home and local farmers sponsored transportation for British orphans to come to the area to work on farms. Russell was officially incorporated as a town in 1913.  Industrial development  Recent changes to agriculture, such as the elimination of the Western Grain Transportation Subsidy, have put the region in a unique position. With one of the highest freight rates in western Canada, the Russell area is well- positioned to experience an explosion in value-added processing. Bunge Canada, an advanced canola-processing plant, is located at Harrowby, west of Russell. Nearby potash mining in Saskatchewan provides jobs for numerous Russell residents, as well as purchasing supplies and services locally. The first potash mine in Manitoba has been proposed for a site just southwest of Russell, but due to the greater depth of the potash and higher taxes versus Saskatchewan, progress has been stalled for the last 20 years. Russell and the surrounding rural municipalities are promoting tourism through the Asessippi Parkland Economic Development Corp.  Education  A semi-major service centre for the regional agricultural communities, Russell provides educational facilities ranging from day care and nursery, to post-secondary facilities. Russell is part of the Park West School Division. The Assiniboine Community College also has a regional campus located in Russell. The community has access to First Year Distant Education transmission, allowing individuals to take first-year education via internet.  Recreation  Recreational facilities include a serviced campground, tennis courts, ball fields, curling and hockey arenas, community halls, a swimming pool, snowboarding and downhill skiing, and a nine-hole golf course. Russell is located only from Asessippi Provincial Park, the site of Asessippi Ski Area & Resort‚Äîa world-class ski facility and year-round family park. The park also contains the Lake of the Prairies, a 64 km-long lake. In Manitoba the lake recorded an annual walleye catch per square kilometre that is five times greater than the provincial average.

CCPOA made the largest contribution to the No on 5 Campaign in 2008, contributing one million dollars. CCPOA president Don Novey established the union's tradition of forming close alliances and friendships with political leaders during the 1980s. Mission The mission of the CCPOA is to \\"promote and enhance the correctional profession, protect the safety of those engaged in corrections and advocate for the laws, funding and policies needed to improve prison operations and protect public safety.\\" Membership The CCPOA union members currently pay $90.70 per month to the union. As of 2017, the union had 39,750 members, at which time union dues totaled $31,600,141 per year. History In the 1950s, an officer, despondent over working conditions at San Quentin State Prison, committed suicide. This prompted Officer Al Mello and eight fellow officers, five of which were Correctional Lieutenants concerned with the pay scale and working conditions, to start traveling to the three existing state prisons (Folsom, Soledad, and San Quentin) to rally support for the creation of a union dedicated to representing the correctional officer series. In 1957, the California Correctional Officers Association (CCOA) was formed with members from each adult institution. Almost immediately, law enforcement officers from the California Youth Authority, Youth and Adult Paroles, and Medical Technical Assistants began to inquire about membership. Until the 1980s, unionized prison guards were relatively weak politically in California, with membership divided between the California State Employees Association and the CCOA. Don Novey led a successful effort during the 1980s to combine California Youth Authority supervisors and parole officers with prison guards, launching the CCPOA's rise to prominence. The CCPOA's membership increased substantially. Novey was an aggressive lobbyist and helped bring the union to a position of great influence in Sacramento politics, eventually becoming one of the most powerful unions in the state. By 1992, the CCPOA was California's second largest political action committee, contributing over a million dollars to legislative candidates. The CCPOA also contributed over a million dollars to Pete Wilson's successful 1990 gubernatorial campaign, the largest independent campaign contribution on behalf of a candidate in California history. The CCPOA subsequently backed Gray Davis's successful campaign for governorship in 1998. The CCPOA has supported campaigns for tougher criminal sentences, including large contributions to the 1994 campaign for Proposition 184, the 'three strikes' ballot initiative, which puts repeat offenders behind bars for lengthy terms. Political activity The CCPOA is deeply involved in a variety of political activities. Most spending is done through political action committees. Although its membership is relatively small, representing only about one tenth the membership of the California Teachers Association, CCPOA political activity routinely exceeds that of all other labor unions in California. The union spends heavily on influencing political campaigns, and on lobbying legislators and other government officials. CCPOA also hires public relations firms and political polling firms. As calls for reform of the state's prison system escalated during 2006, putting pressure on former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to take a more aggressive stance on reform. =Lobbying= Lobbying efforts and campaign contributions by the CCPOA have helped secure passage of numerous legislative bills favorable to union members, including bills that increase prison terms, member pay, and enforce current drug laws. The CCPOA takes the position that correctional officers perform an essential public service that work in great danger, and strives for a safer California. =Political action committees= CCPOA has many political action committees, according to a report in the Los Angeles Times.

In 1982, the story was adapted as a segment in the movie Creepshow, and included in comic-book form in the Creepshow graphic novella. Plot An old wooden crate, marked from an 1834 Arctic expedition, is discovered by a janitor beneath the basement stairs at the zoology department of Horlicks University. He notifies Dexter Stanley, the school's biology professor, and together they open it to discover the crate contains a small yet powerful - and hungry - beast, still alive after 140 years. The creature kills and eats the janitor, as well as Stanley's grad student Charlie Gereson - consuming them entirely, leaving only scraps of clothing behind. In a daze, Stanley flees to the home of his friend, English professor Henry Northrup. He tells Henry the whole story, and Northrup believes him, seeing the crate- dwelling beast as a way to rid himself of his verbally abusive, alcoholic wife, Wilma. He dopes Stanley's drink, and while Stanley is unconscious Henry writes and leaves a letter for Wilma to find and then drives to the University where he cleans up the blood and remaining scraps from the beast. Wilma meanwhile comes home and finds the letter and after reading it races up to the University. Henry had led her to believe in the note that Stanley had attacked a female grad student earlier and that she was now hiding underneath the stairs and that only Wilma would be able to talk her out. As Wilma peers under the stairs looking for the girl, Henry quickly comes up and pushes her from behind up against the beast's crate and starts screaming for it to come out and feed on her. After an initial delay that sees Wilma start to berate Henry, the beast - Northrup likens it to a Tasmanian devil, albeit possibly having six legs - does indeed appear and eat Wilma completely, then retreats back into its crate. As Henry carefully loads the crate into another larger crate for disposal, he notes that Wilma's face (and only her face) is still visible in the crate. Northrup drives the crate within a crate to a local quarry and tips the entire cargo into the deep quarry lake. Upon his return home Stanley wakes up, and the two decide to keep quiet about the entire incident - Stanley has gained a friend, and Northrup has lost his abusive wife, a situation that both are happy with. Film adaptations The story was adapted as a segment in the film Creepshow. Although there are numerous small changes, the film version remains essentially faithful to the written source material. The changes include the appearance of the beast to a small Yeti-like creature with a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and the beast destroying the waterlogged crate after being dumped in the lake and escaping into the outside world. In the ninth installment of the Friday the 13th franchise, Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday, an Easter egg of \\"The Crate\\" can be seen - labeled \\"Arctic Expedition Julia Carpenter Horlicks University\\". A crate marked \\"Ship to Horlicks University via Julia Carpenter\\" can be seen in The Walking Dead, Episode 1 of Season 5. While trying to escape from Terminus, Rick Grimes, Glenn, Daryl and Bob try to save someone trapped in a container. As they run across the street, the container can be seen off to the right of the screen. There were three original prop crates made for \\"The Crate\\" segment of the film Creepshow by production designer Cletus Anderson. A bloody crate, formerly owned by director George A. Romero, is owned by David Burian, prop collector and film archivist. The other two crates are owned by KNB FX co-owner Greg Nicotero (who purchased it from special effects artist Tom Savini) and Creepshow soundtrack composer John Harrison.

Bobby experiences his first kiss, but the relationship sours due to his being more interested in Marie than she is in him. He takes the break up hard. To cheer him up, Hank and Peggy take him to the Panhandler Steakhouse where he sees Marie also having dinner with her parents. He takes on the restaurant's standing challenge to eat a 72-ounce steak in under an hour, simultaneously spiting Marie and finding catharsis by eating the entire steak in just 37 minutes as everyone in the restaurant watches. He later vomits from overeating, which Connie initially feared might be his still reacting to the break-up. The couch story has Hank and the gang initially being against the couch being in the alley. As the days progress, they grow to like sitting on the couch while they drink in their usual spot. The couch is also where Bobby and Marie kissed, somewhat to Bill's annoyance.

It is part of Toledo Public Schools and contained the Smart Academy and Humanities Academy. Libbey was named after Edward Drummond Libbey, the founder of the Toledo Art Museum and Libbey Glass. David L. Stine was the building's architect.Libbey High School National Register of Historic Places Registration Form The Libbey Cowboys were founding members of the Toledo City League from 1926 until the school closed. Their colors were royal blue and gold. The Cowboys were most famous for their boys basketball teams and had a strong basketball rivalry with Scott High School in Toledo. Prior to the Shoe Bowl championship for the City League football title, Libbey had an annual Thanksgiving Day football game with Woodward High School from 1923-1932, and with DeVilbiss High School from 1933-1963. Fate of Libbey Libbey High School had been rumored to be potentially closing since the 1980s, but was recommended to stay open by the school district each time the issue was brought up. In 1991, TPS decided to close two high schools that were to be chosen from a list of Libbey, DeVilbiss and Macomber-Whitney high schools. Libbey was spared while DeVilbiss and Macomber-Whitney were shuttered. In April 2009, Libbey High School‚Äôs Student Council President had strong words for administrators and school board members with regard to saving their school. The proposal to eventually send some Libbey neighborhood students to Scott, Bowsher, and Waite high schools is \\"segregation of different populations and is racist\\", they claimed. Libbey always had been the \\"unwanted stepchild\\" of Toledo Public Schools and 'their positive news is always overshadowed by the negative\\", students added. Libbey was left open for the 2009-10 school year, but the issue of closing the school was brought up again in March 2010. After a failed levy early in May, Toledo Public Schools ultimately voted 3-2 in favor of closing school at the end of the 2009-10 school year. The final class of 2010 graduated on June 3 in the fieldhouse. All remaining Libbey students were divided geographically, between Scott, Bowsher, Waite and especially Rossford and Central Catholic High Schools. On July 15, 2011 Libbey High School was vetted by the Ohio Historic Site Preservation Board for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.Ohio Historic Site Preservation Advisory Board Lucas County Auditor's Photograph of Libbey High School, 1965 On August 15, 2011 two large dumpsters were placed (one at the south entrance and one at the east entrance) of the Career Center.

He was born in Winnweiler, and died in Heidelberg.  Academic career  In 1864 he received his medical degree from the University of Heidelberg, where for several years he served as an assistant to pathologist Nikolaus Friedreich (1825-1882). As a young man, he also worked for a period of time under Ludwig von Buhl (1816-1880) in Munich. In 1880 Erb attained the chair of special pathology at the University of Leipzig, where he was also appointed head of its policlinic. In 1883 he succeeded Friedreich at the University of Heidelberg, where he worked until his retirement in 1907. Psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) and neurologists Ernst Julius Remak (1849-1911), Max Nonne (1861-1959) and Paul Julius M√∂bius (1853‚Äì1907) NCBI, Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840‚Äì1921) and his contributions to neuroscience J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry.

Up until his death in 1921, he served as honorary president of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Nerven√§rzte (Society of German Neurologists).  Neurological research  Erb began his medical career in the fields of toxicology and histology, but later his interest switched to neurology, of which he became one of the 19th century's leading neurologists. He extensively used electrodiagnostic testing and demonstrated heightened motor nerve sensitivity in tetanus. He is also credited with popularizing the reflex hammer for use in neurological examinations. He made early observations associated with syphilis to tabes dorsalis (nerve fiber and nerve cell degeneration). In his research of tabes dorsalis, he tried to find the link between this condition and syphilis. He also made contributions in his research of poliomyelitis, claudication intermittens, and progressive muscular atrophy. In 1878, he described myasthenia gravis, a condition sometimes referred to as the \\"Erb-Goldflam disease\\" (named along with neurologist Samuel Goldflam). Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder that leads to fatigue and muscle weakness. He was the author of over 250 medical works, including Handbuch der Elektrotherapie (a textbook on electrotherapy), and an important study on spinal paralysis. In 1891, he contributed to the foundation of the journal, Deutsche Zeitschrift f√ºr Nervenheilkunde - in its first volume, he published a survey on muscular dystrophies.Jost W H.

Some supporters and staff were at first concerned that his tactics were in total contrast to those of his predecessor George Martin, but these doubts were laid to rest when he guided the team to FA Cup victory in 1955. The Newcastle board had the final say in which players would be playing during his spell at the club and they notably played Jackie Milburn for this final, against Livingstone's wishes. Milburn coincidentally scored in the match. It was largely believed that Livingstone was unhappy with the amount of influence the board had on first team issues (although he never stated this).

Krueger compared restaurant jobs in New Jersey, which raised its minimum wage, to restaurant jobs in Pennsylvania, which did not, and found that restaurant employment in New Jersey increased, while it decreased in Pennsylvania. The results reinvigorated the academic debate on the employment effects of minimum wages and spawned a large literature. His books, Education Matters: Selected Essays by Alan B.

It is written as a lifelong series of journals kept by the fictional character Mountstuart, a writer whose life (1906‚Äì1991) spanned the defining episodes of the 20th century, crossed several continents and included a convoluted sequence of relationships and literary endeavours. Boyd uses the diary form to explore how public events impinge on individual consciousness, so that Mountstuart's journal alludes almost casually to the war, the death of a prime minister or the abdication of the king. Boyd plays ironically on the theme of literary celebrity, introducing his protagonist to several real writers who are included as characters. The journal style of the novel, with its gaps, false starts and contradictions, reinforces the theme of the changing self in the novel. Many plot points simply fade away. The novel received mixed reviews from critics on publication, but has sold well. A television adaptation was made with the screenplay written by Boyd, first broadcast in 2010. Composition Mountstuart appeared in Boyd's short story \\"H√¥tel des Voyageurs\\" written in the early 1990s and published in London Magazine and his 1995 collection The Destiny of Nathalie 'X'. The story was inspired by the journals written by writer and critic Cyril Connolly in the 1920s. It was written in journal form and was, like Connolly's journals self obsessed, lyrical and hedonistic. As a schoolboy, Boyd was obsessed with Connolly, avidly reading his reviews in The Sunday Times, and later read his entire published ≈ìuvre and found his flawed personality 'deeply beguiling'.William Boyd explains the origins of Any Human Heart's Logan Mountstuart  Books  The Guardian Retrieved 2012-01-11. In 1988 Boyd had written The New Confessions as a memoir, the hoax biography of an invented artist, Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960, in which Mountstuart reappeared. Boyd claimed that he, as biographer, had first heard of the painter through the work of a little-known British writer, a black-and-white photograph of whom Boyd had found in a French second-hand shop. The caption identified the chubby man as \\"Logan Mountstuart in 1952\\".Tayler, Christopher A Bit of a Lush The London Review of Books, Vol. 24, No. 10, May 2002, London. Accessed 9 August 2010 Boyd described him as, Boyd distinguished journal, biography and memoir as literary forms, different treatments of the same essential subject, the human condition, the change in medium justified his writing again of a whole-life view: \\"I don't think there's anything wrong with going back over territory you've previously covered.\\"Cox, Tom. \\"William Boyd:The Magician of Realism\\" The Daily Telegraph, 16 April 2002, London. Though avowedly not an (auto-)biographical novelist, Boyd acknowledged that personal experiences often subconsciously affect a writer's fiction. As in several of Boyd's novels there are parallels with the author's life: both Boyd and Mountstuart lived in Africa and France, studied at Oxford, worked in literary London and had a taste of New York.Mullan. John. The Heart Has Its Reasons www.theguardian.co.uk. 11 November 2006. Accessed 9 August 2010. Boyd usually splits the creation of a novel into two phases: research and writing. The first phase of Any Human Heart took 30 months as he carefully plotted Mountstuart's life to be significant but seem random, a period during which he bought several hundred books. He spent another year and a half writing the book.  Synopsis  The book begins with a quotation from Henry James, \\"Never say you know the last word about any human heart.\\" A short preface (an anonymous editor suggests it was written in 1987) explains that the earliest pages have been lost, and recounts briefly Mountstuart's childhood in Montevideo, Uruguay before he moves to England aged seven with his English father and Uruguayan mother. In his final term at school he and two friends set challenges. Logan is to get on to the school's first XV rugby team; Peter Scabius has to seduce Tess, a local farmer's daughter; and Ben Leeping, a lapsed Jew, has to convert to Roman Catholicism. Mountstuart enters Oxford on an exhibition and leaves with a third in History. Settling in London, he enjoys early success as a writer with The Mind's Imaginings, a critically successful biography of Shelley; The Girl Factory, a salacious novel about prostitutes (which is poorly reviewed but sells well); and Les Cosmopolites, a respectable book on some obscure French poets. Mountstuart's mother loses the family wealth in the Wall Street Crash. He embarks on a series of amorous encounters: he loses his virginity to Tess, is rejected by Land Fothergill whom he met at Oxford, and marries Lottie, an Earl's daughter. They live together at Thorpe Hall in Norfolk, where Mountstuart, unstimulated by slow country life and his warm but dull wife, becomes idle. He meets Freya whilst on holiday, and begins an affair with her. Just before he departs for Barcelona to report on the Spanish Civil War, Lottie unexpectedly visits his London flat and quickly realises another woman lives with him. On his return to England, following an acrimonious divorce, he marries Freya in Chelsea Town Hall. The newlyweds move to a house in Battersea where Freya gives birth to their daughter, Stella. During the Second World War, Mountstuart is recruited into the Naval Intelligence Division by Ian Fleming. He is sent to Portugal to monitor the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; when they move to the Bahamas, Mountstuart follows, playing golf with the Duke and socialising regularly until the murder of Sir Harry Oakes. Mountstuart suspects the Duke is a conspirator after two hired detectives ask him to incriminate Oakes' son-in- law with false fingerprint evidence. Mountstuart refuses and is called a \\"Judas\\" by the Duchess. Later in the war, Mountstuart is interned in Switzerland for two years. After the war's end, he is grieved to discover that Freya, thinking him dead, had remarried and then died, along with Stella, in a V-2 attack. Mountstuart's life collapses as he seeks refuge in an alcoholic daze to escape his depression. He buys 10b Turpentine Lane, a small basement flat in Pimlico. He returns to Paris to finish his existentialist novella, The Villa by the Lake, staying with his old friend Ben Leeping (now a successful gallery owner). After a failed sexual encounter with Ordile, a young French girl working at Ben's gallery, he attempts suicide but is surprised by the girl when she returns an hour later for her Zippo lighter. Ben offers Mountstuart a job as manager of his new gallery in New York, \\"Leeping fils\\". Mountstuart mildly prospers in the art scene of the 1960s, meeting artists like Willem de Kooning (whom he admires) and Jackson Pollock (whom he does not); he moves in with an American lawyer, Alannah, and her two young daughters. On his return to London, he has an affair with Gloria, Peter Scabius' third wife (Peter has become a successful author of popular novels), and in New York with Janet, a gallery owner. He eventually discovers Alannah having her own affair, and the couple split. He reconciles with his son from his first marriage, Lionel, who has moved to New York to manage a pop group, until Lionel's sudden death. Monday, Lionel's girlfriend, moves into Mountstuart's flat; at first friends, they become intimates until her father turns up and Mountstuart discovers ‚Äì to his horror ‚Äì that she is 16 (having told him she was 19). His lawyer advises him to leave America to avoid prosecution for statutory rape. In the African journal, Mountstuart has become an English lecturer at the University College of Ikiri in Nigeria, from where he reports on the Biafran War. He retires to London on a paltry pension and, now an old man, he is knocked over by a speeding post office van. In hospital he brusquely refuses to turn to religion, swearing his atheism and humanism to a priest. He recovers but is now completely destitute. To boost his income and publicise the state of hospitals, he joins the Socialist Patients' Kollective (SPK), which turns out to be a cell of the Baader-Meinhof Gang. He becomes the SPK's prize newspaper seller and is sent on a special mission to the continent. The trip ends with a brief interrogation by Special Branch, after which Mountstuart returns to his life of penury in London. With a new appreciation of life, he sells his flat and moves to a small village in the south of France, living in a house bequeathed to him by an old friend. He fits into the village well, introducing himself as an √©crivain who is working on a novel called Octet. As he contemplates his past life after the deaths of Peter and Ben, his old school friends, he muses:  Themes  =Multiple selves= Multiplicity of self is introduced early on as a theme, to capture a \\"more riotous and disorganised reality\\", and the use of the journal as the novel's literary form is explicitly pointed to as developing this theme: \\"We keep a journal to entrap the collection of selves that forms us, the individual human being\\" the narrator explains. In an article in The Guardian, Boyd confirmed \\"this thesis that we are an anthology, a composite of many selves\\" is a theme of the book.William BoydThe book of life The Guardian 08 March 2003.

Wisdom, as with age, is slowly acquired. =20th century= Boyd has previously written about the 20th century through two characters: The New Confessions was a fictional memoir, and Nat Tate a spoof biography. In Any Human Heart, Boyd uses the journal form as a fresh angle to pursue the subject from: \\"I wanted to invent my own exemplary figure who could seem almost as real as the real ones and whose life followed a similar pattern: boarding school, university, Paris in the 20s, the rise of Fascism, war, post-war neglect, disillusion, increasing decrepitude, and so on‚Äîa long, varied and rackety life that covered most of the century.\\"Book Browse, Author Interview, Any Human Heart Boyd sets Mountstuart's life within its context, tracing the grand arc of events during the 20th century by depicting Mountstuart as swept along in the flow of history - he serves in World War II, sees the cultural revolution in the 1950s and 60s, and takes advantage of modern transport in his extensive travels around the world. Rather than being re-told in hindsight, their importance in context, historical events are seen through the petty lens of every-day living. For example, in an entry from the 1920s, Mountstuart notes \\"Coffee with Land Fothergill at the Cadena. She was wearing a velvet coat that matched her eyes. We talked a little stiffly about Mussolini and Italy and I was embarrassed to note how much better informed she was than I.\\"Giles Foden Heart of the matter The Guardian 20 April 2002. Retrieved 5 September 2010. Boyd said he was partially inspired by the generation of English writers who matured between the wars: \\"I am fascinated by the life and work of that generation of English writers who were born at the beginning of the century and reached maturity by the time of World War II. People like Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Anthony Powell, obviously, but also less well known writers‚ÄîHenry Green, Lawrence Durrell, Cyril Connolly and William Gerhardie. The last two in particular lurk closely behind Logan.\\" Both real and imagined characters are blended into this context, where historical personages are typically used to concentrate the historical significance of a novel's plot, Mountstuart's encounters with them are superficial, leaving only an impression of both parties' small-mindedness. John Mullan found the conceit most effective during the New York journal, where Boyd satirises figures in the Abstract Expressionist movement during the 1950s \\"whose characters seem almost beyond invention.\\"  Genre and style  The novel is narrated in the first person through a series of nine journaux intimes, kept by Mountstuart from age 17 until shortly before his death at 85.Eder, Roger. Evelyn Waugh Kissed Me The New York Times 16 February 2003. Accessed 9 August 2010. French literary journals, always published posthumously, are often extremely candid accounts, particularly of the author's sexual life. Boyd, himself a francophile, includes masturbation, prostitution and Mountstuart's three marriages. While Boyd had earlier written work in the form of memoir or biography, a journal is different: \\"For a start, it's written without the benefit of hindsight, so there isn't the same feeling you get when you look back and add shape to a life. There are huge chunks missing.\\" The novel's grounding in everyday life and focus on characterisation place it firmly within realism. Each journal covers a different period of Mountstuart's life, and they are usually geographically named: The School Journal, London I, etc. Boyd varied the narrator's tone in each to demonstrate changes in Mountstuart's character. In the first London Journal he is, according to Boyd, a \\"modernist aesthete\\", becoming a \\"world-weary cynic\\" in New York and finding \\"serene and elegiac serenity\\" in the final French journal. To support the book's historical themes and documentary premise, there is a feigned editorial apparatus: an index listing real people and their relation to Mountstuart alongside fictional characters, an editor's introduction (by Boyd), an authorial preface (by Mountstuart) and a list of works attributed to Mountstuart.Mullan, John Imaginary Friends The Guardian 28 October 2006. Accessed 25 September 2010. An additional stylistic feature is the anonymous editor (Boyd), who introduces the book and offers explanatory footnotes, cross-references and attempts at dating. Since a journal is written from the perspective of each day, Mountstuart's moods change as events affect him. The form lends itself to \\"plotlessness\\", since the author/narrator inevitably cannot see the overall structure of the story.Mullan, John. Notes to Self The Guardian, 21 October 2006, London. Accessed 9 August 2010 Plot lines which \\"fizzle and fade\\" emphasise the theme of multiple selves throughout life. Boyd adds other aspects to the work, such as parenthetical musings that are never answered, to re-enforce the style. His tone of voice gradually changes as he ages: Boyd wanted the style to reflect the major theme that we change and grow throughout life: \\"I wanted the literary tone of each journal to reflect this and so the voice subtly changes as you read on: from pretentious school boy to modern young decadent, to bitter realist to drink soaked cynic, to sage and serene octogenarian, and so forth.\\"  Critical reception  Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times: \\"William Boyd, is multifaceted and inventive, and he plays a deep game under his agile card tricks.\\" Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and wondered if he was merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, \\"Boyd hustles you through to the end despite all this, but it‚Äôs hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey.\\" In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: \\"he is far more generous, forgiving, and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life\\", thus making an \\"attractive central character\\" and Boyd's writing showed \\"a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism.\\"Allen, Brooke.

In The Observer, Tim Adams complimented the opening sections as \\"nicely layered with the pretensions of a particular precocious kind of student\\" but criticised the \\"predictability\\" of Mountstuart's \\"walk-on part in literary history\\" and ultimately the suspension of disbelief, particularly the Baader-Meinhoff passages, concluding \\"For all the incident, for all the change he witnesses, Mountstuart never really feels like a credible witness either to history or emotion.\\"Adams, Tim. The Observer Tues:Lunch with Baader-Meinhoff 14 April 2002. Accessed 10 August 2010. Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed: he praised the characterisation, calling Mountstuart \\"a man whose fragile egotism and loose-fitting story has you frequently forgetting you're reading fiction, and even more frequently forgetting you're reading at all.\\" Giles Foden, in The Guardian, found the New York art-scene sections weakest, saying they \\"puncture the realism Boyd has so carefully built up in the rest of the novel.\\" Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart's youth was well evoked, but that the description of his retirement and poverty was \\"as carefully observed and emotionally resonant\\".Kakutani, Michiko A Witness to the Century, Just Looking Out For Himself 14 February 2003,New York Times Book Review.

During the sixteenth century the first permanent settlement of the town arises around this hermitage. The increase in pilgrimages to pray to Christ determined the Crown and the Council of Military Orders to build a new chapel and some dependencies to give shelter to pilgrims. After the work during the reign of King Philip V, and resulting in a rapid increase in population, urban redevelopment, which took place, and in times of Carlos III, Pablo de Olavide became necessary. Later, in December 1800, King Charles IV issued a Royal Charter privilege with which dictated the independence of San Carlos del Valle and became independent and autonomous municipality as it is today.

Geography Santa Cruz de Mudela has a Mediterranean-Continental climate that consists of cold winters, warm summers, and little precipitation. History =The Founding of Santa Cruz de Mudela= Various artifacts and remains dating back to the first half of the second millennium B. C. E. have been found in the northern parts of the Meadow of Medula and the lowlands of Jabalon. Additional archaeological evidence from the Cerro de las Cabezas dig further suggests that the region was an important settlement of the Iberian Oretan tribe between the 7th and 2nd centuries B. C. E. In the following centuries, the region came to lie under the sphere of influence of a Roman, and later Visigothic, town near present-day Valdepe√±as. The Roman legacy and influence in Santa Cruz are most evident in the region's wine culture and many vineyards. After the sudden Moorish conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century, Santa Cruz's wine and vineyards became less important in the new Arabic culture. The town lost much of its former regional economic clout and came to serve mainly as a grain depository for the region south of Toledo. In 1212 C. E., after Alfonso VIII of Castile and the Order of Calatrava drove the Moors from Central Iberia, the townspeople relocated and established around the Good Well (situated in front of what was then a convent, but is now the barracks of the Civil Guard) the town center that exists today. The name of the town itself, Santa Cruz de Mudela, dates back to the 13th century. Several different explanations of the origin exist, mixing historical fact, tradition, and legend. Oral tradition takes the \\"Holy Cross\\" (Santa Cruz) to be that which accompanied the Christians in their triumphant 1212 battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. More reliable sources suggest that the \\"Santa Cruz\\" in actuality refers to the crossroads located in the Meadow of Mudela (so called for its proximity to the pass of Muradal, one of the entrances to the Central Meseta through the Andalusian Plain). =El Marquesado de Santa Cruz= On January 30, 1538, Don √Ålvaro the Elder bought off from Carlos I the towns of Santa Cruz de Mudela and Viso del Puerto (Muradal), under his own terms and along with civil and criminal jurisdiction, for 26,208,626 maraved√≠es (for comparison, Ferdinand Magellan's epic voyage around the earth, financed by Carlos I in 1518, cost 8,751,125 maravedis). Later his son, Don √Ålvaro de Baz√°n the Younger, became the first Marquis of Santa Cruz and built the palace and the Franciscanos Capuchinos convent, still constituted, as said above, in authentic benefactors of the town. The lineage of the Baz√°n belongs to one of the twelve houses of Navarre and continues through the towns of Bazt√°n, and in the vernacular language is called soy uno. Don √Ålvaro of Baz√°n was one of the most interesting historical figures from Spain of the 17th century. The illustrious Granadian, celebrated admiral of Felipe II, was named 'first marqu√©s of Santa Cruz of Marcenado, leader of the towns Viso and Valdepe√±as, major commander of Le√≥n, his majesty's advisor and general captain of the ocean sea and of the people during the war of the kingdom of Portugal. =The War of Independence and the Battle of Oca√±a= On June 5, 1808, Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Spain suffered a reversal at the hands of peasants from Santa Cruz de Mudela. Of 700 French troops, 109 were killed and an additional 113 were taken prisoner. Throughout November 1808, Santa Cruz de Mudela served as the headquarters for the La Mancha Spanish army under the command of General Don Francisco de Egu√≠a during preparations for the crucial Battle of Oca√±a. =19th Century to present= The city became known during the 19th century for its sword and cutlery artisans, who forged steel blades of exceptional quality comparable to those of Toledo and Albacete.

The book is a collection of most of de Camp's early \\"Viagens Interplanetarias\\" tales, all of which are set in a future in which interstellar travel between the Solar System and nearby stellar systems inhabited by alien races is common, and an Interplanetary Council regulates relations between the various civilizations. Terrans and the reptilian natives of the planet Osiris are the main spacefaring peoples. The tales take place in the period from the mid-21st-century to the mid-twenty-second. Individual stories are set on spaceships traveling between planets and individual planets such as Earth, Krishna, Ganesha and Osiris (it being assumed that Terrans will have carried their penchant for naming planets after gods to other star systems). Features of the postulated future include an Earth governed by a World Federation in which Brazil has become the paramount great power, with Terran space travel monopolized by a Brazilian-dominated agency called the Viagens Interplanetarias (\\"Interplanetary Tours\\" in Portuguese). Interstellar travel is limited to sub-light speeds, as the author eschews such common science fiction gimmicks as hyperdrives. Contents The date headings to the individual stories are as listed in the collection's table of contents and at the beginning of each story. *\\"In Re Sprague\\" by Isaac Asimov (introduction) *\\"Author's Note\\" *A.D. 2054-2088: \\"The Inspector's Teeth\\" *A.D. 2104-2128: \\"Summer Wear\\" *A.D. 2114-2140: \\"Finished\\" *A.D. 2117: \\"The Galton Whistle\\" *A.D. 2120: \\"The Animal-Cracker Plot\\" *A.D. 2135-2148: \\"Git Along!\\" *A.D. 2137: \\"Perpetual Motion\\" *A.D. 2153: \\"The Continent Makers\\" Reception Critical response to the book was mixed. The most extensive examination of the book came from P. Schuyler Miller, who wrote \\"Here you will find entertainment, ideas skillfully played with, precise care for detail and consistency, but actually not too much plot-suspense. So logical is the development of most of the stories, that the experienced reader knows what must be coming next.\\" Of the setting, he observed that it allowed \\"ample room for swashbuckling, skullduggery and horseplay, in which de Camp deals deftly from time to time,\\" but noted that \\"[o]ut of this setting, on the other hand, has come just one really memorable book--'Rogue Queen.'\\"\\"The Reference Library,\\" Astounding Science-Fiction, November 1953, p. 150-152. Mark Reinsberg wrote that \\"De Camp's style is adroit and witty as he develops science-fiction take-offs on themes like sea piracy, head hunters, the wild west, and jousting knight-hood,\\" and noted that \\"[t]he tales are spiced with glamorous other worldly women.\\"\\"It's 21st Century and Brazil Rules Stellar World,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 26, 1953, p. B5. He also rated it \\"[p]robably the most entertaining collection of 'tomorrow tales' by an individual author\\" published in 1953, whose \\"yarns kept the reader laughing over space pioneering in the 22d century and a marvelous pair of interstellar swindlers named Koshay and Borel.\\"\\"Exciting Year for Futuristic, Fantastic,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, December 6, 1953, p. 136 The English Journal stated that \\"[f]or fantasy, irony, and imagination these stories are remarkable.\\"\\"New Books,\\" The English Journal, April 1953, p. 226. The Los Angeles Times noted that in postulating the rise of Brazil as a world power, de Camp \\"develops an interesting and not too improbable theme.\\"\\"Storytellers Deal With Instruments of Future World,\\" Los Angeles Times, May 31, 1953, p. D6. On the other hand, Boucher and McComas felt \\"the stories of the Viagens Interplanetarias have usually struck us as pretty routine work unworthy of L. Sprague de Camp, but devotees of the series will welcome the collected volume.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, May 1953, p. 89. Groff Conklin assessed it as a \\"cream-puff-light book of space opera ... [f]ine stuff for bedtime, but I do feel that the stories were written with the left hind paw of an immensely brilliant fellow who just wasn't trying hard. Perhaps we should call it 'relentlessly light reading!'\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf,\\" Galaxy Science Fiction, June 1953, p. 122-123.

The duo consisted of musician Jake Holmes as Allen and his wife Katherine \\"Kay\\" Holmes as Grier. The two met at Bennington College and decided to write songs that mocked the popular folk music of the time. The result was an album that, according to interviews Jake Holmes has given, earned the pair the label \\"the most tasteless folk group ever\\" from Pete Seeger. Discography Despite being billed as a folk act, Allen & Grier actually emulate various genres of music on their sole album, Better To Be Rich Than Ethnic. The title track, for example, is a straightforward comedy track in which the pair's WASPish mother explains the virtues of being white and privileged. The tracks \\"Teenage Mother\\" and \\"Hyena Baby\\" parody the pop music of the late 50s that was often favored by the teenybopper set. The album's final track is an intentionally grating cover of the song \\"Earth Angel. \\"\\"The Ballad of the Camping Woodcutters\\" attempts to play on the sound of medieval ballads while at the same time making off-color puns. In fact, only \\"Grapefruits\\" and \\"Lonesome Traveler\\" sound like most folk music did at the time Allen & Grier were performing. One should note, furthermore, that the former of the two songs is intended to be a comedic song. Legacy Jim Connell, Jake Holmes, and Joan Rivers when they worked as the team \\"Jim, Jake & Joan\\" After moderate success with Better To Be Rich Than Ethnic, Katherine left Jake and the duo disbanded. Jake eventually formed a comedy act with Joan Rivers and Jim Connell called \\"Jim, Jake and Joan\\". Holmes' follow-up album, a serious solo effort titled A Letter to Katherine December, was released later. It dealt with the fall-out from his divorce. Since the advent on the online music industry, Allen & Grier has seen some resurgence in popularity, as prints of the original vinyl album have long been hard to find. The Culps, the married pair of middle school music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer on Saturday Night Live resemble Allen & Grier in their sound. Mrs. Culp in particular sounds like Grier. Also, both bands cover popular songs in quirkly, often irritating ways for the purpose of humor.

For nearly 700 years, the Castle and then Palace of Coudenberg was the seat of government of the counts, dukes, archdukes, kings, emperors and governors, who from the 11th century until its destruction in 1731, exerted their sovereignty over the area of the Duchy of Brabant, now in the southern Netherlands and northern Belgium. After several years of recent excavations, the archaeological vestiges of the palace and its foundations are open to the public. History Around 1100, the counts of Leuven and Brussels left the bottom of the valley of the Senne and built their castle on the heights of the Coudenberg from where they could dominate Brussels. With the creation of the Duchy of Brabant in 1183 by the German Emperor Frederik Barbarossa, the Coudenberg gained in importance and was included within the first great wall built around the city. The hunting park of the dukes led down the hill to the north, a remnant of which is now Brussels' Park. The palace and gardens of Coudenberg in 1659, L. Vorsterman the Younger With the second enclosure of the city, following the 1356 occupation by Louis II of Flanders, the castle was no longer necessary as a primary defence, and it was gradually converted from a military strong point into a residential palace. After 1430, when Brabant was annexed by inheritance to Burgundy, Philip the Good ordered the building of new wings for the palace, embellishments to the park, and the building of the Aula Magna, a gigantic room for royal receptions and other pageantry. The first regular meetings of the States-General, composed of delegates from the middle class, clergy and nobility of the Burgundian Netherlands, were held there in 1465. It was in this room that in 1515 Margaret of Austria formally relinquished her regency over the Low Countries to Charles von Habsburg, and the future emperor Charles V became the Duke of Burgundy. It was in this same room that, 40 years later, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son, King Philip II of Spain. During his reign, Charles V ordered the creation of Bailles Square (French: , Dutch: ) in front of the palace, the building of galleries and rooms in Renaissance style and the construction of the Grand Chapel in late Gothic style, in memory of his parents, Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile. Andreas Martin, 1726 In the 17th century, under their reign as the sovereigns of the Spanish Netherlands, the Archdukes Albert VII and Isabella established their court on the Coudenberg. The archdukes restored the facade of the palace, transformed the buildings and refitted the apartments and gardens. For the protection of the Archduchess, as she made her way to her devotions in the cathedral (this being the height of the Wars of Religion), the street which skirts the Aula Magna and the chapel was extended almost as far as the Cathedral of Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula, and renamed / (\\"Isabella Street\\"). As art lovers, the archdukes brought to their court the best artists of the time, Jan Brueghel and Rubens among them, to decorate the palace with their works. On the night of 3 February 1731, a fire broke out in the kitchens and quickly engulfed the entire palace. The freezing conditions made it difficult to deliver any water and the means of firefighting were very insufficient. In the morning, the palace was in ruins with many of the works of art destroyed along with the governmental archives. Only the chapel was saved. The court moved elsewhere. Funds were not available for rebuilding, so for more than 40 years, the ruins of the palace remained. It was only in 1774 that Charles Alexander of Lorraine proposed replacing the ruins with a Royal Square. Because of the architectural clash between the Gothic chapel and the surrounding neoclassical buildings, the chapel was pulled down. Modern Just off the southwest corner of Brussels' Park, lies the Royal Square (French: , Dutch: ) which was built atop the ruins of the old Palace. Originally, a statue of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, then-governor of the Austrian Netherlands, by Peter Anton von Verschaffelt, was placed on the square. The statue showed Charles- Alexander standing and attending to the affairs of government. Following the French Revolution and during the French rule over Brussels, it was melted down for the value of the metal. The current equestrian statue is of a young Godfrey of Bouillon. A new statue of Charles-Alexander of Lorraine was eventually placed nearby on Museum Square. The Royal Square on the Coudenberg is faced by the Church of St. James on Coudenberg. It was built by two French architects, Montoyer and Guimard, from 1776 to 1780, in the neoclassical style. In the 19th century, a dome and two side wings were added to the church. There are a number of other notable buildings on the Coudenberg including Belgium‚Äôs General Accounting/Auditing Office (French: , Dutch: ); the Royal Chapel, built in 1761 with a Louis XVI style interior; the Palace of Charles of Lorraine; and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium. Archaeological remains and partial restoration The remains of the ancient palace and adjacent building have been extensively excavated below present ground level, and preserved with a partial concrete cover. The remains can be visited via the BELvue Museum, and provide an excellent presentation of this historical site. The main buildings of the palace stood on roughly the same location as the present-day museum and Rue Royale/Koningstraat which faces it. The adjacent Chapel and Aula Magna buildings stood on sites which are now respectively part of the Centre for Fine Arts (BOZAR/PSK centre) and the north corner of the Royal Square beside the Musical Instruments Museum (MIM). The former / ran beside these buildings; it had a significant slope, but the present surface of Rue Royale which parallels it is flat, as the whole area was levelled in the 18th century. The lower rooms of these buildings partially survived the fire, and are exposed in the archaeological site. The preserved remains presently visitable comprise: * the cellars of the main palace * the rooms underlying the main banqueting hall in the Aula Magna * the warehouse space that underlay the chapel On the other side of Rue Isabelle, all along its length lay the house of the influential Counts of Hoogstraeten, currently (2008) at an advanced stage of excavation, with a view to later opening to visitors, alongside the existing remains.

He was born in Newburn, Newcastle upon Tyne, England. During his playing career he played for sides including Huddersfield Town and Sheffield Wednesday. Stan Seymour appointed Smith as his assistant at Newcastle United in 1939 and he helped contribute to the club's success in the 1950s. The loyalty he had shown by staying at the club for twenty-two years was rewarded in 1961 when he was appointed the new manager of the club, following Charlie Mitten's sacking. While he only won twelve games out of thirty-five during his period in charge, this was enough to stave off relegation to the Third Division, which had looked a distinct possibility when Mitten was sacked, and he still had the respect of the fans for staying with the club for so long and showing a passion for the club.

The corner route is less likely to be intercepted when compared to the slant route, because it is thrown away from the middle of the field. The pass is used frequently in the West Coast offensive scheme, where quick, accurate throwing is key. The pass may also be used closer to the goal line in what is called a \\"fade\\".

(YSB) was a non-profit corporation organized under the membership corporation law of the State of New York that provided safety and testing standards for the marine industry in the United States. Located in Westwood, New Jersey, the YSB developed boat safety tests, developed test equipment for these tests, and wrote standards for such testing, completely independently of commercial interests. It later became the Marine Department of Underwriters' Laboratories. The Yacht Safety Bureau created test standards. Another company, the American Boat and Yacht Council set performance standards.  History  The Bureau was established in 1947/48 by Ed S. Terwilliger based on work begun by E. D. Wright, a marine surveyor, as an independent, privately owned organization. The funding came from a group of insurance companies (yacht underwriters) and from National Association of Engine & Boat Manufacturers, Inc. (NAEBM). The board of directors was evenly divided between marine insurance companies and boat manufacturers. Early work included inspecting boat yards and writing reports on boat storage yards. Investigations into marine accidents lead to standards for testing of individual items of marine equipment. Reports developed as a result of these investigations became guides to underwriters and their surveyors and to boat builders. With United States Coast Guard cooperation, the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety. In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized as a non-profit public service membership corporation in the State of New York with no change of its name. It provided a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment. In 1969, it became the Marine Department of Underwriters' Laboratories.

It was also known as the Guided Projectiles Establishment and PERME Westcott (Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment, Westcott). For many years this establishment was regarded as so secret that it was not marked on Ordnance Survey maps, although it was present, from necessity, on maps for the use of pilots. History The establishment was set up in April 1946 under the Ministry of Supply. In the initial years a team of German scientists worked at the site, and examples of German weapons were on-site for study. These included the V-1 flying bomb; V-2; Feuerlilie F-55 subsonic missile; Messerschmitt Me 163B rocket-propelled interceptor; Rheintochter-1 anti-aircraft missile; Ruhrstahl X-4 air-to-air wire-controlled missile; Enzian E-1 3,150-lb missile; Henschel Hs 298 anti- aircraft missile; Hs 293 anti-shipping weapon; and Schmetterling and Wasserfall anti-aircraft missiles. Until the mid 1990s, Westcott undertook the design and development of rocket motors, and was responsible for most of the rocket motors used in British guided missiles and research vehicles. The design of these complete missile systems was undertaken by the Royal Aircraft Establishment at its facilities in Farnborough and Bedford. In 1984 the Rocket Propulsion Establishment came under the control of the Royal Ordnance Factories, and in 1987 control passed to the private sector when British Aerospace took over Royal Ordnance.

Waddington by which a phenotype originally produced in response to an environmental condition, such as exposure to a teratogen, later becomes genetically encoded via artificial selection or natural selection. Despite superficial appearances, this does not require the (Lamarckian) inheritance of acquired characters, although epigenetic inheritance could potentially influence the result. Waddington stated that genetic assimilation overcomes the barrier to selection imposed by what he called canalization of developmental pathways; he supposed that the organism's genetics evolved to ensure that development proceeded in a certain way regardless of normal environmental variations. The classic example of genetic assimilation was a pair of experiments in 1942 and 1953 by Waddington. He exposed Drosophila fruit fly embryos to ether, producing an extreme change in their phenotype: they developed a double thorax, resembling the effect of the bithorax gene. This is called a homeotic change. Flies which developed halteres (the modified hindwings of true flies, used for balance) with wing- like characteristics were chosen for breeding for 20 generations, by which point the phenotype could be seen without other treatment. Waddington's explanation has been controversial, and has been accused of being Lamarckian. More recent evidence appears to confirm the existence of genetic assimilation in evolution; in yeast, when a stop codon is lost by mutation, the reading frame is preserved much more often than would be expected. History =Waddington's experiments= Normal and cross-veinless Drosophila wings Conrad H. Waddington's classic experiment (1942) induced an extreme environmental reaction in the developing embryos of Drosophila. In response to ether vapor, a proportion of embryos developed a radical phenotypic change, a second thorax. At this point in the experiment bithorax is not innate; it is induced by an unusual environment. Waddington then repeatedly selected Drosophila for the bithorax phenotype over some 20 generations. After this time, some Drosophila developed bithorax without the ether treatment. Waddington carried out a similar experiment in 1953, this time inducing the cross-veinless phenocopy in Drosophila with a heat shock, with 40% of the flies showing the phenotype prior to selection. Again he selected for the phenotype over several generations, applying heat shock each time, and eventually the phenotype appeared even without heat shock. =Waddington's explanation= Waddington called the effect he had seen \\"genetic assimilation\\". His explanation was that it was caused by a process he called \\"canalization\\". He compared embryonic development to a ball rolling down a slope in what he called an epigenetic landscape, where each point on the landscape is a possible state of the organism (involving many variables). As a particular pathway becomes entrenched or \\"canalized\\", it becomes more stable, likely to occur even in the face of environmental changes. Major perturbations such as ether or heat shock eject the developmental pathway from the metaphorical canal, exploring other parts of the epigenetic landscape. Selection in the presence of that perturbation leads to the evolution of a new canal; after the perturbation is discontinued, developmental trajectories continue to follow the canalized pathway. =A Darwinian explanation= Other evolutionary biologists have agreed that assimilation occurs, but give a different, purely quantitative genetics explanation in terms of Darwin's natural or artificial selection. The phenotype, say cross-veinless, is presumed to be caused by a combination of multiple genes. The phenotype appears when the sum of gene effects exceeds a threshold; if that threshold is lowered by the perturbation, the phenotype is more likely to be seen. Continued selection under perturbing conditions increases the frequency of the alleles of genes that promote the phenotype until the threshold is breached, and the phenotype appears without requiring the heat shock. Perturbations can be genetic or epigenetic rather than environmental. For example, Drosophila fruit flies have a heat shock protein, Hsp90, which protects the development of many structures in the adult fly from heat shock. If the protein is damaged by a mutation, then just as if it were damaged by the environmental effects of drugs, many different phenotypic variants appear; if these are selected for, they quickly establish without further need for the mutant Hsp90. Neo- Darwinism or Lamarckism Waddington's genetic assimilation compared to Lamarckism, Darwinian evolution, and the Baldwin effect. All the theories offer explanations of how organisms respond to a changed environment with adaptive inherited change. Waddington's theory of genetic assimilation was controversial. The evolutionary biologists Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr both thought that Waddington was using genetic assimilation to support so-called Lamarckian inheritance. They denied that the inheritance of acquired characteristics had taken place, and asserted that Waddington had simply observed the natural selection of genetic variants that already existed in the study population. Waddington himself interpreted his results in a Neo- Darwinian way, particularly emphasizing that they \\"could bring little comfort to those who wish to believe that environmental influences tend to produce heritable changes in the direction of adaptation.\\" The evolutionary developmental biologist Adam S. Wilkins wrote that \\"[Waddington] in his lifetime... was widely perceived primarily as a critic of Neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory. His criticisms ... were focused on what he saw as unrealistic, 'atomistic' models of both gene selection and trait evolution.\\" In particular, according to Wilkins, Waddington felt that the Neo-Darwinians badly neglected the phenomenon of extensive gene interactions and that the 'randomness' of mutational effects, posited in the theory, was false. Even though Waddington became critical of the neo-Darwinian synthetic theory of evolution, he still described himself as a Darwinian, and called for an extended evolutionary synthesis based on his research. Waddington did not deny the threshold-based conventional genetic interpretation of his experiments, but regarded it \\"as a told to the children version of what I wished to say\\" and considered the debate to be about \\"mode of expression, rather than of substance\\". Both genetic assimilation and the related Baldwin effect are theories of phenotypic plasticity, where aspects of an organism's physiology and behaviour are affected by the environment. The evolutionary ecologist Erika Crispo states that they differ in that genetic assimilation decreases the level of plasticity (returning to Waddington's original definition of canalization; whereas the Baldwin effect may increase it) but does not change the mean phenotypic value (where the Baldwin effect changes it). Crispo defines genetic assimilation as a kind of genetic accommodation, \\"evolution in response to both genetically based and environmentally induced novel traits\\", which in turn is in her view central to the Baldwin effect.  Relationship to adaptation Mathematical modeling suggests that under certain circumstances, natural selection favours the evolution of canalization that is designed to fail under extreme conditions. If the result of such a failure is favoured by natural selection, genetic assimilation occurs. In the 1960s, Waddington and his colleague the animal geneticist J. M. Rendel argued for the importance of genetic assimilation in natural adaptation, as a means of providing new and potentially beneficial variation to populations under stress, enabling them to evolve rapidly. Their contemporary George C. Williams argued that genetic assimilation proceeds at the cost of a loss of previously adaptive developmental plasticity, and therefore should be seen as resulting in a net loss rather than gain of complexity, making it in his view uninteresting from the perspective of the constructive process of adaptation. However, the preceding phenotypic plasticity need not be adaptive, but simply represent a breakdown of canalization.  In natural populations Notechis scutatus tiger snakes from islands, like this one from Chappell Island, have larger heads than mainland populations, apparently genetically assimilated. Several instances of genetic assimilation have been documented contributing to natural selection in the wild. For example, populations of the island tiger snakes (Notechis scutatus) have become isolated on islands and have larger heads to cope with large prey animals. Young populations have larger heads by phenotypic plasticity, whereas large heads have become genetically assimilated in older populations. In another example, patterns of left-right asymmetry or \\"handedness\\", when present, can be determined either genetically or plastically. During evolution, genetically determined directional asymmetry, as in the left-oriented human heart, can arise either from a nonheritable (phenotypic) developmental process, or directly by mutation from a symmetric ancestor. An excess of transitions from plastically determined to genetically determined handedness points to the role of genetic assimilation in evolution. A third example has been seen in yeast. Evolutionary events in which stop codons are lost preserve the reading frame much more often than would be expected from mutation bias. This finding is consistent with the role of the yeast prion [PSI+] in epigenetically facilitating stop codon readthrough, followed by genetic assimilation via the permanent loss of the stop codon.

When a single billiard ball arrives at the gate through input 0-in or 1-in, it passes through the device unobstructed and exits via 0-out or 1-out. However, if a 0-in billiard ball arrives simultaneously as a 1-in billiard ball, they collide with each other in the upper-left-hand corner of the device and redirect each other to collide again in the lower-right-hand corner of the device. One ball then exits via 1-out and the other ball exits via the lower AND-output. Thus, the presence of a ball being emitted from the AND-output is logically consistent with the output of an AND gate that takes the presence of a ball at 0-in and 1-in as inputs. A billiard-ball computer, a type of conservative logic circuit, is an idealized model of a reversible mechanical computer based on Newtonian dynamics, proposed in 1982 by Edward Fredkin and Tommaso Toffoli.. Instead of using electronic signals like a conventional computer, it relies on the motion of spherical billiard balls in a friction-free environment made of buffers against which the balls bounce perfectly. It was devised to investigate the relation between computation and reversible processes in physics. Simulating circuits with billiard balls This model can be used to simulate Boolean circuits in which the wires of the circuit correspond to paths on which one of the balls may travel, the signal on a wire is encoded by the presence or absence of a ball on that path, and the gates of the circuit are simulated by collisions of balls at points where their paths cross. In particular, it is possible to set up the paths of the balls and the buffers around them to form a reversible Toffoli gate, from which any other Boolean logic gate may be simulated. Therefore, suitably configured billiard-ball computers may be used to perform any computational task.. Simulating billiard balls in other models of computation It is possible to simulate billiard-ball computers on several types of reversible cellular automaton, including block cellular automata and second-order cellular automata. In these simulations, the balls are only allowed to move at a constant speed in an axis-parallel direction, assumptions that in any case were already present in the use of the billiard ball model to simulate logic circuits. Both the balls and the buffers are simulated by certain patterns of live cells, and the field across which the balls move is simulated by regions of dead cells, in these cellular automaton simulations..

It is located at 1215 Grand Avenue. The home is also referred to as the Higgins House or Higgins Mansion. The house is architecturally unusual because it was built as a late Victorian style house in 1884, then substantially renovated in 1912 with addition of neo-classical porches and roofline. with In 1984, it was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time the property retained historic landscaping and a by playhouse from c. 1917-18. In 2014 it was included as a contributing property in the North Grand Avenue Residential Historic District. History =Recent= The Adams- Higgins house, known locally as the Higgins Mansion or simply The Mansion, was built in 1884 by J.Q. Adams, a local farmer, banker, and sometime Mayor. The property was sold in 1900 to Amanda Bender, who soon sold it to Mr. and Mrs. William Higgins, newlyweds who had moved to Spencer from Chicago. They contracted architect J. G. Ralston of Waterloo, Iowa to make the home an architectural landmark, beginning in 1910, by adding massive Neo-classical columns, adding a third floor, iron fence surround, and a kidney-shaped fish pond. The building next to the house was originally built as the children's playhouse for the two children adopted off the Orphan Train when it passed through Spencer. For a short period, the playhouse was used as a classroom for children attending a nearby elementary school undergoing repairs. Mrs. Higgins died in 1961, and the property was sold at auction in 1962 to Mathilda Delaney. Mrs. Delaney occupied the home until 1983, when the property was sold to Paul and Paula Brenner, who successfully placed the home on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The Brenners completed restoration projects on the exterior and interior over the near-15 years of their ownership. The playhouse was renovated in 1993 by the Brenners, and used as their antique shop. The home passed to Drs. Jon and Debora Hade. The kitchen was remodeled and the cabinets used by Mr Higgins were brought up into the kitchen, his handwriting can be seen on one of the shelves. The dining room boasts a mahogany sideboard that runs from floor to ceiling. The painted mural in the dining room are signed by a Chicago artist. The Playhouse which at one time served as a school was moved to its current location and the current garage was built. The current owners Neal and Kitty Conover, completed the renovation work in 2005.

For Cray himself, the mirror remains blank for many years, until one day he sees in it the image of a young girl. With no idea of who she is, he watches the girl transform into a lovely woman over the years, and Cray realizes that he is destined to find her. When he does, he learns that this is Aliza, a sorceress who lives in a crystal palace which is partly within the demon realm and who is dedicated solely to the study of her craft. Cray finds Aliza to be a skilled young sorceress, but also cold, aloof, and entirely focused on sorcery. Cray encourages her to take an interest in the outside world and forms a budding friendship. However, this friendship is strongly discouraged by Aliza's sorcerer grandfather, Everand. Despite Everand's disapproval, Aliza and Cray travel to the demon realm and also to the home of Cray's sorceress mother, Delivev. During this latter journey, Aliza looks into the mirror of heart's desire and causes it to shatter. This causes some initial confusion, but it is quickly revealed this is because Aliza's soul has been stolen from her. Ultimately, her grandfather Everand is shown to be a villain of the worst degree. He uses Aliza's soul and his capture of Feldar as leverage to demand Aliza and Cray's obedience. However, Cray rallies his allies from the demon realm in order to confront and defeat Everand and free Aliza's soul. With her soul freed, Cray and Aliza realize their love for each other.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. History thumb In 1966, the border with Jordan ran parallel to Shmuel HaNavi Street. Beyond was a no man's land and the bunkers and fortifications of Ammunition Hill, the site of fierce battles between Jordanian and Israeli forces in the 1967 war. According to ARIJ, Israel confiscated 416 dunams of land from the Palestinian neighbourhood of Shuafat in order to construct Ramat Eshkol.Shu‚Äôfat Town Profile, ARIJ, 2013 p. 14 Ramat Eshkol (lit. \\"Eshkol Heights\\") was the first new neighborhood built in Jerusalem after the Six Day War, along the route to Mount Scopus, Hadassah Hospital and the Hebrew University.Governing Jerusalem: Again on the World's Agenda, Ira Sharkansky Plans were drawn up for tree-lined streets, small parks, a neighborhood health clinic and a commercial center with a supermarket. Most of the new apartment buildings were limited to four floors. The architecture included prefab elements, but outside walls were faced with a veneer of Jerusalem stone.Ramat Eshkol was designed as a middle- class neighborhood.Critical Essays on Israeli Society, Religion, and Government: Books on Israel, edited by Kevin Avruch, Walter P. Zenner Levi Eshkol Construction on Sderot Eshkol (Eshkol Boulevard), named for Israeli prime minister Levi Eshkol, began in 1968 Israel Levitt of the Israel Defense Forces Engineering Corps cleared the mines on what is now Etzion Gaver street. Levitt, also a trained architect, designed the first buildings there. In January 1970, the first occupants moved in. There were no roads, and the nearest bus was on Shmuel Hanavi. The first minyan was held in an air raid shelter on Etzion Gaver street, before the completion of a synagogue. Government policy at the time was to create a contiguous link from Shmuel Hanavi to French Hill and the campus of Hebrew University of Jerusalem on Mount Scopus. A new bus line, number 9, was inaugurated to link the Mount Scopus campus with the campus in Givat Ram, built when the road to Mount Scopus was blocked by the Jordanians. The route of the bus followed the route of the convoy attacked on April 13, 1948, killing doctors and nurses of Hadassah Hospital. Building also began at this time in Givat HaMivtar. Plots were raffled off for the construction of single-family homes. A time limit was imposed on construction and access was difficult. The only access was via a muddy track. The construction of private homes on Ramat Hagolan Street in Ramat Eshkol also employed the lottery method. Parks and memorials Ammunition Hill park After the Six-Day War, Ammunition Hill was restored and turned into a park and memorial site. Ramat Eshkol also has a park dedicated to Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who saved many Jews during World War II.

The work was begun in 1972 by the artist Michael Heizer and is ongoing. When complete, it will be one of the largest sculptures ever built. City will open to the public in 2020. Concept Like Heizer's previous Double Negative (1969), City is designed and executed on a massive scale. Covering a space approximately one and a quarter miles long and more than a quarter of a mile wide (2 km by 0.4 km, roughly the scale of the National Mall), City is one of the largest sculptures ever created. Using earth, rocks, sand and concrete as building materials and assembled with heavy machinery, the work comprises five phases, each consisting of a number of structures referred to as complexes, with some of the structures reaching a height of eighty feet. City attempts to synthesize ancient monuments, Minimalism and industrial technology. Heizer's inspiration for the work came while he was visiting the Yucatan and studying Chichen Itza. Heizer also cites an interest in the ceremonial squares and associated civic monuments of cites. Management The cost of City is being financed by several patrons, including the Dia Art Foundation and Lannan Foundation, with an estimated cost of well over twenty five million USD. The work is located on a large parcel of private land owned by the artist and is closed to the public until its completion. Heizer is currently completing the work with a team of roughly a dozen and had, as of 2005, anticipated completion before 2010. As of Spring 2015 City is not yet open to the public. Visitors are explicitly not welcome, and due to its orientation away from the road and system of earthen berms no part of City can be viewed from the ground without trespassing on posted property, but photos can be seen here. Conservation Garden Valley has been eyed for several major projects in the years since Heizer started working on his sculpture. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the government planned to crisscross the valley and others nearby with railroad tracks that would carry MX missiles to and from hidden silos. The program was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan. The proposed Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste would have included a new railroad line across Garden Valley, and would have come within its sightline. Heizer reportedly considered burying City if this line was built. In September 2014, U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada introduced ‚ÄúGarden Valley Withdrawal Act,‚Äù a bill that would preserve the land around City and protect 805,100 acres of Federal land from mineral and energy development.Helen Stoilas (November 3, 2014), Move to protect Heizer‚Äôs City from development The Art Newspaper. Reid had visited the area around City in 2007, and he soon after tried to pass a similar bill in 2010 that would designate part of Garden Valley and nearby Coal Valley as a national conservation area.Steve Tetreault and Henry Brean (October 21, 2014), Sen. Reid quietly moves to block development of 800,000 acres in central Nevada Las Vegas Review-Journal. In early 2015, a group of American museums, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston the Walker Art Center, and the Nevada Museum of Art joined together to urge preservation of the area. In July 2015, the area became part of the newly-created Basin and Range National Monument. The national monument designation will prevent new railroad or power lines and other development.Secretary Jewell Applauds President Obama's Designation of Basin and Range National Monument in Nevada: President's Action Preserves Sweeping Landscapes & Ancient Rock Art, Protects Existing Ranching & Military Uses (press release), United States Department of the Interior (July 10, 2015).

It currently has over 1 million members. As a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, it is outside the purview ofand therefore not rated byCharity Navigator. DAV's Employer Identification Number (EIN) is 31-0263158. History In the aftermath of World War I, disabled veterans in the United States found themselves seriously disadvantaged, with little governmental support. Many of these veterans were blind, deaf, or mentally ill when they returned from the frontlines. An astonishing 204,000 Americans in uniform were wounded during the war. The idea to form the Disabled American Veterans arose at a Christmas party in 1919 hosted by Cincinnati Superior Court Judge Robert Marx, a U.S. Army Captain and War World I veteran who had been injured in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in November 1918. Although it had been functional for some months by that time, the Disabled American Veterans of the World War (DAVWW) was officially created on September 25, 1920, at its first National Caucus, in Hamilton County Memorial Hall in Cincinnati, Ohio. While touring across the U.S. as part of the election campaign of James M. Cox, Judge Marx publicized the new organization, which quickly expanded. It held its first national convention in Detroit, Michigan on June 27, 1921, at which time Marx was appointed the first national commander. In 1922, a women's auxiliary organization was founded. The DAVWW continued working through the Great Depression to secure the welfare of disabled veterans, although their efforts were troubled by fundraising challenges and the desire of the public to put the World War behind them. In the midst of these troubled years, DAVWW was issued a federal charter by Congress, on June 17, 1932. DAV Thrift Store, Westland, Michigan The demands of World War II required the urgent expansion of the organization, which officially changed its name to Disabled American Veterans to recognize the impact of the new war. In 1941, DAV launched a direct mail campaign, distributing \\"IdentoTags\\", miniature license plates which could be attached to a keyring with instructions that lost keys should be mailed to the DAVWW, who would return them to the owners. In 1944, the DAV began offering a National Service Officer Training Program at American University in Washington, the first step of education that completed with a two-year mentorship program. In 1945, the DAV expanded the Idento Tag program and brought the manufacturing in-house, eventually purchasing complete ownership of the program in 1950. The program proved long-lasting and highly successful, both in bringing in donations and employing veterans in manufacture. By 1952, 350 people were employed in the endeavor, which brought in over $2 million a year in donations. Meanwhile, the number of disabled veterans had been increased by the still-ongoing Korean War. The DAV suffered a decline in the later 1950s and into the 1960s, with diminishing leadership and funds, but it rallied around the veterans of the Vietnam War and also focused heavily on working for Prisoners Of War (POWs) and Missing In Action (MIAs). Vietnam veterans soon filled the diminished ranks of the National Service Officers. On Veterans Day, 1966, the DAV moved its headquarters to Cold Spring, Kentucky. The following year, the IdentoTag program was discontinued in favor of providing address labels, with a request for donation, when changes in license plate practices made continuing the IdentoTag program impracticable. The DAV underwent substantial change in 1993, when internal arguments concerning the governance of the organization led to a watershed election that turned over the administration to new hands and the National Service Program was overhauled. In 1998, DAV National Adjutant Arthur Wilson joined with philanthropist Lois Pope and for Secretary for Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown to push for congressional authorization of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. By the time fundraising was complete in 2010, the DAV and its affiliates had raised more than $10 million for the memorial.

She is best known for her trilogy of films, Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (1927), The Great Road (1927), and The Russia of Nicholas II and Leo Tolstoy (1928). Shub is credited as the creator of compilation film. Early life Shub was born, March 16, 1894, into a Jewish family of landowners in the town of Surazhe, a small town in the Chernigov region of the Ukraine, which is now the Brianskaya province of the southwest part of the Russian Federation. Her father, Ilya Roshal, was a pharmacist. Shub‚Äôs mother died when she was a young child and was also known to have one brother. Shub had a relatively privileged upbringing, which allowed her to travel to Moscow before the revolution. Education By the mid-1910s, Shub had settled in Moscow to begin her study of literature at the Institute for Women‚Äôs Higher Education. There she got involved in the revolutionary fervor emerging amongst young university students. Career After moving to Moscow, Shub became involved in the Soviet avant-garde world, specifically in constructivist theatre. In 1918, after working as Vsevolod Meyerhold‚Äôs private secretary in the Soviet administration at the head office of the TEO Theatre Department of the Narkompros (People‚Äôs Commissariat of Education), she began collaborating with the stage director Vsevolod Meyerhold and poet Vladimir Mayakovsky on several theatrical projects. During this time she also became involved with the Left Front of the Arts (LEF) group. =Goskino= In 1922, Shub began her film career at Goskino, the major Soviet state-owned film company. There she worked as an editor, in charge of censoring imported foreign films for domestic distribution, rendering these films ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù for Soviet audiences. Here she worked alongside Sergei Eisenstein, re-editing films such as the Soviet release of Fritz Lang‚Äôs Dr Mabuse. Shub edited a wide range of films. Noted is her first work, a complete re-editing of Charlie Chaplin's 1916 film Carmen, which was the first Chaplin film ever to be seen in the Soviet Union. Shub‚Äôs intensive experience at Goskino, reediting pre- revolutionary and foreign productions as well as new Soviet features, helped cultivate the journalistic style of filmmaking she is well-regarded for. Her method of editing had a substantial influence on both Dziga Vertov and Eisenstein, two of her most prominent peers. =Documentaries= In 1927, Shub released her first documentary, Padenie dinastii Romanovykh (). She was commissioned to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution. It was released at the same time as Eisenstein‚Äôs October. However LEFists critiqued his film for being too personal, deeming the impersonality of Shub‚Äôs work more exemplary of the Revolution. Soviet film theorists praised Shub‚Äôs invisible authority as truly revolutionary, for it was consumed effectively as propaganda. In the making of these films, Shub collected an extensive amount of footage from old newsreels. The way in which she catalogued everything enabled the establishment of a filmic archive for the Russian Revolution. Shub‚Äôs extensive efforts and technical approach to filmmaking reveal her technological, political, artistic expertise. Sergei Emolinsky, a constructivist critic associated with Soviet art journal, LEF, praises both Shub and Vertov equally for their different attitudes towards documentary film. He explains that while, ‚ÄúVertov ‚Äòthrew himself on the given material, cutting it into numerous pieces, thus subordinating it to his imagination...Shub regarded each piece [shot] as to a self-sufficient, autonomous entity‚Äô.‚Äù This first-hand critique of the two methods indicate that Shub‚Äôs dedication to journalistic cinematography was the catalyst for what documentary film classifies today, compilation film. Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (1927) is one of Shub‚Äôs most famous surviving films and what many film historians classify as the first compilation film or Soviet montage. Shub traveled to Leningrad in 1926 to obtain the footage she needed for the film. She spent two months examining more than 60,000 meters of film (much of which was damaged) and chose 5,200 meters to take back to Moscow. She made the film because there was no visual record of the Russian Revolution. The movie is made up of stock footage and film that Shub shot herself to make up for the lack of documentation. The film covers the years 1912 to 1917, recounting the moments before, after and during World War I, and then ending with the October Revolution. The amount of footage Shub recovered and shot for this film is incredibly comprehensive. Her dedication to the project is evident and proves Shub‚Äôs skills of compiling, cataloging, and editing archival film. Shub‚Äôs contribution to the history of compilation film was influential in the United States in the 1930s and during World War II. Historians Jack C. Ellis and Betsy A. McLane note that, ‚Äúnothing like Shub‚Äôs films had existed before them, and her work remains among the finest examples of the compilation technique. According to Shub, ‚Äúthe most successful and valuable filmmaking required ‚Äòthe greatest austerity of execution,‚Äô rather than the ‚Äòremarkable‚Äô but irrelevant excesses...Eisenstein had indulged in when making October. Shub insisted that ‚Äòmastery‚Äô in filmmaking was not a matter of personal genius: ‚ÄòIt is all a matter of technique‚Ä¶of aims and method. That is what we must talk about‚Äô.‚Äù In 1932, Shub helped spearhead the first Soviet documentary to have sound, called Sponsor of Electrification. Personal life Shub was married twice. She had a daughter, Anna, with her first husband, Isaac Vladimirovich Shub. After this marriage ended in divorce, she married Aleksei Gan, a filmmaker who also published the film journal Kino-Fot. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, she worked predominantly as an editor and spent time writing her memoirs both about her life and about filmmaking techniques. She also wrote a script titled Women (1933‚Äì34), which examined women's roles throughout history. Although this project was never filmed, the script reveals Shub's interest in feminism. Shub died on September 21, 1959, in Moscow. = Memoirs = Esfir Shub took the time to write her own memoirs entitled, Zhizn Moya ‚Äî Kinematograf (My Life ‚Äî Cinema) in the latter half of her career. More information about these memoirs can be found in Vlada Petric‚Äôs article in the Quarterly Review of Film Studies no. 4, ‚ÄúEsther Shub: Cinema is My Life‚Äù which is available for viewing at the New York Public Library. In her memoirs, she describes numerous films that were either never made or that the government handed to lesser-known filmmakers who were favored at the time. In her recollections, she is forthcoming about her struggle to win respect as a female theorist and practitioner in the male dominated field of Soviet cinema.

The importance of the occasion seemed to affect him not at all, and playing extremely confidently from the outset, he put together 45 of the best by sound cricket, his partnership with his captain releasing 158 runs in ninety-five minutes.\\"'' All of Freeman's ten first-class wickets came in his two games for HK Foster's XI, both against Worcestershire in 1919. His best figures of 4-31 were achieved on his debut that July at Hereford, his first wicket being that of Arthur Jewell, the nephew of future Worcestershire captain Maurice Jewell. In another match against the same opponents in August he was caught and bowled for 58, a career best score, by John Coventry, another future Worcestershire captain; this was Coventry's first first-class wicket. A nice symmetry was achieved when Freeman in turn dismissed Coventry in the second innings. Freeman's last game was against Glamorgan, playing in only their third first-class match; Gloucestershire won by the emphatic margin of an innings and 191 runs, but Freeman contributed only five runs (albeit not out) and a catch; he did not bowl a ball. Freeman was born in Norton, Gloucester; he died in Whitbourne, Herefordshire at the age of 82.

Fabiola Colmenares and Rafael Novoa starred as the main protagonists, while Chiquinquir√° Delgado, Carlos Cruz and Nohely Arteaga starred as the antagonists. History On September 30, 2003, Venevisi√≥n started airing Cosita rica at 9:00 pm. The last episode was aired on August 30, 2004, with Sabor a ti replacing it. During its broadcast, the telenovela became a hit among viewers due to its combination of humor, romance and drama with political and socio-cultural commentary. At the time the telenovela was on air, Venezuela was going through a presidential recall referendum, and the media was heavily polarized. The character of Olegario P√©rez was seen as an alter-ego of then president Hugo Ch√°vez, and events in the telenovela mirrored what was happening in the country. After the end of the broadcast of Cosita rica, the Venezuelan government created the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television which aimed as censuring writers and television content produced in the country. This affected subsequent telenovelas produced by RCTV (which lost its license in 2007 after the government of Chavez refused to renew it for its anti-government stand) and Venevisi√≥n, as writers became restrictive in terms of what content they could write and produce.  Plot  Paula, the most popular girl of the neighborhood, dreams of becoming a dancer. The day she meets Diego Luj√°n, the young heir of a cosmetic holding, she can't stop thinking of him. Diego is about to get married with the famous model Vicky C√°rdenas. But destiny is going to play its cards and the sudden encounter between Paula and Diego turns into a love story. Paula and Diego meet again and during the week they spend together, their lives change forever. Diego promises Paula to cancel his engagement to Vicky and they both agree to meet at the airport to start a new life. When Paula arrives at the airport, she sees how an old and weak man can't manage the luggage he carries, so Paula decides to help him. When they are about to cross the immigration line, the authorities discover drugs inside the old man's luggage that Paula is holding, but the man has disappeared and Paula is sent to jail for five years. Paula cannot get in touch with Diego to explain him the situation. Diego looks for her with any success. Today, five years later, Paula leaves jail. She wants to recover her life and to revenge the man who destroyed her future. She starts working as makeup girl. One day, she is hired to make up a bride. This is the day when she reencounters Diego, who is going to get married. The impact is mutual. But there's nothing to do. It's too late. The day of the wedding, Diego's father dies unexpectedly and the worst comes when he finds out that he is not the heir. Olegario P√©rez, the bastard son of Diego's father, will manage the holding. From one day to another, Olegario P√©rez will become one of the most powerful executives of the country. The worst comes when Olegario meets Paula by chance and he falls in love with her. Olegario asks Diego to help him conquer a woman. Without knowing that the woman is Paula, Diego helps his stepbrother writing love letters, choosing the flowers, the restaurants and the presents for him. Paula starts falling in love with him and she accepts to get marry to Olegario. A duel begins for the love of Paula between the two brothers.

In that capacity, Shane became a seminal figure in the revival of folk and other acoustic music as a popular art form in the United States in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s. The success of the Kingston Trio in its heyday had repercussions far beyond its voluminous album sales (including four albums simultaneously in the Top 10 in 1959), its host of imitators, and the relatively short-lived pop-folk boom it created. For the Kingston Trio's success took acoustic folk-based music out of the niche market it had occupied prior to the Trio's arrival and moved it into the mainstream of American popular music, opening the door for major record labels to record and market both more traditional folk musicians and singer- songwriters as well.[ Bruce Eder, \\"The Kingston Trio,\\"AllMusic Guide.] Early life Shane was born on February 1, 1934 in Hilo on the Big Island of Hawaii, the son of Margaret (Schaufelberger) and Arthur Castle Schoen, a wholesale distributor of toys and sporting goods. His mother was from Salt Lake City, and his father was a Hawaiian of German descent. Shane was in his own words \\"a fourth-generation islander\\". He attended local schools, including the prestigious Punahou School for his junior high and high school years. Punahou's curriculum emphasized native Hawaiian culture, complementing Shane's already developing interest in music in general and Hawaiian music in particular. During these years, Shane (the phonetic spelling he began using in 1957) taught himself to play first ukulele and then guitar, influenced especially by Hawaiian slack key guitarists like Gabby Pahinui. It was also during these years that Shane met Punahou classmate Dave Guard and began performing with him at parties and school variety shows. Formation of The Kingston Trio The Kingston Trio's original lineup: Dave Guard, Bob Shane, Nick Reynolds Following graduation in 1952, Shane attended Menlo College in Menlo Park, California while Guard matriculated at nearby Stanford University. At Menlo, Shane met and became fast friends with Nick Reynolds, originally from the San Diego area and also a musician and singer with a broad knowledge of folk and popular songs, due in part to Reynolds's music-loving father, a captain in the Navy. Shane introduced Reynolds to Guard, and in 1956, the three began performing together as part of an informal aggregation that could, according to Reynolds,Rubeck, Shaw, Blake et al., The Kingston Trio On Record (Naperville IL: KK Inc, 1986), p. 97. expand to as large as six or seven members. The group went under different names, most often as \\"Dave Guard and the Calypsonians\\". They made little more than beer money and had no formal professional aspirations. Shane dropped out of college in his senior year and returned to Hawaii to work in the family business.Rubeck, Shaw, Blake et al., The Kingston Trio On Record (Naperville IL: KK Inc, 1986), p. 25. However, Shane had discovered a natural affinity for entertaining and at night pursued a solo career in Hawaii, including engagements at some of Waikiki's major hotels. Shane's act consisted of an eclectic mix of songs from Elvis Presley, Hank Williams, Harry Belafonte, and Broadway shows. During this period of several months he also met acoustic blues legend Josh White, who helped Shane refine his guitar style and influenced him to support his vocals with a Martin \\"Dreadnought\\" guitar, significant in that it led to Shane's lifelong association with that guitar maker.Washburn and Johnston, Martin Guitars (Emmaus, PA: Rodale Press, 1997), p. 171. The company reciprocated by issuing a number of \\"signature\\" models honoring Shane and the Kingston Trio in the late 1990s and early 2000s. At the same time back in California, Guard and Reynolds had organized themselves somewhat more formally into an act named \\"The Kingston Quartet\\" with bassist Joe Gannon and his fianc√©e, vocalist Barbara Bogue. This group appeared for a one-night engagement at a club called the Italian Village in San Francisco, to which they invited publicist Frank Werber, who had caught the Calypsonians' act with Shane some months earlier at the Cracked Pot beer garden in Palo Alto. Werber was impressed by the natural talent of and synergy between Guard and Reynolds; he was less impressed with Gannon and Bogue, and suggested to Reynolds and Guard that they would be better off as a trio without Gannon - easier to book and better musically.Rubeck, Shaw, Blake et al., The Kingston Trio On Record (Naperville, Illinois: KK Inc, 1986), p. 17 When Guard and Reynolds let Gannon go and Bogue followed, Reynolds, Guard and Werber all considered Shane the logical third member and asked him to return to California, which he did in spring 1957.Rubeck, Shaw, Blake et al., The Kingston Trio On Record (Naperville IL: KK Inc, 1986), p. 18. Shane's baritone vocals and guitar work were the foundation of the Kingston Trio's sound.Bush, Bill. \\"The Kingston Trio\\", Frets Magazine (June 1984), p. 26. Shane, Guard, Reynolds, and Werber drew up an informal agreement (on a paper napkin, according to a legend that Werber has debunked)Kingston Trio On Record, p. 19. that morphed into a legal partnership. They decided on the name \\"Kingston Trio\\" because it evoked, they thought, both the then-popular calypso music that emanated from Kingston, Jamaica as well as the kind of \\"collegiate\\" ambiance suggested by their quickly adopted stage outfit of matching button-down collared three-quarter length sleeved striped shirts. The Kingston Trio: The Peak Years, 1957‚Äì1967 The Kingston Trio's second troupe: John Stewart, Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane Under Werber's rigorous tutelage, Shane, Guard, and Reynolds began almost daily rehearsals for several months, including instruction from prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis. The group's first significant break came in the summer of 1957 when comedian Phyllis Diller had to cancel an engagement at The Purple Onion, a small San Francisco night club, and Werber talked the management into hiring the untested trio for a week. The trio's close harmonies, varied repertoire, and carefully rehearsed but apparently spontaneous on stage humor made them an instant success with the club's patrons, and the engagement stretched to six months. During this stint, Werber used the Kingston Trio's local popularity to try to generate interest from record companies. After several false starts, the group landed a contract with Capitol Records, recording their first album in three days in February 1958. The producer was the already legendary (from Frank Sinatra's 1950s Capitol sessions) Voyle Gilmore, who made two immediate and fateful decisions. Gilmore insisted that the trio's acoustic sound have more of a \\"bottom\\" and added a bass player to the recordings. He also decided that the group should be recorded without additional orchestral instrumentation, unusual for the time; both decisions came to characterize nearly all of the Kingston Trio's subsequent recordings and live performances.Kingston Trio On Record, p. 26 The album The Kingston Trio was released in June 1958 at the same time that the group was beginning a long engagement at San Francisco's more prominent Hungry i night club. The album included the number that became Shane's signature song, \\"Scotch and Soda,\\" powerful and rhythmic guitar work from Shane throughout, and an obscure North Carolina murder ballad, \\"Tom Dooley\\" on which Shane sang the lead. In the summer of 1958, while Shane and the Trio were performing at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Honolulu, disc jockey Paul Colburn in Salt Lake City began playing the \\"Tom Dooley\\" cut from the album on the air, and DJs in Miami and nationally followed suit.Kingston Trio On Record, p. 27 Popular response forced a reluctant Capitol Records marketing department to release the song as a single on August 8, 1958. It shot to #1 on the Billboard and Variety charts, selling a million copies before Christmas of 1958 and earning the Kingston Trio both its first of eight gold records and of two Grammys.Rubeck, Shaw, Blake et al., The Kingston Trio On Record (Naperville IL: KK Inc, 1986), p. 12 This ushered in an era of remarkable success as both a recording and performing act for Shane and the Trio. In 1959 alone, the group released four albums, three of which attained #1 status and all four of which were in Billboard's Top Ten in December 1959, a feat equaled only by the Beatles. Thirteen of their albums placed in Billboard's Top Ten, with five going to #1 and the first album remaining on the charts for 195 weeks. A half dozen singles charted in the Top 100 as well. The group played over two hundred dates per year for several years, pioneering the college concert circuit and appearing at most of the country's top night clubs, festivals, and amphitheaters as well. It was during this period, however, that conflict began to simmer between high school friends Shane and Guard. Disputes over the musical direction of the Kingston Trio and disagreement over finances and copyrights are the causes most frequently cited in Guard's decision in the spring of 1961 to leave what was at the time the most popular group in American music.Kingston Trio On Record, p. 48. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership and moved quickly to find a replacement, settling on John Stewart, a young folk performer and composer who had written a number of songs that the Trio had already recorded. The Shane, Reynolds, and Stewart Kingston Trio remained together for another six years, releasing nine more albums on Capitol and scoring a number of Top 40 hit singles until diminishing record sales resulting from the passing of the popular folk boom and the rise of Capitol's other major acts the Beach Boys and the Beatles prompted the group to move to Decca Records. They released four more albums before disbanding as an act following a final engagement at the Hungry i in June 1967. Solo efforts and The New Kingston Trio, 1969‚Äì1976 Shane had not been in favor of the break-up of the Kingston Trio, both because he felt that the Trio could adapt to changing musical tastes and because he had by then become a thoroughly accomplished entertainer and a canny marketer. Deciding to stay in the entertainment business, Shane experimented both with solo work (he recorded several singles, including a version of the song \\"Honey\\" that later became a million-seller for Bobby Goldsboro)Kingston Trio On Record, pp. 117-118. and with different configurations with other folk-oriented performers. In 1969, he asked permission of Reynolds and Werber, still his partners, to lease the group's name. They assented with the provisos that Shane assemble a group of comparable musical quality to the two original configurations and that \\"New\\" be appended to the name. Shane organized two troupes under the name of \\"The New Kingston Trio\\". The first consisted of guitarist Pat Horine and banjoist Jim Connor in addition to Shane and lasted from 1969 to 1973, the second including guitarist Roger Gambill and banjoist Bill Zorn from 1973 until 1976. Shane tried to create a repertoire for these groups that included both expected Kingston Trio standards like \\"Tom Dooley\\" and \\"M.T.A.\\" but also more contemporary songs, including country and novelty tunes. The attempt did not meet with any significant success. Though both of these groups made a limited number of recordings and television appearances, neither generated very much interest from fans or the public at large.Kingston Trio On Record, pp. 129, 132 Another Kingston Trio, reunion, and retirement: 1976‚Äì2004 The 1981 Reunion Concert: Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane, Dave Guard At the end of 1976, Bill Zorn wanted to pursue a solo career and left the group under amicable circumstances. To replace him, Shane found a younger performer named George Grove, an instrumentalist and singer. Shane realized that the group's greatest asset in addition to his vocals and his presence as a founding member was the name itself. Consequently, he purchased the rights to the Kingston Trio name outright from Reynolds and Werber, and all subsequent iterations of Shane's troupe since late 1976 have been known simply as the Kingston Trio. In 1981, PBS producers JoAnn Young and Paul Surratt pitched an idea to Shane: a reunion concert that the network could use as a fund raiser and that would include not only Shane's current group but also on stage reunions of the two original Kingston Trio lineups with Guard and Stewart. Shane and the other principals assented, and the concert was staged and taped at the Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, California in November 1981; it was broadcast over PBS stations in March 1982. Despite some residual tension between Guard and Shane, part of which surfaced in a Wall Street Journal article by Roy Harris about the event and which resulted from public comments made by Guard that Shane felt disparaged both him and his current group, the concert was moderately successful and became a landmark in Kingston Trio history. Over the next nine years, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree. Guard was suffering from cancer though apparently in remission when Shane and Reynolds visited him in New Hampshire in the summer of 1990, and the three discussed the possibility of a reunion tour that would again feature Shane's current troupe (which by this time included a re-invigorated Nick Reynolds) as well as Guard and Stewart. Guard's lymphoma returned, however, and he died in March 1991. Shane was the only member of any configuration of the Kingston Trio to sing at Guard's memorial service.Bob Shane Interview, Wherever We May Go (video documentary; Surratt and Young, producers; Shout Factory, 2006). Through the years following Shane's acquisition of the Kingston Trio name in 1976, the personnel in the group changed several times, though Shane and Grove remained constants. Shane guided the group to a success that, if never the equivalent of the group's first decade, was nonetheless steady and consistent. Shane's Kingston Trio relied heavily on a \\"greatest hits formula\\" augmented by a number of other songs acquired through the years that fans had accepted as part of the group's repertoire. In March 2004, a month after his 70th birthday, Shane suffered a debilitating heart attack that forced him into retirement from touring and performing after 47 years with the act. Though Shane had initially planned to return to the group after convalescing, the attack was severe enough to warrant Shane's permanent withdrawal from performing with the group that he still owns. He was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn. Personal life Shane was married for 23 years to the former Louise Brandon; they had 5 children and 8 grandchildren. The marriage ended in divorce and he remarried in 2000 to Bobbi Childress. He died on January 26, 2020 at a hospice facility in Phoenix, Arizona at the age of 85.

The set is a collection of all of Steely Dan's albums (up to 1980) in chronological order, and also contains a non-album single (\\"FM (No Static at All)\\"), a non-album B-side (\\"Bodhisattva (Live)\\"), a rare compilation track recorded during the sessions for The Royal Scam but released only on the 1978 Greatest Hits (\\"Here at the Western World\\"), and a previously unreleased demo of \\"Everyone's Gone to the Movies\\" (a song from their 1975 album Katy Lied). The set is not a complete compilation of every track released by Steely Dan up to 1993. Missing are both sides of the band's 1972 debut single (\\"Dallas\\" b/w \\"Sail the Waterway\\"), neither of which has ever been re-issued on CD, because of band's dislike of the songs. The compilation was the first release of the remastered versions of Steely Dan's albums until the remastered studio albums were issued in 1998. The first pressing features \\"Rikki Don't Lose That Number\\" using the single edit of the song. This version omits the percussive opening for the song. The second pressing of the box set features the version from the album although it was reissued without any information noting the change. Glenn Meadows remastered the CD set from the digital masters archived by Donald Fagen, Gary Katz and Roger Nichols in 1982. The digital tapes were prepared because the original analog tapes were in very poor shape. The earliest CD mastering for all the Steely Dan albums in 1985 used these digital tapes but MCA used deteriorating analog masters for all later CD pressings until the 1998 remasters. This information was revealed by Nichols in 1991 when asked about his opinion of the Mobile Fidelity Gold reissues of Aja and Gaucho. Nichols remarked that the \\"Gaucho CD was even a different speed, about a quarter tone sharper\\" when compared to the original CD that he was involved in.

Water  The term bowser is used by water companies in the United Kingdom to refer to mobile water tanks deployed to distribute fresh water in emergencies where the normal system of piped distribution has broken down or is insufficient. The term rose to prominence in general usage in England in July 2007 when severe flooding in the valley of the River Severn caused interruption of the piped-water supply to a large area of Gloucestershire.  Fuel  A C-5 Galaxy cargo plane is re-fuelled by a KrAZ-258/TZ-22 tanker at Manas International Airport Bowser also describes a fuel tanker used to deliver fuel to aircraft at airports or airfields. The term also describes refuelling boats that supply seaplanes, army fuel tankers used for combat resupply, and vehicles that fill heavy construction equipment such as hydraulic excavators and bulldozers. Even aircraft have been described as \\"flying fuel bowsers\\" when configured to ferry fuel to support a forward operation. The related verb, \\"bowsing\\", is used in the fuel distribution industry to refer to the practice of customers of one fuel distributor to be able to collect fuel from a depot (including retail stations) of a second fuel distributor, at the prices of the first distributor. As such, it is a method of mutual distribution, improving fuel access for customers while reducing the main costs of each distributor. Being a commercial service, it normally applies to DERV (road vehicle diesel fuel) rather than petrol (gasoline).  Other liquids  At the former nuclear research facility at Dounreay in the far north of Scotland, the word bowser is used to describe various moveable (but not wheeled) vessels that contain alkali metals (sodium or NaK), protected from oxidation by an inert gas. The word may also have been in use at the Atomic Energy Authority's (now UKAEA's) southern sites.

Traditionally a leader in tourism, the shore region holds 15.1% of the state's tourism, ranking 3rd in New Jersey.

It has a panoramic view of Raritan Bay, New York City and Sandy Hook and is near the Twin Lights Lighthouse in Highlands, NJ. It is also the location of the Monmouth County 9-11 Memorial. It was named after Samuel Latham Mitchill, who determined the height of the hill. near Locust.

Its people were ancestors of the modern Libyans. They occupied the area for thousands of years before the beginning of human records in ancient Egypt. Climate changes affected the locations of the settlements. More narrowly, Libya could also refer to the country immediately west of Egypt, viz Marmarica (Libya Inferior) and Cyrenaica (Libya Superior). The Libyan Sea or Mare Libycum was the part of the Mediterranean Sea south of Crete, between Cyrene and Alexandria. In the Hellenistic period, the Berbers were known as Libyans,Oliver, Roland & Fagan, Brian M. (1975) Africa in the Iron Age: c. 500 B.C. to A.D. 1400. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; p. 47 a Greek term for the inhabitants of the Berber world. Their lands were called \\"Libya\\" and extended from modern Morocco to the western borders of ancient Egypt. Modern Egypt contains the Siwa Oasis, which was part of ancient Libya. The Siwi language, a Berber language, is still spoken in the area.  Name  The Greek name is based on the ethnonym Libu ( L√≠byes, ). The name Libya (in use since 1934 for the modern country formerly known as Tripolitania and Barca) was the Latin designation for the region of the Maghreb, from the Ancient Greek ( Lib√∫ƒì, Lib√∫ƒÅ). In Classical Greece, the term had a broader meaning, encompassing the continent that later (second century BC) became known as Africa, which, in antiquity, was assumed to constitute one third of the world's land mass, compared to Europe and Asia combined. The Libu are attested since the Late Bronze Age as inhabiting the region (Egyptian R'bw, Punic: lby). The oldest known references to the Libu date to Ramesses II and his successor Merneptah, pharaohs of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt, during the 13th century BC. LBW appears as an ethnic name on the Merneptah Stele.Gardiner, Alan Henderson (1964) Egypt of the Pharaohs: an introduction Oxford University Press, London, p. 273, Menelaus had travelled there on his way home from Troy; it was a land of wonderful richness, where the lambs have horns as soon as they are born, where ewes lamb three times a year and no shepherd ever goes short of milk, meat or cheese. Homer names Libya, in Odyssey (IX.95; XXIII.311). Homer used the name in a geographic sense, while he called its inhabitants \\"Lotus-eaters\\". After Homer, Aeschylus, Pindar, and other ancient Greek writers use the name. Herodotus (1.46) used ŒõŒπŒ≤œçŒ∑ Lib√∫ƒì to indicate the African continent; the L√≠bues proper were the light-skinned North Africans, while those south of Egypt (and Elephantine on the Nile) were known to him as \\"Aethiopians\\";The Cambridge History of North Africa and the people between them as the Egyptians, p. 141. this was also the understanding of later Greek geographers such Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, etc. When the Greeks actually settled in the real Libya in the 630s, the old name taken from the Egyptians was applied by the Greeks of Cyrenaica, who may have coexisted with the Libu.Fage, J. D. (ed.) (1978) \\"The Libyans\\" The Cambridge History of Africa: From c. 500 BC to AD 1050 volume II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, p. 141, Later, the name appeared in the Hebrew language, written in the Bible as Lehabim and Lubim, indicating the ethnic population and the geographic territory as well. In the neo-Punic inscriptions, it was written as Lby for the masculine noun, and Lbt for the feminine noun of Libyan. Latin absorbed the name from Greek and the Punic languages. The Romans would have known them before their colonization of North Africa because of the Libyan role in the Punic Wars against the Romans. The Romans used the name L√≠bues, but only when referring to Barca and the Libyan Desert of Egypt. The other Libyan territories were called \\"Africa\\". Classical Arabic literature called Libya Lubya, . Modern Arabic uses Libya. The Lwatae, the tribe of Ibn Battuta,The full name of Ibn Battuta was Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah al-Lawati at-Tanji ibn Battuta as the Arabs called it, was a Berber tribe that mainly was situated in Cyrenaica. This tribe may have ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to modern Libya, however, and was referred to by Corippius as Laguatan; he linked them with the Maures. Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah states Luwa was an ancestor of this tribe. He writes that the Berbers add an \\"a\\" and \\"t\\" to the name for the plural forms. Subsequently, it became Lwat. Conversely, the Arabs adopted the name as a singular form, adding an \\"h\\" for the plural form in Arabic. Ibn Khaldun disagrees with Ibn Hazam, who claimed, mostly on the basis of Berber sources, that the Lwatah, in addition to the Sadrata and the Mzata, were from the Qibts (Egyptians). According to Ibn Khaldun, this claim is incorrect because Ibn Hazam had not read the books of the Berber scholars.The History of Ibn Khaldun, third chapter p. 184-258 Oric Bates, a historian, considers that the name Libu or LBW would be derived from the name LuwatahBates, Oric (1914) The Eastern Libyans. London: Macmillan & Co. p. 57 whilst the name Liwata is a derivation of the name Libu.  History  Archaeological Site of Sabratha, Libya Compared with the history of Egypt, historians know little about the history of Libya, as there are few surviving written records. Information on ancient Libya comes from archaeological evidence and historic sources written by Egypt's neighbors, the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines, and from Arabs of Medieval times. Since Neolithic times, the climate of North Africa has become drier. A reminder of the desertification of the area is provided by megalithic remains, which occur in great variety of form and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands : dolmens and circles like Stonehenge, cairns, underground cells excavated in rock, barrows topped with huge slabs, and step- pyramid-like mounds . Most remarkable are the trilithons, some still standing, some fallen, which occur isolated or in rows, and consist of two squared uprights standing on a common pedestal that supports a huge transverse beam . In the Terrgurt valley, Cowper says, \\"There had been originally no less than eighteen or twenty megalithic trilithons, in a line, each with its massive altar placed before it\\". In ancient times, the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, the Persian Achaemenid Empire (see Libya (satrapy)), the armies of Alexander the Great and his Ptolemaic successors from Egypt, then Romans, Vandals, and local representatives of the Byzantine Empire ruled all or parts of Libya. The territory of modern Libya had separate histories until Roman times, as Tripoli and Cyrenaica. Cyrenaica, by contrast, was Greek before it was Roman. It was also known as Pentapolis, the \\"five cities\\" being Cyrene (near the village of Shahat) with its port of Apollonia (Marsa Susa), Arsinoe (Tocra), Berenice (Bengazi) and Barca (Merj). From the oldest and most famous of the Greek colonies the fertile coastal plain took the name of Cyrenaica. These five cities were also known as the Western Pentapolis; not to be confused with the Pentapolis of the Roman era on the current west Italian coast. Geography The exact boundaries of Ancient Libya are unknown. It lay west of Ancient Egypt and was known as \\"Tjehenu\\" to the Ancient Egyptians.A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian, Raymond O Faulkner, Page 306 Libya was an unknown territory to the Egyptians: it was the land of the spirits.Bates, Oric To the Ancient Greeks, Libya was one of the three known continents along with Asia and Europe. In this sense, Libya was the whole known African continent to the west of the Nile Valley and extended south of Egypt. Herodotus described the inhabitants of Libya as two peoples: The Libyans in northern Africa and the Ethiopians in the south. According to Herodotus, Libya began where Ancient Egypt ended, and extended to Cape Spartel, south of Tangier on the Atlantic coast . Modern geographers suspect that Ancient Libyans may have experienced loss of forests, reliable fresh water sources, and game availability as the area became more desert-like. .  Later sources  After the Egyptians, the Greeks; Romans; and Byzantines mentioned various other tribes in Libya. Later tribal names differ from the Egyptian ones but, probably, some tribes were named in the Egyptian sources and the later ones, as well. The Meshwesh-tribe represents this assumption. Scholars believe it would be the same tribe called Mazyes by Hektaios and Maxyes by Herodotus, while it was called \\"Mazaces\\" and \\"Mazax\\" in Latin sources. All those names are similar to the name used by the Berbers for themselves, Imazighen.Mohammed Chafik, Highlights of thirty-three centuries of Imazighen p. 9 . Late period sources give more detailed descriptions of Libya and its inhabitants. The ancient historian Herodotus describes Libya and the Libyans in his fourth book, known as The Libyan Book. Pliny the Elder, Diodorus Siculus, and Procopius also contributed to what is now primary source material on ancient Libya and the Libyans. Ibn Khaldun, who dedicated the main part of his book Kitab el'ibar, which is known as \\"The history of the Berbers\\", did not use the names Libya and Libyans, but instead used Arabic names: The Old Maghreb, (El-Maghrib el-Qadim), and the Berbers (El-Barbar or El-Barabera(h)).  Ancient Libyan (Berber) tribes  There were many tribes in ancient Libya, including the now extinct Psylli, with the Libu being the most prominent. The ancient Libyans were mainly pastoral nomads, living off their goats, sheep and other livestock. Milk, meat, hides and wool were gathered from their livestock for food, tents and clothing. Ancient Egyptian sources describe Libyan men with long hair, braided and beaded, neatly parted from different sides and decorated with feathers attached to leather bands around the crown of the head while wearing thin robes of antelope hide, dyed and printed, crossing the shoulder and coming down until mid calf length to make a robe. Older men kept long braided beards. Women wore the same robes as men, plaited, decorated hair and both genders wore heavy jewelry. Depictions of Libyans in Egyptian reliefs show prominent and numerous tattoos, very similar to traditional Berber tattoos still seen today. Weapons included bows and arrows, hatchets, spears and daggers. The Libyan script that was used in Libya was mostly a funerary script. It is difficult to understand, and there are a number of variations.Chaker Script Ibn Khaldun divided the Berbers into the Batr and the Baranis.Ibn Khaldun, The History of Ibn Khaldun: The thirth chapter p. 181-152. Herodotus divided them into Eastern Libyans and Western Libyans. Eastern Libyans were nomadic shepherds east of Lake Tritonis. Western Libyans were sedentary farmers who lived west of Lake Tritonis.Herodotus, On Libya, from The Histories, c. 430 BC At one point, a catastrophic change reduced the vast body of fresh water to a seasonal lake or marsh. Ibn Khaldun and Herodotus distinguish the Libyans on the basis of their lifestyles rather than ethnic background. Modern historians tend to follow Herodotus's distinction. Examples include Oric Bates in his book The Eastern Libyans. Some other historians have used the modern name of the Berbers in their works, such as the French historian Gabriel Camps.\\"Gabriel Camps is considered as the father of the North African prehistory, by founding d'Etude Berb√®re at the University of Aix-en-Provence and the Encyclop√©die berb√®re.\\" (From the introduction of the English book The Berbers by Elizabeth Fentres and Michael Brett, p. 7). The Libyan tribes mentioned in these sources were: \\"Adyrmachidae\\", \\"Giligamae\\", \\"Asbystae\\", \\"Marmaridae\\", \\"Auschisae\\", \\"Nasamones\\", \\"Macae\\", \\"Lotus-eaters (or Lotophagi)\\", \\"Garamantes\\", \\"Gaetulians\\", \\"Mauri\\", and \\"Luwatae\\", as well as many others.

It is eaten very young, has no rind and a very soft, creamy texture and normally a mild and delicate flavour. It is normally square in shape. The name of the cheese derives from the Lombard adjective stracco, meaning \\"tired\\". It is said that milk produced by tired cows coming down from the alpine pastures in the autumn is richer in fats and more acidic. These qualities were discovered, according to legend, in the milk of cows who were moved seasonally, up and down the Alps, to different pastures. The milk of such cows gives the cheese its characteristic flavours. Stracchino is usually eaten on its own but also as a filling for some kinds of bread: in Recco, on the Ligurian riviera east of Genoa, focaccia col formaggio (\\"cheese focaccia\\") or focaccia di Recco is typically filled with crescenza, while in Romagna and in parts of some nearby regions (e.g. northern Marche, Umbria and eastern Tuscany) it is a common filling for the cascione which is made out of piadina, a thin flat bread.

Bowser & Co. Sylvanus Freelove Bowser (8 August 18543 October 1938) was an American inventor who is widely credited with inventing the automobile fuel pump. Bowser Avenue in his hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana is named after him. Bowser marketed his patented kerosene pump starting in 1885. The introduction of automobiles, mainly powered by gasoline, led him to develop it into the \\"Self-Measuring Gasoline Storage Pump\\", launched in 1905. Bowser's invention operated with a manual suction pump, which dispensed the gasoline into the car through a flexible hose. The 50-gallon metal storage tank, housed in a wooden cabinet, could be set up at the curbside in front of a store. Under the banner of his company, S. F. Bowser & Company, this activity expanded to the measurement and handling of many commercial liquids. Bowser opened branches around the world, and bowser became a generic term for fuel dispensers, then fuel tankers (especially on airfields), then finally for any kind of self-propelled liquid tanker with the ability to dispense direct to consumers. In New Zealand and Australia it is still a generic term for consumer fuel pumps, while in the United Kingdom it refers to wheeled water tankers (either automotive or towed) used to supply fresh water to areas where normal supplies have been interrupted. The Bowser company was acquired in 1969 by Keene Corporation in Greenville, Tennessee. The vacuum oil purification side of the business was divested by Keene in 1978, subsequently trading under the name Enervac. Keene filed for bankruptcy in 1993 due to a large number of asbestos-related lawsuits.

Amelita Baltar (September 24, 1940) is an Argentine singer, one of the leading voices of tango, that appeared in the 60's to be considered, along with Susana Rinaldi, as a modern counterpart of older divas such as Libertad Lamarque and Tita Merello. She is mostly known for her collaboration with composer Astor Piazzolla and writer Horacio Ferrer, specially as first performer of their song ‚ÄúBalada para un loco‚Äù. She starred in places such as Olympia (Paris), De Kleine Komedie (Amsterdam), Cemal Re≈üit Rey Concert Hall (Istanbul, Turkey), Cocoanut Grove at Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles) or Gin√°sio do Maracan√£zinho (Rio de Janeiro) and shared the stage with celebrities such as Charles Aznavour, Franck Pourcel, Henry Mancini, Gerry Mulligan, Gary Burton and Chick Corea. http://www.elpais.com.uy/divertite/musica/amelita-baltar-noche-show.html Biography =Early life and career= Unlike most tango artists she was born in the upper-class neighbourhood of Barrio Norte, Buenos Aires and was raised at the countryside in Jun√≠n, Buenos Aires Province. She studied to become a school teacher and started her musical career as a singer of Argentine folk music with the band ‚ÄúSombras‚Äù. =The Piazzolla years= Piazzolla discovered her by chance and offered her to star in his opera Mar√≠a de Buenos Aires. He also started to write along with Ferrer songs for her to sing, among which ‚ÄúBalada para un loco‚Äù is the most famous one. Its first performance at Estadio Luna Park in 1969 aroused a scandal reminiscent of Igor Stravinsky's ‚ÄúThe rite of spring‚Äù riot in 1913. Immediately released as a single by CBS Records International, it sold 200.000 copies in just a few weeks, thing that could only be achieved at the time in Argentina by foreigner stars such as The Beatles or local pop singers such as Palito Ortega and Sandro de Am√©rica. International success followed with performances all around the world, including a half-Italian version which was broadcast on RAI TV. Back in Argentina, she performed ‚ÄúEl gordo triste‚Äù, Piazzolla and Ferrer's tribute to An√≠bal Troilo, in the presence of the honoree. =After Piazzolla= After the split with Piazzolla in 1975 she started singing traditional tangos such as ‚ÄúEl d√≠a que me quieras‚Äù, ‚ÄúVolver‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoledad‚Äù by Carlos Gardel, ‚ÄúUno‚Äùand ‚ÄúGrisel‚Äù by Mariano Mores, ‚ÄúCambalache‚Äù and ‚ÄúYira yira‚Äù by Enrique Santos Disc√©polo or ‚ÄúLa √∫ltima copa‚Äù by Francisco Canaro. But, just as Piazzolla kept performing the Ferrer songs with Italian singer Milva, so did Amelita, and in 2002 she returned to the Estadio Luna Park to perform again ‚ÄúBalada para un loco‚Äù, this time for international ballet star Julio Bocca to dance to. http://www.lanacion.com.ar/455877-gran-actuacion-de- bocca =Present= In 2010 she appeared in the ‚ÄúBuenos Aires by night: The ultimate electronic tango voyage‚Äù DVD with the song ‚ÄúFr√≠o Intenso‚Äù. In 2012 she released the CD ‚ÄúEl nuevo rumbo‚Äù featuring the famous rock singers Fito P√°ez, Pedro Aznar, Fernando Ruiz D√≠az from Catupecu Machu and specially Luis Alberto Spinetta in one of his last recordings before passing away. In her CD ‚ÄúAmelita Baltar canta Vinicius y Piazzolla ‚Äì Bossa & Tango‚Äù released in July 2015 beside the Piazzolla classics she performs Bossa nova songs by their friend Vinicius de Moraes. A symphonic tribute to Horacio Ferrer recorded at the Sol√≠s Theatre (Montevideo) in June 2015 is due to be released. Discography *Para usted...

Its headquarters were at One Piedmont Plaza in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, a building that is now part of Wake Forest University.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. April 1, 1989. 113. In April 1989, shortly before it merged into USAir, Piedmont had 22,000 employees. In September 1988 it flew to 95 airports from hubs in the eastern United States; its commuter and regional affiliates flew turboprop aircraft via code sharing agreements to 39 more airports. History The company that would become Piedmont Airlines was founded by Thomas Henry Davis (March 15, 1918 ‚Äì April 22, 1999) in Winston-Salem, North Carolina in 1940, when Davis purchased Camel City Flying Service and changed the name to Piedmont Aviation. Piedmont originally operated as an airplane repair service and a training school for pilots in the War Department Civilian Pilot Training Program. In 1944, Davis filed an application to run a passenger flight service in the southeast. After several years of lobbying government agencies and fighting legal challenges from other airlines, Piedmont received authorization on January 1, 1948. The first flight, from Wilmington, North Carolina to Cincinnati, was on February 20, 1948. Davis grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As a child, he loved airplanes and often used his allowance to take flying lessons. He took pre-med classes at the University of Arizona. At the same time, he worked as a part-time flight instructor. =Foundation= Martin 404 was Piedmont's first pressurized airliner Like most airlines before deregulation, Piedmont did not have hubs. The airline would eventually fly jets to small airports and connected unlikely city pairs with jet flights: Kinston, North Carolina, and Florence, South Carolina; Roanoke, Virginia, and Asheville, North Carolina; Lynchburg, Virginia, and New York City's LaGuardia Airport; Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Bristol/Kingsport/Johnson City, Tennessee; and Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Lynchburg, Virginia. Its early routes stretched from Wilmington, North Carolina, northwest to Cincinnati, Ohio, with intermediate stops. All flights were on Douglas DC-3s. =Growth= Piedmont YS-11A at Washington National Fairchild-Hiller FH-227B at Washington DCA in 1972 Boeing 727-100 at Chicago O'Hare Airport in 1979 Boeing 737-200 and a Boeing 737-300 at La Guardia Airport in August 1985 Piedmont started with Douglas DC-3s; it added Fairchild F-27s in late 1958 and Martin 4-0-4s at the beginning of 1962. Fairchild Hiller FH-227B flights started (and F27 flights ended) in 1967 and NAMC YS-11A flights started in 1968.Davies says YS11 flights started in 1969, which must be a typo. In August 1953 it scheduled flights to 26 airports and in May 1968 to 47. Like other Local Service airlines, Piedmont was subsidized; in 1962, its operating \\"revenues\\" of $18.2 million included $4.8 million \\"Pub. serv. rev.\\"Moody's Transportation Manual 1964 =The jet age= Piedmont's first jet flights took off in March 1967: 92-seat Boeing 727-100s on such routes as Atlanta - Asheville - Winston-Salem - Roanoke - New York LaGuardia Airport. Boeing 737-200s arrived in 1968; six 727-100s were added from 1977, and in June 1981 the airline added the Boeing 727-200. Piedmont was all turbine after the last M404 flights in 1972 and all jet after the last YS11 flights in 1982. (One 727-100 that Piedmont bought from Northwest Orient Airlines was the aircraft hijacked by D. B. Cooper.) Fokker F28 Fellowships were added to the fleet, and Boeing 737-300s, 737-400s and 767-200ERs. = Route expansion = In 1949 the network extended from Cincinnati and Louisville east to Norfolk and points south. The map reached Knoxville in 1951-52, Columbus OH and Washington DC in 1955, Atlanta and Baltimore in 1962, New York La Guardia in 1966, Nashville and Memphis in 1968 and Chicago Midway in December 1969. In 1978, still under U.S. route regulation, Piedmont added Boston, Denver, and Miami. Flights to Dallas/Ft.

Syracuse was the smallest hub; it had been an Empire hub.http://www.departedflights.com, Sept. 1, 1984 Empire route map =Deregulation= Boeing 767-200ER at London Gatwick International Airport After deregulation in the late 1970s the airline grew rapidly and developed a hub at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina. Piedmont bought Empire Airlines, based in Utica, New York, in 1985 which brought Fokker F28 Fellowships into the fleet. Passenger-miles for the merged airline in 1987 were almost nine times Piedmont's RPMs in 1977. Later hubs included Baltimore/Washington International Airport ; James M. Cox Dayton International Airport in Dayton, Ohio; and Syracuse Hancock International Airport in Syracuse, New York. Nonstops from Charlotte to the west coast started in 1984 on Boeing 727-200s that were Piedmont's first jets with a first-class section. New Boeing 767-200ERs (ER for \\"Extended Range\\"), the airline's only wide-body jet, flew nonstop Charlotte to London Gatwick Airport beginning in 1987. The 767 also flew nonstop Charlotte-Los Angeles.http://www.airliners.net, photos of Piedmont 767-200 at LAXShortly before it was acquired by USAir, Piedmont was the first airline to announce fleet-wide adoption of the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). =Commuter and regional airline affiliates= Several commuter and regional airline affiliates provided passenger feed for Piedmont via code sharing agreements, including Britt Airways, Brockway Air, CCAir, Henson Airlines and Jetstream International Airlines.http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1986 & June 1, 1989 Piedmont Airlines system route maps These operations were identified by several different names including Piedmont Commuter System, Piedmont Shuttle Link and The Piedmont Regional Airline.http://www.departedflights.com, June 1, 1988 Piedmont Airlines system route map Turboprop aircraft operated by these airlines included the Beechcraft 99, Beechcraft 1900C, British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31, de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7, de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8, Fokker F-27-600, Saab 340, Short 330 and Short 360.http://www.airliners.net, photos of Piedmont Commuter and Piedmont Regional aircraft =Absorption into USAir= US Airways A319 in a hybrid US Airways/Piedmont \\"retro\\" livery Piedmont's expanding route system, its loyal passenger following, and its profitability caused it to gain notice among other airlines for a potential buyout. On August 5, 1989, Piedmont Airlines was absorbed by USAir (formerly Allegheny Airlines); the combination became one of the East Coast's largest airlines. USAir later changed its name to US Airways, which merged with America West Airlines on November 4, 2007. US Airways merged with American Airlines on October 17, 2015 with the American name being retained. The Charlotte hub established by Piedmont and maintained by US Airways continues under American. Piedmont Airlines (formerly Henson Airlines) still exists as a brand within American Airlines, doing business as American Eagle.

Twenty- six of the 27 people on board the Douglas DC-3 perished. On July 19, 1967, Piedmont suffered another fatal accident when Flight 22, a Boeing 727-100, collided with a Cessna 310 over Hendersonville, North Carolina. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the pilot of the Cessna went off course, placing his aircraft in the path of the 727. 82 perished in the mid- air collision. On August 10, 1968, Piedmont Flight 230 was on an ILS localizer only approach to Charleston-Kanawha County Airport (CRW) runway 23 when it struck trees 360 feet from the runway threshold. The aircraft continued and struck up sloping terrain (+30 degrees) 250 feet short in a 4-5 degree nose- down attitude, slightly left wing down. The Fairchild-Hiller FH-227 continued up the hill and on to the airport, coming to rest 6 feet beyond the threshold and 50 feet from the right edge of the runway. A layer of dense fog (about 150 feet thick) was obscuring the threshold and about half of the approach lights. Visual conditions existed outside the fog area. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the probable cause was \\"an unrecognized loss of altitude orientation during the final portion of an approach into a shallow, dense fog. The disorientation was caused by a rapid reduction in the ground guidance segment available to the pilot at a point beyond which a go-around could not be successfully effected.\\"National Transportation Safety Board.

The bags typically contain thiamine, folic acid, and magnesium sulfate, and are usually used to correct nutritional deficiencies or chemical imbalances in the human body. The solution has a yellow color, hence the term \\"banana bag\\".  Composition  The typical composition of a banana bag is 1 liter of normal saline (sodium chloride 0.9%) with: * Thiamine 100 mg * Folic acid 1 mg * Multivitamin for infusion (MVI), 1 ampule * Magnesium sulfate 3 g The solution is typically infused over four to eight hours or as per physician's orders.  Uses  Banana bags are used in the intensive care unit to correct acute magnesium deficiencies. They are stated to be beneficial for patients with terminal illness because magnesium can mitigate nerve pain and relieve muscle pain and cramps. Banana bags are often prescribed for alcoholics who need thiamine to prevent Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome. However, most recent evidence points that the amount of thiamine in a banana bag is inadequate for prophylaxis and treatment for ICU patients. The proposed regimen is 200-500mg IV every 8 hours for the first day of admission. Chronic alcoholics can suffer significant whole-body magnesium deficiencies.

Synopsis Sol is a poor young girl who lives with her father, Hipolito Romero, on an old ship anchored close to the shore of a small coastal town. Fishing and sailing are her passions, and the sea is her home. When she was a small child, her mother abandoned her to run away with a wealthy tourist. Sol and her father, however, believe that her brother drowned in the ocean that they love so much. Armando de la Torre is handsome, rich and lives in the capital city. He is on vacation on his family‚Äôs yacht with a group of friends and his arrogant fiancee: Martita Aristigueta. A boating accident initially brings Armando and Sol together, lighting the spark of love. Later, at a street festival in town, they meet again and, consumed by an irresistible attraction, they begin a passionate love affair. Martita, crazy with jealousy, sets out to do everything in her power to destroy Sol and Armando's happiness. Resorting to lies and intrigue, she manages to make Armando distrust Sol and put an end to their relationship. A disillusioned Armando marries Martita; Sol, feeling abandoned and desperate, decides to marry Rildo, a former suitor, in spite of the fact that she is expecting Armando's baby. Fifteen years later, destiny places Sol in the path of her former lover, Armando. Now, they are both filled with anguish upon learning that their respective children have fallen in love with each other. Only the strongest, truest love will be able to reunite Sol and Armando, allowing them to make up for lost time.

It has about 2,000 inhabitants. The centre of the town is historically significant and is protected by law as urban monument zone. The town is known for its freestyle skiing centre whose operator is the Olympic winner Ale≈° Valenta. Administrative parts Villages of B≈ôezn√°, Crhov and Heroltice are administrative parts of ≈†t√≠ty. Etymology The original name was Schildberg in German language (meaning Shield Hill) and ≈†ilperk in Czech language (transcription from German). After World War II, the town was renamed as ≈Ωalkov. However, this name was not popular, thus new name ≈†t√≠ty was created. The current name is derivered from the original one and literally means Shields. Geography ≈†t√≠ty is located in west part of ≈†umperk District in Olomouc Region of the Czech Republic. Historical centre is situated on the promontory above B≈ôezn√° river which is part of Orlick√© Hory mountain range. Surrounding area is hilly. Agricultural land is not fertile, therefore number of inhabitants has never reached higher numbers. History =Feudal history= The oldest document about the town was discovered in Liechtenstein archive. It is dated 4 April 1365 referring to the estate transfer from Zdenƒõk of Sternberg to a man named Heylin. The document also states that the transferred estate is connected to the right coming from year 1278, thus town existence before the 13th century is probable, Another document comes from 1307 and 1308 which is a complaint of monks from Lan≈°kroun who had to pay tribute of 180 silver grzywnas to the robber baron Je≈æek of ≈†ilperk. According to Zemsk√© desky, ≈†t√≠ty was owned by the House of Sternberg from 1308 who often leased the town to another aristocratic families. ≈†t√≠ty coat of arms is inspired by ≈†tenberk coat of arms. In 1480, the town was sold to Jan Dalƒçick√Ω from Daƒçice, who donated ≈†t√≠ty as a dowry to Ale≈° Krƒçma of Konƒõpasy. During late 15th and early 16th century the town often changed its owners. From 1553, the owner was Maty√°≈° ≈Ωalkovsk√Ω, who sold the town to Pavel Catharin from Cathar, whose sons sold ≈†t√≠ty to Jan Odkolek from √öjezdec in 1602. ≈†t√≠ty was heavily damaged by fire in 1557. Jan Odkolek Jr. participated in the uprising against Habsburg rule from 1618 to 1620, and after suppression of the revolt his property, including ≈†t√≠ty, was confiscated. Odkoled escaped to Poland and was convicted in absentia to death. New owner was the House of Liechtenstein, who administered the town to the fall of feudal system in 1848. Lichten≈°tein rule was not popular because originally ultraqist town was under strong pressure of recatholization, also corv√©e obligation was very hard. Liechtenstein's cruel administration was mitigated by intervention of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1642 and 1643, the town was looted by Swedish soldiers under the command of general Lennart Torstensson. In 1646, ≈†t√≠ty was looted by Swedish soldiers again, under the command of general Arvid Wittenberg this time. Historical report from Horn√≠ Stud√©nky administrator says that \\"all houses were burnt down expect the church and the town hall\\" Periodical looting caused famine which happened in 1649. ≈†t√≠ty was stricken by plague in 1680 and again in 1713. As a reaction the plague column was erected in 1713, which still can be found in the town's main square. During war of the Austrian Succession, Prussian hussars fought minor victorious battle with Austrian soldiers in town's neighborhood. As a result, Prussians invaded to ≈†t√≠ty and started looting. Allegedly, one of the ≈†t√≠ty residents, the man named Du≈°ek, shot from church tower to the group of hussars. Prussian major Sch√ºtz ordered to execute 83 ≈†t√≠ty men and to burn the town down. Another devastating fire stroke ≈†t√≠ty on 21 March 1799. According to the chronicle of Welzl, 74 houses were destroyed. The fire started in local forge. =≈†t√≠ty Castle= The castle was situated in the place of the current Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The structure was not strategically significant and was probably burnt down by hussite army in 1424. Ruins were used as a building material for new houses. =WWII= Munich agreement let the annexation of Czechoslovak borderland including ≈†t√≠ty by Nazi Germany. Most of Czech citizens were evacuated to the inland. Kub√≠ƒçk≈Øm ml√Ωn, the mill in the area Na Piln√≠ku, was the meeting point for local resistance movement from 1941 to 30 March 1944, when resistance members were imprisoned. Labor camps for Polish and French prisoners were operating near the town. ≈†t√≠ty was liberated by Red Army at midnight from 4 to 5 May 1945. The population was ethnically mixed until 1945 when Sudeten Germans were expelled.

The film follows the formula of the original, with one female lead (Lysette Anthony) playing parts in each of three segments. In the episode \\"He Who Kills\\", one of the museum security guards is reading a Dark Shadows comic book, and enthuses about how he used to rush home from school to watch it. Dan Curtis created the TV series Dark Shadows in 1966. Category:Demons in film Plot =Story I: The Graveyard Rats= A wealthy man by the name of Ansford (Matt Clark) discovers his young wife Laura (Lysette Anthony) having an affair with her cousin. Having video proof he threatens Laura to be faithful and honest or he will turn the video over to the news stations and cut her out of his multimillion-dollar will. Meanwhile, her lover Ben (Geraint Wyn Davies) comes up with the idea to murder Ansford and collect all his money. After Ansford is pushed down the stairs and killed, Laura and Ben are more than happy to collect their winnings, however all does not go as planned. Before dying, Ansford transferred all of his millions into an account in Z√ºrich, and microfilmed the access codes, which were buried with him. Now, Laura and Ben have to dig up his grave, and Ben climbs into the opened coffin to retrieve the microfilm. Soon after, Laura shoots and kills Ben to claim all the money for herself. All of a sudden, the body of the dead millionaire is dragged through a hole in the side of the coffin by flesh-eating giant rats with red eyes, and Laura is forced to crawl in after him through a network of underground graveyard tunnels. Eventually the advancing rats corner her into another buried coffin. Laura tries to keep the rats away by firing her gun at them but quickly the rats pour into the coffin and devour her. This first episode (screenplay by William F. Nolan and Dan Curtis) is based on Henry Kuttner's eponymous short story, albeit considerably altered. In Kuttner‚Äôs tale, the thief is a male cemetery caretaker who habitually steals valuables from the corpses in a graveyard beset by a colony of abnormally large rats. =Story II: Bobby= The second episode is a re-filming of a script by Richard Matheson. It was originally written by Matheson for the Dan Curtis omnibus movie Dead of Night and was there filmed with different actors. It has been some time since Bobby \\"accidentally\\" drowned, leaving his mother Alma (Lysette Anthony) depressed and guilty. However, while her husband is away on business, she determines to raise her son from the dead. Armed with a magic book and a \\"Key of Solomon\\" (in this case, a talisman rather than a book), she conjures up dark forces to bring her son back. Before going to bed, a vicious thunderstorm approaches the luxurious beach mansion. Hearing a knock, she opens the door to discover her son. After cleaning him up, she begins to make him feel at home again. However, all does not work out when Bobby goes completely mad and begins to terrorize his mother in the dark house with a sledgehammer and a butcher knife. The mother soon realizes that it is not Bobby who returned to her, but a demon that had taken his place, as he says \\"Bobby hates you, Mommy, so he sent me instead,\\" revealing his demon-like face, after which the screen blacks out. =Story III: He Who Kills= This segment, about the Zuni fetish doll \\"He Who Kills\\", is a sequel to the third segment of the original Trilogy of Terror, \\"Amelia\\". After finding the double homicide of Amelia and her mother from the first movie with the Zuni Doll at the scene, the local police drop off the doll to local Dr. Simpson (Lysette Anthony). As she begins to examine the doll she learns that the doll comes to life when a gold chain is removed from his neck and that the Zuni Doll has a desire for flesh. It also seems to regenerate (the idea itself initially laughable to both Dr. Simpson and her assistant) as when she chips away the charred wood, the Zuni Doll seems to be brand new. After a quick pizza break, she discovers the doll missing. One of the officers investigates the surrounding museum, only to be shot down by an arrow from one of the exhibits, courtesy of the doll. After minutes of looking, she finds the doll attacking and running towards her with a lab knife as a weapon. Now Dr. Simpson is all alone in a large museum with a tiny killer on the loose. Much like the first movie, Dr. Simpson catches the Zuni Doll in a briefcase, giving her time to try to reach her keys. As the doll cuts through the case, Dr. Simpson tries twice to grab the knife, only to get cut as in the first film. The doll eventually breaks through, meeting the stabbing force of a screwdriver-like object from Dr. Simpson. Making the same mistake as the first movie's protagonist, Dr. Simpson opens the briefcase to be bitten ferociously by the Zuni Doll. She eventually regains control, and tosses the doll into a large rectangular container of sulfuric acid. As the Zuni Doll comes to a halt in its motion, Dr. Simpson goes to grab tongs in an attempt to remove the doll, only to be possessed by He Who Kills, the spirit inhabiting the doll. Later on, she kills her date with the same ax she tried to use against the Zuni Doll.

Early life and career Although born in Chile, Jewell was educated in England, at Chigwell., Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1923. (His surname is given as \\"Jewel\\".) and Felsted (1902‚Äì05) Jewell first appeared in first-class cricket in South Africa, when he played five games for Orange Free State in the Currie Cup in the space of less than a fortnight in March 1911. He made his debut on the 11th against Transvaal; this match also saw the first-class debut of Arthur's brother John. Arthur, batting at three in each innings, made only 0 and 3 and claimed a single catch, to dismiss Maurice Luckin. His highest score that season was 34, made against Eastern Province in what proved to be his last appearance for eight years. After the First World War In 1919 Jewell finally played first-class cricket again, when he opened the batting for Worcestershire against HK Foster's XI at Hereford, making 3 and 46; two days later he scored 19 and 0 for Foster's side in a friendly game against the Australian Imperial Forces. Against Somerset five days later still, he kept wicket for the first time, in place of Ernest Bale. In August of that year Jewell made the first (and highest) of his three centuries, hitting 128 for Worcestershire in another match against Foster's team. His Wisden obituary gives his score as 123. 1920 saw Jewell score another two hundreds, and enjoy his most successful summer behind the stumps with 21 victims, 13 of them caught and eight stumped. The Worcestershire side that year was captained by Arthur's brother Maurice. That season Arthur was also chosen for a Gentlemen v Players game at The Oval, in which he opened the batting for the Gentlemen as well as keeping wicket; he made 3 and 0 and held a single catch (to dismiss Patsy Hendren) in an innings defeat. For Worcestershire he played on until the end of the season, his final appearance coming in late August against Lancashire and his last dismissal, in that match, being that of Lancashire captain and former England Test player Jack Sharp. Jewell played no more first-class cricket, and he died aged only 34 after a long illness. Relations Three of Jewell's relatives played first- class cricket. Two brothers, John and Maurice, have already been mentioned in the text; the other was his nephew, also named John Jewell, who played twice for Worcestershire in 1939.

He sang to great critical acclaim at major opera houses on both sides of the Atlantic, and his recordings of the music of Richard Wagner are considered to be among the finest ever made. Biography Jacques Urlus was born to music-loving Dutch parents in the then-German, nowadays Belgian town of Hergenrath (now part of Kelmis) and grew up in Tilburg in The Netherlands. Since the family was poor, they could not afford a musical education for their son who had to work at a steel mill in Utrecht instead, singing in choirs in his free time. During military service an officer recognised his musical talents and offered to pay for his musical lessons. But since this offer did not include money for food and lodging, the young man could not accept. Although Cornelie van Zanten is credited in some reference books as being Urlus' teacher, the young tenor was more or less an autodidact when he made his stage d√©but at the Amsterdam opera house on 20 September 1894 as Beppe in Leoncavallo's Pagliacci. He was 27 and a married man. Urlus stayed in Amsterdam for the next few years, gaining further musical training on the job. He appeared as a guest singer in other Dutch cities and built himself a small but growing reputation as a singer, especially in the part of Lohengrin. In 1898, Urlus was invited to Hanover, where he sang his famous Lohengrin and another Wagner role, that of Tannh√§user. This journey won him an audition with Cosima Wagner, the composer's widow and matriarch of the Bayreuth Festival. But although Urlus had learned all his Wagner roles in German especially for this occasion, he was not invited to sing at the next festival. Urlus auditioned for the opera company in Frankfurt on his way back to the Netherlands, and was offered a five-year contract there at a generous salary. Although Urlus and his wife had several children already, and needed the money, he turned down the Frankfurt offer because the company would not grant him time off each summer to attend Bayreuth: he still hoped for a call from the festival's directors which, as it transpired, would not be forthcoming for another 13 years. After returning to the Netherlands, Urlus continued enlarging his repertoire and improving his singing technique until he earned a contract with the Leipzig opera House in Germany in 1900. This company would become his musical home for the next 14 years. In addition, he made a habit of returning to Amsterdam and Antwerp every year to give performances. During the first decade of the 20th century, Urlus made a series of debuts in different European cities. They included: Berlin (the Berlin State Opera); Prague; Vienna (the Vienna State Opera); Munich (the Bavarian State Opera); Stuttgart; Dresden (the Dresden Opera); Frankfurt; and, lastly, London (the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, where he sang in 1910 and 1914). In 1911-12, the Bayreuth Festival's audience finally got to hear him for the first time, as Siegmund in Die Walk√ºre. In 1912, Urlus made his initial stage appearance in the United States of America. It took place in Boston, where he sang a Tristan in a series of performances opposite the dramatic sopranos Johanna Gadski and Lillian Nordica as Isolde. These performances secured him a contract with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, where he succeeded the Wagnerian tenors Heinrich Knote and Karel Burian (Carl Burian). Urlus' Met d√©but took place on 8 February 1913. It turned out to be one of the worst personal disasters in Met history. Urlus tried to sing in spite of a heavy head cold and lost his voice completely during the second act of Tristan und Isolde, having to resort to pantomime in act three. Still, when he sang the lead role in Siegfried only a week later he not only restored his reputation completely but cemented his position as the Met's number one (and, later, its sole) heldentenor. Urlus' Metropolitan Opera career was cut short in 1917 when the United States entered World War I and Wagnerian operas were banned for the duration. That same year, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity at the New England Conservatory of Music. The tenor joined the Leipzig Opera after his return from the United States, giving occasional concerts in Amsterdam and in Scandinavia as well. From 1922 he sang at the new Wagner Festival at the Zoppoter Waldoper, helping to build its reputation as \\"Bayreuth of the North\\". His operatic schedule diminished during the 1920s, however, as he accepted an increasing number of concert engagements. Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Berlin were all visited by him. When in Berlin, he performed at the Volksoper in 1923‚Äì24 and sang again at London's Royal Opera House in 1924. On 19 November 1931, Urlus delivered his last Tristan in Amsterdam. It was his final operatic performance after more than 1000 nights spanning 37 years. He still appeared occasionally in concerts, however, until 1933. Jacques Urlus died on 6 July 1935 while undergoing routine surgery. Upon receiving the news of his demise, the people of the Netherlands greatly lamented his passing, considering him to be a national hero. Repertoire, voice & recordings Urlus is best remembered for his Wagnerian performances but he sang many other types of roles. He performed regularly, for example, the Evangelist in Johann Sebastian Bach's St Matthew Passion, always to much acclaim, as well as singing Tamino in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te and Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio. He appeared, too, in such Verdi parts as Manrico (in Il trovatore), Radames (Aida) and Otello (Otello). He was not a stranger to the French repertoire either, appearing at various times as Samson (in Samson et Dalila), Faust (Faust), Raoul (Les Huguenots) and Don Jos√© (Carmen). In later years Urlus developed a reputation as a specialist in the vocal works of the Austrian composer and conductor Gustav Mahler. Although powerful, Urlus' voice was not like that of the usual 'monolithic' heldentenor, as epitomised by his mighty successor Lauritz Melchior (1890‚Äì1973). It was an elegant, flexible instrument with a lively vibrato and a smooth legato singing style. Urlus' voice also maintained its luminosity throughout a long career, despite the taxing demands placed upon it by the singer. This accounts for Urlus' continued success in a role as lyrical as Tamino. Today, Urlus is regarded as being one of the very best Wagner singers of all time. He made many acoustic discs of operatic arias and duets, mainly for HMV and Edison Records, which have been reissued on CD‚Äîmost notably by Marston Records and the Preiser label. These recordings confirm the outstanding quality of his voice and the excellence and versatility of his musicianship.

The WCBM studios are located in the Baltimore suburb of Pikesville, while the station transmitter resides in nearby Randallstown. Besides its main analog transmission, WCBM simulcasts over the HD digital subchannel of WQSR, and is available online. History WCBM first signed on the air in 1924.Broadcasting Yearbook 1970 page b-93 The original studios were in the Hotel Chateau, located at the northwest corner of Charles Street and North Avenue. The call letters - Chateau Baltimore Maryland, are derived from the hotel's name. The Chateau was also home to the drugstore where Dr. George Bunting first produced and marketed the skin cream Noxzema.Kelly, Jacques. \\"Old Building A Homely Piece of City History,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Saturday, February 14, 2009. In the 1930s, WCBM had moved to the Hearst Tower Building in Baltimore.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 36 It broadcast on 1350 kilocycles but was only powered at 500 watts by day, 250 watts at night, while competitor WBAL ran 50,000 watts. WCBM was the NBC Blue Network affiliate for Baltimore, carrying its dramas, comedies, news and sports, during the \\"Golden Age of Radio.\\" The Blue Network later became ABC. WCBM moved several times on the dial. With the 1941 enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), it switched from 1350 to 1400. Then in 1949, it relocated to its current dial position, 680 kHz. The move allowed WCBM to increase its power to 10,000 watts in the daytime and 5,000 watts at night. As network programming shifted from radio to television in the 1950s, WCBM gradually became a full service, middle of the road music and personality station. In 1960 WCBM added an FM station; WCBM-FM broadcast at 106.5 MHz, simulcasting the AM station. It was sold to the owner of Channel 2 WMAR-TV in 1968 and today is WWMX, owned by Entercom. WCBM-AM-FM were sold in 1963 to Metromedia, a large New York City-based broadcasting company. Metromedia also owned WTTG/Washington, D.C.; WNEW, WNEW-FM and WNEW-TV/New York City; WHK and WHK-FM/Cleveland; and WIP and WIP-FM/Philadelphia. The studios were moved to Owings Mills, Maryland. Metromedia helped WCBM establish a reputation for radio news reporting. It affiliated WCBM with CBS Radio News and maintained a staff of professional reporters and anchors. An advertisement in the 1964 Broadcasting Yearbook said WCBM airs 32 hours of news each week. \\"WCBM listeners hear it first! WCBM legmen are first on the scene, in Baltimore, surrounding counties and at the state capital of Annapolis.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1964 page B-69 But WCBM had a hard time competing with Hearst Corporation-owned WBAL, which also had a large news- gathering staff, as well as a powerful 50,000 watt signal. By the 1970s, WCBM evolved into more of an Adult Contemporary music format. In 1981, WCBM began running talk programming in the evening, while keeping its music and news in the daytime. As fewer people listened to music on AM radio, WCBM evolved to all talk by 1983. It was also the flagship radio station of the Baltimore Colts football team. Chuck Thompson and Vince Bagli called the action in the broadcast booth. The station was sold in 1987 to local owners using the corporate name \\"Magic 680 Inc.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1988 page B-129 WCBM returned to an adult contemporary format, dropping talk abruptly. After several months, it began playing oldies music, with a playlist of hits from 1955 to 1969. In 1987, when the radio broadcast rights for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team became available, WCBM surprisingly outbid both WBAL and WFBR which had been the radio home of the Orioles for the previous eight years. Considered to be a major coup at the time, WCBM's tenure as the Orioles flagship lasted only one season, as the station faced severe financial difficulties. By 1988, WCBM had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, went dark soon after, and was put up for sale. At about the same time that WCBM was in the middle of bankruptcy, rival AM station 1300 WFBR was sold in 1988 and changed its format from news/talk to 1950's rock & roll. With the format flip, WFBR let go most of the station's talk show hosts that summer. In October 1988, WCBM was bought by Baltimore area businessman and philanthropist Nick Mangione, Sr. who resurrected it from bankruptcy. A World War II veteran, Mangione was an avid listener of talk radio and a fan of WFBR's former talk radio format. Once he acquired the station, Mangione brought most of WFBR's former talk radio line-up to WCBM, including Frank Luber, Joe Lombardo, Tom Marr, Ken Maylath, Les Kinsolving and Stan \\"The Fan\\" Charles. WCBM originally had The Rush Limbaugh Show on its weekday schedule in the early 1990s, but lost it to competitor 1090 WBAL in 1994. With its stronger signal and higher ratings, Limbaugh's syndicator put the program on WBAL. At the time, WCBM was broadcasting at 10,000 watts by day and 5,000 watts night. WCBM had to scramble to replace Limbaugh in the Noon to 3 p.m. slot, choosing Zoh Heironimus to fill the role. Despite having a following, Zoh Heironimus didn't capture the listeners as well as Limbaugh. So WCBM added Dr. Laura Schlessinger to the 12‚Äì3 spot but her ratings dropped further. After WJFK (1300 AM) discontinued his program, WCBM added the syndicated G. Gordon Liddy Show. Liddy improved the ratings numbers for WCBM, although was not as successful as Limbaugh. By the end of 2001, The Sean Hannity Show was added to the 3‚Äì6 p.m. time slot, replacing Bob Scherr. In the early 2000s, WCBM began building a new, stronger radio tower in Carroll County, Maryland. WCBM went to a daytime power of 50,000 watts in 2004. The nighttime power increased to 10,000 watts. At the end of his contract with WBAL, on July 1, 2006, Limbaugh returned to WCBM. WBAL did not renew its contract with Premiere Networks due to the high cost. The station decided to go with a local host and use the extra money to win back the broadcast rights to the Baltimore Orioles and to go after the rights to the Baltimore Ravens football team. Limbaugh's show replaced G. Gordon Liddy in the early afternoon time slot. The Mark Levin Show, syndicated by Westwood One, debuted on the same day as Limbaugh's return, airing from 7 to 9 p.m. In 2009, WCBM dropped the ABC News Radio Network and switched to Fox News Radio for its world and national news coverage. This change coincided with competitor 1090 WBAL's change to an all news morning show. For both WCBM and WBAL, new station sweepers, imaging, station ID's and music accompanied the changes in programming. WCBM's imaging now centers on its affiliation with Fox News. On October 31, 2019, veteran personality Frank Luber retired after 31 years with WCBM, 27 of them hosting \\"Maryland's Wake Up Call.\\"InsideRadio.com \\"Frank Luber Steps Away from Mornings\\" October 28, 2019 Luber will continue to voice commercials for long- time advertisers and work on special projects. Luber's co-host, Sean Casey, is now teamed with former late morning host Bruce Elliott for \\"The Morning Drive with Casey & Elliott.\\" Derek Hunter, formerly of 1090 WBAL, took Elliott's time slot, 9 to 11:45 a.m. Derek Hunter, Veteran talk show host in his own right, has been with WCBM since 2019. Programming WCBM personalities Sean Casey and Bruce Elliott host the weekday morning show, followed by a local program hosted by Derek Hunter and Bill O'Reilly's syndicated daily commentary. Conservative talk shows The Rush Limbaugh Show and The Sean Hannity Show air during the afternoons, both of which are syndicated via Premiere Networks. The Mark Levin Show (via Westwood One) and The Buck Sexton Show (via Premiere) air in late evenings, and paranormal/conspiracy theory oriented program Coast to Coast AM with George Noory (via Premiere) airs through the overnight hours. WCBM airs several weekend talk programs, including The Money Pit Home Improvement Radio Show and The Lutheran Hour, syndicated shows hosted by Ric Edelman and Kim Komando, and assorted brokered programming.

Upon succeeding Clarence Campbell in 1977, he became the fourth president of the National Hockey League. Ziegler served as league president through 1992. His 15-year term was marked by the 1979 merger that integrated four teams from the rival World Hockey Association into the NHL, and by increasing labour unrest among the players. The first American to serve as chief executive of the NHL, he received the Lester Patrick Trophy in 1984 and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. Early life and career Born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan in 1934, John Augustus Ziegler, Jr. lived with his family in the Detroit area's northern, lakefront suburb of St. Clair Shores, graduating from Lake Shore High School in 1951. He would go on to attend the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, obtaining both an undergraduate degree and a graduate law degree, the latter in 1957. Before becoming National Hockey League President in 1977, Ziegler practiced law initially with the firm Dickson, Wright, McKean and Cudlip, in Detroit, Michigan, and after 1970 on his own. He was involved in the ownership of the Detroit Red Wings, and served one year as chairman of the NHL Board of Governors. Ziegler had also been the Vice-Chairman of the England-based London Lions independent professional ice hockey franchise. President of the National Hockey League Prior to the 1978‚Äì79 season, a failed manipulation of the waiver system by the Montreal Canadiens led Pierre Bouchard's rights to unintentionally move from Montreal to Washington. Montreal had intended to reclaim him, but Ziegler interfered in the deal. Initially unhappy with the move, Bouchard played only one game in the 1978‚Äì79 season and considered retirement. However, he returned next season to the NHL with Washington where he finished his career playing four seasons. Ziegler, along with Alan Eagleson, announced on August 6, 1979 that protective helmets would become mandatory in the NHL. The new rule had a grandfather clause that granted players who had signed pro contracts prior to June 1, 1979 the option of wearing helmets or not. Those who chose not to wear one signed liability waivers. =NHL‚ÄìWHA merger= Ziegler was the NHL's first American chief executive, and the American teams were far less hostile to the idea of a merger with the World Hockey Association than their Canadian counterparts. There were a number of reasons for this, but probably the most compelling was the Montreal Canadiens' dominance of the NHL during the years of the WHA's existence. The Canadiens won five of the seven Stanley Cups during this time, including four in a row from 1976 through 1979. Montreal owed this success in large part to its ability to resist WHA efforts to lure away its players, and many American teams believed they were able to do this because Canadian Hockey Night in Canada television revenues were mostly distributed among the three Canadian teams instead of across the league. Hence, adding Canadian teams would lessen the financial advantage that teams like the Canadiens had. Also, both NHL and WHA owners realized that the Canadian markets were a vital economic base, both to the WHA and any future rival league that might take its place. Absorbing the Canadian markets would therefore preclude the possibility of the NHL having to fight off another rival league. In June 1977, Ziegler announced that the NHL had created a committee to investigate the possibility of a merger, while Bill DeWitt, Jr., owner of the WHA's Cincinnati Stingers, stated that Ziegler had invited six teams to join the league for the 1977‚Äì78 season if various conditions could be met. The proposal would have seen the six teams become full members of the NHL, but play in their own division with a separate schedule for the first year. Led by Toronto's Harold Ballard, the owners voted down Ziegler's proposal. The Calgary Cowboys, who had hoped to be one of the six teams to join the NHL, subsequently folded, as did the Phoenix Roadrunners, Minnesota Fighting Saints, and San Diego Mariners. This reduced the junior league down to eight teams for the 1977‚Äì78 WHA season, and left its long-term future in doubt. The merger was completed in the 1979‚Äì80 season, with four WHA teams, the Edmonton Oilers, Winnipeg Jets, Hartford Whalers and Quebec Nordiques joining the NHL. =Suspensions handed out by Ziegler= Following a 4‚Äì3 Boston Bruins victory over the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden on December 23, 1979 an on-ice fray occurred between the players from both teams. During the fray, a Rangers fan cut the face of Bruins player Stan Jonathan with a rolled-up program and grabbed his hockey stick. Boston Bruin Terry O'Reilly climbed over the Plexiglas and went into the stands in pursuit of the offender, followed by fellow Bruin Peter McNab and other teammates. Another Bruin, Mike Milbury, who had actually reached the visitors locker room when his teammates started going into the stands, raced back to join his colleagues in the brawl. He caught the unruly spectator, removed one of his shoes and, while holding the heel end, hit him hard once with the sole side. Subsequently, Ziegler suspended O'Reilly for eight games and McNab and Milbury for six, with each being fined $500. This incident also resulted in the installation of higher glass panels enclosing rinks in hockey arenas.Seminara, Dave. \\"Over The Glass And Into Lore,\\" The New York Times, Wednesday, December 23, 2009. In December 1986, Los Angeles Kings head coach Pat Quinn signed a contract to become coach and general manager of the Vancouver Canucks with just months left on his Kings contract. Ziegler suspended Quinn for the rest of the season and barred him from taking over Vancouver's hockey operations until June. Ziegler also barred him from coaching anywhere in the NHL until the 1990‚Äì91 season. In Ziegler's view, Quinn's actions created a serious conflict of interest that could only be resolved by having him removed as coach. The 1988 Stanley Cup playoff series between the New Jersey Devils and Boston Bruins featured the infamous confrontation between Devils coach Jim Schoenfeld and referee Don Koharski after Game 3, when, during an argument in the tunnel after the game, Koharski tripped and fell, accusing Schoenfeld of pushing him. Schoenfeld famously responded, \\"Good, 'cause you fell you fat pig!\\" Then, he yelled \\"Have another doughnut! Have another doughnut!\\" The incident was played repeatedly on ESPN and has since become part of NHL lore. Schoenfeld was suspended by Ziegler for Game 4, but the Devils received an injunction from a New Jersey court, allowing Schoenfeld to coach the fourth game. In protest, the officials scheduled to work that game in the Meadlowands refused to take the ice, forcing the NHL to scramble for amateur officials to call the contest. The injunction was lifted and Schoenfeld served his suspension during Game 5 in the Boston Garden. In 1990, Edmonton Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr came forward about his drug use after spending two weeks in a counseling center in Florida. He admitted that he used \\"a substance\\"‚Äîhe did not say cocaine‚Äîfor some seven years, or most of the period that the Oilers rested at the top of the NHL. Details of Fuhr's drug use were supplied by the player's ex-wife, Corrine, who told the press in Edmonton that she often found cocaine hidden in his clothing and that she fielded numerous threatening telephone calls from drug dealers who had not been paid. These embarrassing details no doubt contributed to the one-year suspension handed down in September 1990 by Ziegler, who called Fuhr's conduct \\"dishonorable and against the welfare of the league.\\" Once Fuhr was re-instated, fans of opposing teams taunted him at games with bags of sugar. =Soviet players in the NHL= In 1987, the All-Star Game was pre- empted in favor of Rendez-vous '87, held at Le Colis√©e in Quebec City. Like the Challenge Cup before it, Rendez-Vous '87 was an event where the best the NHL could offer played against a Soviet squad which had an entire year to prepare. To reduce the possibility of the NHL being embarrassed again, Rendez- Vous '87 was a two-game affair. The series was split between the two teams with a game apiece. During the series, Ziegler stated that Soviet players would never be able to join the NHL because of the way the Soviet hockey programme worked, and that NHLers would never be able to play in the Winter Olympics, both of which, as events would turn out, would eventually happen. Pavel Bure was selected 113th overall in the 6th round of the 1989 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks, following his rookie season with CSKA Moscow. The pick was controversial, as the Canucks had chosen him seemingly a year ahead of his eligible draft season. At the age of 18, he was available to be chosen in the first three rounds of the draft, but in order to be selected any later than that, he would have to have played in at least two seasons (with a minimum of 11 games per season) for his elite-level European club, the Central Red Army. However, the Canucks' head scout at the time, Mike Penny, discovered that Bure had played in additional exhibition and international games to make him an eligible late-round draft choice a year early. Several other teams either had similar knowledge or had pursued Bure, but there was confusion as to the legitimacy of the extra games. The Detroit Red Wings had inquired to league vice president Gil Stein as to Bure's supposed availability prior to their fifth-round pick, but were told that he was not eligible.Banks 1999, pp. 30-37. Winnipeg Jets general manager Mike Smith claimed he travelled to Moscow prior to the draft and made an offer to the Soviet Ice Hockey Federation. The deal involved a transfer fee to be paid to the Soviets over three years, after which time, Bure would join the Jets as a 21-year-old. Smith did not have any plans to draft Bure in 1989, however, as he believed Bure was ineligible.Banks 1999, p. 34. General manager Pat Quinn originally intended to draft Bure in the eighth round, but after receiving word that the Edmonton Oilers had similar intentions, he selected him in the sixth. Detroit's European scout Christer Rockstr√∂m immediately began protesting, while several other unidentified team representatives reportedly stormed the Met Center stage in Minnesota, where the draft was being held, following the announcement of Bure's draft.Banks 1999, p. 30. The Hartford Whalers and Washington Capitals then filed formal complaints to the league, resulting in an investigation into the selection. After the pick was deemed illegal by league president Ziegler in a press release on May 17, 1990, the Canucks appealed the decision, procuring game sheets proving Bure's participation in the additional games with the help of recent Soviet acquisition Igor Larionov. It was not until the eve of the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, in which Bure would have been re-entered, that the draft choice was upheld. =Labor relations, ouster and aftermath= Bobby Orr was involved in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players' pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players to give up a seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: \\"Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players\\". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: \\"It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, as far as we can understand, have US$31.9 million.\\" The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case. Ziegler was ultimately forced out of office in 1992 by the settlement which resolved the ten-day strike. Alan Eagleson was succeeded as National Hockey League Players' Association executive-director on January 1, 1992 by former player agent Bob Goodenow. He had served as deputy director of the NHLPA since 1990, and had spent his time instructing the players on the issues the union faced in its relations with the league. As executive-director, Goodenow was tasked with negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, which had expired prior to the start of the 1991‚Äì92 NHL season. Goodenow met with Ziegler as the two attempted to negotiate an agreement on a range of issues including how free agency worked, the arbitration process, playoff bonuses and pensions. The issue of how to share trading card revenue was considered to be one of the greatest stumbling blocks the two sides faced. In Ziegler's last season at the helm of the NHL, the San Jose Sharks started play (which marked a return of the NHL to the San Francisco Bay area after a 15 year layoff), sparking the NHL's next expansion wave of the 1990s. Gary Bettman (the NHL's first commissioner), replaced John Ziegler's successor, Gil Stein. Bettman quickly accomplished one of his stated goals by signing a five- year, $155 million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to broadcast NHL games nationally beginning in the 1994‚Äì95 season. The deal was significant, as a network television contract in the United States was long thought unattainable during the presidency of Ziegler. Ziegler moved back to his legal career by practicing in Detroit, then as alternate Governor with the Chicago Blackhawkshttps://rdnewsnow.com/article/603471/cp-newsalert-former-nhl- president-john-ziegler-dead-84 before moving to Florida where he would remain until his death in 2018.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tcpalm/obituary.aspx?n=john-a- ziegler&pid;=190651857&fhid;=10593 References External links * * Sports Encyclopedia: Commissioners of the National Hockey League * John Ziegler Interview Part One: The Man Behind The Former NHL President * HOCKEY; Committee to Consider Ziegler's Status * Ziegler's NHL dream got burned in Sunbelt Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Hockey Hall of Fame inductees Category:Lester Patrick Trophy recipients Category:National Hockey League Commissioners Category:People from Grosse Pointe, Michigan Category:Michigan lawyers Category:Sportspeople from Michigan Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:University of Michigan alumni ","title":"John Ziegler Jr."},{"id":"6646213","text":"The 1920 Tube Stock consisted of forty cars built by Cammell Laird in Nottingham, England. These cars were the first new tube cars to be built with air operated doors. The batch consisted of twenty trailer and twenty control trailer cars, which were formed into six-car trains by the addition of twenty French motor cars built in 1906 and modified for air-door operation. They initially ran on the Piccadilly tube, but in 1930 were considered to be drab, compared to new stock being delivered at the time. The motor cars were therefore replaced by Standard Stock units, built in 1927, and the 1920 cars were refurbished. They were transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1932, and continued to operate until 1938. A second planned refurbishment so that they could be used on the Northern City Line shuttle service between Moorgate and Finsbury Park stations was interrupted by the Second World War, and after hostilities ceased, 35 of the cars were scrapped. The remaining five were formed into an instruction train, and were moved around the system to act as a mobile classroom until they were scrapped in 1968. Background Following the end of the First World War, consideration was given to how improvements to the service on the Underground could be improved. One of the main factors in the slow running of the service was the time taken at stations to close all the doors or gates. In order to address this issue, a batch of 20 trailer and 20 control trailer cars was ordered from Cammell Laird in 1919. These would be the first vehicles to be designed with air-operated doors. In order to make up complete trains of air-operated stock, twenty \\"Gate Stock\\" driving motor cars, built in France in 1906, were reconstructed with air doors, and were normally formed into six-car trains. The cars were the forerunners to the Standard Stock, which became the most prolific group of tube stock to operate on the system, thanks in part to the Trade Facilities Act 1921. This was a government initiative to fund projects which would create employment in the aftermath of the First World War, and enabled the Treasury to inject ¬£5 million into the Underground. Design Each of the new cars was equipped with four doors on each side, one at each end, and a pair of doors in the middle of the car, but unlike modern designs, they closed against a wide central pillar, rather than against each other. The centre doors were wide, while the end doors were only , and when they opened, they moved into a pocket between the outside of the car and the seats. In order to ensure that the opening was tall, the top of the door curved inwards, following the roof line. The doors were fitted with a sensitive edge, which prevented it from closing if someone was in the door opening. However, this proved to be too sensitive, and in order to maintain the advantage of shorter times at stations, was disabled after an initial trial period. Each door was controlled by an air engine, consisting of a large and a small cylinder, which were supplied with compressed air at . The air supply was controlled by an electrical valve. At stations, this was energised, which resulted in air in the large cylinder being exhausted, and the small cylinder then opened the door. When the train was ready to depart, the valve was de-energised, admitting air to the large cylinder, and the door closed. If the air supply failed, this arrangement allowed the door to be pushed back manually. Of the 20 French motor cars, the first two were converted by Cammell Laird. A pair of double doors were fitted in the centre of the car, and the end vestibule, which was originally fitted with gates, was enclosed and provided with a single door. These entered service in November 1920. The remaining 18 cars were adapted by Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, with the final one not completed until June 1924. There were differences in the implementation of the conversion, as the railway company was considering a plan to convert all of the gate stock cars to air-door operation, and this small batch provided an opportunity to experiment with what might be possible. On a gate stock train, each of the cars had its own conductor, who was responsible for the operation of the doors on that car. It was originally planned to work the air operated doors in a similar fashion, but the method adopted was for all the doors on a 3-car train to be controlled by a guard at the rear of the motor car. This reduced the number of staff needed to operate a 6-car train from seven to three, consisting of a driver, a rear guard and a front guard. Each guard controlled the doors on the three cars at his end of the train. The cars were initially fitted with yellow flipper arms, which protruded from the side of the vehicle when a door was open, and enabled staff to identify doors which had not yet closed. The design was unsatisfactory, and the arms were replaced by indicator lamps interlocked to the air engines in 1924. Traction control circuits and door operating circuits were carried along the train by 10-core jumpers fitted at roof height between the cars. There were two lighting circuits, one fed from each of the motor cars. It was possible to operate a 3-car train, but in order to do so, a shorting plug had to be fitted to the control trailer, to connect the lighting circuits, and to complete the door interlock circuit. Operation The cars were initially used on the Piccadilly tube. The trailer cars were numbered 800-819, the converted motor cars were 480-499, and the control trailers were initially 700-719, but were renumbered to 1700-1719 in 1926. The trailers became 1316-1335 and the control trailers 2043-2062 in 1930, and in 1934, following the formation of London Transport and the introduction of a standard numbering scheme, the trailers became 7230-7249, while the control trailers were given the numbers 5170-5189. The cars were considered to be drab, when compared with new stock being delivered to the Hampstead Line around 1930, and they were refurbished. As built the cars had longitudinal seating through the length of the car, providing seats for 44 passengers. As part of the refurbishment, the central bay was fitted with transverse seats, increasing the capacity to 48, and armrests were fitted to the remaining seats. The cement floors were replaced by wooden slat flooring, and the lighting was improved. Changes were also made to the couplers between the cars, and the air-doors on the driving cabs of the control trailers were replaced by swing doors. The 1906 motor cars were withdrawn, and the trains were completed by the addition of Standard Stock motor cars, built by the Metropolitan Carriage & Wagon Company in 1927. At the time, the Piccadilly line was being extended, with the extensions involving open-air running, and the 1920 stock was unsuitable for use in wet conditions. It was therefore transferred to the Bakerloo line between January and October 1932. Following the introduction of the 1929/30 batch of Standard Stock, which was the first to be fitted with electro-pneumatic brakes, a decision was taken to convert all of the Standard Stock to use this system. Most had been fitted with the new equipment by 1936, but the exceptions were the motor cars running with the 1920 stock. These were not converted until 1938 when the 1920 stock was withdrawn from passenger service. Following withdrawal, two of the French motor cars were adapted so that they could be used as single cars on the Aldwych Shuttle service from Holborn to Aldwych. Others became part of the engineering stock, working as ballast motor cars. The 1920 stock cars were retired from service in 1938. It was intended to recondition them, and use them on the Northern City Line shuttle from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, but the onset of the Second World War prevented that, and they were stored at Cockfosters Depot. After the war ended, 35 of them were sold for scrap, and the remaining five became an instruction train for the Chief Mechanical Engineer. The cars were renumbered IC1075-1079, and the train was moved from depot to depot by ballast motor cars or battery locomotives. It continued to serve its training function until it was scrapped in 1968.

It features Sellers acting the role of an Indian doctor, and Loren of his wealthy Italian patient ‚Äì who fall in love  Conception and composition  The song was conceived and instigated by George Martin, who was the producer at that time of Peter Sellers's comedy recordings. Martin commissioned David Lee and Herbert Kretzmer to write the song. Martin himself produced the recording. Martin envisaged the song as a recording to be incorporated in the soundtrack of the film The Millionairess which was being filmed at that time starring Sellers and Loren. However, the film's producers did not share his enthusiasm for including the song in the film's soundtrack and did not utilize it. The studio was however happy to see the song released as a stand-alone single to promote the film. In becoming a chart hit it succeeded in publicizing the film.  Release history  Though the song did not feature in The Millionairess itself, some of the lyrics in the song refer to the film; for example, \\"There's nothing the matter with it; put it away please\\" referring to the scene when Epifania shows Dr. Kabir her tongue, pretending to be ill. The song proved so popular in the United Kingdom that a follow-up song, \\"Bangers and Mash\\", was released. Sellers sang and spoke the part of a Cockney asking for plain and simple English cooking, Loren singing the part of his Italian wife wanting to serve him traditional Italian food. Both are featured on collections of Sellers' comedy recordings.

Stamford Hospital is a major teaching affiliate of the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians & Surgeons. History Founding and early historyalt= John Clasen, a farmer and former state legislator, town assessor and school board member, is credited with the founding of Stamford Hospital. After consultation with his friend and attorney, Edwin L. Scofield (later the second mayor of Stamford), regarding possible philanthropies, he gave the initial funding for the hospital by selling some of his property. Clasen raised about $45,000 from the sale of the property. Clasen's only conditions for the money were that the new institution would be named Stamford Hospital, be nonsectarian and not discriminate in receiving patients. Subsequently, the hospital opened with 30 beds on May 7, 1896 in a mansion on East Main Street, just west of the railroad bridge.

Geibel, chief administrator of the hospital from 1954 to 1977, oversaw significant change and growth of the hospital, specifically from 1966 to 1969, with the construction of the hospital's signature white pavilion wing designed by Perkins & Will. From 1994 to 2000, the hospital had significant financial difficulties, but the hospital's finances began to improve under CEO Brian Grissler, with revenues in 2007 of $357 million. \\\\ In early 2006, the hospital actively considered moving to a new, undetermined site and construct a new hospital in order to enlarge hospital rooms (which were approximately half the size of those of more modern hospitals), as well as expand and modernize clinical departments (particularly the emergency department, critical care units and cardiac labs). However, this proposal was scrapped in favor of building a large expansion. The expansion of the hospital, dubbed \\"New Stamford Hospital\\" resulted in a large 11 story glass structure, becoming the dominant portion of the hospital. This expansion was completed late 2016 and cost approximately 575 Million dollars.Sullivan, Eve, \\"Stamford Hospital breaks ground on new building\\", news article, Business section, The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, May 15, 2013Porstner, Donna, \\"Stamford to get $7M from feds\\", The Advocate of Stamford, Connecticut, Stamford edition, p. 1 The Perkins & Will white pavilion building is largely vacant, with its future plans to be determined. Stamford Health as an organization has expanded significantly since 2010, now with a large affiliated medical staff, Stamford Health Medical Group. In that same time, Stamford Health has opened numerous small outpatient clinical, laboratory and imaging facilities spanning throughout Fairfield County and southwestern Connecticut. Facilities Stamford Hospital's Carl and Dorothy Bennett Medical Center is located in the southwestern portion of Stamford, CT, adjacent to downtown and near the waterfront. The campus has facilities that provide both inpatient and outpatient care. The hospital structure is composed of various wings, including the new main hospital, the original Perkins & Will pavilion, Warner and Wheeler wings, was well as the Whittingham Pavilion. Adjoined to the main structure is the outpatient Bennett Cancer Center as well as the Medical Office Building (M.O.B.). The Tandet Center, previously a nursing home, is currently used for administrative purposes, including housing the affiliated Sacred Heart University Physician Assistant training program. Carl and Dorothy Bennett Cancer Center The Carl and Dorothy Bennett Cancer Center opened in 1992, offering access to oncologists, oncology nurses, a team of professionals and treatment options and supportive services. It was the first facility in Connecticut selected to join the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Care Collaborative. The Bennett Center offers the full array of cancer care specialists, including Medical Oncology, Radiation Oncology, Interventional Radiology/Oncology as well as ancillary staff such as Geneticists. The staff participates in multiple ongoing scientific studies for researching advanced therapies for cancer. Hospital for Special Surgery In 2018, Stamford Hospital and HSS opened a collaborative unit within the main hospital, staffed by HSS orthopedic and sports medicine physicians. This unit offers separate dedicated clinic and operating room space. In addition, there is increased cooperation between HSS staff and Stamford Health at Stamford's Chelsea Piers facility, specifically for sports rehabilitation. Cohen Children's Specialty Center at Stamford Hospital An extensive pediatric ward within Stamford hospital, the Cohen Children's Center provides all branches of pediatric medicine and surgery.

The collective First Nations are Ojibway (Anishinaabe) peoples located on the eastern shores of Lake Huron on the Bruce Peninsula in Ontario, Canada. Though predominantly Ojibway, due to large influx of refugees from the south and west after the War of 1812, the descendants of the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory also have ancestry traced to Odawa and Potawatomi peoples. Consequently, though only two First Nation governments are successors apparent, there are seven different First Nation communities who lived, fished, hunted and traded in Saugeen Ojibway Territory. The story of each of their communities from past to present realities are best told by their own people. Oral tradition carries those stories and their descendants are still alive. History =Origins= At one time, both by oral history and archaeological evidence, all of the modern Bruce Peninsula (or the \\"Saugeen Peninsula\\" as referred by the Ojibway) was home to the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory. From time immemorial, hunting and fishing were plentiful in this area. Archaeologist are able to find arifacts from Early Woodland Period (1000 BCE to 1000 CE) calling the culture that left artifacts in the Saugeen Ojibway Territory as the Saugeen Culture. Other than pottery, the projectile points called Saugeen Point are typical characteristics of the Saugeen culture. Consequently, associated with both the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory and the Saugeen Culture peoples were winter camps around Owen Sound, Cape Croker and the Collingwood area, as well as summer camps in Walkerton, Wiarton, Goderich, Tobermory and Red Bay. Traditional territory also included all of the Saugeen River watershed. Thus, places such as Tobermory, Meaford, Goderich, Cape Croker, Owen Sound and Orangeville are located in the traditional Saugeen Ojibway Nation Territory. The permanent settlement at the outlet of the Saugeen River which lent its name to the region and its people was called Zaagiing, meaning \\"at the river's outlet,\\" i.e. \\"at the mouth of the river. The Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory are a member of the Council of Three Fires of the Ojibway, Odawa and Potawatomi Nations. The Confederacy came to help in the Battle of Skull Mound and in the Battle of Blue Mountain. Though the Council of Three Fires often fought against the Iroquois Confederacy (or the Naadowe as they are called in the Anishinaabe language), the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory peacefully shared the territory with the Wyandotte/Wendat Nation who also made the area their home. The Ojibway Nation called the Wendat peoples Nii'inaa-Naadowe (\\"The 'Nadowe' within our homeland\\"), but the French referred to them as \\"Huron\\" and lent their name to the Lake. People from many nations moved into Saugeen Ojibway Territory after the War of 1812. They came from Ohio and from the State of New York. As a result of the American Indian Removal Policies of the 1830s more people came from Michigan and Wisconsin. Some were on their way to the Manitoulin Island project. Some moved from Coldwater on the Narrows. Others came from the Toronto and Niagara regions after European and Loyalist newcomers affected their territory. Due to these influxes of people from other areas, the history of the original Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory is often confused with that of other Anishinaabeg who settled in Saugeen Ojibway Territory after the American Revolution. In addition, often confused together are the histories of those Anishinaabeg who settled in Cape Croker in 1854 with the history of the original Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory. =Treaties= One of the earliest documents recognizing Nation to Nation relations between the Crown and Indigenous peoples, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 stated \\"Indian land\\" could only be sold to the Crown. However, the document did not differentiate between those who were the original resident of the land cession in question and those who settled as part of the refugee migration, which has caused long-held animosity among the Anishinaabe communities located in the Saugeen Ojibway Territory. In the Saugeen Surrenders, due to development pressures of the European Canadians, mainly in the form of farming, the Saugeen and Owen Sound Indian Reserve was ceded to The Crown. However, five smaller areas were reserved for the Chippewas of the Saugeen Ojibway Territory. Member First Nations =Saugeen First Nation= : Main article: see Saugeen First Nation The major Successor Inherent to the original people of the Chippewas of Saugeen Ojibway Territory is that of the Saugeen First Nation, as told in the stories of the community that is known as Chippewa Hill.

The building was 14 floors tall, with one basement floor, and 13 above-ground floors.The office building was designed in the neo-classical architecture style by C. Howard Crane who built many of Detroit's theaters. It is built with mainly brick, limestone, and terra cotta. Its triangular form mimicked the Flatiron Building in Manhattan.Compare, The building contained of frontage along Michigan Avenue, of frontage along Shelby Street, of frontage along Lafayette Boulevard, and was in length along its east facade which stood mid-block. After years of mismanagement, and a declining tenant base, the building was finally shuttered in 1997.

September 30, 2009. Retrieved on October 1, 2009. History In the 1970s and 1980s, the Michigan Supreme Court, the Supreme Court Administrator's Office, the Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission and parts of the 36th District Court of Detroit had space in the building. Preservationists unsuccessfully tried to place the Lafayette Building on the National Register of Historic Places. They were unable also to secure tax credits or find a purchaser. In a cruel irony (for preservationists), it was said that efforts to preserve the Book-Cadillac Hotel dissipated support and contributed to its demolition.  Redevelopment plans  Graffiti on Lafayette Building windows while not in use The Peebles Atlantic Development Corporation announced on December 15, 2005, that it planned to convert the Lafayette into one of Detroit's premier condominium buildings at a cost of more than $40 million. The residential conversion would have included refurbishing the historical exterior and the interior, which would have included 125 modern units with upscale amenities such as a fitness center and ground floor commercial space. The renovation of this building was slated to start in the summer of 2006 with a completion sometime in the summer of 2007. However, the developer failed to come through with the money and the building remained abandoned. The Ferchill Group, which developed the Westin Book Cadillac, and Dan Gilbert of Quicken Loans were touted as possible saviors. However, they bowed out, citing prohibitive cost of renovation. However, some critics said that money spent on demolition should have been used to secure the building and remove graffiti. \\"Their solution was like saying, 'Oh my God, there's a fly on the wall. Quick, grab the sledgehammer.'\\" On November 13, 2007, the City of Detroit offered Quicken Loans the Lafayette Building for $1 as part of their major redevelopment of downtown Detroit. Quicken had a year to choose the site of their headquarters (Hudson or Statler/Tuller Blocks) and to study the redevelopment of two parking lots on Library and Broadway and the Lafayette Building. If redeveloped, the two parking lots and the Lafayette Building were to become a mixed-use building of retail, offices, and residential space. Plans fell through when Quicken decided to relocate only a portion of its staff downtown into the Compuware Building. On December 9, 2008, the City of Detroit issued a request for environmental consulting services to prepare for the demolition of the building. Demolition Demolition barricades around street level in autumn 2009. On March 26, 2009, Detroit‚Äôs Downtown Development Authority announced it was seeking bids to demolish the Lafayette Building. Despite earlier redevelopment plans, the building remained vacant for more than a decade and was heavily vandalized and neglected; trees were even growing from its roof. Bids for the demolition work were due by early April 2009. However, shortly after the deadline came, Detroit Mayor Kenneth Cockrel, Jr. canceled demolition plans due to a public outcry to save the landmark. The future for the Lafayette Building was still uncertain, as this was a temporary halt. On June 25, 2009, Detroit's Downtown Development Authority voted unanimously to destroy the Lafayette Building. The DDA voted to give the demolition contract to Detroit-based Adamo Demolition. for a lump sum amount of $1,445,888, according to an article in the Detroit Free Press. On July 12, 2009 it was disclosed in the Detroit newspapers that local developer Dionysia Properties LLC, which has developed six loft projects around the city in recent years, had asked Detroit city officials to give it two weeks to conduct a structural inspection of the Lafayette Building in hopes of saving it. But, on August 15, 2009, it was announced that Dionysia Properties LLC failed to obtain a reprieve for the Lafayette Building, and demolition moved forward. The pile of rubble that used to be the Lafayette Building. Demolition started on October 12, 2009. Demolition proceeded slowly throughout November and December 2009 and January 2010. On February 24, 2010, at 4:30 AM EST, the east tower of the 14-story portion of the building was leveled to the ground when it twisted towards the north and then collapsed resulting in smoke blanketing the surrounding block. The only remaining portion of the building is a pile of rubble. Demolition is completed. The site will become a pocket park with grass & landscaping until future development takes its place. The historic Lafayette and American Coney Island restaurants were not affected by the demolition.

Using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests, '\\"Selection cutting\\"', also known as 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture', manages the establishment, continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes (usually three, but 5 or even 10 are possible) of trees within a stand. A closely related approach to forest management is Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF), which makes use of selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular stand structure. Selection cutting or systems are generally considered to be more challenging to implement and maintain than even-aged management, due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space, but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it. Uneven-aged stands generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure (key for many species of birds and mammals), have higher levels of carbon sequestration, and produce a more constant flow of market and non-market forest resources than even-aged stands. Although a forest composed of many stands with varied maturity ages maybe comparable, this would be at the forest rather than the stand level. This silvicultural method also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even-aged silviculture, including nutrient loss, erosion and soil compaction and the rapid loss of organic material from a forested system. Selection silviculture is especially adept at regenerating shade-tolerant species of trees (those able to function under conditions of low solar energy, both cooler and less light), but can also be modified to suit the regeneration and growth of intolerant and mid-tolerant species. This is one of many different ways of harvesting trees. Selection cutting as a silvicultural system can be modified in many ways and would be so done be a forester to take into account varied ownership goals, local site conditions and the species mix found from past forest conditions.Silviculture: Concepts and Applications 2nd Edition by Ralph D. Nyland Confusing term Selection cutting is often (sometimes deliberately) confused with \\"selective\\" cutting, a term synonymous with the practice of highgrading (the removal of the most economically profitable trees in a forest, often with a disregard for the future of the residual stand). Often the latter term is used by foresters or loggers to imply the former (which has a generally positive connotation in forestry circles) and mislead landowners into stripping their woodlot of its most valuable timber. Used correctly, the term 'selection cutting', 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture' implies the implementation of specific silvicultural techniques‚Äîusually either 'single tree selection', 'group selection' or a combination of the two‚Äîto create an uneven-aged or all-aged condition in a forest stand, one more akin to a late successional or 'climax' condition.McEvoy, T.J. 2004. Positive Impact Forestry - A Sustainable Approach to Managing Woodlands. Island Press, New York, DC. 268p. Partly as a result of such confusion, the term Plenterwald, which is the German term for selection cutting, is being more commonly used as the standard term in English.6 TECHNICAL CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x4109e/X4109E07.htm Increasingly, especially in Britain, Ireland and elsewhere in Europe, the term Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF) has been adopted to embrace an approach to stand management that most often employs selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular stand structure. Single-tree selection The most common type of selection system is single-tree selection, in which scattered individual trees of multiple age classes, whose canopies are not touching, are harvested. This type of selection system generally produces small canopy openings especially conducive to the establishment and growth of shade tolerant tree species. Group selection Another variation of selection silviculture is group selection. Under this system, a number of 'groups', or small openings created by the removal of several adjacent trees, are created in complement to the harvest of scattered individual trees. If the groups created are large enough, and if seed-bed conditions are favorable, this can allow species which are intolerant of shade to regenerate. Group selection is designed to mimic larger, multi-tree mortality events, which in some environments may represent natural disturbance regimes. The maximum size of a group (before it becomes a patch, or clearcut) is debatable. Some say it may be up to 2 acres (0.8 hectares) in size, whereas others limit it to a maximum of 0.5 acres (0.1 hectares). In any case Plenterwald can operate in a small areas of 1/3 - 1/2 hectare, whereas other systems need a bigger area.Die Plenterung und ihre unterschiedlichen Formen Skript zu Vorlesung Waldbau II und Waldbau IV J.-Ph. Sch√ºtz; Professur Waldbau ETH Zentrum 8092 Z√ºrich 2002 Behind this is the philosophical idea that a stand should be balanced (that is equal amounts of land cover for each age class) in the same way that a forest would be balanced under a clear cut r√©gime (that is stands collectively are balanced on yield flow). The reasoning is based on the Normalwald concept, which is a model of a forest over 100 years that will produce an amount of money that is consistent over time with treatments being consistent over time rather than big expenses or big profits at one time and low expenses and low profits at another.Silviculture: Concepts and Applications Chapter 10. Selection system and its application 2nd Edition by Ralph D. Nyland Care need to be taken to avoid epicormic shoots growing on trunks of surrounding trees such that they lead to knotty wood, if timber production is desired. It is also challenging to visualize the groups with cuttings over time.Group-selection-Problems and possibilities for the more shade-intolerant species. Murphy et al. in Gillespie et al (Eds.) Proceedings of the Ninth Central Hardwood Forest Conference pg 229-247 USFS Gen. Tech, Report NC-161 Implementing A Selection System In North America, trees are selected for harvest in a selection system with reference to the Arbogast Method (named after the method's creator ). This is also known as the BDq method. Under this method, a harvest is specified by defining a residual basal area (B), a maximum diameter (D), and a q-ratio (q). The q-ratio is the ratio of the number of trees in a diameter class to the number of trees in the next larger class. Typically diameter classes are either 4 centimeters or 2 inches. When the Q is plotted on semi- log paper it gives a straight slope for uneven aged stands. However, in reality this slope can be seen to vary from what is called an S-curve in old growth forests to cut off the older trees giving a reverse-J curve in a managed stand. The curve is also an ideal curve and there may be variations to some extent, particularly in earlier number of trees where there are many more seedlings and saplings than the model Q-ratio would suggest. Given the BDq, a curve representing the state of the residual stand is computed. This curve is compared to the inventory data from a stand, specifically the curve of the diameter classes of the trees in the stand against the number of trees in each diameter (age) class. Diameter is used as a surrogate for age and thus called an age class even though strictly it should be a size class. The comparison of these two curves tells the forester how many trees of each age-class should remain in the stand. Surplus trees are marked for harvest. If there are too few trees in a class, the forester will determine if it is necessary to reduce the removal of trees from neighboring classes to maintain an ideal q-ratio.Silviculture: Concepts and Applications Chapter 10. Selection system and its application 2nd Edition by Ralph D. Nyland The goal of the use of a BDq curve is to ensure the continued development of trees in each age class, and the continued availability of mature timber to harvest on a relatively short cutting cycle (8‚Äì15 years). Longer cutting cycles may be used depending on species mix, silvicultural goals and if the aim is amenity or economic forestry in respect to the land. Following this method with well performed forest inventories should see the right amount of cutting. However, reality has shown about a third of forests are overcut and a third are undercut. It appears that the model also departs from reality in many cases, and so cannot be solely relied on. The judgement of an experienced forester is also needed.Tech study questions whether forestry standards are followed May 30, 2014 Dan Roblee, The Daily Mining Gazette See also *Ecoforestry *Patch cut *Shelterwood cutting References Category:Forest management ","title":"Selection cutting"},{"id":"6646422","text":"New York State Route 313 (NY 313) and Vermont Route 313 (VT 313) are a pair of like-numbered state highways in New York and Vermont in the United States, that meet at the state line.

At the intersection with Covered Bridge Road, VT 313 enters West Arlington, Vermont, which is slightly more developed than the area surrounding it. In West Arlington, VT 313 makes a dive to the south in direction. Passing through a relatively stable environment of woodlands and clearings, the highway begins to turn to the southeast again. After a couple of turns, VT 313 passes the Arlington Recreational Park, and enters the town of Arlington, Vermont. View east along VT 313 between Historic VT 7A and US 7 in Arlington In Arlington, VT 7A (the Ethan Allen Highway) intersects and becomes concurrent with VT 313\\\\. The two highways turn to the south and head through downtown Arlington. East Arlington Road intersects and begins to parallel the highways as they progress southward. In the community of East Arlington, VT 313 and VT 7A split, heading to the east and south respectively. VT 313 then begins its final stretch of highway, heading through woodlands once again, and reaching its final intersection, which is with South Road. After that, VT 313 terminates at an interchange with US 7 in East Arlington. The right-of-way for VT 313 continues after the interchange to a dead end as Orvis Road.  History  NY 313 was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. There was initially no matching route on the Vermont side of the highway; however, the east‚Äìwest highway connecting U.S. Route 7 (now VT 7A) in Arlington to New York State Route 313 at the New York state line was added to the Vermont state highway system as part of the 1935 state highway system expansion and initially designated as VT 123. The route became part of VT 11 by 1938, which was then co-designated as VT 313 from New York to Arlington by 1940. VT 11 was truncated to Manchester between 1947 and 1952, leaving only the VT 313 designation on the New York ‚Äì Arlington highway. In the late 1970s, US 7 was realigned onto a new limited-access highway through most of southwestern Vermont. The new highway bypassed Arlington to the east. In 1978, VT 313 was extended eastward by way of VT 7A and a new roadway to meet the new routing of US 7.

Edward Vander Pyle or Mr. Vander Pyle. In addition to his ring persona, he is the General Manager of the NWA Pro group located in Southern California. Career =Pre-Wrestling= Before entering the wrestling business Marty Lurie spent considerable time in the music business as a producer and road manager for Chicago, Illinois based independent acts such as Chris Prchal and Mugs Alley. He toured throughout the Midwest with Certain Distant Suns in various roles. In addition to music, he was involved in several independent film projects. It was at this time he met professional wrestler Adam Pearce. =Early career= Shortly after Marty moved to Los Angeles, California Adam Pearce requested that he create a ring name to become his new wrestling manager. Pearce had become disappointed with the direction professional wrestling had taken and took a long hiatus from performing. After watching several tapes of his favorite wrestlers and realizing that most of the great old school heels had managers by their side, Adam decided that was what he was missing. Marty accepted the offer and C. Edward Vander Pyle was born. Mr. Vander Pyle debuted alongside Adam Pearce at a small show in a San Diego ocean front bar that had a total of 4 paid fans in attendance. The debut was an interruption of a match followed by a self- interview in which Adam introduced Vander Pyle to the world. In their debut match, Mr. Vander Pyle managed Adam Pearce and Primetime Peterson against Al Katrazz and Jason Allgood in a main event for Lemon Grove, CA based WCWA. The next show saw Mr. Vander Pyle capture the WCWA Heavyweight Title from Al Katrazz due to a 24/7 stipulation in which the champion could be pinned by anyone at any time. 18.4 seconds after capturing the title, Vander Pyle lost it to Jason Allgood marking it one of professional wrestling‚Äôs shortest title reigns. Vander Pyle went on to bigger success in the early days of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla as a featured player alongside Pearce as well as Hardkore Inc. members Aaron Aguilera and Al Katrazz and Pearce‚Äôs longtime friend from Chicago, \\"Classic\\" Colt Cabana. In addition to their PWG exploits Pearce and Vander Pyle began to cause havoc in Newhall, CA‚Äôs APW-LA and Tijuana, Mexico‚Äôs Promociones XLUM. Lucha Libre does not have managers and Vander Pyle‚Äôs presence, along with his carrying of a U.S. Flag and broken Spanish on the mic, added to the immense heat his group generated. During a sold out show in el Auditorio de Tijuana over 5,500 fans rained garbage on the Vander Pyle led American group The San Diego Horsemen nearly causing a full blown riot. =2004‚Äì2005= Early 2004 saw a brief split between Pearce and Vander Pyle. Marty‚Äôs mother had contracted lung cancer and he took time off from wrestling to be with her. When he returned, to the shock of Southern California fans, it was not by Adam‚Äôs side but rather in the corner of Pearce‚Äôs rival Babi Slymm. Vander Pyle and Slymm were eventually joined by Frankie Kazarian, Scott Lost and Marty‚Äôs friend and fellow Northern Illinois University graduate Brad Bradley as the short lived First Family. Vander Pyle and Slymm moved on to Bart Kapitzke‚Äôs Alternative Wrestling Show in City of Industry, CA. Slymm defeated Pearce to capture the first ever AWS Heavyweight Championship in an AWS Idol Match in which Slymm and Pearce sang to the crowd before fighting. Hosted by Jason Allgood the judges were Al Katrazz, Nikki T and Vander Pyle. Vander Pyle went on to lead Slymm in successful defenses against Joey Ryan, American Dragon, B-Boy, Scorpio Sky, Scott Lost and more before turning on Babi Slymm with the returning Adam Pearce (under a hood as Masked Spymaster #2). Pearce took the title from Slymm before losing it to the Human Tornado who then lost it to the Vander Pyle led Al Katrazz. Vander Pyle held the distinction of managing 3 of the 4 men who had held the belt when Al Katrazz won the title. In addition to being part of the main feuds in the ring at AWS, backstage Marty was instrumental in associating AWS with David Marquez‚Äôs NWA Pro group. This allowed for a new talent exchange that helped AWS showcase wrestlers from throughout the globe who were in town to train at NWA Pro and New Japan Pro Wrestling‚Äôs LA Inoki Dojo. Vander Pyle had the distinction of being the first American manager to appear on New Japan Pro Wrestling TV in nearly 20 years as he appeared at their Toukon 7https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0453520 special taped in Los Angeles. Off screen Marty was a part of the production team for both Toukon 7 special and the NJPW \\"Toukon Fighting Spirit\\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421106 TV show. Back in the ring, Vander Pyle was a part of one of UPW‚Äôs largest events ever entitled Overloadhttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476605 as he managed Adam Pearce against Diamond Dallas Page at Buffalo Bill's Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. =2006= Marty served in the role of Talent Coordinator for MTV‚Äôs \\"Wrestling Society X\\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0932906 first and only season. When UPW returned to smaller shows in 2006, Vander Pyle began to manage Joey Ryan in a series of matches in which they tested the top UPW students. Vander Pyle also became one of very few modern managers to work both coasts as he worked the inaugural Liberty States Wrestling (later called NWA New Jersey and NWA On Fire) events in Lodi, New Jersey and Lowell, Massachusetts. At AWS, Vander Pyle was involved in the long-standing feud between Adam Pearce and Aaron Aguilera and their allies. The highlight of the feud included: a 4-on-4 War Games match where Team El Jefe(Aguilera, Human Tornado, Babi Slymm and Sexy Chino) defeated Team Vander Pyle(Pearce, Al Katrazz, Crayz and Plague); a manager/wrestler mixed tag team match of Pearce and Vander Pyle against Aguilera and El Jefe in which Jefe pinned Vander Pyle; and a Strap Match where Aguilera vanquished Pearce once and for all leading to another break-up between Pearce and Vander Pyle. =2007= In February, Vander Pyle and Pearce reunited at NWA Pro's Fiesta Luchahttp://www.bigvisionentertainment.com/store/wrestling/fiesta.php at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas, NV. Vander Pyle helped Pearce keep the NWA Heritage Championship in a match against Canada's Nelson Creed. Later in the evening Pearce and Vander Pyle interfered on behalf of Joey Ryan and Karl Anderson's Real American Heroes in their Flag Match against Mexico's Los Luchas (Phoenix Star and Zokre). Vander Pyle distracted referee Scotty DeMarco while Pearce broke a flag pole over Zokre's back allowing Ryan to get the pinfall. A YouTube upload of this match has been viewed over 300,000 times.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqcpAjEKemA With three main wrestlers in stable, Vander Pyle stayed very busy at NWA Pro arena shows across the country and particularly in Texas. Pearce feuded with Sean 'X-Pac' Waltman trading the Heritage Title at events in El Paso, TX and Laredo, TX. Ryan and Anderson continued their feud with Los Luchas including matches in Phoenix, AZ, Orlando, FL and throughout Texas and California. An extremely notable match from this period saw Ryan, Anderson and Vander Pyle incite a riot at Plaza San Miguel in Houston, TX before their scheduled match with √öltimo Drag√≥n and TJ Perkins. On a rodeo arena floor covered in dirt and rocks and with no guardrails, chairs or ringside security, the mostly Mexican crowd of over 5,000 showered the Americans as well as ring announcer Andy Schmitz and referee Joe Furrer with rocks, bottles and more. At point blank range and with no one to stop them, the barrage of trash from the crowd was too much for the wrestlers to handle as they fought their way back to the locker room. Dragon and Perkins signed autographs for over ten minutes while referee Jesse Hernandez pleaded with the crowd to calm down and let the event continue. After the NWA ended their relationship with TNA Wrestling on May 13, 2007https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly1J5IUw1d0 both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Tag Team Championship were declared vacant. C. Edward Vander Pyle pulled off the incredible feat of becoming manager of both championships. First he led the team of Joey Ryan and Karl Anderson to victory in a 3 team gauntlet match in McAllen, TX over the team of Incognito and Sicodelico, Jr. and then the team of Sean Waltman and Billy Kidman. Vander Pyle then led Adam Pearce to a controversial victory in the Reclaiming the Glory 16-man tournament for the NWA World Heavyweight Title. Pearce won his first round match against longtime rival Aaron Aguilera in Lodi, NJ and his second round match against Chad Parham at an Empire Wrestling Federation event in Covina, CA. Pearce then lost his third round contest to Bryan Danielson in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada but advanced to the finals when Danielson suffered an eye injury a week before he could fight for the title. Pearce went on to defeat Brent Albright in Bayam√≥n, Puerto Rico with Vander Pyle's assistance to claim the title.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAo-EEqa_NM Vander Pyle led his champions to several successful title defenses throughout the rest of the year. Pearce defended the World Title against challengers such as Sean Waltman, Sicodelico, Jr., Lil' Cholo and more. Ryan and Anderson defended against Los Luchas, TNT (Brandon Gatson and Johnny Dynamite), The Young Bucks and more. Ryan, Anderson and Vander Pyle also travelled to Perth, Western Australia to defend against top Aussie fighters Hartley Jackson and Shane Haste. =2008= Despite his best efforts, Vander Pyle's Real American Heroes team of Ryan and Anderson finally lost the NWA World Tag Team Titles to Los Luchas at a NWA Wrestling Showcasehttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228888 taping at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas, NV. Shortly after this loss, Karl Anderson was offered a contract with New Japan Pro Wrestling leaving the Vander Pyle family with only two main wrestlers. Adam Pearce continued a series of successful title defenses against wrestlers such as Shane Haste, Scorpio Sky, Lil' Cholo, Matt Jackson, SoCal Crazy, Tommy Wilson, TJ Perkins and primarily Brent Albright. the Pearce and Albright feud extended past the NWA and into Ring of Honor Wrestling where Pearce had no manager. Thus Vander Pyle was not there when Pearce lost and regained the championship against Albright. Vander Pyle was in Pearce's corner when he lost the championship a second time in Mexico City, Mexico to the legendary Blue Demon, Jr. in controversial fashion. As Demon held Pearce in a single leb crab hold, Pearce's arm stretched under the bottom rope which should have constituted a clean break. Despite Vander Pyle's protests, the referee would not check the arm in question as Pearce passed out and lost the championship.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXPx_dEfx-E Joey Ryan and Vander Pyle went through a series of potential replacements for Anderson, but never settled on a full-time partner. Ryan also had several singles matches including a huge victory over TNA star Frankie Kazarian. However Vander Pyle could not manage to get a championship on Joey as they fell short in attempts at the AWS Championship, the EWF Championship and even a shot at Blue Demon after his victory over Pearce. =2009= 2009 saw Vander Pyle's main two wrestlers attempting to get back into title contention by facing any and all upcoming wrestlers. Though rarely teaming together, Pearce and Ryan feuded with many of the same fighters including Johnny Yuma, Willie Mack, Johnny Goodtime and more. Ryan also feuded with James Morgan in NWA associate Mach One Wrestling over their Championship and scored a big victory over Scotty II Hotty at the Long Beach Comic Con thanks to Vander Pyle's shenanigans. Pearce and Vander Pyle continued their quest for Blue Demon by teaming with Oliver John against Demon and Incognito in Pearce and Vander Pyle's return to Tijuana.http://www.prowrestling-revolution.com/2009/11/29/revolution-at-el- palenque-de-tijuana =2010= Vander Pyle added a new member to his wrestling family when he became the manager of Ricky Mandel at NWA's SoCal Pro Wrestling in Oceanside, CA. Vander Pyle has been instrumental in keeping Mandel's former tag team partner Hector Canales away from him allowing Mandel to pursue the SCP Championship. In a strange turn of events, Vander Pyle and Joey Ryan found themselves being cheered by fans at Mach One Wrestling's weekly Friday Fight Night in Anaheim, CA after standing up to Australian upstart Bobby Marshall. Adam Pearce and Vander Pyle continue to plan their attack on Blue Demon in an attempt to regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

Biography Stryker began his radio career while attending the University of Arizona where he was a member of the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. During those six and a half years, he began working at 92.1 KFMA in Tucson, Arizona, taking his air name from Robert Hays' character in the movie Airplane!. He eventually moved back to Los Angeles, California, and worked at KROQ-FM 106.7 FM as a music DJ from 4pm to 7pm (PST). From September 4, 2007 to September 9, 2008 he was the on- stage DJ for the 5th season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Stryker voiced the in-game radio disc jockey (\\"The Voice\\") in Burnout 3: Takedown as himself. He has also hosted shows on MTV, Fox Sports, VH1, Fuse and Direct TV and has acted in several feature films, including Grandma's Boy, Out Cold and The Sweetest Thing (he played a club-goer who stumbles upon the sight of Christina Applegate being felt-up by two other women in the restroom). During the August 2, 2004 episode of Loveline with guest Randy Jackson, it was discussed that he had been hired as one of the original judges on American Idol, a position which he turned down before filming began over image concerns. Jackson related Stryker's position as \\"It's going to blow my cool.\\" On February 3, 2009, Stryker announced on Loveline that he would be serving as a Dean for the 3rd season of VH-1's Charm School along with \\"LaLa\\" Vasquez and Ricki Lake. Coincidentally, he will be replacing Riki Rachtman, who also hosted Loveline from 1990-1995. During the September 24, 2008 episode of Loveline, both DJ Samantha Ronson and actress Lindsay Lohan spoke to Stryker regarding the plane crash involving DJ AM and Travis Barker. During the conversation, Stryker casually asked Lohan how long she and Ronson had been together, to which Lohan confessed that they had been in a relationship for \\"a very long time\\". Despite obvious evidence before this incident, this remark unintentionally became what is widely regarded as Lohan officially 'coming out'. Stryker has a handful of quirks, such as being able to spell and pronounce people's names backwards on the fly and formulate palindromes, as well as being mildly mysophobic. He revealed during several interviews that he was born with a tail, a benign protrusion of his coccyx (tail bone) from his lower back. On April 22, 2009, Stryker announced his departure from Loveline per Westwood One. Ann Wilkins- Ingold briefly explained on the air that Stryker would be greatly missed, and the decision was solely based on Westwood One's unfortunate need to tighten its financial belt. Stryker was sad to leave, but upbeat during his announcement. He mentioned he would be back from time to time (as Westwood One has invited him to guest host periodically in the future). Stryker signed off officially at 10:56 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on April 22, 2009. Stryker was on the air on KAMP-FM 97.1 AMP Radio 3-7 p.m. weekdays.http://www.radioandrecords.com/RRWebsite20/members/ShowHeadline.aspx?FormatId=0&ContentID;=47999 However, it was announced on February 26, 2010 that Stryker would return to his former position at KROQ-FM as the afternoon drive host on March 1, 2010. On April 16, 2014 Stryker was a guest star on the webseries Talking Marriage with Ryan Bailey.

It operates at 102.5 MHz and airs a hot adult contemporary radio format branded as Star 102.5. It is owned and operated by Entercom Communications. WTSS's transmitter is in Colden, New York on the WIVB-TV Tower, while its studios and offices are located on Corporate Parkway in Amherst, New York. History The owner of AM station WBEN, WBEN, Inc. as of October 13, 1931, had experimented with higher- frequency broadcasts for over a decade prior to launch of the station that would become WTSS. It had operated W8XH, an Apex band station, from 1934 to 1939; W8XH was the first Apex station to operate a regular schedule.\\"WBEN Short-Wave Station To Begin Broadcasts Sunday\\", Buffalo Evening News, March 17, 1934, page 4. That station converted to facsimile broadcasting as W8XA in 1939 before shutting down in December 1940. The Federal Communications Commission issued a construction permit to WBEN, Inc. for a new FM station on 43.3 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM Broadcast Band on August 10, 1944 with the WBEN-FM call sign. The FCC reassigned the station to 92.1 MHz in August 1946 after it created the current FM Broadcast Band on June 27, 1945. The station made its broadcast debut on November 11, 1946.\\"18-Year History Of WBEN-TV Marked By Many Firsts\\", Buffalo Evening News, May 15, 1948, page 8. The station was subsequently reassigned by the FCC to 106.5 MHz in 1947, and mostly simulcast its AM counterpart.For the later history of the 106.5 frequency in Buffalo, see WYRK. The FCC granted the station its first license on January 7, 1953, followed by a reassignment to 102.5 MHz in July 1958. It ceased simulcasting WBEN (AM) a few years later, with the exception of the Clint Buehlman morning show, which it carried until 1973. WBEN-FM aired a mixture of live and automated music, mostly easy listening and block music programming, such as organ music. As FM listening grew, the station became \\"Rock 102\\" in 1973, using the syndicated TM \\"Stereo Rock\\" automated contemporary hits format and dropping the morning show simulcast with WBEN. This same TM format and its prerecorded announcer were heard on other stations in Upstate New York during this period, including WGFM (now WRVE) in Schenectady/Albany, WYUT (now WXUR) in Herkimer (Utica-Rome), WKFM (now WBBS) in Fulton/Syracuse, WNOZ (now WIII) in Cortland/Ithaca and WPXY (FM) in Rochester. WBEN-AM-FM were sold to Algonquin Broadcasting effective March 1, 1978. Beginning in 1984, Rock 102's mornings were hosted live by Roger Christian, who had been with the station since 1976 and in Buffalo radio since 1964. (This Roger Christian, whose real name is Emerson Stevens, is not to be confused with the Buffalo-born disc jockey also known as Roger Christian, who was known as \\"Mike Melody\\" in Buffalo. Stevens may have chosen the name in honor of the real Roger Christian, who went on to a prolific career in radio and songwriting.) Christian remained with the station, most recently as midday host, until Entercom eliminated his position in September 2019.\\"After 43 years, Roger Christian is out at Star 102.5\\" by Alan Pergament, September 6, 2019 (buffalonews.com) In 1987, the station shifted to a fully live format with the WMJQ call sign.\\"Radio Stations: New York: Buffalo\\", Broadcasting Yearbook (1988), page B-189. WMJQ was originally branded as \\"Majic 102\\" and later \\"Q102\\". The Q102 moniker remained until the late 1990s. As \\"Majic 102\\", the station competed heavily with 98.5 WKSE for Buffalo's Top 40 audience in the late 1980s and early 1990s before shifting to its current Hot AC format in September 1991.\\"WMJQ: Buffalo's Sleeping Giant Wakes Up\\" by Mike Kinosian, Radio & Records, January 31, 1992, page 56. The \\"Star\\" moniker and WTSS call sign were adopted in 2000, shortly after Entercom purchased the station in 1999 from the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which was exiting radio to focus on its television holdings. The station has, since 1973, been a pop music (Hot Adult Contemporary or Adult Top 40) outlet geared toward a female audience. It has varied in its presentation during that time depending on the formats of other stations. For instance, much of the mid-to-late 2000s, WTSS' playlist included music as early as the 1970s in an effort to serve listeners when Buffalo did not have an oldies station. It changed to its current formula after longtime oldies/classic hits outlet WHTT-FM returned to the format. The music on WTSS today is mostly upbeat hits from 2000 to the present, minus any hard rock or rap. In 2006, WTSS began streaming its programming on the Internet. WTSS was nominated for Hot AC Station of the Year by Radio & Records Magazine in 2006 and 2007. WTSS became Buffalo's only hot AC radio station following CFLZ-FM's flip from hot AC to adult hits in August 2011. Programming and playlists On weekdays, Rob Lucas hosts morning drive time and Sue O'Neill is heard in afternoons. Mike McQueen is heard on weekends. WTSS also airs the syndicated weekend show Hollywood Hamilton Weekly Top 30 Countdown. Every holiday season, Star switches to the moniker \\"Buffalo's Christmas Station\\" and plays all Christmas music. The change usually occurs two weeks before Thanksgiving and runs through Christmas Day (the date has generally progressed earlier and earlier through the 2010s, to the point where it changed the day after Halloween in 2019). After December 25, Star has historically gone back to its regular hot adult contemporary format; since 2018, it has continued its all-Christmas format for several days after the holiday. WTSS is temporarily delisted from Mediabase's hot AC panel when the station goes all-Christmas.Mediabase Hot AC Add Board News and traffic are provided from sister station 930 WBEN and weather is provided by television station WGRZ. These information elements are heard near the bottom of each hour during the morning show. Broadcast signal/Canadian listenership Broadcast map form the FCC for the station. WTSS is a grandfathered ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù station. The station‚Äôs effective radiated power (ERP) exceeds the maximum limit allowed for a Class B FM station, and is also far above the maximum allowable ERP for its antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) according to current FCC rules. WTSS is one of the strongest FM signals in the Northeastern United States at 110,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP), at a height above average terrain (HAAT) of . WTSS and 99.5 WDCX-FM have the strongest FM signals in Western New York, both broadcasting with 110,000 watts, although WTSS has a much taller tower. Sharing the tower of former sister station, WBEN-TV (now WIVB), the station's transmitter is located on a high ridge in the Allegheny Plateau, 20 miles southeast of Buffalo, near Colden, New York. WTSS can be heard in the Rochester metropolitan area, although some adjacent channel interference is picked up from WVOR (102.3 MHz) and WLGZ-FM (102.7 MHz). WTSS's signal also extends across the Pennsylvania state line, around Allegheny State Park, as well as parts of Erie County, Pennsylvania, although adjacent channel interference exists at 102.3 MHz from classic rock station WQHZ in and west of the city of Erie, also where co- channel interference with WZOO in Ashtabula, Ohio (also at 102.5 MHz) begins.Radio-Locator.com/WTSS WTSS can also be heard in parts of the Greater Toronto Area, where the signal crosses Lake Ontario. At times during the station's history, before the FM band became more crowded (and especially during its run as \\"Rock 102\\"), it performed as a top-10 rated station in Toronto. Other Buffalo area radio stations with strong signals and in formats not available in Canada at the time, such as 550 WGR, 98.5 WKSE, and 93.7 WBLK, were also highly rated in Toronto. HD Radio and Translator In 2006, WTSS began offering an HD2 channel called \\"The Delta\\", which featured Delta blues music. As of May 11, 2015, the HD2 channel is a simulcast of co-owned alternative rock station 107.7 WLKK.HD Radio station guidehttp://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/05/08/alt-107-7-fm-will-be- available-monday-on-alternative-frequency/Freqseek HD Radio Guide The HD2 channel feeds an FM translator in Buffalo, W284AP at 104.7 MHz. WLKK's transmitter is in Wethersfield, New York, making reception difficult in some parts of Buffalo, so the HD2 channel and translator are alternatives for WLKK listeners. An HD3 channel had broadcast Family Life Network, a Christian radio network, primarily to serve as an originating station for FLN's translators.\\"Family Life: Find a Station: New York and Pennsylvania\\" (FLN.org) In October 2019, the HD3 channel switched to Channel Q, an Entercom service for LGBTQ listeners, featuring talk shows on weekdays and dance music nights and weekends.\\"Channel Q Adds Four New Channels\\", October 14, 2019 (InsideRadio.com) References External links *Star 102.5 Official website * *FCC History Cards for WTSS (covering WBEN-FM for 1946-1981) *List of \\"Grandfathered Superpower\\" FM stations Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States TSS Category:Radio stations established in 1946 Category:Entercom radio stations ","title":"WTSS"},{"id":"6646449","text":"Municipal Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Mombasa, Kenya.

Currently, the global community of registered students number over 50,000 students in more than 180 countries including Antarctica.  History  The institution that later became known as University College London was established in 1826 and opened in 1828 under the name \\"London University\\", although without official recognition of university status. The institution ‚Äì following the Scottish model in curriculum and teaching ‚Äì was non-denominational and, given the intense religious rivalries at the time, there was an outcry against the \\"godless\\" university. The issue soon boiled down to which institutions had degree-granting powers and which institutions did not. The compromise solution that emerged in 1836 was that the sole authority to conduct the examinations leading to degrees would be given to a new officially recognised entity called the \\"University of London\\", which would act as examining body for the University of London colleges, originally University College London and King's College London, and award their students University of London degrees. As Sheldon Rothblatt states, \\"thus arose in nearly archetypal form the famous English distinction between teaching and examining, here embodied in separate institutions.\\" With the state giving examining powers to a separate entity, the groundwork was laid for the creation of a programme within the new university that would both administer examinations and award qualifications to students taking instruction at another institution or pursuing a course of self-directed study. =People's University and larger role= University of London External System official logo from year 2007 to 2010. The 1858 charter of the University of London allowed students at any college, whether affiliated or not, self-taught students, students with private tutors and students taking correspondence courses to sit University of London exams on payment of the ¬£5 fee. On this basis, the University of London has claimed to be the first university to offer distance learning degrees, although its role at that time was limited to that of an examining board. Thanapal (2015) states that \\"the original degree by external study of the UOL was not a form of distance education\\". In 1858, British weekly literary magazine named All the Year Round, founded and owned by Charles Dickens, coined the term ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs University‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe English People‚Äôs University‚Äù, to describe the University of London as it provided access to higher education to students from less affluent backgrounds. Several current degree-awarding universities started as colleges presenting candidates for University of London degrees, such as Owens College which later became part of the Victoria University and eventually the University of Manchester.Harte, Negley (1986) The University of London 1836‚Äì1986, p.106 The external system continued to expand from its London base with examinations for non-collegiate students held in Gibraltar (1867), Canada (1868), Tasmania and West Indies (1869), India (1880), Ceylon (1882), Hong Kong (1888), with 18 centers worldwide by 1899. With the reform of the University of London from an examining board to a federal university in 1900, the existing examination system became the External System, with the newly- federated colleges in London forming the Internal System (with the university taking responsibility for approving courses and teachers). Both external and internal students continued to be awarded the same University of London degrees. The University of London examination system and the External System were instrumental in the formation of British higher education. Most English and Welsh university colleges founded between 1849 and 1949 (exceptions include Newcastle, linked with Durham from its foundation in 1871, and Swansea, part of the University of Wales from its foundation in 1920) served what was a form of 'apprenticeship' through offering London degrees by external study for a period (which could vary considerably in length), before receiving authorisation to award their own degrees and becoming universities in their own right. The External System also played a significant role in establishing many Commonwealth universities under a unique scheme of ‚Äòspecial relations‚Äô. Enrolment increased steadily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and during the Second World War there was a further increase in enrolments from soldiers stationed abroad as well as soldiers imprisoned in German POW camps. Because the Geneva Convention (1929) stipulated that every prisoner of war, in addition to being entitled to adequate food and medical care, had the right to exchange correspondence and receive parcels, many British POWs took advantage of this opportunity and enrolled in the University of London External Programme. The soldiers were sent study materials by mail, and at specified intervals sat for proctored exams in the camps. Almost 11,000 exams were taken at 88 camps between 1940 and 1945. Though the failure rate was high, substantial numbers of soldiers earned degrees while imprisoned. However, as more universities were established in Britain and the Commonwealth in the decades following the second world war, the demand for the external system dropped. In 1972 it was announced that the external system would stop registering students at public institutions from 1977, and in 1977 overseas registrations were also stopped, although these were reopened in 1982.Harte, Negley (1986) The University of London 1836‚Äì1986, p. 271 In 1985‚Äì6, there were 24,500 students registered for external degrees in six main subject areas. Law was by far the biggest subject, with 75 percent of all enrollments. In 1985, 358 LLBs were awarded to internal students; in the same year 298 graduated with external LLBs. Reform of the external system in 1987 saw colleges contracted (either individually or, as in the case of Law, as a consortium) by the university to provide academic support for external students. This established the concept of the \\"lead college\\" on a course, and led to programme directors in the lead colleges taking on not just examinations but also the delivery of the courses and, in collaboration with academics in the colleges, the development of teaching materials University of London International Programmes official logo from year 2010 to 2018. The University of London International Programmes commemorated its 150th anniversary in 2008. A specially commissioned anniversary book was produced to mark the occasion. =Research programmes and degrees= With the advent of inexpensive airmail services after the war, the number of external students taking University of London courses increased dramatically. According to relevant Regulations, until 2000 University of London external students could pursue research leading to the award of Master of Philosophy (MPhil) or Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) albeit the completion rate had been rather low.  Current system  The Princess Royal, presiding over the External Programme Presentation Ceremony, 2006thumbright261px The system offers courses of study for undergraduate and postgraduate diplomas and degrees to more than 50,000 students around the world. A designated constituent institution of the University of London, called the \\"lead college\\", creates materials to allow students to study at their own pace. Examinations take place at testing centres around the world on specified dates. Hallmarks of the programme are its low cost in comparison to attendance in London, and the possibility of pursuing either full-time or part-time study. As stated in the University of London Statutes, International Programmes students are graded on the same standard as internal students to ensure a uniform credentialing process. A student who completes a course of study under the program is awarded a University of London degree with a notation specifying which lead college provided the instruction. Students enrolled in the University of London International Programmes are members of the University of London. International Programmes Students however, have very limited student representation within the University. There are also differences over the status International Programmes Students have with respect to their lead college. Some institutions co-register their International Programmes Students as college members (e.g. SOAS, LSHTM), in addition to their status as University of London member. However, other colleges deny International Programmes Students membership status and privileges when they are present in London (e.g. LSE). Academics at the University of London are responsible for the academic direction of the International Programmes. When the International Programmes was audited in 2005 by the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the auditors concluded that 'broad confidence' could be placed in the University's management and the awards made through the External System ('broad confidence' is \\"the best verdict any institution can be given by the auditors\\").University of London Press Release, \\"Vote of confidence in delivering world-wide education for the University of London\\", 10 April 2006 http://www.londonexternal.ac.uk/news_events/archive/docs/ext_prog_press_06.pdf The 'confidence' was once again reiterated in the QAA's 2011 Institutional Audit, attesting to the quality of the program provision.University of London International Programs, Institutional Audit\\", May 2011 http://www.qaa.ac.uk/en/ReviewsAndReports/Documents/University%20of%20London%20International%20Programmes/University- of-London-International-Programmes-annex-IA-11.pdf Most International Programmes Students are in former territories of the British Empire.

Furthermore, there are around 1,000 students in Russia participating in this programme. = Name changes = In November 2007, the University of London External Programme became known as the University of London External System. In August 2010, the name was once again changed to University of London International Programmes in response to feedback that the programme needed a clear, simpler and more inclusive name that described what the University of London offered to almost 50,000 students in 180 countries. As from February 2018, University of London International Programmes changed its name to just University of London.

Such institutions may be audited and, if found to meet quality standards, may become \\"recognised\\" by the University for the support offered. Starting August 2010, the External System programmes were renamed University of London International Programmes. The central academic body of the university, collaborating with the colleges of the University of London, is renamed University of London International Academy, term mainly used internally. In parallel to this change, the teaching institutions are now categorized into Registered and Affiliate centers (collectively known as recognised centres). Students can either decide to study entirely by themselves, or to enjoy the administrative and academic support of the institutions that are recognised by the University of London for the International Programmes. Registered Centres have demonstrated commitment to developing high standards in respect of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centres have demonstrated a sustained commitment to developing excellence in respect of quality of teaching, support to students and administrative processes. Affiliate Centre status is the highest level of recognition awarded by the University of London. Recognition applies to specific programmes on named campuses.Information for students  University of London International Programmes . Londoninternational.ac.uk. Retrieved 17 July 2013.

Organisations such as Commonwealth Scholarships, Sir John Cass's Foundation scholarship and individual scholarship like Guy Goodwin-Gill scholarship, Sadako Ogata scholarships are available for external students.  Influence  261px The University of London external system has played an important role in the development of higher education institutions in Britain. Many leading research universities in England started out as \\"university colleges\\" that prepared students for external degrees of the University of London. Some technical colleges in England and Scotland also awarded University of London degrees and certificates prior to becoming polytechnics and then universities. Examples include the University of Nottingham, the University of Leicester and the University of Exeter in England, Cardiff University and Bangor University prior to joining the University of Wales and becoming independent and Robert Gordon University in Scotland. This was a common way of establishing new universities in Britain and around the British Empire during the first half of the twentieth century. Many universities in the Commonwealth began as extension institutions or a provider of the programme. Notable examples include Ceylon University College in Ceylon, University College Ibadan (now the University of Ibadan) in Nigeria, the former University of East Africa's three constituent institutions and the University of the West Indies in the Caribbean. Online MOOCs In 2012, University of London International Programmes became the first British higher education institution to join Coursera and offer MOOCs through that platform. By 2016, total enrollments had crossed 1 million. In 2018 the University of London, its member institution Goldsmiths, University of London, and Coursera announced they were collaborating to offer the first undergraduate degree on the platform. Notable alumni The degree graduates from the International Programmes are member of the University of London International Programmes Alumni Association and formal alumni of the University of London. =Nobel laureates= At least seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded to alumni of the University of London distance learning students in external mode: *Ronald H.

With over half a million participants, it is the largest study of diet and disease to be undertaken. EPIC is coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, and funded by the \\"Europe Against Cancer\\" programme of the European Commission as well as multiple nation-specific grants and charities. 521,457 healthy adults, mostly aged 35‚Äì70 years, were enrolled in 23 centres in ten European countries: Denmark (11%), France (14%), Germany (10%), Greece (5%), Italy (9%), The Netherlands (8%), Norway (7%), Spain (8%), Sweden (10%) and the United Kingdom (17%). One UK centre (Oxford) recruited 27,000 vegetarians and vegans; this subgroup forms the largest study of this dietary group. Recruitment to the study took place between 1993 and 1999, and follow up is planned for at least ten years, with repeat interview/questionnaires every three to five years. The main prospective data collected are standardised dietary questionnaires (self- administered or interview-based), seven-day food diaries, blood samples and anthropometric measurements, such as body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio. Additionally, the GenAir case-control study is studying the relationship of passive smoking and air pollution with cancers and respiratory diseases. Up to 2004, there were over 26,000 new cases of cancer recorded among participants, with the most common being cancers of the breast, colorectum, prostate and lung. Current analyses are focusing particularly on stomach, colorectal, breast, prostate and lung cancers. The different dietary patterns in the different countries should enable reliable associations to be made between particular diets and cancers. The analysis of stored blood samples should also allow dissection of genetic factors involved in cancers, as well as the effects of hormones and hormone-like factors.  Key findings  The study and its analysis is ongoing, but key results of the study retrieved in 2008 are: *Lowered sodium from salt intake, high potassium from fruit and vegetable consumption promote healthy blood pressure levels *High physical activity, involving some high impact activities is a good indicator of longevity and low risk of bone fractures *High dietary fibre protects against bowel cancer *Obesity increases a number of cancer risks *High levels of sex hormones increase risk of breast cancer *Increased fat intake increases the risk of breast cancer *Increases in eating fruit and vegetables reduces the risk from all causes of an early death *High blood glucose levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease *The combined impact of four behaviours ‚Äì not smoking, being physically active, moderate alcohol intake and the consumption of at least five fruit and vegetable servings a day ‚Äì was estimated to amount to 14 additional years of life (Khaw et al. 2008) Subsequent findings from 2012 and 2013 are: *Dietary flavonoid intake is associated with reduced gastric carcinoma risk in women but not men *Regular consumption of processed meat increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and death from cancer Notes Selected papers Review * Primary     External links  *EPIC project (IARC) *EPIC study (CR UK) *EPIC (Oxford centre) (preferentially recruited vegetarians & vegans) *EPIC-Norfolk (UK Norfolk cohort) Category:Epidemiological study projects Category:Nutrition Category:Oncology ","title":"European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition"},{"id":"6646510","text":"Linda G.

It ran for 27 episodes on TV Tokyo between April and September 2007. It was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, written by veteran playwright Kazuki Nakashima. Gurren Lagann takes place in a fictional future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. The plot focuses on two teenagers, Simon and Kamina, who live in a subterranean village and wish to go to the surface. Using a mecha known as Lagann, Simon and Kamina reach the surface and start fighting alongside other humans against Lordgenome's forces, before fighting the forces of their true enemy. In North America, although initially announced to be licensed by ADV Films in 2007, the license was transferred to Bandai Entertainment in 2008 and then transferred to Aniplex of America in 2013. In the United Kingdom, it was licensed by Manga Entertainment in 2007, then transferred to Beez Entertainment in 2008, and then transferred to Anime Limited in 2013. The Sci Fi Channel acquired the broadcasting rights of Gurren Lagann and began airing the anime on July 28, 2008, as part of Sci Fi's Ani-Monday anime block. The anime won several awards at the Tokyo International Anime Fair and the Animation Kobe and Japan Media Arts Festivals. A manga adaptation was published by ASCII Media Works between 2007 and 2013. Bandai Entertainment licensed the manga and released it in English in North America. A series of four light novels was published by Shogakukan between 2007 and 2008. A Nintendo DS video game was released in October 2007, bundled with a special episode of the anime series. Two animated film versions were produced; the first premiered in Japanese theaters in September 2008, and the second premiered in April 2009. Plot =Story= Gurren Lagann takes place in a future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers in Giha village, finds solace in his best friend, an older brother figure who is an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen. Shortly thereafter, a huge Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko, who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann) and its drilling-based abilities. He successfully uses it to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through the ceiling to bring him and Kamina to the surface world. Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen who are piloted by Beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle by one of Lordgenome's four generals. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, who is revealed to be Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her but they allow her to join them when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many who came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other teams of humans, who had captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace. As the palace itself turns out to be a gigantic Gunmen called the Teppelin and launches armies of other Gunmen, the human forces engage them while Simon, Nia, and Rossiu pilot Gurren Lagann against Lordgenome himself, who fights them in a similar Gunmen called Lazengann. When both Lazengann and Gurren are damaged, Lordgenome fights Simon in Lagann with his bare hands, and emerges victorious, until Simon uses his Core Drill to defeat him once and for all. Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government in their new capital of Kamina City. As soon as the human population reaches one million people, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce their intentions: they have sent the Moon onto a collision course with the Earth as part of their effort to wipe out all life on the planet, to prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. It turns out Lordgenome, having since been resurrected as a bio-computer, was once part of an intergalactic army of warriors that failed to stop the Anti-Spirals, and so forced mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals. With guidance from Lordgenome and help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, in the process revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension the Anti-Spirals had hidden it in, and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld. After a journey with significant loss, they rescue Nia, and in a one-on-one Gunmen battle that virtually spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away into nothing, as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals, a fate she and Simon accept. With his life in battle finally over, Simon hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and leaves his friends to spend the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant, saying his destiny was merely to \\"dig the tunnel to the future\\", not to travel down it himself. In the epilogue, twenty years have passed since the team's victory over the Anti- Spirals. With many of Team Dai-Gurren having since finally retired, it is up to the new generations of pilots to prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. Other races across the galaxy, having contacted Earth upon being freed from the Anti-Spirals, have joined forces with President Rossiu of Kamina City and during the twenty years, created the Galactic Spiral Peace Conference. Yoko, now as Miss Yomako, has become the principal of the small school she worked as a teacher at during her seven years absence from the team. One of her students, Nakim, has become a representative of the galaxy in the Grapearl Squadron. Gimmy and Darry have used Simon's Core Drill to become the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Viral has become the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. Nia's memorial and her engagement ring are shown to have been placed next to Kamina's grave. Simon, still living as Simon the Digger, watches over them as a squadron of Gurren Laganns flies overhead through the night sky on their way to join their Spiral brethren in the stars. =Main characters= The original Team Dai-Gurren ; : :Simon is the main protagonist of Gurren Lagann. He is introduced as a fourteen-year-old digger from Giha village who is looked down upon by many of his peers for his timid and weak character. He greatly admires Kamina, one of his few friends in the village, and refers to him as his brother despite them not being related by blood. Simon spends much of the first quarter of the series following after Kamina, but gradually acquires his own fighting spirit and determination over the course of the series, acting on his own more often until his personality mirrors that of Kamina. His discovery of the Core Drill and the Gunmen Lagann are what set the events of the series in motion. Throughout the series, Simon primarily pilots Lagann (Japanese for \\"head/face\\"), which is capable of producing drills from any part of his body when he reacts to Simon's Spiral energy. He uses this ability to combine with Kamina's Gunmen, Gurren, to form Gurren Lagann. He can also take control of other Gunmen using this ability. ; : :Kamina is a refractory youth from Giha village who dreams of leaving his underground home and going to the surface world, which he saw as a child. His extremely passionate and self-confident personality causes him to act as a foil for the more timid and weak-willed Simon, and serves to instill courage within Simon. He is known for wearing sunglasses along with a tattered cape that had belonged to his late father. He wields a nodachi he stole from the chief of Giha village and his catchphrase of \\"just who the hell do you think I/we am/are?!\\" becomes the battle cry of his group. Although Kamina is killed significantly early in the show, his actions greatly influence the entire series, as he founds Team Gurren (later renaming it Team Dai-Gurren) and acts as its leader to combat the threat of Lordgenome and the beastmen. Early in the series, Kamina hijacks a Gunmen he names Gurren (Japanese for \\"scarlet\\"), which he pilots while combined with Simon's Lagann to form Gurren Lagann. ; : :Yoko is a young woman from Littner, a village neighboring Giha, and is introduced as a member of a small resistance against the beastmen. She helps introduce Simon and Kamina to the surface world, and becomes a member of Team Gurren soon after. She falls in love with Kamina early in the series, and thinks little of Simon until he begins showing signs of self-confidence. After Kamina's death, she tries to help Simon cope and forms a sisterly relationship with him. Instead of piloting a Gunmen, she wields a high-powered energy rifle and uses her superb marksmanship and wise counsel to help her teammates. ; : :Nia is a major character introduced later on in the series. Having lived a sheltered life as the daughter of Lordgenome, the main antagonist of the first half of the series, she is ignorant of the war between the humans and Lordgenome until she is abandoned by her father and discovered by Simon. She is a very polite and naive girl who is curious about the world, and acts as a soothing influence for Simon following his depression caused by Kamina's death. The two fall in love and become engaged at the start of the second half of the series, after which she is discovered to be an agent of the Anti-Spirals. During this time, Nia is taken over by a cold and uncaring personality called \\"Messenger Nia\\" and forced to fight Simon against her will until Simon rescues her. Because her existence is tied with that of the Anti-Spirals, however, she fades away with them after they are defeated, but keeps herself alive long enough to marry Simon. Production Gurren Lagann was first announced in July 2006 with Aniplex and Konami assisting Gainax in its making. Konami director Koichi Natsume suggested possibilities of the series getting multiple sequels. The series was directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi who was a fan of the mecha genre, having previously done animation work for Neon Genesis Evangelion, and ever since he started working he had wanted to work in a mecha series. After working on Re: Cutey Honey with Kazuki Nakashima, Imaishi appointed him as the writer, believing him to be the best choice. Imaishi was surprised with how much material Nakashima could condense into 27 episodes. Imaishi had finished writing the main storyline long before reaching the end which facilitated the staff in making the episodes. According to Gainax president Hiroyuki Yamaga the series was in planning phases for a long time. Producer Yasuhiro Takeda used the time to research how would the characters live underground although this aspect is briefly used. Once the series started production, the team did not have much time to research materials. In contrast to other popular series, Imaishi decided to include drills as the robot's main weapons despite its impact on the suspension of disbelief. Imaishi also wanted the series to only have robots. The robots were made organic so that they would be easier to animate. Nevertheless, animating episode 15 was challenging to the staff due to the number of shots it required. Its animator Sushio called himself the \\"super animator\\" for his work. Deciding the design of the Gurren Lagann was complicated since it was the basis for the other mechas appearing in the story. In the making of the series, the team wanted to focus more on the underground life and Simon's imprisonment but their ideas could not be used. In the eighth episode Kamina dies in order to provide Simon character development and make him become the main character. Simon's development kept on going until the final arc when staff planned ideas to make him surpass Kamina. The ending was written to finalize Simon's growth and not leave signs of a sequel. The finale had the pre-planned tragic event of Nia's death which left several staff members saddened. While the staff acknowledged how people were not satisfied with the sad conclusion, they noted that there were still issues that made her survival difficult for the characters. Once the series ended, Yamaga had the idea of releasing a film that retells the events of the series to expand the audience. =Influences= In an interview, the writer Kazuki Nakashima cites Ken Ishikawa, co-creator of Getter Robo, as one of Gurren Lagann's influences. Gurren Lagann occasionally pays homage to Ishikawa's Getter Robo, particularly towards the end of the series, where the scale becomes absurd, with the robots steadily becoming bigger and bigger, much like Getter Robo more specifically, the manga version of Getter Robo Go. The final enemy also bears a striking resemblance to La Gooth of Records of Nothingness, another work by Ishikawa. Nakashima, however, wanted to conclude the story of Gurren Lagann in a more reasonable fashion than what Ishikawa usually does in his works. According to Jason Green from Anime News Network, the anime was influenced by previous Gainax anime, particularly in the character development of the protagonist Simon, who goes through three stages in his character development during the three arcs of the series. Each of these stages in his development were influenced by protagonists from several previous Gainax anime: Shinji Ikari from the Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise, Noriko Takaya from Gunbuster, and Ken Kubo from Otaku no Video. The animation on the show pays special tribute to the animation and character designs of Yoshinori Kanada. =Conflicts= Takami Akai, the producer of the series and a co-founder of Gainax, announced that he would resign his position effective episode five, which aired on April 29, 2007, over comments that he made regarding posts on the Japanese textboard 2channel. Akai and another Gainax employee, Keiko Mimori, made disparaging remarks about comments criticizing the animation style of the fourth episode of Gurren Lagann, which was completely directed by guest and friend Osamu Kobayashi. With regard to reading the fan criticisms, Akai stated that it was \\"like putting [his] face next to an anus and breathing deeply.\\" Fans later became aware of his comments, and he announced his departure from the company he helped found. As a result of the series airing at a child-friendly time slot, the staff members had problems with episode 6. Although that episode had a subplot involving peeking into the women's bath, the television stations believed it was suitable when reading the script. After seeing the finished episode, the station said that it could not be aired, and a revised version of the episode was produced. Media =Anime series= Produced by the animation studio Gainax and directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, Gurren Lagann aired in Japan on TXN stations between April 1 and September 30, 2007. The anime has 27 episodes plus two specials, the first being the uncensored version of the sixth episode, and the second is episode 5.5, a bonus that came with the Nintendo DS game. The English version had been previously licensed by ADV Films, but was later acquired by Bandai Entertainment. A subtitle-only version was released in three volumes in July 2008, and an official English dub with the first two volumes released on November 18, 2008 called \\"Gurren Lagann Set 01\\". The show premiered on the Sci Fi Channel on July 28, 2008 as part of Sci Fi's Ani- Monday anime block, airing two episodes each week (and three the final week). The European distribution branch of Bandai, Beez Entertainment, distributed the series in the UK and Europe but has gone out of print since January, 2012. In 2013, Anime Limited announced that they have the distribution license for Gurren Lagann on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK. In 2014, they released a limited Blu-ray Ultimate Edition on October 20, 2014, featuring the entire series, both film adaptations and the complete Parallel Works series, as well as a hardcover artbook. A standard edition Blu-ray containing the complete series was also released on the same day with the DVD release following later that year. The English version also aired on Animax across its English-language networks in Southeast Asia and South Asia starting on May 22, 2009. It was broadcast in Italy on Rai 4 between September 24, 2009 and April 1, 2010. Aniplex of America re-released the series in a limited edition DVD box set on May 9, 2013. A Blu-ray Disc box set, which includes both the television series and the two film adaptations, was released on June 26, 2013. Adult Swim began airing the series in English as part of the Toonami block on August 16, 2014. Music Taku Iwasaki composed the show's main background music. Four theme songs are used for the episodes; one opening theme and three ending themes. The opening theme is by Shoko Nakagawa. Starting from episode 17, the second verse and chorus was used, as compared to the first verse and chorus used in the previous episodes. For episodes 1 through 15 the ending theme is \\"Underground\\" by High Voltage. \\"Happily Ever After\\" by Shoko Nakagawa was used in episode 16. by Afromania was used for episodes 17 to 27. Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Character Song was released on July 25, 2007, by Aniplex, including image songs by the main voice cast, with songs sung by Tetsuya Kakihara (Simon), Katsuyuki Konishi (Kamina), and Marina Inoue (Yoko), the latter of which is a playable song in Dance Dance Revolution SuperNOVA 2. In addition, several music compilation albums have been released, most consisting of background music. =Manga= The Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann manga, illustrated by Kotaro Mori, started serialization in the June 2007 issue of MediaWorks' magazine Dengeki Comic Gao!. The manga ended serialization in Dengeki Comic Gao! with the April 2008 issue when the magazine was discontinued, but continued serialization in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh with the June 2008 issue and continued until the July 2013 issue. Ten tank≈çbon volumes were published between September 27, 2007 and June 27, 2013 in Japan under ASCII Media Works' Dengeki Comics imprint. Bandai Entertainment licensed the manga and released an English translation of the first six volumes in North America. The manga follows the same basic story as the anime, although there are some changes to the order of events, and the addition of character backstories that had been cut from the anime, such as the relationship between Dayakka and Kiyoh. A spin-off manga entitled was serialized in Comp Ace between August 26, 2008 and January 26, 2009; a single tank≈çbon volume was released on March 26, 2009. The manga takes the characters from the original story and puts them in a school in a parallel world. In the manga, Simon attends with his friend Kamina, and childhood friend Yoko. Simon, who lives in a run down apartment building, wishes for a normal life, and meets the mysterious Nia one day when she trips down the stairs. She immediately takes a liking to Simon and declares him her husband. Kamina finds another \\"aniki\\" in Nia, who shares his hot-blooded style. She enrolls in Dai- Gurren Academy, and all three must deal with the threat of students from Teppelin Academy, who wish to bring Nia back to her father, the principal. Another spin-off manga titled was published by Futabasha in 2008 as a compilation of various short stories. =Video games= An online video game was developed by Konami called . Beta testing had ended on April 16, 2007. The player takes up the role of a driller and drills for treasures in first person view. There is a shop to purchase drills‚Äîthe shopkeeper is an original character named Asaki. The player can also collect digital trading cards. The game was canceled at the closed beta stage, as installing the game crashed Windows indefinitely. Konami even had to send out 500GB external hard drives to beta users so that they could back up files while reinstalling their operating systems. A game for the Nintendo DS was released October 25, 2007, not only featuring the characters from the series, but also containing a special episode set in the early stages of the story as a pre-order bonus. In June 2010, Gainax re-acquired the video game rights to the series from Konami, which allowed Banpresto to include it in the latest installment of its storied Super Robot Wars franchise, 2nd Super Robot Wars Z: Destruction Chapter, released in April 2011. A Pachislot game based on the anime teased by Konami was later released in February 2016. =Anime films= An animated film entitled , once again directed by Hiroyuki Imaishi, and written by Kazuki Nakashima, was produced by Gainax and released on September 6, 2008 in Japanese theaters and the DVD was released on April 22, 2009.

She has written three memoirs about her experience: The Cage, To Life and Holocaust Lady. Early life  Rifkele Riva Minska was born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland to Avromele and Nacha Minska. Riva was born on May 3, 1926. She was the fourth of seven children: Chanele, Yankele, and Mala preceded her; brothers Motele, Moishele, and Laibele followed her. Riva's father, Avromele Minska died shortly after Moishele's birth. World War II Before the invasion of Poland, Riva's older siblings fled to Russia to escape forced labor. Riva, her mom and younger siblings are forced to live in the Lodz Ghetto, where younger brother Laibele contracted tuberculosis. On September 10, 1942, their mother was taken out of the ghetto during a Nazi raid, leaving Riva to care for her younger brothers. She adopted them to keep the family together, which lasted until Laibele died and Riva, Motele, and Moishele were rounded up with the other remaining Jews in the ghetto and sent to Auschwitz. Riva and her brothers were separated at the gates. After a week, Riva was transported to a labor camp in Mittelsteine. There she contracted blood poisoning from cutting her hand, and because she inspired others around her to work harder, she was hospitalized instead of killed. When she recovered, she was sent to the labor camp at Grafenort for the remainder of the war. The camp was liberated by Russian forces. Riva finally got her wish to be free. She moved to the United States of America and started a family. Post-war After liberation, Ruth returned to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ with friends from the camp. They found that their former homes were occupied by people who had acquired the homes after the Jewish removal. Ruth and her friends decided to flee upon learning that Jewish survivors of the camps were targets for murder. They stayed in an abandoned apartment with other survivors. The newlywed couple arranged to be taken to a displaced persons camp in Germany, where the couple gave birth to sons Laibele and Avromele. Also while at the camp, Ruth was reunited with her brother and sisters (Chanele, Yankele, and Mala) that escaped to Russia. Afterward the family emigrated to the United States, where two more children, Chaim and Nachele (Nancy), were born. The family settled in Commack, New York and she still resides there with her husband. She occasionally speaks on her story.

In 1867 a small square screw-pile structure was constructed at the site. It served until 1876, when the Mathias Point Light was constructed to the east. The Lighthouse Board received numerous complaints, however, and reactivated the light in 1882. Five years after the lighthouse was re-lit, Thomas Edwin Speake was the keeper.

The band originally formed in the early 1980s as an AOR band called Slyder ‚Äì by 2 brothers, Andrew and Robert Zarins. In 1983, childhood friend Neil Wilson joined as singer and the band changed their name to Tyrant enlisting Grant Wallace as second guitarist and began playing a harder-edged style of blues-influenced rock in the style of AC/DC, Rose Tattoo and The Angels. Tyrant were also influenced by countless Overseas metal acts including, Mot√∂rhead, Saxon, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Accept. In 1984, Tyrant released a four-track EP titled Never Too Loud, which topped the metal charts on the local radio stations and gained them a massive following in Tasmania. A successful tour of Tasmania followed, including a show at the Hobart City Hall in front of 2000 people. Tyrant moved to Sydney, becoming one of the leading hard rock bands in the city. Amazingly, Tyrant 'headlined' the inaugural \\"Metal Crusade\\" show in 1985, the lineup being: Tyrant, Bengal Tigers, Shy Thunder, Statez and Vice before 1800 metalheads. Despite 'rave' reviews in both RAM and Juke magazines at the time, a strong fanatical fan base, a record deal never eventuated with Tyrant splitting up in late 1986 due to different musical interests among the band members. In 1987, brothers Andy and Roberet Zarins re-formed Slyder, which split up again in 1990 after releasing one single titled \\"Dreams\\". Meanwhile, Neil Wilson and fellow Tyrant member, guitarist Grant Wallace formed a band called in 1987 called, The Law and played for a couple of years in Sydney, until both Wilson and Wallace formed a band called, \\"Sonic Temple\\" which was a concept band for UK rockers, The Cult. In 1998 Tyrant reformed again with the original line-up, Neil 'Steel' Wilson, Grant Wallace, Andrew Zarins and Robert Zarins ‚Äì returning to a packed house on 11 November 2000 at the Iron Duke Hotel in Sydney. Tyrant delivered many shows over the next couple of years, recording two full-length albums Freaks of Nature (2000) and Thunder Down Under (2003) before playing their 'last show' together with childhood heroes, Rose Tattoo. The band now middle aged, moved onto married life with the exception of Wilson. Vocalist Neil Wilson returned to Tasmania in 2004, forming a NEW line-up of Tyrant which released a live CD in 2005 titled, Live Bootleg. The new CD exposed a band that was far more ferocious, than the previous incarnation with the sound shifting its style musically speaking, with Tyrant moving away from their AC/DC, Rose Tattoo roots to a more modern and heavier metal sound with the new lineup consisting of vocalist, Neil Wilson, Brett Collidge on guitars, Simon Wilson guitars, Jason Smith bass guitar, and Nathan Sproule on drums. While only being a 'bootleg' recording, the new Tyrant was far more together musically with a fearsome beast displayed over the recording. In August 2008 Tyrant singer, Neil Wilson was returning home from a recording session for the bands' \\"25th Anniversary\\" project that was underway, when Wilson was involved in a 'head on' car accident, luckily escaping with relative minor injuries. Recording of the \\"Anniversary\\" CD re-commenced in early 2009 with 2 new songs, albeit in 'demo' form titled, \\"Running From The Law\\" and \\"Defenders Of The Faith\\" uploaded to the bands' My Space page (TyrantAustralia) ‚Äì the first new studio recordings by Tyrant since 2003. The \\"Save The Devil\\" (demo edition) was released March 2011 containing 10 songs of attitude fuelled, obnoxious hard rock metal that sees the Tasmanian metal act deliver possibly their finest effort to date. Full of barn storming anthems, a cool cover and a ballad - \\"Save The Devil\\" was recorded at Izaneer studios, in Tasmania - and was the fifth self-financed CD by TYRANT being engineered, mixed and produced by Brett Collidge. A number of videos have been up loaded to YouTube (keywords Tyrant Australia) including a new song, 'Lay Down The Law' off the latest CD. On 19 August 2011 saw the inception of a new \\"All Star\\" TYRANT at the Brisbane Hotel in Hobart. The new line up features: James Shelverton (Lady Crimson), Adrian Scott (Hammerhead), Michael Adkins (Raise The Flag/Rogue Sharks) and Neil Steel (Roadkill). The 'SPECIAL EDITION' of the \\"Save The Devil\\" CD was issued 1 June 2012 - the CD being remixed and mastered, produced by Brett Collidge and re-mixed by Michael Shelley in Hobart at the Green Room studios. The CD includes 2 different cover art and contains 8 songs! TYRANT returned to the stage playing in Hobart on 18 May 2012 - supporting US metal legend, TIM RIPPER OWENS on his first Australian solo tour! The band played its '30th Anniversary Show' at the Brisbane hotel, Hobart (Tasmania) in March 2013 and now has an 'official' page at Facebook (tyrantaustralia)and will release their 7th product - an 'Anniversary Edition' 2 CD version of \\"Never Too Loud\\" release in March 2015. The 2-CD set contains 8 tracks, the 'original' 1984 4 song (demo cassette)and the same 4 songs in re-recorded versions! The songs are: War Of The Roses, Thunder & Steel, Never Too Loud and Lamb To The Slaughter. In October 2015 - TYRANT headlined the 'Tasmanian Edition' of the second, METAL UNITED DOWN UNDER showcase concert, with the return of original guitarist Andy Zarins - joining co-founding member Neil 'Steel' Wilson (vocals), Adrian Scott (guitars) and James Shelverton (drums) in the current line up of the band. A new compilation album, \\"Thunder & Steel\\" - was released November 2017 and features 15 songs culled from the bands' 7 previous releases and includes a brand new song titled, Hellbound - which also appears on singer Neil Steel Wilson's other hard rock/metal band, ROADKILL (Australia) 2016 CD, \\"Extinct\\"! TYRANT vocalist Neil 'Steel' Wilson - also fronts another Tasmanian based hard rock act, ROADKILL (Australia).

The song was inspired by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's recent successful radio (then commonly called \\"wireless\\") telephone transmission from the U.S. Navy's station, NAA in Arlington, Virginia, to Hawaii.\\"Wireless Telephone from Washington Across the Continent and to Hawaii\\", Telegraph and Telephone Age, October 16, 1915, pages 474-476. This technology was still experimental, and the song underscores the caller's desperation to talk to his or her sweetheart in Hawaii, from his or her home in New York City. The song was recorded in 1915 by Billy Murray, backed with an instrumental version by Pietro Deiro on Side B; and later that year by Broadway star Nora Bayes. This was Murray's version of the chorus. It was easily adaptable for a woman to sing with just a couple of word changes: Captain Jinks, one night on Broadway, all alone, Read the news about the wireless telephone. Pretty soon his thoughts began to stray, over seven thousand miles away. He went through a whole month's pay just to phone and say: :Hello, Hawaii, how are you? :Let me talk to Honolulu Lou :To ask her this :Give me a kiss :Give me a kiss :By wireless :Please state :I can't wait :To hear her reply :For I had to pawn :Ev'ry little thing I own :To talk from New York :Through the wireless telephone :Oh, Hello, Hawaii, how are you? :Good-bye!

It was written by George Harrison during the Beatles' stay in Rishikesh, India, and given to Lomax to help launch Apple Records. The recording is a rarity among non-Beatles songs since it features three members of the band ‚Äì Harrison, who also produced the track, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. Performed in the hard rock style, the song also includes musical contributions from Eric Clapton and session pianist Nicky Hopkins, and was the first of many Harrison productions for artists signed to the Beatles' record label. Harrison wrote \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" to promote Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been studying in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In the lyrics, Harrison espouses meditation as a remedy for worldly cares. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the White Album). On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's \\"Our First Four\\" promotional campaign by the Beatles' \\"Hey Jude\\" and Mary Hopkin's \\"Those Were the Days\\"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. Together with its B-side, the Lomax-written \\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\", the song was included on the singer's only Apple album, Is This What You Want?, released in March 1969. \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" received favourable reviews in 1968 and has continued to invite praise from music critics, particularly for the energetic quality of the performance. Several writers consider that the song deserved to be a hit for Lomax and that, had the Beatles retained it for the White Album, it would have been among the best songs on the album. The track also appears on the 2010 multi-artist compilation Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records. Background and inspiration Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, whose teachings inspired the song \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" was one of several songs that George Harrison wrote while staying at Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, from February to April 1968.Greene, pp. 98‚Äì99. Having first visited India in September 1966, following the Beatles' final concert tour,Clayson, pp. 206‚Äì07. Harrison became enamoured of the teachings of the MaharishiNick Jones, \\"Beatle George And Where He's At\\", Melody Maker, 16 December 1967; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Will Hermes, \\"George Harrison 1943‚Äì2001\\", Spin, February 2002, p. 22 (retrieved 29 May 2016). and led his Beatles bandmates to Rishikesh to study Transcendental Meditation two years later.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 139.Steve Rabey, \\"George Harrison, 'Living In The Material World'\\", The Huffington Post, 9 October 2011 (retrieved 29 May 2016). With Life magazine labelling 1968 \\"the Year of the Guru\\",Syman, p. 198. the Beatles' visit generated wide interest in Transcendental Meditation,Greene, p. 98. and Eastern spirituality generally, among Western youth.Lavezzoli, pp. 6, 180.Goldberg, pp. 7, 8. Author Simon Leng writes that with \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", Harrison adopted \\"the role of advertising executive\\" to further promote meditation. Leng views it as a follow-up to \\"Within You Without You\\", in which Harrison had first channelled the teachings of the Hindu Vedas into a song.Leng, pp. 31, 57. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison says that \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" espouses meditation as a means to improve the quality of one's life, as well as advocating a proactive approach when faced with difficulty. He says he named the composition after a picture titled Kalladadi Samudra, which reflects the theme of Vishvasara Tantra in sacred Hindu texts, particularly regarding \\"the geological theory of the evolution of organic life on earth\\".Harrison, p. 142. Singer Jackie Lomax, whose debut solo album Harrison had agreed to produce before the Beatles departed for India,Clayson, pp. 239‚Äì40. said that the Sour Milk Sea symbolises \\"a fallow period\\" during each of the Earth's 26,000-year evolutionary cycles, before the planet begins its process of regeneration. As with the other songs he wrote in Rishikesh, \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" marked the start of Harrison's return to the guitar as his main instrument,Leng, p. 34. coinciding with a gradual relinquishing of his attempts to master the Indian sitar.Lavezzoli, pp. 184‚Äì85. In a September 1968 interview, he recalled that he wrote the music \\"in ten minutes\\" since he was without a guitar at the time and had to borrow John Lennon's. He also said that, although it was not until June that he decided to forgo Indian classical music and fully re-engage with rock music, \\"[Even when] I was in India, I always imagined the song as rock 'n' roll.\\"Alan Smith, \\"George Is a Rocker Again!\\", NME, 21 September 1968, p. 3. Composition Referring to the compositional draft for \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", musicologist Walter Everett states that together the various chords suggest \\"a pentatonic minor scale on A, allowing B as a tritone-related ornament to E7\\". The song makes limited use of the expected A major chord, however, instead centring on E over the verses and D in the choruses, with the latter representing what Everett terms \\"the Mixolydian VII area\\".Everett, p. 200. Described by author and critic Richie Unterberger as a melody filled with \\"tense chord ascensions\\", the composition shares part of its melodic characteristics with \\"Savoy Truffle\\", another Harrison song from 1968.Ingham, p. 309.Quantick, p. 160. In the lyrics to the verses, Harrison focuses on the benefits of Transcendental Meditation rather than detailing the way to achieve these results.Allison, pp. 45, 155. While Leng likens Harrison's approach to that of an advertiser selling anti-dandruff shampoo, author Joshua Greene describes the lyrical thrust of the song as: \\"Is life getting you down? Not getting the breaks you want? Try illumination.\\"Greene, p. 99. Harrison proffers greater awareness and a release from earthly limitations as the other benefits brought about by the meditation experience.Allison, p. 45. According to theologian Dale Allison, through its promise of a quick solution, the song pre-empts the concept espoused by Lennon two years later in \\"Instant Karma!\\"Allison, p. 45. Harrison urges the listener to follow a \\"very simple process\\" and to \\"do it soon\\", in order to leave the Sour Milk Sea state of mind and \\"Get back to where you should be\\".Harrison, pp. 141, 142. Author Ian Inglis views the chorus lyrics as particularly forthright; he paraphrases the message as \\"admit your shortcomings, pull yourself together, look for a solution\\". Although it originated as an acoustic guitar song, the official recording of \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" is in the heavy rock style typical of the late 1960s.Leng, p. 56. Greene comments on the appropriateness of this \\"hard- driving, blues guitar medium\\" as a way for Harrison to directly convey \\"a simple rule of thumb\\" regarding the human condition. The Beatles' demo The Beatles recorded a demo of \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" at Harrison's Esher home, Kinfauns, in late May 1968,Miles, p. 299.Womack, pp. 264, 857. while preparing material for their self-titled double album (also known as \\"the White Album\\").MacDonald, p. 244. By this point, the group had publicly ended their association with the Maharishi.Wayne Warga, \\"Maharishi Yogi Turns Other Cheek to The Beatles' Slur\\", Los Angeles Times, 17 May 1968, p. D14. Lennon, who, along with Harrison, was the last to leave Rishikesh, said in mid May that following the Maharishi had been a \\"mistake\\"Greene, p. 97. but that the band continued to believe in the benefits of meditation.Syman, p. 202. The demo was taped on Harrison's Ampex four-track recorder.Unterberger, p. 197. The performance features Harrison singing falsetto throughout,Unterberger, p. 196. and a musical backing that includes guitars and percussion.Winn, p. 170. Although the subsequent album sessions were marked by disharmony and a lack of cooperation among the band members,MacDonald, p. 267. author and critic Kenneth Womack comments that the Kinfauns demos \\"witness the Beatles working in unison and exalting in the pure joy of their music\\".Womack, p. 264. Leng similarly describes the group's performance of \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" as an \\"exciting\\" version \\"[p]layed with real enthusiasm\\".Leng, p. 57.

I think he was feeling held back [in the Beatles].\\"Terry Staunton, \\"Jackie Lomax: Is This What You Want?\\", Record Collector, July 2004; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Recording With Harrison as his producer, Lomax recorded \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" for release as a single. The sessions for the song began at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London on 24 June 1968,Miles, p. 302. before moving to Trident Studios,Lewisohn, p. 139. to use that facility's superior, eight-track recording equipment. Speaking to Melody Maker in September, Harrison described the recording as a \\"glorified jam session\\".Clayson, pp. 239, 477. The line-up consisted of Lomax on vocals, Harrison and Eric Clapton on guitars, Nicky Hopkins on piano, Paul McCartney on bass, and Ringo Starr on drums.Everett, pp. 199‚Äì200. McCartney was absent from the initial session, however, only returning on 25 June from an Apple- related business trip to California.Doggett, p. 47.\\"Timeline: June 20‚ÄìJuly 16, 1968\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition, p. 35. While Apple projects typically featured one member of the Beatles, \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" is the only track where more than two members of the band appeared on another artist's recording.Spizer, The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, pp. 338‚Äì44. Clapton's electric guitar playing gave the song a riff-based quality that was absent from the Beatles' version. Lomax later said that he thought the track \\"worked as an instrumental\\", and he recalled his nervousness when it came to overdubbing the vocal part, with \\"three Beatles in the control room watching me\\".\\"Is This What You Want?\\", Apple Records (retrieved 29 May 2016).

Cream) played lead guitar on the track, initiating a guitar combination with Harrison that continued long after the Beatles' break- up in 1970. Leng identifies \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" as marking three important \\"firsts\\" in Harrison's career. It was the first song Harrison \\"gave away\\" to another artist, a sign that his output as a songwriter had outgrown the quota of tracks typically allocated to him on Beatles releases. The Lomax album project also marked the first time that Harrison served as producer for another artist,Leng, pp. 55‚Äì56. after he had produced sessions in London and Bombay for his own debut solo album, Wonderwall Music.Ingham, p. 154. In addition, although Clapton had contributed to Wonderwall Music earlier in the year,Lavezzoli, p. 182. \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" is the first example of him and Harrison sharing the lead guitarist's role on a recording.Leng, pp. 49, 56. Later in 1968, the pair co-wrote Cream's final hit single, \\"Badge\\",Ingham, pp. 305‚Äì06. while their guitar combination would be a feature through much of Harrison's solo career,Inglis, pp. 134‚Äì35. as well as on Derek and the Dominos' first single, \\"Tell the Truth\\".Leng, p. 101. =\\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\"= For the single's B-side, Lomax recorded his composition \\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\". Produced by Harrison, the song was also recorded between 24 and 26 June. According to Apple Records historian Andy Davis, the musicians on the track comprised an \\"ad hoc power trio\\" of Lomax on bass and rhythm guitar, Harrison on lead guitar and \\"a couple of overdubs\\", and drummer Tony Newman from Sounds Incorporated.Liner notes by Andy Davis, Is This What You Want? CD booklet (Apple/EMI, 2010; produced by George Harrison, Jackie Lomax, Mal Evans & Paul McCartney). Lomax recalled that he and Harrison overdubbed a cornet part (played by a studio cleaner) and then manipulated the recording to make it sound like the call of an elephant. Release The \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" single was issued on 26 August 1968 in America (as Apple 1802)Miles, p. 307. and 6 September in Britain (as Apple 3).Castleman & Podrazik, p. 68. Along with \\"Hey Jude\\" by the Beatles, Mary Hopkin's \\"Those Were the Days\\" and the Black Dyke Mills Band's \\"Thingumybob\\", it was one of Apple's \\"Our First Four\\" singles,Schaffner, pp. 110, 111. marking the official launch of the label.Doggett, p. 49.Miles, p. 306. The four releases took place on the same day in the United States but were spread out over two weeks in the UK.Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 67‚Äì68. Apple staged a lavish promotional campaign for the launch, led by Derek Taylor, whom Harrison had invited to help run the Beatles' new enterprise.Doggett, pp. 31, 49. In advance of the release date, the company declared 11‚Äì18 August to be \\"National Apple Week\\"Johnny Black, \\"A Slice of History\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition, p. 90. and sent gift- wrapped boxes of the four records to Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family, and to the British prime minister.Schaffner, p. 111. In an interview to help promote \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", Harrison said that the song's message would \\"[go] above the heads of some people\\", but it was a \\"very good record\\" and indicative of his and Lomax's decision to put artistic merit before commercial considerations. Lomax carried out radio promotion for the single in November,Billboard staff, \\"News\\", Billboard, 23 November 1968, p. 4 (retrieved 8 February 2018). while he and Harrison were in the US recording further material for Lomax's album, Is This What You Want?Miles, p. 313. Although the single received considerable promotion, it was a surprising commercial failure.Allison, p. 155.David Colker, \\"Jackie Lomax dies at 69; signed by Beatles label but never hit it big\\", Los Angeles Times, 16 September 2013 (retrieved 29 May 2016). \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" failed to chart in Britain.Unterberger, p. 349. In America, the song reached number 117 during a two-week run on the Bubbling Under listings of Billboards Hot 100 chart, and \\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\" placed at number 125.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 350. \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" was a hit in Canada, however, peaking at number 29 on the RPM 100 in November 1968.\\"RPM 100 Singles Chart, 11 November 1968\\", Library and Archives Canada (archived version retrieved 24 May 2018). In a 1974 feature on his career in ZigZag magazine, Lomax said that the song's release in tandem with \\"obvious\\" hits like \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Those Were the Days\\" jinxed its commercial performance, since radio stations were reluctant to risk alienating other record labels by featuring all four Apple singles too heavily on their playlists. Lomax added: \\"So they kind of lost me in the shuffle.\\"Andy Childs, \\"The History of Jackie Lomax\\", ZigZag, July 1974; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). The song's exhortation to \\"Get back to where you should be\\" was partly appropriated by McCartney in his lyrics to \\"Get Back\\",Spizer, The Beatles on Apple Records, p. 44.Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 152. which the Beatles recorded in January 1969.Everett, pp. 221‚Äì22. In March that year, both sides of Lomax's single were included on Is This What You Want?,Castleman & Podrazik, pp. 75, 77. which was his only album for Apple. The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success,Bruce Eder, \\"Jackie Lomax\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 May 2016). a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in Lomax's talents.\\"Jackie Lomax\\", The Daily Telegraph, 17 September 2013 (retrieved 29 May 2016).Shea & Rodriguez, p. 260. In June 1971, Apple re-released \\"Sour Milk Sea\\", with \\"Fall Inside Your Eyes\\" on the B-side,Castleman & Podrazik, p. 102. but this single also failed to chart. In 2010, Apple reissued Is This What You Want? as both an individual release and as part of the seventeen-disc box set titled The Apple Box.Joe Marchese, \\"Review: The Apple Records Remasters, Part 4 ‚Äì Harrison's Soulful Trio\\", The Second Disc, 18 November 2010 (retrieved 29 May 2016). \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" also appeared on the accompanying two-CD compilation, Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records.Stephen Thomas Erlewine, \\"Various Artists Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 May 2016). In conjunction with these releases, a mono mix of the song was made available for digital download. Lomax's 2015 box set Rare, Unreleased and Live, 1965‚Äì2012 includes live versions of \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" and \\"The Eagle Laughs at You\\", recorded by him for BBC Radio.Michael Halpin, \\"Jackie Lomax: Rare, Unreleased and Live, 1965‚Äì2012\\", Kaleidoscope, 15 May 2015; available at Michael Halpin Journalism (retrieved 8 February 2018). Critical reception and legacy On release in 1968, the single received favourable reviews from music critics. Derek Johnson of the NME called it a \\"raving r-and-b number\\" that was \\"powerfully interpreted\\" by Lomax and \\"peppered with twangs\\".Derek Johnson, \\"Top Singles Reviewed by Derek Johnson\\", NME, 31 August 1968, p. 6. Record World included the single among its Four-Star Picks and described the song as \\"Hard rock from one of the new Beatles prot√©g√©s\\" with Lomax \\"lay[ing] out the thick sound\\".\\"Single Reviews\\", Record World, 7 September 1968, p. 8. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, it subsequently retained a degree of renown among rock music fans. In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands,Greg Prato, \\"Freddie Mercury\\", AllMusic (retrieved 29 May 2016). was named after the track.Jones, p. 75. Writing for Rolling Stone in 1971, Ben Edmonds described the song as \\"excellent\\" but suggested that Lomax \\"seemed to get lost among the superstars\\" accompanying him.Ben Edmonds, \\"Jackie Lomax: Home Is In My Head\\", Rolling Stone, 24 June 1971; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Three years later, Andy Childs of ZigZag admired it as \\"a classic single ‚Äì a really dynamic rock song with Lomax in great voice\\". Among Beatles biographers, Bruce Spizer attributes the commercial failure of Lomax's \\"great rock single\\" to the simultaneous release of \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Those Were the Days\\",Spizer, The Beatles Solo on Apple Records, p. 341. while John Winn describes it as an \\"excellent debut\\" and \\"an inexplicable flop\\".Winn, p. 267. Simon Leng opines that the song \\"just wasn't catchy enough\\" in Lomax's reading and views the Beatles' \\"garage rendition\\" as superior.Leng, pp. 56, 57. Although he finds the musical arrangement and Lomax's singing slightly incongruous beside Harrison's philosophical lyrics, Ian Inglis recognises the track as \\"an early prototype of heavy metal, particularly in the interplay between drums and lead guitar and its relentless sequence of musical climaxes\\". Writing in Goldmine magazine in 2002, Dave Thompson included \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" and \\"Badge\\" in his list of the Harrison-written songs that \\"rank among the finest Beatles compositions of the group's final years\\", and he concluded: \\"the only regret is that neither of the latter two ever made it into a Beatles recording session.\\"Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 15. In his book on the making of the White Album, Uncut critic David Quantick describes the song as \\"excellent\\" and rues how, together with Harrison's \\"Not Guilty\\", it was passed over in favour of \\"old toot\\" such as \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" and \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\".Quantick, p. 111. Less impressed with the track, Richie Unterberger finds the lyrics \\"a blend of encouragement and mild scolding\\", while rating it \\"a serviceable hard-rock number with a bluesy boogie feel\\" next to the \\"considerably superior\\" \\"Savoy Truffle\\". In an online article for Mojo published shortly after Lomax's death in September 2013, Danny Eccleston described \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" as \\"a brilliantly excitable recording\\". He said that the single had become a \\"cult rendering\\" and attributed its lack of commercial success to an \\"accusatory tone\\" in Harrison's lyrics.Danny Eccleston, \\"Jackie Lomax ‚Äì How The Web Was Woven\\", mojo4music, 18 September 2013 (retrieved 29 May 2016). In his preview of Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed Is This What You Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album releases and praised \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" as, variously, a \\"get-off-your-ass rocker\\" and a \\"dynamite\\" track.David Fricke, \\"Apple Records' Top Five Albums\\", rollingstone.com, 10 July 2010 (retrieved 29 May 2016). Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered it to be \\"a knockout version\\".Greg Kot, \\"Top Box Sets 2010: From Bowie to Beatles' Apple reissues\\", PopMatters, 3 December 2010 (retrieved 29 May 2016). Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" \\"would've been one of the best songs on [the White Album] if George had kept it for himself\\",Douglas Wolk, \\"Various Artists Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records\\", Pitchfork Media, 23 November 2010 (retrieved 29 May 2016). while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as \\"sensational\\".David Cavanagh, \\"The Apple Remasters\\", Uncut, November 2010, p. 112. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song \\"a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker\\". In his liner notes to the compilation, Andy Davis, formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine, highlights \\"Sour Milk Sea\\" as \\"the greatest record The Beatles never made\\".Liner notes by Andy Davis, Come and Get It: The Best of Apple Records CD booklet (Apple/EMI, 2010; compilation produced by Andy Davis & Mike Heatley).

It uses alternative pedagogical tools to work with youth who are marginalized or at social or personal risk. Purpose Through the dynamic approach of art-based education, the \\"Social Circus\\" seeks to expand the opportunities of and teach valuable skills to marginalized youth. The Social Circus \\"recognizes and values the role of art and culture as powerful agents in the education of at-risk youth, producing knowledge, and promoting the interchange of ideas and experiences, impacting (Brazilian) society and the public organizations responsible for youth education.\\"Circo Educando Com Arte With rigorous training, interpersonal dialogue and expression, and the acquisition of goals through dedication, the social circus has the ability to alter the lives of at-risk youth. Autonomy, solidarity, self-esteem, physical-fitness, communication, and adaptability are some of the skills learned and practiced. While a career in the circus is one possible future to the youth who participate in the social circus, it is not the purpose. Rather, the objective is to increase self-awareness, individuality and collective unity, self-discipline and many other values through a pedagogical alternative in order to transform the vision and capabilities of at-risk youth. Methodology The Social Circus owes much of its use and success to its roots in arts education. Artistic expression often allows for the recognition of emotions and their articulation because art is a different language in itself. Art creates a basis for a greater understanding of new experiences, often not attained through a simple translation of verbal concepts which are not tied to the emotions of the individual. With a base in the circus arts, the social circus has the capacity to bring about a personal transformation in the performer and the spectator.http://www.cpdoc.fgv.br/cursos/bensculturais/teses/CPDOC2007CarolinaMachadodesennafigueiredo.pdf Another characteristic of the social circus is its universality and accessibility. Each person, in accordance with their abilities, is able to realize their own potential through the wide gamut of activities that the circus offers: one can participate in juggling, trapeze, acrobatics, contortionism, clowning, magic, balancing acts, etc. Thus, she who does not have the flexibility required to be a contortionist can find refuge in balancing acts; he who does hot have the ability to do trapeze can act and be a clown; someone not interested in the physical activities has an opportunity to work with the set, lighting, or costumes. Furthermore, the social circus lacks barriers to entry: one does not have to know how to read and write in order to participate. Often, the youth have already developed skills in dancing, singing, and percussion‚Äì activities which, generally not valorized, take on importance in the social circus. Such inclusive characteristics add to the social circus' success by attracting youth from all backgrounds, ensuring participation and access. The demands and necessities of the circus arts give rise to personal transformation. Self-discipline is an absolute requisite with the constant practices, daily difficulties, and physical risks that characterize the social circus. Youth learn to push through these challenges, with their own efforts, and in doing so discover that they are capable and valuable beings. The social circus allows for at-risk youth to realize their own potential through the challenges that the circus brings, making them feel accomplished. Upon discovering that they are capable and intelligent beings, they start to deconstruct paradigms that they originally thought to be true. For example, Brazilian youth reevaluate the commonly held beliefs that everyone who lives in the favela is stupid, that every street child does not have a purpose or future, etc. These beliefs end up becoming a barrier to the self-development of the youth, and circus activities let them break such paradigms. The structure and characteristics of the circus allow the youth to discuss and engage in free thought, often under the pretext of circus technicalities. Social relationships and generally taboo yet relevant topics are discussed, such as sexuality, gender, inclusion, prejudice, and discrimination. Such debate and discussion expands youth perspective while increasing their confidence, tolerance, and knowledge. =The Circle= A Roda, or the Circle, is an integral part of the social circus. It refers to the scheduled hour in which students and leaders of the social circus gather for a discussion on the status, successes, and problems of the circus. The Circle's ritual and physical shape embody a moment of complicity in which everyone is in harmony, subjectively thinking together, although differently, about solutions, paths, and options for the daily questions and challenges. This youth reflection represents the right for everyone to speak, disagree, express opinions, and make contributions. The Circle's dialog is essential to the Social Circus' pedagogical method, as it contributes to the composition of a liberal, critical, and democratic education. By participating in the Circle, the participating youth develop a conscientiousness born through hearing other opinions and thoughts and through the articulation of their own. Reflection, dialog, and communication are elements that allow youth to take into account their place in the world, decisions, errors, and questions. Such personal analysis has direct implications to the development of the youth's reality and even his perception of reality. They learn to coexist in a peaceful, constructive, and respectable manner, and in doing so, implement such behavior into their daily lives. The Circle gives youth an opportunity to vocalize their thoughts and ideas, to hear other opinions on their own, and to sometimes see their opinions incorporated into the social circus. This process valorizes the youth who in turn perceives the importance of his own knowledge. Thus, a transformation ensues: once seeing himself as incapable and inadequate, the youth, through the Circle, becomes a confident and conscious being, with increased self-esteem and self-awareness.

Cezar (born December 1, 1951) is a retired Filipino professional basketball player in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He was part of the fabled Crispa Redmanizers ballclub that won two PBA Grand Slams, in 1976 and 1983. He won the Most Valuable Player award in 1980. He was also a many-time Philippine national team player in the 1970s. He was also known by the monikers Tapal King and The Scholar. PBA career Coming from the JRU Heavy Bombers, some consider Cezar the best ‚Äúthinking‚Äù power forward in the history of the PBA. He is the perfect example of a power forward with finesse, unlike contemporary \\"four\\" players like Marc Pingris, Eric Menk and Danny Ildefonso, and much earlier, Alvin Patrimonio and Nelson Asaytono, who rely primarily on sheer power and brute strength. Though barely 6'3\\" and less than 200 pounds, he was usually given the unenviable task of guarding tall imports from opposing teams. On defense, his unusually long arms served him in good stead, using them in his famous \\"umbrella-like\\" defense and two-handed shot- blocks. And though he played the No. 4 position for most of his career, he was like a second point guard on the floor, often orchestrating big plays and dishing out timely passes. He could also run the floor and finish fastbreaks with his patented \\"stretch\\" lay-up. He is best remembered as the very first one-on-one champion of the league when he defeated Ramon Fernandez in the finals of the 1979 Sprite One-on-One challenge where he won P25,000.00. In 2000, he was named as one of the PBA's 25 greatest players of all-time in elaborate awards ceremonies that highlighted the 25th anniversary of the league. In 2005, he was one of the twelve initial inductees to the PBA Hall of Fame alongside fellow Crispa players Atoy Co and Bogs Adornado, and Toyota stalwarts Robert Jaworski, Francis Arnaiz and Fernandez together with former PBA Commissioners Leo Prieto, Emerson Coseteng and Atty. Rudy Salud as well as legendary Crispa coach and team manager, respectively, Virgilio \\"Baby\\" Dalupan and Danny Floro, and the late anchorman Joe Cantada. He finished his illustrious PBA career as the No.6 all-time leading scorer with 12,077 points behind Fernandez, Abet Guidaben, Patrimonio, Atoy Co and Asaytono. He also is the fifth all-time best rebounder with 5,834 total rebounds behind Fernandez, Guidaben, Jerry Codi√±era and Patrimonio and was No. 2 in shotblocks with 1,370. He also had 3,130 assists (3.4 assists per game), 599 steals, converted 2066/2767 free throws in 28127:05 minutes played in 918 games. He, along with Fernandez, are the only two players in PBA history who has accumulated at least 12,000 points, 5,000 rebounds and 1,000 shot blocks. =Career highlights= *Member of the 1976 and 1983 Crispa Grand Slam Team *1-time Most Valuable Player (1980) *7-time Mythical First Team Selection (1976, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1987) *2-time Mythical Second Team Selection (1984, 1985) *2-time PBA All-Star *4-time All Defensive Team Member (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988) *Member, PBA's 25 Greatest Players *Member, PBA Hall of Famehttp://www.pba.com.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=462&Itemid;=59 *Member, 5,000 & 10,000 points clubs *Member, 1,000 offensive rebounds club *Member, 2,000 defensive rebounds club *Member, 2,000 assists club *Member, 900 & 1,000 shotblocks clubs *Member, 500 steals club Coaching career After his retirement, Cezar went to coaching.

In 2000, he coached the San Juan Knights to a championship in the now defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association beating the Negros Slashers in six games, 4-2. In 2004, he was named commissioner of the Universities and Colleges Athletic Association for its third season. In 2005, he accepted the job as the new head coach of the Philippine School of Business Administration. In 2013, he was appointed by then Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada as head of Manila's sports council, which aims to prioritize youth volleyball, swimming, track and field, chess, badminton, table tennis, and basketball, along with coaching and training clinics at the elementary and high school levels.

Political career He also served as a long-time Vice Mayor of the municipality of San Juan first under Mayor (now Senator) Jinggoy Estrada. Months prior to the 2001 elections, he was appointed as Acting Mayor of San Juan while then Mayor Estrada was serving his suspension due to the plunder charges leveled against the latter and his father, former Philippine President Joseph Estrada. Quotes *from Rudy Salud, former PBA Commissioner - \\"As a player, Fernandez should be ranked No. 1. With his skills, I would rank him No. 1. But one little shade below him, very little shade, is Philip Cezar, a natural talent. In fact, they could even be a dead heat. Viewed from my angle, it's Fernandez in a photo finish, followed by Cezar. But viewed from the other side, it could be the other way around. Fernandez was tall, a natural advantage. He was quick, he had agility. For a tall player, he handled the ball very well. But all of those things - height, ball handling, agility - mayroon din si Cezar (Cezar also has).\\" *from Tommy Manotoc, former coach at Crispa - \\"Simple lang ang basketball kay Philip. (Basketball was a simple thing for Philip) He was one of our headiest players. He knew the game. He studied his opponents so well that he knew their every move.\\" *from Ron Jacobs, former coach of San Miguel Beer - \\"Probably the player I respect more than any other was Philip Cezar. I thought he was a great defensive player and, at that time, the reputation was there were certain people who would take cheap shots at other players. Philip never did that. He really played straight up and I really respected him for that. And I respected his game.\\" *from Tim Cone, coach of the San Mig Coffee - \\"He's called 'Tapal King.' He's got pretty long hands, and he's a good defender. He's awesome, he's the great reason why Crispa was successful. He does the dirty work for the team. Aside from being a good defender, he can also score if he wants. You must admire him because Crispa that time was loaded with so many good shooters like Freddie Hubalde, William Adornado and Atoy Co but Philip can still finish in double figures.\\"  References  External links *https://web.archive.org/web/20121208072235/http://www.pba.ph/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20051127095357/http://www.myglobe.com.ph/portal/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=3509 *http://www.geocities.com/maong69/pba.cezar.html *http://www.teenfad.ph/news/archives/why25.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20060317200024/http://www.turbochargers- pba.com/dinner.shtml Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Asian Games competitors for the Philippines Category:Barangay Ginebra San Miguel players Category:Basketball players at the 1974 Asian Games Category:Basketball players from Metro Manila Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Crispa Redmanizers players Category:Filipino men's basketball coaches Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:Filipino sportsperson- politicians Category:Great Taste Coffee Makers players Category:Jos√© Rizal University alumni Category:Mayors of San Juan, Metro Manila Category:JRU Heavy Bombers men's basketball players Category:People from San Juan, Metro Manila Category:Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars Category:Philippines men's national basketball team players Category:Power forwards (basketball) Category:Shell Turbo Chargers players ","title":"Philip Cezar"},{"id":"6646738","text":"The Scottsdale Unified School District (SUSD) is a school district with its headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona.\\"Inicio.\\" Scottsdale Unified School District.

Description Rock Sandpiper on the Humboldt Bay North Jetty, near Eureka, California Adults have short yellow legs and a medium thin dark bill. The body is dark on top with a slight purplish gloss and mainly white underneath. The breast is smeared with grey and the rump is black. The Pribilof Islands subspecies of this bird shows a bold black belly patch. Breeding Their breeding habitat is the northern tundra on Arctic Pacific coast of Alaska and the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands. The birds also breed in Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands. The breeding pair is usually monogamous, with pair bonds usually lasting several years. They nest on the ground either elevated on rocks or in lower damp location. The males makes several scrapes; the female choose one and lays 4 eggs. Both the male and female take the responsibility for incubation. =Subspecies= There are four subspecies of rock sandpipers: *C. p. tschuktschorum, (Portenko, 1937), breeds in Chukchi Peninsula and western Alaska. *C. p. ptilocnemis, (Coues, 1873), breeds in the Pribilof Islands & on /Hall and St. Matthew Islands. *C. p. couesi, (Ridgeway, 1880), breeds in the Aleutian Islands and on the Alaskan Peninsula. *C. p. quarta, (Hartert, 1920), breeds on the south of the Kamchatka Peninsula and in the Kuril and Commander Islands. Migration Birds migrate south to rocky ice- free Pacific coasts in winter. The subspecies leap frog each other for winter, with more northerly breeders passing south of more southerly breeders. It can form rather large wintering flocks. Rock Sandpipers which spend the non- breeding season in the Pacific Basin, Alaska, have to endure harsh conditions where they rely on high prey quality, especially of their primary prey - the bivalve Macoma balthica. Diet Newly hatched chick These birds forage on rocky coasts. They mainly eat insects, mollusks, marine worms, also some plant material. It often feeds up to its breast in water, and often swims. It roosts on rocks near its feeding grounds just above the high tide spray.

There are two secondary schools, St Mary's Roman Catholic High School on Newbold Road, which is usually rated in the top ten to twenty state schools in the country each year by The Times schools league tables, and Outwood Academy Newbold on Highfield Lane. The school reopened in 2006 after being rebuilt with the aid of government funding. The school was previously split across 2 locations known as Upper Site and Lower Site, and both buildings were ageing and badly in need of replacement. Saint John's Church of England parish church was built in 1857,John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales 1870‚Äì72 and its churchyard contains the grave of John Lauder (died 1882), the father of Sir Harry Lauder.Wallace, William, with Lauder-Frost, Gregory, Harry Lauder in the Limelight, Lewes, East Sussex, 1988, p.18, and 40n, Derbyshire Times Next door to the church is 'The Eagle Club'. Also on St John's Road there are two veterinary practices and a police house. A path to the left of the Nag's Head pub leads past a late-Saxon chapel, which belonged to the local Roman Catholic Eyre family, and contains 12 coffins in a crypt. Eyre's chapel stands geographically on the highest point of Newbold Village. It was used as the local Roman Catholic church for many years until the present church, on the corner of Littlemoor and Dukes Drive, was built in the mid-1960s. Due to persistent vandalism, the chapel windows were bricked up in the 1970s and access restricted. More recently, some restoration of the chapel has taken place. Nearby is the Barnett Observatory on Hastings Close, which is a member of the Federation of Astronomical Societies. The name of Hastings Close is linked to the Battle of Hastings, and the name of Dukes Drive is linked to the large local landholdings which used to be held by the Duke of Devonshire, and this road was built on land sold by the duke for residential housing in the 1930s. In the early 1960s the road leading off Littlemoor, by the side of the Goldminers public house, was named Windermere Road. It used to be called Bargh's Lane and had a row of old stone cottages. Bargh's Lane led to open farmland until the building of the council estates. There is now a private dentist's practice on the corner of Windermere and Littlemoor, which is situated next-door to a pharmacy (Dent's Chemists), the doctor's (Newbold Surgery) and Newbold Library. There is a collection of shops, pubs to the north and a new indoor and outdoor Tennis Academy to the south near Chesterfield FC's original football ground at Saltergate. Towards the end of Newbold Road there is Holme Brook Reservoir and Country Park, designated a site of Importance for Nature and Conservation. It is host to a variety of plants, insects and animals with a large woodland plantation. It is also home to the increasingly rare Skylark. It has popular walking and cycling routes, some of which lead to Linacre Reservoirs. Early history Newbold is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1066, where it is spelt Newebold. Newbold had 6 berewicks within it, and was given greater importance than Chesterfield. Today the opposite is true: Chesterfield has become much larger and has enveloped Newbold. It says, under the heading of 'The lands of the King':The King held a number of Derbyshire manors. These included, but are not limited to: Newbold, Wirksworth, Unstone and Weston-on-Trent > In Newbold with six berewicks ‚Äì Old Whittington, Brimington, Tapton, > Chesterfield, Boythorpe, Eckington ‚Äì there are six carucates and one bovate > to the geld.

Biography Barrett was born in Philadelphia in 1933. He was an early fifties successful independent black record producer, influential in shaping the New York rhythm and blues sound. Barrett discovered and promoted Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers, the Chantels, Little Anthony & the Imperials, the Valentines, and the Three Degrees. He managed the Chantels in the 1950s, and later managed the Three Degrees from the early 1960s until the early 1980s, producing many of their albums, and conducting the orchestra at their live shows. As an artist, he is most famous for co-writing (with Leiber and Stoller) and recording, as Richie Barrett, the song \\"Some Other Guy\\". Barrett sang lead for the Valentines from 1954 to 1957. Ronnie Bright, who later joined the Cadillacs and the Coasters, sang bass. Barrett co-wrote two songs with Carl Hogan (also from the Valentines). One was \\"Be Sure My Love,\\" which was recorded by the Dubs on Gone Records in 1958; and another, \\"So Much,\\" was recorded by Little Anthony & the Imperials on End Records in 1958, and also recorded by the Attributes. On the Chantels' single \\"Maybe\\" (1958), Barrett played piano, bass, and drums. Barrett produced several of the Chantels' records. Barrett's first single was a cover of the Fleetwoods' \\"Come Softly to Me\\", with the Chantels as backing vocalists. He recorded \\"Some Other Guy\\" in 1962, a tune modeled on Ray Charles' \\"What'd I Say\\" and was assured immortality, if not a hit single, following cover versions performed by the Beatles and other Liverpool groups of the time, including the Searchers and the Big Three. A clip of the Beatles performing the song at the Cavern was shown on a regional television program screened by Granada TV in the north- west of England in August or September 1962 shortly after the band fired their previous drummer Pete Best and replaced him with Ringo Starr, and this low- quality footage has been included on many videos and DVDs since that time. There was a recording by Richard T. Barrett called \\"Try To Be Happy\\" b/w \\"Your Gentle Heart\\", released on Maarc Records #1542, in 1962. This may be a different singer. In 1998, Ben Vereen portrayed Barrett in the film bio about Frankie Lymon called Why Do Fools Fall in Love. Barrett died of pancreatic cancer in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania on August 3, 2006.

It was particularly noted for its ornate woodwork. History Funds for a light near Quantico, Virginia were appropriated in 1872. An engineering study recommended instead that lights be built downstream, and an appropriation was made in 1874 to build a light on Port Tobacco Flats, with a day beacon for Mathias Point. By the time construction began the two were switched, and the light was completed in 1876. Matthias Point was like no other screw-pile structure on the bay, with much decorative woodwork and a distinctive three tiered structure that some described as resembling a wedding cake. It was intended that this light replace that at Upper Cedar Point; in the end the number of complaints led to the latter's reactivation in 1882.

As the owl lay stunned on the field, Moreno, from the opposing team, kicked it approximately 3 meters (~10 feet) to the touchline. Shortly after, he claimed he was prompting it to fly away\\"Football player faces sanctions for kicking injured owl in Colombia\\", The Canadian Press, February 28, 2011. but in a later interview he admitted \\"The kick was a product of tension on the field at the time.\\" The owl was treated for its injuries at a local veterinary clinic, but later died of stress related to the incident. Moreno received a two-match ban, a $560 fine from Colombian football's governing body in addition to veterinary costs for the owl's treatment and was ordered to do community service at a zoo.

Route description View north along VT 7A in Manchester Center VT 7A begins at the southern end of the US 7 limited-access highway in Bennington. It heads northwest on Northside Drive for roughly six blocks, then turns north to follow the Ethan Allen Highway at the southern terminus of VT 67A. Upon passing under VT 279, VT 7A begins to parallel US 7\\\\. The two routes eventually reconnect by way of the Bennington North State Highway before US 7 veers off to the northeast. VT 7A, meanwhile, continues north into Shaftsbury. Just inside Shaftsbury, VT 7A passes by the Robert Frost Stone House Museum. The route continues north to the village of South Shaftsbury, where it meets VT 67\\\\. North of the village, VT 7A curves slightly to the northeast as it enters Arlington. Here, the route travels past the Norman Rockwell Gallery and Exhibition and overlaps with VT 313\\\\. Outside of the village of Arlington, VT 7A takes on a more pronounced northeasterly routing into Manchester. The route passes near Hildene and serves the historic site by way of Hildene Road, then continues on to Manchester Center. Here, VT 7A intersects VT 11 and briefly overlaps VT 30 before exiting the village and entering the town of Dorset, where the route ends at another junction with US 7\\\\. Some drivers prefer VT 7A over the nearby four-lane US 7 freeway during the winter because it is significantly lower in elevation (up to lower than the freeway at points), so driving conditions are generally better during storms.

The group was formed by Haroon Rashid, lead vocalist, who was soon joined by keyboardist Faakhir Mehmood and lead guitarist Asad Ahmed. Awaz were one of the pioneer bands of the local pop music scene and were highly skilled and talented musicians, producers and composers. The band's skill at composing and producing was often overlooked and the focus was on their good looks, glossy videos, catch songs and wild stage performances. Awaz is also regarded as one of the most successful bands in Pakistan having sold more than 5 million albums worldwide.Haroon Biography Retrieved on 27 December 2010 Awaz achieved commercial success in Pakistan with the release of their self-titled debut album, Awaz, in 1993. The single \\"Janeman\\" from their debut album was an instant hit as they became the first band from South Asia to appear on MTV in April 1992, composed by lead vocalist Haroon Rashid, produced by Haroon and Faakhir and lyrics written by Sarmed Mirza and Haroon. Their second studio album, Jadoo Ka Charagh, released in 1995, which included hit singles \\"Jadoo Ka Charagh\\" and \\"Shawa\\". The album proved to be better than the first studio release and stood up to everybody's expectations. In 1996, the band went on to record and release their third studio album, Shola, which included their biggest hit song \\"Mr. Fraudiay\\". Their third album comprised elements of western music and less traditional eastern music unlike the previous albums had. The very patriotic number Ay Jawaan was one of their most loved songs, followed by Jadoo Ka Chiragh and the comic, Mr Fraudiye. Due to a dispute between the members in late 1999, Haroon and Faakhir went on to pursue their solo careers while Asad Ahmed formed Karavan. After the release of their third studio album, the band fell apart due to the differences among the three members, vocalist Haroon Rashid and keyboardist Faakhir Mehmood went on to pursue a career as a solo singer and lead guitarist Asad Ahmed went on to forming his own band, Karavan. History =Formation (1992)= Haroon Rashid, during his college years at Washington D.C., thought of the name \\"Awaz\\" for the band and after graduating with a degree in Business Administration from the George Washington University he returned to Pakistan. First, he recruited keyboardist and friend Faakhir Mehmood and then the former The Barbarians lead guitarist, Asad Ahmed, whom he met at a performance in Marriott Hotel, Islamabad, in November 1992.Haroon Interview Retrieved on 27 December 2010Assad Ahmed Biography Retrieved on 27 December 2010 Awaz was formed in December of that year.

The band went on to make a video for the single \\"Janeman\\", from their self-titled debut album, on a shoestring budget of Rs. 15,000 sponsored by a private company based in the capital, Islamabad. The band sent the video to all local TV stations and record labels but the overall response was very negative and nobody showed any interest. Says Haroon \\"They responded by saying 'stick to your day job.' but I was stubborn and decided to send it off to MTV Asia to see what happens\\" and the song \\"Janeman\\" became the first ever Urdu/Hindi pop song to air on MTV on 20 April 1992. The song was composed by Haroon himself when he only 16 years old, and the lyrics were written by Sarmed Mirza. =Success (1993‚Äì1996)= After the release of the music video, Awaz started to gain success as the song made a great impact locally. This was the band's initial break-out and after that many record labels and local TV stations called the band with several offers.

Commonly the salt is known as \\"basic iron acetate\\". The formation of the red-brown complex was once used as a test for ferric ions.  Structure and synthesis  Basic iron acetate forms on treating aqueous solutions of iron(III) sources with acetate salts. A typical precursor is freshly precipitated iron oxide/hydroxide, which is halide-free. Early work showed that the cation is trinuclear. The Fe centres are equivalent, each being octahedral, being bound to six oxygen ligands, including a triply bridging oxide at the center of the equilateral triangle. This paper describes the isostructure chromium and iron compounds. The compound was an early example of a molecular complex of iron that features an oxide ligand. The cation has idealized D3h symmetry.  Reactions  The terminal aqua ligands on the trimetallic framework can be substituted with other ligands, such as pyridine and dimethylformamide. Many different salts are known by exchanging the anion, e.g. [Fe3(Œº3-O)(OAc)6(H2O)3]Cl. Reduction of the cation affords the neutral mixed-valence derivative that contains one ferrous and two ferric centers. Mixed metal species are known such as [Fe2CoO(OAc)6(H2O)3].  Related compounds  Chromium(III), ruthenium(III), vanadium(III), and rhodium(III) form analogous compounds. Iron(III) acetate (lacking the oxo ligand) has been claimed as a red coloured compound from the reaction of silver acetate and iron(III) chloride.  Uses  Materials prepared by heating iron, acetic acid, and air, loosely described as basic iron acetates, are used as dyes and mordants. Iron acetate is often brushed upon untreated wood to give it an aged appearance.

Taxa within Holothuriida were previously classified in the order Aspidochirotida, which was determined to be polyphyletic in 2017. Some taxa were also reclassified into the clades Synallactida and Persiculida.  Description and characteristics  They are distinguished from other sea cucumbers by the presence of flattened, often leaf-like tentacles, but without the other large appendages found in the related order Elasipodida. They do not have introvert or retractor muscles.An illustrated key to the sea cucumbers of the South Atlantic Bight Retrieved 2012-02-12. The tube feet often form a clearly demarcated sole. They have 15-30 shield-shaped retractile tentacles surrounding their mouths. The body wall is thick and leathery and contains ossicles, including some table-shaped ones. They have respiratory trees for gas exchange. The mesentery of the posterior loop of their gut is attached to the right ventral interradius. The muscles that run longitudinally down the body are arranged into five double bands. They can shoot out sticky white threads known as cuvierian tubules from their cloacas in order to distract or entangle predators. They are usually found in exposed shallow-water environments.Order Aspidochirotida Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-02-10.

The policy was changed in 2006 by another vote of the General Assembly.PC(USA) - 217th General Assembly (2006) - GA overwhelmingly approves Israel/Palestine recommendation Divestment The church stated in 1971 (UPCUSA) and 1976 (PCUS) that it has a responsibility to ensure that its funds (such as the Pension Trust for Retired Church Workers) be invested responsibly and consistent with the church's mission. The reunited church formed the Committee for Mission Responsibility Through Investing (MRTI) in 1986. The MRTI Committee carried out the General Assembly's wish to engage in shareholder activism and as a last resort, divest itself of companies which contravened the GA's position. Divestment follows a phased process that starts with attempted dialog and shareholder resolutions and ultimately the total sale of and future ban on the church's holdings in a company.PC(USA) - Mission Responsibility Through Investment (MRTI) - Faith-based investing - What Is MRTI? The church did so with companies cooperating with the apartheid regime in South Africa. As of 2007, the PC(USA) has divested itself from nineteen companies involved in military-related production (large contractors, manufacturers of anti-personnel landmines and weapons of mass destruction), tobacco companies, and companies engaged in or supporting governments in human rights violations. In the latter category, the church most recently divested itself from Talisman Energy, which was accused of collaboration with the Sudanese government. After Talisman withdrew from Sudan, the General Assembly voted to remove it from the divestment list.Microsoft Word - 07 ga divestment list.doc Early communications with Israel In March 2002, General Assembly Clerk Clifton Kilpatrick sent a letter to Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon stating in part, \\"While we do not condone the acts of violence by certain Palestinian extremists, we are appalled that Israel, in response, has continued to punish the entire Palestinian population and its leaders who have been your government's partners in the peace process.\\" 2004 General Assembly resolution In June 2004, the PC(USA) General Assembly met in Richmond, Virginia, and adopted by a vote of 431‚Äì62 a resolution that called on the church's committee on Mission Responsibility Through Investment \\"to initiate a process of phased, selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel\\". The resolution expressed the church's support of the Geneva Accord, said that \\"the occupation ... has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict\\", \\"the security of Israel and the Israeli people is inexorably dependent on making peace with their Palestinian neighbors\\", \\"horrific acts of violence and deadly attacks on innocent people, whether carried out by Palestinian suicide bombers or by the Israeli military, are abhorrent and inexcusable by all measures, and are a dead-end alternative to a negotiated settlement\\", that the United States government needed to be \\"honest, even-handed broker for peace\\", supported the idea of a United Nations peacekeeping force to ensure security in Palestinian territory, and urged \\"the U.S. government, the government of Israel, and the Palestinian leadership to move swiftly, and with resolve, to recognize that the only way out of this chronic and vicious impasse is to abandon all approaches that exacerbate further strife, lay aside arrogant political posturing, and get on with forging negotiated compromises that open a path to peace\\". A second resolution passed \\"Calling for an End to the Construction of a Wall by the State of Israel\\". The resolution opposed the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction. In separate votes, the General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting Christian Zionism as being incompatible with Presbyterian theology on the grounds of it being an offshoot of premillennial dispensationalism.PC(USA) - 216th General Assembly (2004) - Overture 04-34 Criticism of resolution Together, the resolutions caused dissent within the church and some friction with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel. Other critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of antisemitism. Companies named for divestment In 2005, the Committee on Mission Responsibility Through Investment named five companies for initial focus and that it would engage in \\"progressive engagement\\" with the companies' management. The five companies, all based in the United States, were the following: Caterpillar Inc., Citigroup, ITT Industries, Motorola and United Technologies.PC(USA) - Mission Responsibility Through Investment (MRTI) - Faith-based Investing - August 2005 Focus List for progressive engagement General Assembly Council response to criticism In response, the PC(USA) General Assembly Council claimed that the PCUSA has \\"approved numerous resolutions on Israel and Palestine, repeatedly affirming, clearly and unequivocally, Israelis right to exist within permanent, recognized, and 'secure' borders\\".PC(USA) - Worldwide Ministries: Israel and Palestine - Resolution on Israel and Palestine The PC(USA) was not founded until 1983, but its predecessor denominations, the UPCUSA (\\"Northern\\" church) and PCUS (\\"Southern\\" church) made several official statements on ths issue. The Northern church recognized Israel's right to exist occurred in 1974. Both the PCUS and UPCUSA expressed their official support of the two-state solution in 1978 in response to the Sadat/Begin/Carter negotiations. Since then, the General Assembly of the reunited PC(USA) reaffirmed its support of a two-state solution in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003.Document Failed Of concern to some were calls by the PC(USA) for the Israeli government \\"to address justly the issue of the right of return for Palestinian refugees\\", which is a controversial issue. Resolutions endorsing a Palestinian right of return also passed the PC(USA) General Assembly in 2003 and 2004. A former Moderator of the General Assembly, Dr. Fahed Abu-Akel, has long endorsed a Palestinian \\"right of return\\". Change of policy in 2006 In June 2006, the Presbyterian Church (USA) 217th General Assembly overwhelmingly (483‚Äì28) replaced language adopted in 2004 that focused on the \\"phased, selective divestment\\" specifically on companies working in Israel. The new language clarified that the church should pursue its aims through the customary engagement process of its Committee on Mission Responsibility Through Investment, which can include divestment but only as a last resort. The new resolution required the consideration of \\"practical realities\\", a \\"commitment to positive outcomes\\", and an awareness of the potential impact of strategies on \\"both the Israeli and Palestinian economies\\". The 2006 resolution also recognized Israel's right to build a security barrier along its pre-1967 boundaries. The General Assembly acknowledged the \\"hurt and misunderstanding among many members of the Jewish community and within our Presbyterian communion\\" that resulted from the 2004 resolution and stated that the Assembly was \\"grieved by the pain that this has caused, accept responsibility for the flaws in our process, and ask for a new season of mutual understanding and dialogue\\". Reaction to change in policies After the 2006 Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly in Birmingham, advocacy groups on differing sides of the Israel-Palestine issue praised the resolution. Groups supporting the Israelis, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel, praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel. Groups supporting the Palestinians said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process. =Vigilance against anti-Jewish ideas and bias= In May 2008, the Interfaith Office of the PC(USA) issued a statement titled Vigilance against anti-Jewish ideas and bias.available at International Council of Christians and Jews This document stated that \\"Once again, many Presbyterians have become aware that strains of an old anti-Jewish tradition are present in the way we ourselves sometimes speak and in the rhetoric and ideas of some writers that we may read regarding\\" the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The statement reports that examples of \\"anti-Jewish theology can unfortunately be found in connection with PC(USA) General Assembly overtures\\". In June 2008 the church revised the document extensively. This resulted in a rebuke from the major Jewish denominations in a June 13, 2008 letter to the head of the PCUSALetter from Jewish Denomination Leaders to Stated Clerk Kirkpatrick, June 13, 2008 and a similar condemnation in the form of a statement from the denominations and ten other organizations.Jewish Agency Statement on PCUSA Revisions to anti-Jewish bias document, June 13, 2008 See also *Disinvestment from Israel *Academic boycotts of Israel *Disinvestment *Presbyterian Church (USA) Hezbollah controversy *Presbyterian Peace Fellowship References Category:Presbyterian Church (USA) Category:Disinvestment Category:International sanctions Category:Economy of Israel Category:Boycotts of Israel ","title":"Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) disinvestment from Israel controversy"},{"id":"6646937","title":"Wight Is Wight"},{"id":"6646958","text":"The Blackistone Island Light was a lighthouse located on what is now St. Clement's Island on the Potomac River in Maryland. It is best known as the target of a Confederate raid in the Civil War. Completed in 1851, the structure was destroyed by fire in 1956 and its shell was razed; a replica was completed in 2008. The lighthouse replica can be visited on weekends from June through October. After driving to the St. Clement's Island Museum, one may take a water taxi on weekends and walk the grounds. A cross is also on the island. The lighthouse is open on Saturdays and the first Sunday of every month from June through October. History Congress appropriated $3,500 for the construction of a lighthouse on the island in 1848; John Donahoo was awarded the contract, which cost $4,535. He designed an integral lighthouse, a two-story brick keeper's dwelling with a tower through its center, which sat on a plot at the southern tip of the island. Construction was completed, and the light lit, in 1851. The lighthouse, like many in the South, was a target for Confederate raiders. In 1864, CSA Captain John Goldsmith, a former owner of the island, led a party which destroyed the lighthouse lens and confiscated the oil used to light it; the group then declared its intent to destroy the structure. Keeper Jerome McWilliams, an acquaintance of the captain's, succeeded in convincing the men not to destroy the lighthouse because his wife was pregnant; he argued that destroying the family home would leave both her and the baby vulnerable. The United States Navy purchased the island in 1919 and razed most structures on it, leaving only the lighthouse and building piers and a landing strip. The light was automated in 1932 and left unattended, gradually decaying over the next twenty years. Fire gutted the structure on July 16, 1956; to this day, the cause of the blaze is uncertain, but many suspect that a stray artillery round fired from the proving ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, may have been to blame. In any event, the Navy viewed the shell as a hazard and ordered it razed. Through the efforts of the St. Clement's Hundred, a local community organization created for the preservation of St. Clement's Island, a replica of the Blackistone Lighthouse was constructed and completed in June 2008.

Career There is some confusion as to the year of Granger's birth. Legal documents including the Social Security Death Index lists it as 1911 as does her death certificate and the Ohio Birth Index, which gives the certificate number as 1911085869. Most biographies say 1912, although at least one site lists the year as 1914. Granger, with her parents, two brothers, Richard and James, and their grandmother, Clara (Wilcox) Granger, moved to Los Angeles during the late 1920s. Granger got her start in the entertainment industry when she won a beauty contest at the age of 13 at Silver Beach Summer Resort near Houston. Her budding figure and confident stage presence were perfect for studios that made comedy shorts. In 1930 her father took her to producer Hal Roach, who was then testing talent for his upcoming comedy series, The Boy Friends. Granger‚Äôs natural comedy timing got her the job immediately and she was placed under contract to Hal Roach Studios. She became a charter member of the two-reel-comedy community, appearing opposite many major comedians at Roach, Mack Sennett, Educational Pictures, Columbia Pictures, and RKO Radio Pictures. Among her famous credits are Hog Wild with Laurel & Hardy, The Dentist with W.C. Fields, Punch Drunks and Termites of 1938 with The Three Stooges. Granger also appeared with Andy Clyde, Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy, Harry Langdon, Gus Schilling & Richard Lane, and Joe DeRita, as well as on live television with Abbott & Costello. Granger is best remembered as the sarcastic, suspicious wife in Leon Errol‚Äôs series of two-reelers for RKO. For her body of work in two-reelers, Granger was known as the \\"Queen of the Short Subject Films\\". However, she also appeared in about 100 feature films, including Frisco Jenny, Sunset in El Dorado, Kentucky Kernels, Dick Tracy vs. Cueball, Diamond Jim, and Show Boat. Later years Granger worked on a variety of television shows through the 1950s, including The Abbott and Costello Show, I Married Joan, Father Knows Best, Topper, Lassie, Death Valley Days and Wells Fargo. Her last television performance was a live show on Face The Facts in 1961. Granger left show business in 1963, calling it an ‚Äúulcer factory.‚Äù Granger made her last public appearance in 1993 for the Screen Actors Guild‚Äôs 60th anniversary celebration. She was an honored guest at the celebration because she was one of SAG‚Äôs first members. In later years she helped her husband run an upholstery shop in Los Angeles. She was the stepmother of film maker and former record producer Anthony J. Hilder. Death Granger died of cancer on January 4, 1995 in Los Angeles, California.

He wrote the seminal book Theatrum Machinarum Generale (\\"The General Theory of Machines\\").  Early life  Jacob Leupold built many instruments needed for experimental physics studies. In 1699 Leupold's interests had fully changed to mechanics and mathematics.  Working life  In 1701 Leupold obtained a position as an economist in George Military Hospital, thus ensuring a regular income but not enough free time to dedicate himself to mechanics. Leupold's steam engine, 1720. In the 17th century, the main instruments for experimental physics were the telescope, the microscope, the pendulum clock and the vacuum pump, invented in 1656 by Otto von Guericke. Leupold is also credited as an early inventor of air pump. He designed his first pump in 1705, in 1707 he published a book \\"Antlia pneumatica illustrata\\". In 1711 following the advice of its president G. W. Leibniz, the Prussian Academy of Sciences acquired Leupold's pump. In 1715 Leupold became a member of academy. In 1720 Leupold started to work on the manuscript of Theatrum Machinarum. It was the first systematic analysis of mechanical engineering. It included, ahead of its time, a design for a high-pressure non-condensing steam engine, the likes of which were not built until the early 19th century. Theatrum machinarum consists of 10 illustrated volumes. It was published in Leipzig between 1724-1739.  Personal life  He married Anna Elizabeth and they had three sons and three daughters who all died young except for one daughter. His wife died in 1713. Leupold died on 12 January 1727 at age 53.

Lamont later directed the team's last few films in the 1950s. Plot Two sidewalk photographers, Tubby McCoy (Lou Costello) and Flash Fulton (Bud Abbott), aspire to work for the local newspaper. Their childhood friend, Dr. Bill Burns (Patric Knowles), invites them to come along on a call to a building fire. While attempting to photograph the inferno, Tubby is injured and brought to Burns' hospital. While they are there, Silky Fellowsby (Sheldon Leonard), a gangster who is admitted as a patient to establish an alibi for a robbery he is planning, mistake Tubby and Flash for two Detroit hitmen. He expects them to guard the bank's entrance while they rob it, while they mistakenly believe that they are hired to take photographs of the gang as they leave the bank. When the bank is robbed, Tubby and Flash are considered the prime suspects. Fellowsby heads to a ski resort in Sun Valley to \\"recuperate\\", hiring Burns and his nurse (Elyse Knox) to care for him. To clear their names, Tubby and Flash go to the resort, where they are hired as waiters. They attempt to retrieve the stolen cash by blackmailing the gangsters with the bank photographs, which turn out to be worthless since the robbers' faces are not shown. A fight ensues and after a climactic ski chase down the mountain, the gangsters are caught.

It was proposed to be the biblical Mount Sinai by Menashe Har-El, a biblical geographer at Tel Aviv University in his book The Sinai Journeys: The Route of the Exodus.The Sinai Journeys, The Route of the Exodus, Menashe Har-El, Ridgefield Publishing, San Diego, pp. 420-421, 1983, . This location was used for Zondervan's NIV Atlas of the Bible.NIV Atlas of the Bible, C. Rasmussen, Zondervan, Grand Rapids, 1989, pp. 88-90.Is Mount Sinai in Saudi Arabia? Gordon Franz, 2000, 2001. Proposed locations Menashe Har-El examined the pros and cons of various theories on where Mount Sinai is located. These include: * the southern Sinai peninsula (including the traditional location of Gabal Horeb) * the northern Sinai peninsula * the central Sinai peninsula * the Suder valley in the west-central Sinai peninsula * Midian and Edom. All locations have proponents, but Gabal Horeb in the southern peninsula has been the traditional location since the 4th century AD (but notably not before). The Old Testament prophet Elijah, according to 1 Kings 19, is the last person recorded in the Bible as visiting Mount Sinai. The account of his visit does not give geographical details that help determine the actual location, but suggests the location was known long after the Jewish people left the mountain. Unfortunately, there are no surviving extra-biblical documents that mark the location. Whether the Second Temple's sacred books (given by Roman General Titus to Josephus) contained information on the location of Mount Sinai is unknown, but Josephus did write about the mountain. However, Dr. Har-El was a geologist and he discusses in detail the geographic and environmental markers in Sinai, which do survive to the present day. He notes how they compare with the biblical account. Dr. Har- El gave nine main reasons why he believed the traditional location of Gabal Horeb (Gabal Musa)in southern Sinai was not Mount Sinai: { style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; width:20pt;\\"  (a)  The geology, soils, and vegetation in the southern peninsula could not support the Jewish people for the year they dwelt there. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (b)  In southern Sinai, there are numerous oases, but they are not mentioned in the Bible (yet the Bible mentions in detail other oases and natural features on the Exodus route). - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (c)  Natural conditions in the southern Sinai would not have allowed for enough food (other than fish) for the Jewish people to survive. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (d)  There are fishing grounds in the southern Sinai, but the Jewish people complained in Numbers 11:5 that they missed the fish they used to eat in Egypt. Complaining of a lack of fish in one's diet when in southern Sinai it could be found nearby undermines this location as a candidate. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (e)  Southern Sinai does not lie on the route to Canaan or Kadesh-Barnea. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  (f)  Critically, southern Sinai does not lie on the route to Midian from Egypt. Moses had camped at Mount Sinai when returning to Egypt from Midian with his wife and son. He also met Aaron there when returning to Egypt from Midian (Exodus 4:27) on a different trip. Thus strongly suggests Mount Sinai was located near the ancient road connecting Egypt to Midian ‚Äì a road still used today as an Islamic pilgrimage route to Mecca from Egypt. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (g)  Mount Sinai should be three days journey from Egypt, based on Pharaoh's request of Moses in Exodus 8:24, and Exodus 5:3. This would rule out Mount Sinai being in southern Egypt, which was much further away. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (h)  There were copper and turquoise mines in southern Sinai that may have been guarded by the Egyptian army. The Jewish people are unlikely to have willingly remained near any military outposts after leaving their homes in Goshen. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (i)  Gabal Sin Bishar is eleven days journey to Kadesh-Barnea, fulfilling Deuteronomy 1:2. The candidates in southern Sinai are much further away. Dr. Har-El also argued against the other southern locations for the same reason. } Gabal Sin Bishar & Suder Valley Har-El believes the evidence supports Mount Sinai being located in the Suder Valley in the west-central Sinai Peninsula. His reasons include: { style=\\"text- align:left;\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center; width:20pt;\\"  (a)  This region is far enough from potential Egyptian armies in the mining region of the south and the road in the north along the Mediterranean Sea ‚Äì the Way of the Land of the Philistines ‚Äì to survive without encountering Egyptian troops. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (b)  The Suder Valley is located in an area known to have been used by Semitic people who traveled to Egypt (1 Kings 11:17‚Äì18). - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (c)  The meeting between Aaron and Moses (Exodus 4:27) likely took place on the road between Midian and Egypt, but closer to Egypt. - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (d)  The Suder valley fits the wilderness described in the Bible. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (e)  \\"Gabal Sin Bishar\\" means \\"the reporting of the law\\" or \\"the laws of man\\", and this is the only mountain where, possibly, the name \\"Sinai\\" has been preserved in the name \\"sin\\". - style=\\"vertical- align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (f)  Har-El cites Josephus' writings, who had access to the Jewish Temple's sacred books that he was given by Roman General Titus after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD. Josephus writes that the mountain was the highest mountain in its surroundings. The prominence of Gabal Sin Bishar is tooth-shaped and stands out from its surroundings, despite being 618 meters above sea level and only 300 meters above the landscape. This also means it is not so high that it would be difficult for 80 year-old Moses to go up and down four times (Exodus chapters 19‚Äì34) or too difficult for the Aaron and the 70 elders to go up with him. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (g)  There are graves and pottery from the middle Bronze Age. - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (h)  There are circular piles of stones at the base of Gabal Sin Bishar (Exodus 24:4). - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (i)  Notably, it addresses Pharaoh's request to not go far outside of Egypt (three days from the border as prescribed in Exodus 3:24). - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (j)  There is a widespread presence of chalk and flint in Wadi Suder. (Exodus 4:24‚Äì26 records that Moses' son was circumcised on short notice using flint at the base of the mountain.) - style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  (k)  The pastureland and water nearby could have supported the Jewish people for a year. } Other evidence Dr. Har-El links Gabal Sin Bishar with a probable route the Jewish people took when fleeing Pharaoh across the Bitter Lakes, where Moses divided the Sea of Reeds. He also links Gabal Sin Bishar with the way stations and travel times the Jewish people took toward the Promised Land when they left Mount Sinai. Unfortunately, due to an Egyptian military presence near Gabal Sin Bishar, the ability of archeologists to further investigate this location is not an option.

It is the largest county fair in the state of Iowa. It has the largest agricultural exposition in North America. Bringing in over 310,000 visitors a year, the Clay County Fair is one of the largest county fairs in the United States. 2011 set attendance records of 328,000.Record-breaking year for Clay County Fair . Beginning in 1918, the fair has grown considerably over the past century. In its first year the Clay County Fair brought in 30,000 guests. In 1936 the fair completed the construction of its second grandstand, able to seat over 7,500 people, which it still uses today. During the 1930s the fair continued construction of agricultural buildings for livestock. The Clay County Fair has firmly planted itself as the largest Midwest county fair. The fair also hosts a carnival of over 80 rides and attractions. There are also many businesses that have booths all over the fair. It consists of over 35 square city blocks of space,Google Map (Aerial View of Fairgrounds). and continues to fill up the space tighter and tighter every year. Some familiar people/groups who have visited and/or performed at the Clay County Fair are: Former President George W. Bush, Sen. John Kerry, former Vice President Al Gore, Bob Hope, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Johnny Cash, Tim McGraw, Kenny Rogers, Lee Ann Womack, Martina McBride, REO Speedwagon, The Righteous Brothers, Plus One, Clay Aiken, ZZ Top, LeAnn Rimes, Brad Paisley, Lee Greenwood, Bill Cosby, Red Skelton, Jim Nabors, Lonestar, Grand Funk Railroad, Garth Brooks, Survivor, Trisha Yearwood, Heart and Foreigner. On September 15, 2007 Aly and AJ played there for the first time in Iowa. With the completion of the Clay County Regional Events Center inside the fairground walls, new opportunities have opened. Some of these are indoor concerts. With seating up to 3,400 people, the events center has hosted The Barnum and Bailey Circus, and the Lipizzan Stallions. It also has a large ballroom/dining room capable of seating up to 400 people, just creating even more opportunities to flourish and grow. The Fair completed another project in 2007. The Race Track was modified into a 3/8 track. The previous track was a large, flat, half-mile oval that was generally used for horse racing. In order to host high-quality auto racing events, the fair deemed it necessary to construct a completely new racetrack. It was converted to a 3/8 mile clay track, with increased corner banking to adjust for the higher speeds of auto racing. Additionally, a state-of-the-art lighting system was installed to make the races more visible for both drivers and fans. In 2008, the racing schedule featured the International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) hosting two classes of racing; Modifieds and Stock Cars. Those races also included Hobby Stocks and 360 Modifieds. July 4, the WorldDirt Racing League (WDRL) also hosted a Late Model Series and 360 Sprints on the track. The season rounded out with an appearance by the World of Outlaws during the 2008 Clay County Fair and another race with IMCA Modifieds and Stock Cars, with Hobby Stocks and 360 Modifieds. In 2013 the Clay County Fair Association partnered with Iowa Lakes Community College to break the Guinness World Record for Largest Science Experiment. To achieve the record, Iowa Lakes Community College and the Clay County Fair had to get at least 750 people in the Grandstand and participating in a half-hour science lesson and experiment. The previous record was set in Oslo, Norway with 749 students in a junior high in November 2012. As part of the experiment, those in attendance participated in two experiments. The first experiment, according to Mark Zabawa, associate professor of chemistry and biology at ILLC's Emmetsburg campus, included mixing potassium iodide and hydrogen peroxide with detergent to create a foam resembling \\"elephant toothpaste.\\" The second included using leaf blowers to demonstrate kinetic energy. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, it was announced on Thursday, July 2, 2020, that the Clay County Fair was canceled for the 2020 season. The decision was announced following a vote by the Fair Executive Committee. After weeks of exploring various options, it became clear that it was simply impossible to maintain social distancing and protect the health and safety of fairgoers, staff, volunteers, 4-H/FFA youth, exhibitors, vendors, sponsors and entertainers during the nine-day event. Despite the cancelation, 4H and FFA livestock competitions were still held in the fall. The fair will reopen Sept. 11-19, 2021. This is only the fifth time the fair has been canceled in its history, and the first time the fair has been canceled since World War 2 (1942 through 1945).

Following their second live show, the band was offered a record deal with Dutch-based Dismemberment Records, after which they released their debut album, Embalmed Madness, now under the name of Prostitute Disfigurement in 2001. Both the debut album and the demo were recorded using a drum computer. Embalmed Madness was released during October 2001, in a limited quantity of 500 copies, which sold out in a few weeks. Quickly, 500 more were pressed and were again sold out quickly. The album got raving reviews in media such as Aardschok (Netherlands) and Legacy (Germany) and was re-released in 2004 through Unmatched Brutality Records?. More gigs made a live drummer mandatory, so local guy Tim Bazen joined. After Tim was enlisted, the band started to work on their second album, entitled Deeds of Derangement. It was recorded in early February 2003 and was released on the German-based Morbid records in August 2003. Again great reviews were received, yet despite this, guitarist Niels van Wijk left the band, and Benny Bats was asked to take over his position. To support the album, many gigs were performed, including festival appearances on Obscene Extreme, the Morbid festival and the Rotterdam Deathfest. Sharing stages with well-known acts like Suffocation, Exhumed, Gorerotted, Cannibal Corpse and Deicide fed the band only more. After 2 years of gigs Tim left the band and Michiel van der Plicht was asked almost immediately. He gladly took over the drum duties and, barely a month after he joined the ranks, the band entered Excess Studios to record their third album, entitled Left in Grisly Fashion. This album was released on Neurotic Records in 2005. The reviews were outstanding and Prostitute Disfigurment planned a European tour to mark it. The fourth full-length album was entitled Descendants Of Depravity. The album was released in October 2007 in Europe, with a U.S. release through Willowtip Records/Neurotic Records. They disbanded shortly after releasing Descendants Of Depravity, reasons are unknown. On 30 January 2010 they announced their reunion, Niels van Wijk rejoining the band and lead-guitarist Danny Tunker joining as a full new member. They confirmed a show at the Death Feast Open Air in Germany the same day.

It was named \\"Halal\\" because of the camels and sheep that used to graze around the mountain. The residents of the mountain are the Tarabin and Tiyaha tribes. The mountain has long been a refuge of smugglers and bandits and has been described as 'controlled by Bedouin outlaws'.

The perception of the mountain as a notorious hideout for terrorists began in 2004 after the 2004 Sinai bombings. Between 2004-5, the Egyptian Armed Forces conducted months-long security operations here. In 2012, the Egyptian Armed Forces launched \\"Operation Eagle\\" in another attempt to root out militants hiding on the mountain after the August 2012 Sinai attack. In March/April 2017, the Egyptian Armed Forces conducted a third security operation named 'Torrent 5' in which they claimed to have cleared the mountain of terrorist hideouts.

Despite its name, it is not a university (a status that can only be conferred by the government under certain conditions to larger institutions), but a limited company involved in research and some university- level education. The main idea behind establishing UNIS was that the unique geographic location of the island permits the study of Arctic sciences in situ, right outside the company walls.

On the basis that the Israelites travelled across the Sinai peninsula towards Petra in a fairly straight line, a number of scholars have contemplated the possibility of Har Karkom being the Biblical Mount Sinai. Following this theory, Emmanuel Anati excavated at the mountain, and discovered that it was a major paleolithic cult centre, with the surrounding plateau covered with shrines, altars, stone circles, stone pillars, and over 40,000 rock engravings.

He contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912‚Äì15), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917‚Äì27), and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914‚Äì28).http://www.blackpast.org/aah/abele-julian-f-1881-1950 He was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924‚Äì54). Abele's contributions to the Trumbauer firm were great, but the only building for which he claimed authorship during Trumbauer's lifetime was Duke University Chapel. Following Trumbauer's 1938 death, he co-headed the architectural firm and designed additional buildings at Duke, including Allen Administrative Building and Cameron Indoor Stadium.  Background  Julian Abele was born in Philadelphia into a prominent family. His maternal grandfather was Robert Jones, who in the late 18th century founded the city's Lombard Street Central Presbyterian Church. He was also related to Absalom Jones, who established the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in 1794, the first black church in Philadelphia. His nephew, Julian Abele Cook, worked as the Building Coordinator for Howard University, and Abele's son, Julian Francis Abele, Jr. was an architectural engineer. Abele worked in many media: watercolor, lithography, etching and pencil, wood, iron, gold and silver. He designed and constructed all of his own furniture, even doing the petit point himself. While he knew many historic styles, he seemed to love Louis XIV French most of all. Education Presentation drawing (1918) for the Free Library of Philadelphia. Although unsigned, this appears to be drawn by Abele. Abele attended the Quaker-run Institute for Colored Youth, which later became Cheyney University, where he excelled in mathematics and was chosen to deliver the commencement address.Webster, Josephine Faulkner. \\"Julian Francis Abele (1881-1950).\\" In Wilson, Dreck Spurlock (ed.), African-American Architects: A Biographical Dictionary, 1865-1945, 2004, pp. 1‚Äì3. Taylor & Francis. In 1898, he completed a two-year architectural drawing course at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art (PMSIA). He was the first black student admitted to the Department of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. This achievement was all the more noteworthy for the restrictions blacks faced at the university, including not being able to live in dormitories or dine in the school's cafeteria. On projects assigned to pairs of students, he partnered with Louis Magaziner, the only Jewish student in the department, who also faced discrimination. This was the beginning of a lifelong friendship between the two. He won a 1901 student competition to design a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway. His submission was in the form of an exedra - a curved bench flanked by piers, but with steps passing through its center. This became his first commission when it was built on the campus of Haverford College.\\"Gate on Haverford College Campus Linked to Black Architectural Pioneer Julian Abele,\\" Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, January 26, 2016. The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate stands at the Railroad Avenue entrance to the college.Conklin Memorial Gate, from Google Earth. He was widely respected among his peers, earning the nickname \\"Willing and Able\\", and also won student awards for his designs for a post office and a museum of botany, and he was elected as the president of the university's Architectural Society. He became the University of Pennsylvania architecture department's first black graduate in 1902. He worked part-time for a local architect and attend evening classes at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Under the financial sponsorship of Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, he traveled through France and Italy, an experience that was to influence his design work throughout his life. =√âcole des Beaux-Arts= Between 1903 and his hiring by Horace Trumbauer in 1906, Abele traveled throughout Europe. His descendants contend that he studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris during his stay. But Sandra L.

She allows that he may have been permitted to informally sit in on the school's atelier. She also notes that Abele listed travel to France, Italy, England, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain on his membership application to the American Institute of Architects (AIA), but not study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. Career Preliminary study for the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1916), possibly drawn by Abele Immediately after his graduation from UPenn in 1902, Abele traveled west to Spokane, Washington, where he designed a house for his sister, Elizabeth Abele Cook, before returning east.https://www.philadelphiabuildings.org/pab/app/ar_display.cfm/21458 In 1906, Abele joined the Trumbauer firm as assistant to chief designer Frank Seeburger. When Seeburger left the firm in 1909, Abele advanced to chief designer. Abele's stature within the firm was no secret; he was the second- highest paid employee. He was an architect. Art historian David B. Brownlee studied the 14-year effort to design and build the Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1914-28. He credits Trumbauer architect Howell Lewis Shay with the building's plan and massing, but notes that the final perspective drawings are in Abele's distinctive hand.David B. Brownlee, Making a Modern Classic: The Architecture of the Philadelphia Museum of Art (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1997), pp. 60‚Äì61, 72‚Äì73. Design of the exterior terracing, including the front steps celebrated in the 1976 film Rocky, is credited to Abele. Following Trumbauer's death in 1938, the firm continued until 1950 under the name \\"Office of Horace Trumbauer,\\" co-headed by Abele and William O. Frank. Commissions were hard to come by during The Depression and World War II, but the firm completed Duke Indoor Stadium at Duke University in 1940, which was renamed Cameron Indoor Stadium in 1972, and later made additions to Duke's Library (1948) and designed Duke's Allen Administrative Building (1954). When Abele joined the American Institute of Architects in 1942, Philadelphia Museum of Art director Fiske Kimball called him \\"one of the most sensitive designers in America\\".http://www.curbed.com/2015/1/16/10001296/julian-abele-black- architect-of-duke-university Smithsonian Magazine described him, in a career retrospective, as \\"probably the most accomplished [black architect] of his era.\\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/out-of-the-shadows-85569503/ Despite being the primary designer of Duke University, Abele was refused accommodations at a Durham hotel during a visit to campus.Henry Magaziner, son of Abele's U. of P. classmate and friend Louis Magaziner, in a 1989 interview.

Waite High School is a public high school located in east Toledo, Ohio that opened in 1914. It is part of the Toledo Public Schools. It is named after Morrison R. Waite, a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who is famous for overseeing the Alabama Claims case. Waite replaced the original Central High School when Toledo Public Schools decided it couldn't afford to have 3 high schools for the 1914-15 school year. (Scott High School had opened in 1913.) The Waite Indians are members of the Toledo City League and their school colors are purple and gold. However, the Indian nickname is not for Native Americans. When the school was first opened, the Toledo Fire Department had an annual competition that involved running and pulling the fire truck. The team from the East Side was called the Indians. Someone thought it would be a good idea to name the school's athletic teams after the Fire Department team. The Indians have a rivalry with fellow East Toledo City League rival Clay. The rivalry ended in 2019. They had a football rivalry from 1914 thru 1963 with Scott High School that was played every Thanksgiving morning and generated much interest across the Midwest. That game is now played on the final Friday of October and, with the closings of Libbey and DeVilbiss High Schools, has become once again the top rivalry for both high schools. Waite has named their football stadium after their successful coach, Jack Mollenkopf, who also coached football at Purdue. Waite was a national high school football power in the 1920s, traveling as far as California. In 1927, they played away games on successive Fridays in Portland, Oregon and Portland, Maine. Travel was by train. They were crowned National High School Champions in 1924 and again in 1932. In 1924 they went 10-0 under Coach Joe Collins to win the title. In 1932, under Coach Don McCallister and Assistant Frank Pauly, they defeated Miami High School 13-7 in Miami to finish 12-0 and win the honor.

Heiler came from a Roman Catholic family. 1918 he became Privatdozent in University of Munich, from where he 1920 moved to theological faculty of the University of Marburg, where he became professor 1922. Dissatisfied with tridentine Roman Catholicism of his time he became Lutheran through the Evangelical Catholic influence of liberal Nathan S√∂derblom after meeting him in Sweden 1919 and receiving Holy Communion in Lutheran church. Soon he became directly involved with Lutheran High Church movement in Germany and 1929 became chairman of Hochkirchliche Vereinigung Augsburgischen Bekenntnisses. Heiler never completely abandoned his Roman Catholic faith, but developed further the idea of \\"Evangelical Catholicity\\" based on Augsburg Confession from his own liberal Catholic point of view. He, for example, did not approve the traditional Lutheran doctrine of forensic justification. Heiler favored Franciscan spirituality and he influenced the foundation of Lutheran Franciscan Third Order (Evangelische Franziskaner- Tertiaren) 1927 within Hochkirchliche Vereinigung. Later the issue of the absence of Apostolic succession in Evangelical Church in Germany caused the foundation of Hochkirchliche St.-Johannes-Bruderschaft. Heiler became the Apostolischer Vorsteher of the St.-Johannes-Bruderschaft, arranging to receive the episcopal consecration from a bishop of the Gallican Church, Petrus Gaston Vigu√© (from the succession line of Joseph Ren√© Vilatte). As a historian of religion, after studying Asian religions, Heiler developed a Modernist view and favored the idea that the \\"one holy church\\" includes also non-Christian faiths. He also had a long literary feud with Sadhu Sundar Singh, but nevertheless defended him in time. Lastly he placed a high value in the role of women in the church, even in favour of ordination of women. Despite of Heiler's liberalism, his high church theology was also widely known among other, usually very conservative Lutheran high church theologians outside of Germany, because of at that time generally a rare ecumenical attempt, Heiler's Roman Catholic background and because of his interest on Liturgical Movement. After the ecumenical approach of Second Vatican Council of Roman Catholic Church, Heiler as an ecumenical theologian has been of less interest in academical theology. Typology of Prayer Friedrich Heiler is recognized for compiling one of the most comprehensive Christian studies into the phenomenology of prayer. This typology proposes six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic. In these the reader can see a sort of progression from man-centered to God- centered prayer. It has been noted in recent years that Heiler‚Äôs typology should include seven types, the first being secular spirituality.Millard Erickson, Christian Theology, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids: Baker Books, 1998), 431. Secular Spirituality The most detached prayer from Christianity is that of worldly mysticism, in which the one praying seeks to converse with a deity by immersing their life with the world. This secular petitioning may not include God at all, but instead be the effort to connect with nature. Secular prayer may also simply be a type of inward meditation instead of outward communication. In societies that recognize a sentient God, prayers progress outward.Donald G. Bloesch, \\"Payer\\", Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 2nd ed. Primitive Prayer The most basic petitions to higher beings, according to Heiler, derive from felt needs and fear. The basics of these prayers focus on deliverance from misfortune and danger. This type of prayer can be found in all facets of life, from primitive cultures to superstitious industrialized countries. When such prayers seem to be heard, and even answered, the culture is likely to progress into ritualistic prayer.Erickson, Christian Theology. Ritual Prayer While primitive prayer may come from the heart, once it is recognized for producing results, efforts are made to replicate the effects. Ritualistic prayer derives from such pragmatism in which superstition leads to formulas and litany. In this case, the form, instead of the content, is thought to produce the results. Many Christians fall into this superstition by ending all prayers, ‚Äúin Jesus‚Äô name‚Äù, when Christ himself ended his lesson in prayer with no such formula, instead saying, ‚Äúfor yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever, amen.‚Äù (Matthew 6:13) The next progression is recognition of the importance of content over method. Greek Cultural Prayer In the Greek culture, more emphasis is placed on moral needs than physical needs. In other words, this refined primitive prayer sought intercession from gods for cultural needs instead of individual needs.Jerome Neyry, Give God the Glory: Ancient Prayer and Worship in Cultural Perspective (Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co, 2007); 11. This type of prayer was often the duty of the philosophical elite.Simon Parker, ‚ÄúDivine Intercession in Judah,‚Äù Vetus Testamentum 56 no 1 (2006): 81-82. Philosophical Prayer The progression from cultural prayer by the philosophical elite leads into contemplative examination of the relationship between creation and creator. At this point, the person praying recognizes that na√Øve and realistic prayers may not affect the divine order of the universe. At this level is where the question first is introduced, ‚ÄúWhy pray?‚Äù Any communicative prayer is no longer for petition, as it seems the immutability of God precludes his intercession, and prayers turn only to thanksgiving. Up until this level, these five types of prayer seek what man can receive from prayer, from the most basic of necessities to transcendent knowledge, but according to Heiler there are two forms of higher prayer which seek an audience with God; Mystical and Prophetic prayer. Mystical Prayer At this level of prayer, the person praying recognizes that God is outside of them, but capable and perhaps willing to indwell and unite with them through conversation and transformation. While not biblical, Mystical prayer does contain similarities, such as petition, revelation, and elevation of the one praying. The major difference between Mystical and Prophetic prayer is the motive of the one praying. Mysticism seeks an illumination rather than intervention, and sees this illumination as being revealed in stages. Prophetic Prayer The highest form of prayer, according to Heiler, is that of the biblical model. In this model, there are no stages, as the ability to speak directly to God without formula or meditation began when the veil was rent on the day Christ was crucified. The prophetic prayer allows all four types of biblical prayer from any believer at any time. No limitations are placed on method, location, or liturgical ranking.Bloesch.

The exact year of its birth is undocumented, but BBSs running Networks II were seen as early as 1981. Written entirely in Applesoft BASIC and 6502 assembly language, earlier versions of Networks II was compatible with only the Hayes Micromodem II family of modems and compatibles. Later versions were written to take advantage of the Novation Apple-CAT II and the Hayes Smartmodem lines with an Apple Super Serial or compatible card. Throughout its lifespan, Networks II runs only under DOS 3.x. It also supports up to four Disk II or compatible disk drives. Original features The original, un-hacked features of Networks II include: * Text-based, teletype- like display. * Individual user name and passwords. * Message board, called forums. The original code can handle only one forum. * Support for the Thunderware ThunderClock and compatible cards. * Chat mode between the sysop and user. * Administrative tools. Must take the BBS down in order to run any administrative tasks. * ASCII-based Applesoft and Integer BASIC, and binary file downloading.

Sorghum originated in Africa, and is now cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical regions. Sorghum is the world's fifth-most important cereal crop after rice, wheat, maize, and barley, with 59.34 million metric tons of annual global production in 2018. S. bicolor is typically an annual, but some cultivars are perennial. It grows in clumps that may reach over 4 m high. The grain is small, ranging from 2 to 4 mm in diameter. Sweet sorghums are sorghum cultivars that are primarily grown for forage, syrup production, and ethanol; they are taller than those grown for grain. Sorghum bicolor is the cultivated species of sorghum; its wild relatives make up the botanical genus Sorghum.  Cultivation  Boiled Chinese sorghum. Two 'turkey tail' style brooms made from broom corn Seed head of sorghum in India thumbuprightSorghum with a recurved peduncle trait, Turpan basin, Xinjiang, China. In some varieties and in certain conditions, the heavy panicle will make the young soft peduncle bend, which then will lignify in this position. Combined with awned inflorescence, this forms a two-fold defence against birds. The leading producers of S. bicolor in 2011 were Nigeria (12.6%), India (11.2%), Mexico (11.2%), and the United States (10.0%). Sorghum grows in a wide range of temperatures, high altitudes, and toxic soils, and can recover growth after some drought. It has five features that make it one of the most drought- resistant crops: * It has a very large root-to-leaf surface area ratio. * In times of drought, it rolls its leaves to lessen water loss by transpiration. * If drought continues, it goes into dormancy rather than dying. * Its leaves are protected by a waxy cuticle. * It uses C4 carbon fixation thus using only a third the amount of water that C3 plants require. Sorghum field in Addi Azmera (Ethiopia) =History= The first archaeological remnants of sorghum are at Nabta Playa on the Upper Nile, c. 8000 BC. However, these are wild sorghum, with small grains and a brittle rachis. Sorghum is believed to have been domesticated from the wild Sorghum verticilliform in perhaps 7000‚Äì5000 BC in the Niger River valley. Botanists divide it into five \\"races\\": *durra, developed in India *guinea, a West African variety requiring high rainfall *caudatum, grown by Nilo-Saharan peoples between Lake Chad and Ethiopia *kafir, a drought-resistant type grown in Southern Africa *bicolor, the most common grain Sorghum in the United States was first recorded by Ben Franklin in 1757.https://www.sorghumcheckoff.com/all-about- sorghum#:~:text=HISTORY%20OF%20SORGHUM&text;=The%20earliest%20known%20record%20of,to%20the%20semi%2Darid%20Sahel. Richard Pankhurst reports (citing Augustus B. Wylde) that in 19th-century Ethiopia, durra was \\"often the first crop sown on newly cultivated land\\", explaining that this cereal did not require the thorough ploughing other crops did, and its roots not only decomposed into a good fertilizer, but they also helped to break up the soil while not exhausting the subsoil.Richard Pankhurst, Economic History of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 193. Uses Red on white sorghum grains Sorghum is cultivated in many parts of the world today.. The grain finds use as human food, and for making liquor, animal feed, or bio-based ethanol. Sorghum grain contains gluten free, high in resistant starch and more abundant and diverse phenolic compounds compared to other major cereal crops. Sorghum grain contains gluten free, high in resistant starch and more abundant and diverse phenolic compounds compared to other major cereal crops =Culinary use= In many parts of Asia and Africa, sorgham grain is used to make flat breads that form the staple food of many cultures. The grains can also be popped in a fashion similar to popcorn. In India, where it is commonly called jwaarie, jowar, jola, or jondhalaa, sorghum is one of the staple sources of nutrition in Rajasthan and the Deccan plateau states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Telangana. An Indian bread called bhakri, jowar roti, or jolada rotti is prepared from this grain. In Tunisia, where its commonly called dro√¥, a traditional creme dish is prepared with ground sorghum grains powder, milk and sugar. The dish is a staple breakfast meal consumed in winter months. In Central America, tortillas are sometimes made using sorghum. Although corn is the preferred grain for making tortillas, sorghum is widely used and is well accepted in Honduras. White sorghum is preferred for making tortillas. Sweet sorghum syrup is known as molasses in some parts of the U.S., although it is not true molasses. =Alcoholic beverage= In China, sorghum is known as gaoliang (È´òÁ≤±), and is fermented and distilled to produce one form of clear spirits known as baijiu (ÁôΩÈÖí) of which the most famous is Maotai (or Moutai). In Taiwan, on the island called Kinmen, plain sorghum is made into sorghum liquor. In several countries in Africa, including Zimbabwe, Burundi, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Nigeria, sorghum of both the red and white varieties is used to make traditional opaque beer. Red sorghum imparts a pinkish-brown colour to the beer. =Bio-based ethanol= In Australia, South America, and the United States, sorghum grain is used primarily for livestock feed and in a growing number of ethanol plants. In some countries, sweet sorghum stalks are used for producing biofuel by squeezing the juice and then fermenting it into ethanol.{{cite weburl=http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet-sorghum-a-new- smart-biofuel-crop/title=Sweet Sorghum : A New \\"Smart Biofuel Croppublisher=agribusinessweek.comdate=30 June 2008url- status=deadarchiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527004827/http://www.agribusinessweek.com/sweet- sorghum-a-new-s. Texas A&M; University in the United States is currently running trials to find the best varieties for ethanol production from sorghum leaves and stalks in the USA. =Other uses= It is also used for making a traditional corn broom.The reclaimed stalks of the sorghum plant are used to make a decorative millwork material marketed as Kirei board. Agricultural uses It is used in feed and pasturage for livestock. Its use is limited, however, because the starch and protein in sorghum is more difficult for animals to digest than the starches and protein in corn. Research is being done to find a process that will predigest the grain. One study on cattle showed that steam-flaked sorghum was preferable to dry-rolled sorghum because it improved daily weight gain. In hogs, sorghum has been shown to be a more efficient feed choice than corn when both grains were processed in the same way. The introduction of improved varieties, along with improved management practices, has helped to increase sorghum productivity. In India, productivity increases are thought to have freed up six million hectares of land. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in collaboration with partners produces improved varieties of crops including sorghum. Some 194 improved cultivars of sorghum from the institute have been released.Sorghum, a crop of substance . Downloaded 16 March 2014. Research Research is being conducted to develop a genetic cross that will make the plant more tolerant to colder temperatures and to unravel the drought tolerance mechanisms, since it is native to tropical climates. In the United States, this is important because the cost of corn was steadily increasing due to its use in ethanol production for addition to gasoline. Sorghum silage can be used as a replacement of corn silage in the diet for dairy cattle. More research has found that sorghum has higher nutritional value compared to corn when feeding dairy cattle, and the type of processing is also essential in harvesting the grain's maximum nutrition. Feeding steam-flaked sorghum showed an increase in milk production when compared to dry-rolling. Additional research is being done on sorghum as a potential food source to meet the increasing global food demand. Sorghum is resistant to drought- and heat- related stress. The genetic diversity between subspecies of sorghum makes it more resistant to pests and pathogens than other less diverse food sources. In addition, it is highly efficient in converting solar energy to chemical energy, and also in use of water. All of these characteristics make it a promising candidate to help meet the increasing global food demand. As such, many groups around the world are pursuing research initiatives around sorghum (specifically Sorghum bicolor): Purdue University, HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Danforth Plant Science Center, the University of Nebraska, and the University of Queensland among others. The University of Queensland is involved with pre-breeding activities, which are extremely successful and still are in progress using crop wild relatives as donors along with popular varieties as recipients to make sorghum more resistant to biotic stresses. Another research application of sorghum is as a biofuel. Sweet sorghum has a high sugar content in its stalk, which can be turned into ethanol. The biomass can be burned and turned into charcoal, syn-gas, and bio-oil. Genome The genome of S. bicolor was sequenced between 2005 and 2007. Pests and parasites Sorghum is a host of the parasitic plant Striga hermonthica. This parasite is a devastating pest on the crop. The European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) was introduced to North America by transport of infested sorghum broom corn.

It concerns an Irishman named Jim O'Shea, a castaway who finds himself on an island somewhere in the East Indies, whereupon he is made Chief Panjandrum by the natives because they like his red hair and his Irish smile. He then sends a letter to his girlfriend, Rose McGee, imploring her to come join him.

Woodward is part of the Toledo City School District. The Woodward Polar Bears wear blue and white for athletics and either chose their nickname because they are located in the north end of Toledo, or because former principal Charles LaRue named them after his alma mater at Ohio Northern University. Woodward is a charter member of the Toledo City League from 1926. From 1923-1932, Woodward played Libbey High School in a football game on Thanksgiving Day until Libbey and DeVilbiss High School became the annual matchup. In April of 1937, the High School displayed a Tesla Coil formerly owned by Nikola Tesla to the public, which they had acquired for educational purposes. In 2010, the building that Woodward's neighborhood had called home since 1928 was replaced by a newer facility located on the same property.

For a short time he directed the Paris Opera. He made a distinction between sacred and secular music and was one of the originators of French interest in musicology.  Biography  Choron studied mathematics at the coll√®ge de Juilly. Since his father had forbidden him to study music, he taught himself the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau, followed by lessons in harmony from abb√© Roze and Bonesi. Bonesi familiarized him with Italian music and the treatises on fugue and strict counterpoint of Nicola Sala (1713-1801). He drew from these his book Principes de composition des √©coles d'Italie. He learned German, studied musical treatises in that language, then undertook to reform all branches of musical activity. A professor of mathematics at the √âcole Polytechnique since its founding, then a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, Choron was charged in 1811 with reorganizing the choir schools with the title of Director of Music of Religious Ceremonies. Named director of the Paris Op√©ra on 18 January 1816, he instituted the reopening of the Paris Conservatory, which had been closed since 1815, under the name of √âcole royale de chant et de d√©clamation. On 30 March 1817 he was forced to resign the directorship of the Opera, without a pension, as a result of having wanted to make too many radical changes. In 1817, he founded and directed the Institution royale de musique classique et religieuse. Its influence was considerable. It trained or influenced some of the most important artists of this era, notably the celebrated singers Gilbert Duprez and Rosine Stoltz, and the actress Rachel Felix. It published and had performed publicly very old choral works, including those of Palestrina, Bach and Handel. With the July Revolution in 1830, the government withdrew his subsidies, and the institution ran into grave difficulties. Choron died soon thereafter in 1834. The institution was resuscitated under the name of Conservatoire royal de musique classique de France or √âcole Niedermeyer by Louis Niedermeyer, who thus ensured the transmission of the principles and teachings of Choron. Choron published numerous musical works. He also left behind his voluminous papers, preserved at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France.

The film was released on December 31, 1952, by Paramount. Plot In 1930, entertainer Bill Miller believes that he has the ability to become a solo performer. He and his partner Ben Bailey split up and go their separate ways. Miller fails miserably, and his manager Leo Lyman thinks it would be a good idea to perform with a \\"stooge.\\" Enter Ted Rogers, who plays an accident-prone foil for Miller. Soon afterwards, Miller's act is a hit. Along the way, Rogers is unaware that he is the real reason the act is a success and becomes very loyal to Miller. Even though he receives no billing, he defends his \\"partner\\" when others suggest he is being taken advantage of by Miller. Eventually, even Miller's wife Mary is ashamed of his treatment of Rogers, going so far as to threaten him with divorce. Miller is more determined than ever to prove he can make it as a single and fires Rogers, but promptly regrets his decision as his first performance as a true solo artist flops. He addresses the audience, apologizing and admitting that the \\"stooge\\" was the true heart and soul of the act. Rogers, who is sitting in the audience, comes to his rescue by joining him onstage and the two finally become true partners.

She was named for Henry Rawlings Hamner. Hamner was launched on 24 November 1945 by the Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Port Newark, New Jersey; sponsored by Mrs. Henry Rawlings Hamner, wife of Lt. Hamner; and commissioned on 12 July 1946, Commander Joseph B. Swain in command. Service history =Pacific Fleet, 1945-1950= After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, Hamner reported to the Pacific Fleet on 24 December 1946 and immediately departed for her first deployment with the 7th Fleet. The destroyer spent nine months operating with Destroyer Division 111 out of various Chinese and Japanese ports before returning to the States for six months of training operations. Hamner followed this pattern of cruises until hostilities began in Korea on 24 June 1950. =Korea 1950-1953= Deployed in the Far East at the time, Hamner sailed to the Korean coast and began shore bombardment of Communist positions and supply lines. After participating in the evacuation of Yongdok and the defense of Pohang Dong, Hamner joined Task Force 77 for the amphibious operations against Inchon on 15 September 1950. After operating along the Korean coast to screen aircraft carriers whose planes were pounding Communist troops, Hamner returned to the States in March 1951. She was back on line in October 1951 and continued to patrol waters surrounding the peninsula with various task forces and bombardment groups, effectively damaging and checking the enemy. In March 1952 she spent five weeks on shore bombardment off the east coast of Korea near Kojo causing much damage to the enemy. Returning to the States in May 1952, Hamner resumed her duties along the Korean coast on 2 January 1953, remaining there on the bombline, at the siege of Wonsan Harbor, and on Formosa patrol until the s:Korean Armistice Agreement of 27 July 1953. =Pacific Fleet, 1953-1963= Hamner returned to the Western Pacific every year thereafter visiting ports in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Australia (arrival 2 August 1956 in Brisbane and arrival 6 Oct 1957 in Melbourne), and 1959. The destroyer made many good-will visits to Asian ports and engaged in exercises and Formosa patrol. She arrived off Taiwan for six weeks duty with the Taiwan Patrol Force on 31 December 1958, just after another flareup of the Quemoy-Matsu crisis. When not deployed in the Pacific, Hamner trained out of San Diego, California. Entering the San Francisco Ship Yard in January 1962, she underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul designed to add 10 to 20 years to her operating efficiency. Fitted with a new superstructure and the Navy's most modern electronic equipment, Hamner left the shipyard on 5 December 1962 and, after training, sailed for her 13th WestPac cruise on 18 May 1963. During this cruise she was part of the ready amphibious group in South Vietnam coastal waters in September. =Vietnam, 1964-1966= Hamner returned to San Diego on 24 November. She operated along the West Coast throughout 1964 and sailed again for the Orient on 5 January 1965. Arriving Subic Bay on the 27th, she escorted aircraft carrier to the Gulf of Tonkin. On 15 March she joined aircraft carrier in \\"Yankee Team\\" operations. On 10 May she sailed North to cover Seabee landings at Chu Lai. \\"Operation Market Time\\" began five days later and on the 20th Hamner shelled Communist positions in South Vietnam in the first scheduled shore bombardment by the U.S. Nayy since the Korean War. Thereafter she screened Coral Sea, bombarded the Trung Phan area on 25 June, and covered the landing of Marines from at Qui Nhon on 1 July. Two weeks later the destroyer sailed home, reaching San Francisco on the 26th. Overhaul at Hunter's Point and operations off the West Coast occupied the next year. Hamner got underway for her 14th WestPac deployment on 2 July 1966. Late in the month she bombarded South Vietnam. Following patrol duty, she steamed up the L√≤ng T√†u River to shell the Rung Sat Special Zone. Hamner joined TG 77.6 as plane guard for on 1 October and continued this duty until receiving an emergency call from the carrier at 0730 on the 26th \\"I am on fire.\\" Maneuvering alongside, Hamner sprayed cooling water on the charred and buckled bulkheads until this threat had gone then escorted her to Subic Bay for repairs. Returning to the gunline off Vietnam on 6 November, the destroyer spent two weeks in Operation Traffic Cop, shelling the junks that were bringing arms and supplies to the Viet Cong. Within a fortnight, Hamner had destroyed 67 craft. On 14 November and 19 November shore batteries fired on Hamner, and . Although several rounds sprayed the destroyers with shrapnel, neither ship was damaged. On each occasion the American ships moved outside range of the enemy guns and bombarded the shore batteries. Leaving the gunline on 20 November, a month and a day later, Hamner reached San Diego. =Decommissioning and sale= After spending several years on Swan Island in Portland, Oregon as a vessel used for Naval and Marine reserve training, she was decommissioned in the 1970s and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1979. She was sold to Taiwan on 17 December 1980, and renamed ROCS Yun Yang. She was reclassified as a guided-missile destroyer (DDG-927). Yun Yang was decommissioned on 16 December 2003. She was sunk by as a target off Ping Tung on 6 September 2005. Note: \\"Jane's Fighting Ships\\" and \\"Register of US Ships of the US Navy 1775-1990\\" said that Hamner became ROCS Chao Yang reclassified as Guide Missile Destroyer (DDG-929). Awards Hamner was awarded five battle stars as well as a Presidential Unit Citation for her outstanding service in Korea. As of 2018, no other ship in the United States Navy has been named Hamner.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Carleton is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  Namesake  HMCS Carleton is named after , a British schooner which took part in the American War of Independence at the Battle of Valcour Island in 1776. History With the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) in 1923, the Ottawa Half-Company was stood up in 1923. In 1935, the name of the Ottawa Half-Company was changed to the \\"Ottawa Division of the RCNVR\\". Just prior to Canada's declaration of war on Germany, the Canadian government called the Naval Reserve into active service. For the duration of hostilities, the Ottawa Division concentrated on the recruitment and basic training of sailors and by the end of the war some 4,620 officers and men had enlisted through the Ottawa Reserve Division. On 1 November 1941, the Ottawa Division was commissioned as HMCS Carleton, named after , a schooner named after Governor Guy Carleton, who defeated Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Quebec on 31 December 1775. On 17 December 1943, HMCS Carleton moved to its current facilities at Canadian Forces Reserve Barrack Dow's Lake, when the new \\"stone frigate\\" was inaugurated in the presence of Major General Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone and the then Governor General of Canada. In 1944, a new type of naval presence was added to Carleton when the barracks blocks were occupied by the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRENS). New training facilities were then added to Carleton in the late 1940s and early 1950s. A memorial anchor with plaques on a concrete base, and nine-pounder guns were erected by HMCS Carleton. This memorial, which was unveiled on 6 May 1973 by Governor General Roland C. Michener, is dedicated to the Naval Reservists and the Naval Reserve in the fiftieth year of the Naval Reserve. Since its establishment, members of Carleton have played an active role in the National Capital Region. In recognition of its contribution to the community, Carleton was presented with the Key to the City of Ottawa in 1976 and Freedom of the city in 2017. HMCS Carleton barracks at CFRB Dow's Lake, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Demolished in September 2013. Operations Until September 2013, HMCS Carleton operated continuously to provide employment and training for its sailors. Its facilities consisted of an administration building, drill hall, classroom building, shooting range, boat shed and a large vehicle compound. On 19 March 2008 several main supports for the roof of the drill hall failed resulting in its closure and then demolition, and this accelerated plans to replace the 65-year-old administration building and drill hall. Temporary office and classroom spaces, as well as a temporary parade structure, were installed on site. At the end of September 2013 demolition of the administration building began. A new administration building, including a drill hall, was built and opened its doors in 2015. An official 'Manning Ship Ceremony' was held on 21 November 2015. Although most of the sailors who are members of HMCS Carleton work on a part-time basis through the training year (September to May), there is a staff of ten full-time members (five Class B Reservists and five Regular Force) who ensure the efficient operation and administration of the unit. HMCS Carleton has administration nights every Tuesday, and training nights on Thursdays from mid-September through to early May. HMCS Carleton also has weekend training throughout the year in order to augment training.

He was nominated for two Grammy Awards as a stage performer, producer, and recording artist. Born in Burbank, California, the young Gary was a bundle of energy and for that reason his parents allowed him to set up the drum kit that his cousin had offered him after getting bored with it. Gary left home at 15 and was drawn to the musical scene of Topanga Canyon, California. He made friends with guitarist Randy California. In the 1960s and early 1970s he played with bluesman Albert Collins. By the time he was twenty-four he was touring and recording with former Cream bassist Jack Bruce and guitarist Mick Taylor, who had just left the Rolling Stones. This stellar lineup also included jazz pianist Carla Bley. Gary also worked with Dr. John in the 1970s. In 1978, singer Doug Fieger asked him to join a group with guitarist Berton Averre. The three were subsequently joined by bassist Prescott Niles. Fieger and Averre brought in a tune they'd written about Sharona Alperin (girlfriend of Doug Fieger), a teenage girl Fieger was obsessed with. Despite his initial reservations about the song, Gary came up with a beat to match \\"My Sharona\\"'s stuttering style. He later said he approached the song like a surf stomp. As he explained, drummers in surf bands often play songs using no cymbals, just kick drum, snare drum, and toms. He also borrowed from the drum part to \\"Going to a Go Go\\" by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles. The final ingredient, he said, was the drum rudiment called a flam, in which one drumstick strikes the drum just before the other does; the flam registers as a single beat, but with a particularly full sound. Gary's immediately recognisable kick-and-snare-drum intro helped propel the power-pop anthem to the top of the US charts. The Knack's debut album Get the Knack sold 6 million copies. After the breakup of the Knack in the early 1980s, Gary became an in-demand drummer for studio work and live performance with musicians including Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Stephen Stills, Rod Stewart, Bette Midler, Harry Nilsson, Robby Krieger, Jack Bruce, Mick Taylor, Cherie Currie, Spencer Davis, Emmett Chapman, and Sheryl Crow. He also worked with blues masters Albert King and John Lee Hooker. In addition to his work as a drummer, he achieved recognition for his work as a producer, recording new albums with the Ventures and co-producing (with Alan Douglas) a series of seminal archival recordings of Jimi Hendrix including the Blues compilation. Gary died at the age of 55 at the Tarzana Regional Medical Center in Tarzana, California of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

It stars David Duchovny (in his first starring role after achieving success with The X-Files), Timothy Hutton, and Angelina Jolie. Plot Duchovny plays Eugene Sands, a surgeon who has his medical license revoked after operating under the influence of amphetamines and opiates. Hutton's character, a crime lord named Raymond Blossom, happens upon him in a bar where Sands saves someone's life with an emergency procedure to inflate a collapsed lung. Blossom hires Sands as his personal physician, patching up his accomplices when they cannot go to a hospital, and tending to the crime boss and his girlfriend, Claire (Jolie). In the final act of the film, Claire and Sands become involved, and he must face up to conflicting loyalties to Blossom, Claire, and the FBI agent who has blackmailed him into being an informant.

The film's trailer contained a brief glimpse of a sex scene between Duchovny and Jolie. The actress later confirmed that she had filmed two sex scenes for the movie, but that both of them were edited out of the final cut. Reception The film did not fare well financially or with critics, scoring just a 13% at the review site Rotten Tomatoes and making only $4,166,918 at the US theater box office. Popular film critic Roger Ebert however, gave the film three stars, saying \\"This may not be a great movie, but for both Duchovny and Hutton, it's a turning point\\", citing Duchovny's ability to \\"stand above the action\\" like Clint Eastwood; and Hutton's ability to create a real character as the villain, instead of merely filling a space. In an interview with the New York Times dated 9 April 2000 David Duchovny himself, while talking about production difficulties, stated that ‚Äú‚ÄòPlaying God' was a mistake only because we didn't have a script ready...

She was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec. Her father is French Canadian and her mother is Peruvian, of Spanish and indigenous Quechua and Aymara descent. Her stage name \\"Quilla\\" is inspired by the Quechua word for \\"moon\\". Daigneault is known for her contributions as a dance music vocalist in the genres of progressive house, deep house, techno, trance, breaks, and others. Her vocals have been featured on tracks by producers such as Ti√´sto, Sultan + Ned Shepard, Feenixpawl, Heatbeat on labels such as Universal Music, Revealed Recordings, Armada Music, Visionquest, and others. Her work as a live electronic performer is unique because she sings live while mixing tracks, and uses keyboards, vocal effects and a looping pedal. In 2016, she shifted away from being a featured vocalist and became an electronic producer, releasing her own self-produced electronic pop album You Got It in April 2017. Daigneault has composed and produced electronic music for film soundtracks, stop motion animations, and documentaries. Outside of her work in music and film, she has also published over thirty online talking dictionaries through her work with Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages as well as articles in the field of endangered language conservation.  Early life  Daigneault grew up in Montreal's Notre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce neighborhood and attended St. Ignatius of Loyola School. She later went to Villa Sainte- Marcelline in Westmount for grades 5 through 11. A member of the Questo Rhythmic Gymnastic Club, Daigneault was a rhythmic gymnast from the age of 5 to 17. She competed in the Canada Games in the mid-90s, and was part of the Canadian Junior National team in 1997. During her youth, she learned hard work and discipline, and she also became intensely interested in music, always looking for the next great track to use for a gymnastics routine. Daigneault studied classical piano with teacher Joan Pierrepoint until she was 16, and started composing for piano around 11 years old. She began writing songs and poetry at an early age, but was too shy to sing in front of anyone until her late teens. Towards the end of high school, she had a brief stint as a bassist in a local Montreal punk band with several friends. During her college years at Dawson College and McGill University, she gained valuable experience playing keyboards in several indie rock bands, as well as a 7-piece social justice Afrobeat funk band named Music Mind Movement. Throughout her formative years, she was heavily influenced by Montreal‚Äôs free jazz and experimental electronic music community, and played in many venues in her home city.  Research and Influences  As a student at McGill University, Daigneault studied anthropology and linguistics, and became interested in vocal traditions from around the world, archaeology and the study of hieroglyphics. She worked as a student archaeologist at Minanha, a Pre-Columbian Mayan site in Belize, and also worked on an excavation with a team from the University of Sydney at Angkor Wat's ancient water systems in Cambodia. Between 2007 and 2010, as a graduate student at Universit√© de Montr√©al, Daigneault focused her attention on the endangered languages and vocal traditions of South America. She embarked on various field trips to Peru, Chile and Paraguay, and traveled to the Peruvian Amazon on three occasions to live among the Yanesha people. She was a field assistant for National Geographic‚Äôs Enduring Voices Project expeditions and worked with indigenous collaborators on several language revitalization projects. She has worked part-time for Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages since 2011. Her research background has strongly influenced the cultural content and otherworldly themes explored in her music.  Bands & Live Acts  In 2006, with drummer / producer Sam Vipond, Daigneault formed Pamplemousse Explosion, a cabaret-noise-jazz duo that rocked Montreal‚Äôs indie circuit between 2006 and 2009. The duo was invited to record a track with legendary recording engineer and inventor, George Massenburg at McGill University's School of Music. Daigneault later formed experimental electronic projects such as Feast of Spirits with long-time collaborator and friend Oliver Lewis. When she lived in Lima briefly in 2008 and 2010, she formed electronic indie pop duo Mono y Banana with Leonardo Camacho. She also was the frontwoman of Banana Lazuli, a psych rock project with a rotating cast of members. As Banana Lazuli, she performed at many local shows and festivals in the Bay Area, where she lived in 2011, and in North Carolina between 2012 and 2014. She toured the US and Canada, opening for Crystal Bright and the Silver Hands. Toward mid-2014, she ceased using all other monikers and only performed as Quilla. She began performing as a DJ / live vocalist in 2014.  Dance Music Collaborations  Quilla (photo by Steve Clarke) Between 2007 and 2010, Daigneault worked at Public Outreach, a company that fundraises for humanitarian organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and Unicef Canada. At Public Outreach, she met Ned Shepard, one half of Sultan + Ned Shepard, rising stars in the world of progressive house music (also known as EDM). After seeing Daigneault‚Äôs band Pamplemousse Explosion perform in 2009, Shepard invited her to write lyrics and collaborate in his recording studio with his production partner Sultan. They co-wrote a song called ‚ÄúWalls‚Äù which was later included in Ti√´sto‚Äôs acclaimed compilation, Club Life: Volume Two Miami. It was released by Musical Freedom in 2012 and the album peaked at 16 on Billboard 200. For the release of \\"Walls\\", Daigneault conceived of the moniker Quilla, to differentiate the track from the other projects she was a part of. The song \\"Walls\\" became an international dancefloor hit, was a staple in Ti√´sto‚Äôs festival and club sets, and was a radio hit in Canada. Following the success of \\"Walls\\", Daigneault decided to broaden her musical horizons and expand her vocal range and style, studying North Indian Classical music with Sargam Shah in California, as well as opera with singer Elena DeAngelis in North Carolina in 2013. Daigneault found herself in high demand to record vocals, and she completed and released over a dozen collaborations and vocal features between 2012 and 2014. She wrote and performed the lyrics for Feenixpawl‚Äôs ‚ÄúUniverse‚Äù (Neon Records), Jewelz & Scott Sparks‚Äô smash hit ‚ÄúUnless We Forget‚Äù (Revealed Recordings), and she has written lyrics for many other international producers such as Heatbeat and Pascal & Pearce. She is a featured vocalist on Ti√´sto's 2014 album A Town Called Paradise, on a track called \\"Close To Me\\" in collaboration with Ti√´sto, Sultan + Ned Shepard. She is featured on \\"To The Core\\" on Julian Calor's 2015 hit album Evolve released by Revealed Recordings. She released several more dance music collaborations in 2016 and 2017.  Lyrics and Style  As a dance music vocalist, Daigneault is known for her unique lyrics and dreamy vocal style, which is soaring yet intimate and ethereal. Her lyrical content is influenced by her experiences traveling and researching different cultures around the globe. She views the dance music world as a catalyst for producing transformative experiences in people. She explores positive themes in her lyrics, such as healing, dealing with regret and loss, breaking through obstacles and learning to love oneself. In an interview with Neon Vision, Daigneault observed, \\"When I see my friends and family going through experiences in life, I try to take those emotions and channel them into meaningful lyrics for people so when they are on the dance floor, they have an emotional catharsis ‚Äì that‚Äôs my goal.\\"  Solo Work  Daigneault performed a vocal looping show at the Center Camp stage at Burning Man in 2010 was approached afterward by renowned DJ Seth Troxler who shortly thereafter signed her to his label Visionquest. The label delayed in releasing her first album for nearly three years because the content of the album spanned indie rock, folktronica and piano pop, and was thus different from the rest of the label's techno esthetic. In early 2014, Visionquest instead released a three-part special edition vinyl series containing tech house remixes of Quilla's album tracks. The remixers included Ricardo Villalobos, Matthew Herbert and Craig Richards (DJ). Daigneault's first album as Quilla Beautiful Hybrid was released on her own label, Ritual Fire Records, in June 2014. It was met with critical acclaim. Writer Jackie Roy observed, \\"There is a lot of anticipation to see what Quilla comes up with next, as a pleasant surprise is always expected with her knack for collaborating so many different styles and genres.\\" Editors at Flush Magazine wrote, \\"Quilla is a multi- talented, multifaceted, hyper literate singer-songstress offering a fresh perspective, fascinating imagery, and songs befitting of the album title.‚Äù Daigneault's second albumYou Got It was released in April 2017 and also garnered positive reviews from dance music blogs We Rave You, as well as I Want EDM. \\"Kicking off with eerie drum-work, the listener is met with her spellbinding and ethereal voice ‚Äì one that soothes the senses like silk would. Exciting more emotions in the listener, Quilla carries off the track well with her pitch perfect adeptness behind both, the microphone as well as the production desk.\\" \\"This last year [Quilla] has been hard at work producing her new album ‚ÄòYou Got It‚Äô, and it does not disappoint. The slick, varied productions alongside beautiful, poetic vocal forms a hybrid genre which Quilla has created. The influences of the producers she has worked with and her dance music background are evident, but her ability to transcend genres and tie all the brilliant intricacies of her production together is majestic.\\" References External links *Quilla (Official Website) Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Montreal Category:21st- century Canadian singers Category:Canadian people of Peruvian descent Category:21st-century Canadian women singers Category:Canadian dance musicians Category:Canadian electronic musicians Category:Canadian keyboardists Category:Canadian female singers Category:Canadian women in electronic music ","title":"Quilla (musician)"},{"id":"6647413","text":"C-141 Starlifter on Ice Runway, near McMurdo Station, 1996. The Ice Runway is the principal runway for the US Antarctic Program during the summer Antarctic field season due to its proximity to McMurdo Station. The other two runways in the area are the snow runway at Williams Field (NZWD) and the compacted snow runway at Phoenix Airfield (NZFX), which replaced Pegasus Field (NZPG) in 2017. The sea ice runway is capable of handling wheeled aircraft, which have included to date: Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, Lockheed C-130 Hercules and Lockheed P-3 Orion. In the summer season of 2009/2010 the RNZAF trialed a modified Boeing 757 operationally.

Pilots landing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft on the sea ice runway report that the surface is stable, not unlike landing on concrete. The similarity with land bases ends when the jet aircraft rolls to a stop, however. The nearly 450,000 pound (= 201 tons) weight of the plane, including cargo and passengers, causes it to sink into the ice, albeit only a matter of inches. A laser light is trained on the aircraft to measure the settlement rate. The $200 million aircraft is moved to a new location on the six-foot- thick ice as a safety measure if the 10-inch red line is reached, according to the News Tribune in Tacoma, Washington. Accidents and incidents On 31 October 1960, a United States Navy Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star from Oceanographic Development Squadron Eight crashed while attempting to land on the Ice Runway. The pilot and co-pilot were badly injured, but the other crew received minor injuries or were uninjured. The aircraft was not recovered, and was simply allowed to sink when the ice melted in the spring.

They speak the Kwoma language. Land The climate is warm and humid, with rain falling almost every day, so that crops may be planted at any time of the year. The Kwoma territory consists of ridges with precipitous sides, nowhere rising above 1,500 feet, covered by a very dense forest canopy, as well as adjacent lowland swamps full of sago palms, an important food. Birds are abundant, but feral pigs are the only large mammals. Coconut and areca palms, pawpaw, breadfruit, and paper mulberry trees are planted near housesites, and yams, taro, and greens are grown as the first crop in swidden gardens, with bananas and plantains as the second crop. People The total population in 1936, the year in which the Kwoma were studied by ethnographers, was less than a thousand (in 2003, three thousand). They are surrounded by other peoples, most with even smaller populations, who speak unrelated languages. The Kwoma will speak in their own language to these outsiders, who will respond in their own language, so that intertribal communication relies upon understanding other languages, not speaking them. Relations with outsiders are often hostile, and even relations among the four Kwoma subtribes can be violent, with members of one subtribe setting out on head-hunting expeditions against another. Each subtribe consists of several hamlets, containing households with hereditary property rights in the hamlet's land. Each hamlet contains a male ceremonial house as its focal point. All of the adult males in a hamlet are members of the same patrilineal sib, but the hamlets of each sib are not contiguous, so that the sibs are scattered about in each subtribe territory. Each sib claims descent from a mythical totem ancestor, and each sib is further subdivided into lineages claiming descent from a legendary hero. Within a hamlet, members of the same lineage will typically build their houses adjacent to each other. Within a lineage, descendants of a common paternal grandfather will be especially close, and sons will live adjacent to or with their father. The Kwoma language is in the Middle Sepik stock, and their kinship system is of the Omaha type. The political system is acephalous and relatively egalitarian, though prestige is accorded senior men who have taken a head in warfare. these men hold high positions in religious cults and often have more than one wife. In the resolution of legal disputes, all males past puberty preside and have an equal voice in the final decision. The sexual division of labor is such that both males and females work in the extraction of sago flour, and each sex has specified tasks in the gardens, but only males hunt and build houses, and only females fish. Most fish is obtained through trade, with females exchanging sago flour for fish with members of river tribes on periodic market days, occurring once or twice a week. John Whiting's ethnography of the Kwoma, based on fieldwork conducted in 1936, was a groundbreaking effort to describe the socialization of children in a traditional, non-Western culture.

At the time of his death, Coleman was believed to be the oldest professional wrestler in the world, and the only known wrestler to live past the age of 100 years.  Early life  Kelmer was born to a Jewish family in ≈ªychlin, Poland in 1905. His father was a coal- seller. Kelmer had 15 older brothers and sisters, some of whom perished in the Holocaust. In 1923, he emigrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and later moved to New York City in the United States.  Professional wrestling career  According to the Canadian Online Explorer's Greg Oliver, there is debate regarding Kelmer's debut in professional wrestling. In 1929, local promoter Rudy Miller offered Coleman $25 to wrestle after seeing him work out in a Brooklyn gym. Despite this, an \\"Abe Coleman\\" wrestled to a draw with George Deslonchamps on March 19, 1928, at Madison Square Garden, but it is unknown if it was Kelmer or another wrestler with the same ring name. Credited for inventing the dropkick, Coleman claims his inspiration to create the move came from kangaroos he observed while on a tour of Australia in 1930. Coleman was never a champion but regarded as a solid mid-card standby. In the 1930s, Coleman defeated Jim Londos in a match in a Mexico City bullring in front of 60,000 spectators. During a 1936 match against Man Mountain Dean in front of 36,000 people, Coleman slammed Dean to the ground, breaking the ring mat and dropping the pair down to the arena floor. Following his retirement from active in-ring competition, Coleman became a professional wrestling referee. He also promoted several wrestling shows with Bill Johnston.  After wrestling  Following his retirement from wrestling, Kelmer inspected license plates for the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles.  Personal life  Kelmer met June Miller in 1936, stating he met her in Madison Square Garden when he landed in her lap after being thrown from the ring. They married three years later in 1939. The couple had no children and Miller died in 1987. Kelmer lived in Forest Hills, New York. It was in Forest Hills that Kelmer subdued two attempted muggers when he was in his 80s. Outside of wrestling, Kelmer's interests included poker and horse racing. In his final years, Kelmer, primarily confined to a wheelchair, lived at the Meadow Park Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Flushing, New York. Kelmer died on March 28, 2007, in a nursing home in Queens, New York, of kidney failure.

He also played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Athletics, Boston Red Sox and Boston Braves. Potter's repertoire featured the screwball. Baseball career =Early struggles= Born in Mount Morris, Illinois, Potter was listed as tall and . He began his 18-year professional career in the minor leagues in 1932, and after a one-inning trial with the Cardinals in April 1936, played his first full MLB season in as a member of the Athletics. He led the American League in earned runs allowed with (144) in , and overall won only 20 of 57 decisions in his first of two stints in Philadelphia, playing for a team that lost an average of 96 games a year between 1938 and . During the latter year, on June 30, Potter's contract was sold to the Red Sox, who used him in only ten games and 20 innings pitched before assigning him outright to their top farm club, the Louisville Colonels. Potter won 18 games, losing eight, for the Colonels in 1942, earning his selection by the Browns in the Rule 5 draft on November 2, 1942. =St. Louis Browns= With World War II depleting major league rosters of playing talent, Potter proceeded to post three consecutive stellar seasons for the ‚Äì‚Äì Browns, winning a total of 44 games with earned run averages below 3.00. In 1944, Potter won 19 games, leading the Browns' staff, as St. Louis prevailed over the Detroit Tigers by a single game in the pennant chase. Potter finished ninth in voting for the 1944 American League MVP balloting, with a 19‚Äì7 won‚Äìlost record, 16 complete games, three shutouts, and a 2.83 ERA. In the all-St. Louis 1944 World Series that followed, he started two games (the second and sixth contests) against the Cardinals. He allowed only one earned run in 9 innings pitched for an ERA of 0.93, but poor defense (he allowed four unearned runs) did him in, and he lost his only decision. The Cardinals won the world championship in six games. In 1945, the Browns failed to repeat as American League champions, although they finished in the first division. Potter contributed 15 wins, 21 complete games and three shutouts, and set a personal best in earned run average at 2.47, sixth in the Junior Circuit. The first two postwar seasons, and , were not as successful for Potter, as he won 12 games and lost 19 for the Browns, who had returned to their losing ways. In , he was reacquired by the Athletics in May, but on June 13, after less than a month with Philadelphia, he was \\"fired\\" by manager Connie Mack after a losing effort in relief against his old Brownie teammates.Davis, Sidney, Nels Potter, Society for American Baseball Research Biography Project. =Boston Braves= Signed as a free agent by the Boston Braves seven days later, he returned to the National League for the first time in 12 years and helped lead Boston to the 1948 NL pennant. Potter worked in 18 games, threw three complete games in seven starts, and added three saves out of the bullpen. Overall, he posted a 5‚Äì2 record and a 2.33 earned run average in 85 innings pitched. He then appeared in his second World Series. Against the AL champion Cleveland Indians, Potter worked in two games. His effective relief appearance in Game 2, a Boston loss, was followed by a starting assignment in Game 5. In the latter game, Potter surrendered five runs, all earned, in 3 innings pitched on five hits (including two home runs), and left the game with the Braves trailing, 5‚Äì4. However, future Baseball Hall of Famer Warren Spahn, who relieved Potter, shut the door on the Indians on only one hit, and allowed Boston to come back to win, 11‚Äì5.Retrosheet box score (10 October 1948): \\"Boston Braves 11, Cleveland Indians 5 (1948 World Series, Game 5)\\" Cleveland won Game 6 and the Series, however, the following day. Potter spent as a member of the Braves' pitching staff, getting into 41 games, all but three in relief, but retired after his contract was sold to the Cincinnati Reds on September 26. He finished his regular-season MLB career with a 92‚Äì97 record, six shutouts, 22 saves, and a 3.99 ERA, allowing 1,721 hits and 582 bases on balls in 1,686 innings pitched. He struck out 747. In World Series play, he posted a record of 0‚Äì1 and an ERA of 3.60, allowing six earned runs, 16 hits and five bases on balls, with seven strikeouts, in 15 innings pitched over four different appearances. Family Potter died in his hometown of Mount Morris at the age of 79. Predeceased by his wife, Hazel, in 1986, he was survived by two sons and a daughter: Nelson Jr., James, and Barbara.

It has been referred to variously in media and popular culture as the Jewish Mob, Jewish Mafia, Kosher Mafia, Kosher Nostra,\\"Forgetting sixth commandment: Jewish gangsters were once known in organized crime circles as the 'Kosher Nostra'\\" , The Jewish Independent, September 19, 2008 or Undzer Shtik (). The last two of these terms are direct references to the Italian Cosa Nostra; the former is a play on the word kosher, referring to Jewish dietary laws, while the latter is a direct translation of the Italian phrase Cosa Nostra (Italian for \\"our thing\\") into Yiddish, which was at the time the predominant language of the Jewish diaspora in the United States. In the late 19th century in New York City, Monk Eastman (who himself was most likely not Jewish) operated a powerful Jewish gang that competed with Italian and Irish gangs, notably Paul Kelly's Five Points Gang, for control of New York City's underworld. Another notorious gang, known as the Lenox Avenue Gang, led by Harry \\"Gyp the Blood\\" Horowitz, consisted of mostly Jewish members and some Italian members (such as Francesco Cirofisi). It was one of the most violent gangs of the early 20th century and became famous for the murder of gambler and gangster Herman Rosenthal. In the early 1920s, stimulated by the economic opportunities of the roaring twenties, and later prohibition, Jewish organized crime figures such as Arnold Rothstein were controlling a wide range of criminal enterprises, including bootlegging, loansharking, gambling, and bookmaking. According to crime writer Leo Katcher, Rothstein \\"transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business, run like a corporation, with himself at the top.\\"Katcher, Leo (1959/1994). The Big Bankroll. The Life and Times of Arnold Rothstein, New York: Da Capo Press Rothstein was allegedly responsible for fixing the 1919 World Series.Pietrusza, David (2003). Rothstein: The Life, Times, and Murder of the Criminal Genius Who Fixed the 1919 World Series. New York: Carroll & Graf Publishers. At the same time, the Jewish bootlegging mob known as The Purple Gang dominated the Detroit underworld during prohibition, while the Jewish Bugs and Meyer Mob operated in the Lower East Side of New York City before being absorbed into Murder, Inc. and becoming affiliates of the Italian-American Mafia. The largely Jewish-American and Italian-American gang known as Murder, Inc. and Jewish mobsters such as Meyer Lansky, Mickey Cohen, Harold \\"Hooky\\" Rothman, Dutch Schultz, and Bugsy Siegel developed close ties with and gained significant influence within the Italian-American Mafia, eventually forming a loosely organized, mostly Jewish and Italian criminal syndicate known in the press as the \\"National Crime Syndicate.\\" Jewish and Italian crime groups became increasingly interconnected in the 1920s and 1930s, as they often occupied the same neighborhoods and social statuses of the time. The two ethnic crime groups became especially close in New York City following the establishment of the close relationship between partners Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky and their subsequent elimination of many of the so- called \\"Mustache Pete\\" types ‚Å†‚Äî Sicilian-born gangsters who often refused to work with non-Italians and even non-Sicilians. The Cohen crime family of Los Angeles and Las Vegas was notably part of both the Jewish Mafia and Italian- American Mafia, and lines between the two ethnic criminal organizations often blurred throughout the 20th century. For decades after, Jewish-American mobsters would continue to work closely and at times compete with Italian- American organized crime.Sifakis, The Mafia Encyclopedia, pp. 319‚Äì321  Origins and characteristics  The Siegel family's memorial plaque in the Bialystoker Synagogue.On the plaques above see the name Max Siegel, Siegel's father, whose Hebrew name is \\"Mordechai Dov ben Reb Beirush HaLevi\\" (from the Hebraic tribe of the Levites) and the one for Siegel, whose Hebrew name is \\"Bairush HaLevi ben Reb Mordechai Dov HaLevi;\\" from this we see that Bugsy was named for his grandfather, Dov, meaning bear (Bairush is the Yiddish for Dov), which was Americanized to Benjamin. All fathers are called Reb as an honorific on memorial plaques; Reb means \\"teacher\\" as in Rabbi. Jewish-American gangsters were involved in many different criminal activities, including murder, racketeering, bootlegging, prostitutionEdward J. Bristow, Prostitution & Prejudice, The Jewish Fight against White Slavery, 1870‚Äì1939, Schocken, 1983 and narcotics. Their role was also significant in New York's burgeoning labor movement, especially the garment and trucking unions, as well as the poultry industry. Jewish organized crime fueled antisemitism and deeply concerned the Jewish community.Killer Jews , by Rachel Rubin, Journal of Criminal Justice and Popular Culture, 8(2) (2001) 145‚Äì148 Jewish organized crime was used by antisemites and anti-immigration supporters as arguments to bolster their agenda. Jewish gangs controlled portions of the Lower East Side and Brownsville in New York City,Richard F. Shepard, \\"Books: Jewish Crime\\" , The New York Times, August 8, 1984 and were also present in other major American cities. American Jewish mafia boss Kid Cann held sway over Minneapolis for over four decades and remains the most notorious mobster in the history of Minnesota. Jewish-American organized crime was a reflection of the ethnic succession among gangsters, which has tended to follow the immigrant waves in the United States: English, German, Irish, Jewish, Italian, Asian and Latino. Ethnic involvement in organized crime gave rise to alien conspiracy theories in the US law enforcement community, in which the conception of organized crime as an alien and united entity was vital. The involvement of a small percentage of recent immigrants in organized crime created a lasting stereotype of devious immigrants corrupting the morality of native-born Americans. Organized crime was a complex set of relations between the recently arrived Jewish and Italian criminals and groups like the Irish-American organized crime networks, which had been established before the 1920s and which the newer groups were sometimes subordinate to.Organized Crime, USA: Changing Perceptions from Prohibition to the Present Day , Michael Woodiwiss, BAAS Pamphlet No. 19 (First Published 1990) Although never receiving close to the level of cultural attention of the Italian-American Mafia, from the late 1960s, Jewish-American gangsters would figure as characters in Jewish American literature. For some writers, Jewish gangsters and boxers in the post-World War II era were seen as tougher, more aggressive literary role models, freeing the community from the stigma of defenselessness and powerlessness, compared with the physical aggressiveness and lawlessness more associated with the Irish and Italian immigrants.\\"European antisemitism and Anti-Americanism\\", by Andrei Markovits, in: O'Connor, Brendon (Ed.) (2007). Anti-Americanism: Historical perspectives , Westport (CT): Greenwood Publishing Group \\"Defenders of the faith\\" , by Linda Grant, The Guardian, July 6, 2002 According to Rich Cohen, author of Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons and Gangster Dreams: \\"If Jewish gangsters still thrived today, if they hadn't gone legit, if Jews of my generation didn't regard them as figments, creatures to be classed with Big Foot and the Loch Ness monster, I think the Jewish community would be better off\\".Cohen, Rich (1999). Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons, and Gangster Dreams, London: Vintage; Review of Tough Jews in The New York Times.

These tough characters were still gangsters who extorted, exploited and murdered other members of the Jewish-American community for profit. They forced Jewish women into prostitution, and were generally considered a scourge within their own community.\\"Gangsters, Genes, Guns & Gamblers\\" ,Moment, July/August 2008 The Yiddish press and literature of the 1920s and 1930s were resolute in their condemnation of Jewish mobsters.  History  = 19th century to early 20th century = A large wave of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries produced Jewish mobsters such as Max \\"Kid Twist\\" Zwerbach, \\"Big\\" Jack Zelig, and Vach \\"Cyclone Louie\\" Lewis, who competed with and were acknowledged by Italian and Irish gangs. Just as with their Italian counterparts, gangs specializing in extortion began operating in the heavily Jewish neighborhoods of New York's Lower East Side, most prominently the so- called Yiddish Black Hand headed by Jacob Levinsky, Charles \\"Charlie the Cripple\\" Litoffsky, and Joseph Toplinsky during the early 20th century. A significant Jewish underworld already existed in New York at the start of the 20th century, with Jewish mobsters conversing in a jargon with Yiddish origins. A pimp was known as a \\"simcha,\\" a detective as a \\"shamus\\", and a loafer as a \\"trombenik.\\"\\"Free-wheeling U.S. spirit stoked gangsters, prof says\\" , Jewish Bulletin of Northern California, December 4, 1998 Jewish- American organized crime arose among slum kids who as prepubescents stole from pushcarts, who as adolescents extorted money from store owners, who as young adults practiced schlamming (wielding an iron pipe, wrapped in newspaper, against striking workers or against scabs) ‚Äì until as adults they joined well- organized gangs involved in a wide variety of criminal enterprises boosted by prohibition.\\"This You Call a Stick-Up?\\" , The New York Times, April 12, 1998 (Review of Tough Jews by Rich Cohen) The lure of quick money, power, and the romance of the criminal lifestyle was attractive to both second-generation Jewish and Italian immigrants. There was a supposed Jewish \\"crime wave\\" in early 20th century New York. In disturbing numbers, young Jews had joined crime \\"rackets,\\" it was said, along with children of Irish, Italian and other immigrants.\\"The Second Generation from the Last Great Wave of Immigration: Setting the Record Straight\\" , by Nancy Foner, Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York & Richard Alba, State University of New York at Albany, October 2006 However, the supposed Jewish-immigrant crime wave may have been exaggerated by the press and law enforcement. Crime and population figures show that Jews in New York committed crimes at a rate far below the average for the wider society. As described by sociologist Stephen Steinberg, less than a sixth of the city's felony arrests were Jews during the 1920s, when Jews constituted nearly a third of the city's population.\\"Higher Immigration, Lower Crime , by Daniel Griswold, Commentary magazine, December 2009 As the 20th century progressed, Jewish-American mobsters such as \\"Dopey\\" Benny Fein and Joe \\"The Greaser\\" Rosenzweig entered labor racketeering, hiring out to both businesses and labor unions as strong arm men. Labor racketeering or \\"labor slugging\\" as it was known, would become a source of conflict as it came under the domination of several racketeers including former Five Points Gang members Nathan \\"Kid Dropper\\" Kaplan and Johnny Spanish during the Labor slugger wars until its eventual takeover by Jacob \\"Gurrah\\" Shapiro in 1927. Other Jewish organized crime figures involved in controlling labor unions include Moses Annenberg and Arnold Rothstein, the latter reportedly responsible for fixing the 1919 World Series. = Prohibition = According to crime writer Leo Katcher, Rothstein \\"transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business, run like a corporation, with himself at the top.\\" According to Rich Cohen, Rothstein was the person to see during prohibition (1920‚Äì1933) if one had an idea for a tremendous business opportunity, legal or not. Rothstein \\"understood the truths of early 20th century capitalism (hypocrisy, exclusion, greed) and came to dominate them\\". According to Cohen, Rothstein was the 'Moses of Jewish gangsters', a rich man's son, who showed the young and uneducated hoodlums of the Bowery how to have style. Lucky Luciano, who would become a prominent boss within the Italian-American Mafia and organize New York's Five Families, once claimed that Arnold Rothstein \\"taught me how to dress\\". The stereotypical attire of the American mobster portrayed in movies can partially trace its roots directly to Rothstein.Cohen, Rich (1999). Tough Jews: Fathers, Sons, and Gangster Dreams, London: Vintage During prohibition, Jewish gangsters became major operatives in the American underworld and played prominent roles in the distribution of illegal alcohol and the spread of organized crime throughout the United States. At the time, Jewish gangs operated primarily in America's largest cities, including Cleveland, Detroit, Minneapolis, Newark, New York City, and Philadelphia. Numerous bootlegging gangs such as the Bug and Meyer Mob headed by Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel and Abe Bernstein's Purple GangKavieff, Paul R. (2000). The Purple Gang: Organized Crime in Detroit, 1910‚Äì1945. New York: Barricade would see the rise of Jewish-American organized crime to its height. Other Jewish mobsters, including Dutch Schultz of New York,Sann, Paul (1971). Kill the Dutchman!: The Story of Dutch Schultz. New Rochelle, New York: Arlington House. Moe Dalitz of Michigan, Kid Cann of Minneapolis, Charles \\"King\\" Solomon of Boston and Abner \\"Longy\\" Zwillman (the \\"Al Capone of New Jersey\\") became wealthy during prohibition. During this time, Luciano successfully eliminated the Old World Sicilian Mafia bosses like Joe Masseria and Salvatore Maranzano in the 1931 Castellammarese War and took control of the New York Italian Mafia. Luciano did not discriminate against Jews and valued longtime associates such as Meyer Lansky and Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel. Several Jewish gangsters such as Red Levine and Bo Weinberg were used in the war as unsuspected non-Italian hitmen. After Masseria and Maranzano were murdered, a conference was held at New York's Franconia Hotel on November 11, 1931 which included Jewish mobsters such as Jacob Shapiro, Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter, Joseph \\"Doc\\" Stacher, Hyman \\"Curly\\" Holtz, Louis \\"Shadows\\" Kravitz, Harry Tietlebaum, Philip \\"Little Farvel\\" Kovolick and Harry \\"Big Greenie\\" Greenberg. During this meeting, Luciano and Lansky convinced the Jewish- American mobsters of the benefits of cooperating with the Italian-American Mafia in a newly created consortium called the National Crime Syndicate by the press. At the meeting's conclusion, \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel supposedly declared \\"The yids and the dagos will no longer fight each other.\\"Sifakis, Carl (2005). The Mafia Encyclopedia. New York: Da Capo Press. Those Jewish gangsters hostile to the idea of cooperation with non-Jewish rivals gradually receded, most notably Philadelphia bootlegger Waxey Gordon, who was convicted and imprisoned for tax evasion based on evidence provided to United States Attorney Thomas E. Dewey by Lansky. Following Gordon's imprisonment, his operations were assumed by Nig Rosen and Max \\"Boo Hoo\\" Hoff. During prohibition Moe Dalitz established the Cleveland Syndicate with fellow Jewish gangsters Louis Rothkopf, Maurice Klein, Sam Tucker, Charles Polizzi, and Irish gangster Blackjack McGinty.

New York: Farrar, Straus and Young. = After World War II = For several decades after World War II, the dominant figures in organized crime were second-generation Jews and Italians, often working in concert. As late as the 1960s, Jewish presence in organized crime was still acknowledged as Los Angeles mobster Jack Dragna explained to hitman and later government informant Jimmy Fratianno: Jewish mobsters, such as Meyer Lansky and the Los Angeles-based Mickey Cohen, along with Harold \\"Hooky\\" Rothman, continued to hold significant power and control organized crime groups in New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, and Las Vegas, while the Jewish-American presence remained strong in Italian-American criminal rackets. Shondor Birns was a Jewish crime boss, in Cleveland, who controlled numbers, prostitution, theft, and gambling rackets. Birns was active until 1975, when he was murdered by Irish gangster Danny Greene. Jewish-American organized crime derived from dislocation and poverty, where language and custom made the community vulnerable to undesirables, the sort of thing that fosters criminality among any other ethnicity in a similar situation. As American Jews improved their conditions, the Jewish thug and racketeer either disappeared or merged into a more assimilated American crime environment. American Jews quietly buried the public memory of the gangster past; unlike the Mafia, famous Jewish American gangsters like Meyer Lansky, Dutch Schultz and Bugsy Siegel founded no crime families.\\"Defenders of the faith\\", The Guardian, Saturday July 6, 2002 Much like Irish-Americans and other ethnicities (with the exception of Italian- American criminal organizations), Jewish-American presence in organized crime began to decline after World War II.

From the 1990s until 2013, members of the New York divorce coercion gang kidnapped and tortured Jewish men in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting religious divorces to their wives, in some cases extorting money from them.

Jewish-American organized crime and Israel  Several notable Jewish-American mobsters provided financial support for Israel through donations to Jewish organizations since the country's creation in 1948. Jewish-American gangsters used Israel's Law of Return to flee criminal charges or face deportation. Notables include Joseph \\"Doc\\" Stacher, who built up Las Vegas by pairing the Jewish and Italian Mafia into a national organized crime syndicate. Prime Minister Golda Meir set out to reverse this trend in 1970, when she denied entrance to Meyer Lansky. He was the mob's accountant, thought to be among the most powerful people in the country, with a gambling empire stretching throughout the United States. In 2010, it was reported by Wikileaks that the United States Embassy in Israel, in a cable titled \\"Israel: The Promised Land of Organized Crime?\\", had expressed grave concern about the activities of Israeli organized crime figures, and was taking measures to prevent members of crime families from being issued visas to the United States. American diplomats expressed concern that Inbal Gavrieli, the niece of one of Israel's most powerful mafia bosses, had been elected to the Knesset as an MK for Likud.\\"WikiLeaks: U.S. worried Israel becoming 'the promised land' for organized crime\\" , Haaretz, December 3, 2010  Russian and Israeli mafia in the United States  The Soviet and Russian √©migr√© community in New York's Brighton Beach contains a large Jewish presence. Some of these newer American- based Jewish gangsters, such as Ludwig Fainberg (who has lived in Ukraine, Israel and the United States, but never in Russia), share more in common culturally with Russia and the Soviet republics than their predecessors, such as Meyer Lansky.Robert I.

The story is set in the late 15th century in Florence, Italy. It was first published by Little, Brown in 2003 with the title The Birth of Venus: love and death in Florence. Plot overview A young Florentine girl, Alessandra Cecchi, is drawn to a young painter commissioned to paint the family's chapel walls. The painter is brought to her home by her father, a rich textile merchant whose business would be negatively affected by the rise of Girolamo Savonarola in Florence over the next few years. The book follows Alessandra's daily life, and is written in the first person, as a memoir written by Alessandra late in her life. Her passion for painting and learning serve her well, but her family does not approve. Her mother tries her hardest to shape Alessandra into a woman who will be desired by a successful and powerful man. Eventually, after Alessandra has met the painter, but before her feelings for him and his talent have made themselves known to her, her hateful brother Tomaso suggests strong but quiet Cristoforo Langella as a potential husband for her. She marries him shortly afterward. Meanwhile, her attraction to the painter grows, as does her affection for her husband Cristoforo. Alessandra's observations of the political turbulence in Florence are key to the storyline. Dunant captures the personal conflict felt by Alessandra - she feels torn between Savonarola's fiery message and her own ideas. She believes she knows what is right, but doesn't know what she will do about it. Alessandra realizes that her duty to her family and to her spouse cannot take over her life, and eventually realizes her passion for the painter. Her romance, it seems, is necessary, because she is the only one who can save him.

Located in Kiamesha Lake, New York, the Concord was the largest resort in the region until its closing in 1998. There were over 1,500 guest rooms and a dining room that sat 3,000; the resort encompassed some . Although the resort was a kosher establishment, catering primarily to Jewish vacationers from the New York City area, it was more lavish in decor and activities than comparable large Catskill resorts. History and design Room B322 in 1977 A small establishment near Kiamesha Lake called the Ideal House existed during the 1920s and 1930s. Arthur Winarick acquired the property after a default and rebuilt it in 1937 as the 500-bed Concord Plaza. Keeping up with Grossinger's following World War II, the then-renamed New Concord Hotel rapidly expanded and added amenities to match Grossinger's ski slope and golf course. The Tropical Indoor Pool opened in 1951, accelerating the race. Expansion continued in the 1950s, when prominent hotel architect Morris Lapidus was hired to design new modern style guest wings. At the Concord Lapidus worked with architect-interior designer Theordor Muller on interiors for lobbies, dining spaces and night clubs. A rotunda and promenade, as well as the huge Cordillion Room, Night Owl Lounge and the even bigger Imperial Room night club were added. Lapidus employed his signature floating stair design in the rotunda to give guests an opportunity to make a grand entrance. The Concord was known for its impressive entertainment venues. The original Cordillion Room opened in the 1950s with 1500 seats, along with the Constellation Room with its distinctive undulating bar. Winarick felt that more was needed, and the Lapidus-designed Imperial Room seated three thousand in a nearly circular space, perhaps the largest in the Catskills, and a popular venue for major entertainers. Guest quarters in the tower sections were regarded as impersonal. Up to ten story guest wings replaced the original hotel in the 1950s. A Lapidus-designed 1959 wing featured 210 rooms with projecting bay windows and his-and-her bathrooms, each with a dressing area. Following the construction of an elaborate indoor pool at Grossinger's, the original Concord pool was replaced by the Lapidus-design Bubble, which doubled as a solarium, as well as a large spa. The Concord attracted major entertainers who could fill the Imperial Room to standing room-only. Buddy Hackett was a frequently featured performer, as were Tony Bennett, Milton Berle and Tony Martin. Barbra Streisand and Judy Garland also played the Concord. Martin Luther King Jr. received an award at the Concord in 1963. Following Arthur Winarick's death in 1964 the resort was managed by son- in-law Ray Parker. =Later history and demolition= Concord lobby in 1977 According to the Concord Resort & Golf Club Website, the hotel is now > \\"...home of the World Famous \\"Monster\\" Golf Course rated by Golf Digest as > one of America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses\\" which \\"features full service pro > shop, driving range, overnight accommodations, meeting rooms, restaurant and > bar, large catering and banquet facilities, individual and corporate > memberships, golf school, and a PGA professional staff for all golf > instruction programs.\\"Concord Resort & Golf Club Website Then owners Robert and Linda Parker (identified in photo), with a large group at the Concord Hotel (1977) There are currently 42 guest rooms and the website indicate that more rooms will be built as well as amenities not related to the golf course (i.e. swimming pool, tennis courts, etc.) The \\"Monster Golf Academy\\" is under the direction of PGA Professional Todd Barker.

It is part of the Cincinnati Public Schools. History The first Hughes High School was established in 1853 on property on Fifth and Mound streets. The school owes its name to Thomas Hughes, an Englishman and shoemaker, who, by his will, dated December, 1826, left his property for a high school, which was built in 1853 at a cost of $23,375. =Pre-Hughes Center= Thomas Hughes' vision, wherein he had bequeathed his land to be ‚Äúapplied to the maintenance and support of a school or schools in the City of Cincinnati for the education of poor destitute children whose parents or guardians are unable to pay for their schooling‚Äù came into fruition almost 30 years later. The first graduating class consisted of six girls and four boys. The school thereafter served a predominantly poor population of students. =Hughes Center= Hughes Center was a team-based magnet school dedicated to the Paideia philosophy. The Paideia philosophy is based upon the belief that all students can be successful in a rigorous college preparatory curriculum. Programs available at Hughes Center included: *Zoo Academy (a program offered in association with the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden) *High School for Teaching and Technology *High School for the Health Professions *High School for the Communication Profession *Cincinnati Academy for Mathematics and Science (CAMAS) High School *The Paideia High School The last principal of Hughes Center was Dr. Virginia Rhodes and the school program was closed with the graduating class of 2012. =Hughes STEM= Hughes STEM saw its first students in 2009. In response to national initiatives for STEM education in America's public schools, the school curriculum was redesigned to focus on related career fields. A NSF grant aimed at creating scalable models of STEM schools paid for much of the upstart and transition costs, many of which were related to technology equipment acquisition. In 2011-2012 Hughes gained an 8th grade class and became a fully 7th-12th grade school the following school year. Academics The school is composed of four pathways: * Health and Bioscience * Engineering * Programming and Software Development * Zoo Academy located at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden =Extra-Curriculars= The school is host to a robotics team, an academic team, and a science club. =Athletics= Hughes is home to a number of teams for boys and girls, most of which compete in the CMAC. Those teams include football, basketball, volleyball, baseball, softball, soccer, wrestling, cheerleading, dance, and track. =Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships= * Boys Baseball - 1938,1949 * Boys Swimming ‚Äì 1930 * Boys Golf ‚Äì 1928 * Boys Track and Field ‚Äì 1925 Notable alumni *Wilbur G.

Modeling career Solinger started modeling through a Miss Caboodles competition sponsored by Teen Magazine. She placed as one of six regional finalists and was flown to Santa Monica, CA for a week long photo shoot. Another regional finalist there was Julee Kleffman, Miss Illinois Teen USA '92. Upon returning to Iowa, Jamie was signed with Ford New York. While with Ford, she worked for magazines such as Seventeen and Glamour. During a summer home from New York, she was spotted by the Iowa pageant directors and recruited to enter the Miss Iowa Teen USA 1992 pageant. After her pageant years were served, she moved to South Beach Miami where she continued to model for places such as Sunglass Hut, Newport News, JC Penney, some French editorial, and German catalogs. She eventually returned to Iowa to work with Hawthorne Direct, an infomercial producer, with whom she did work for Time, OxyClean, and Clorox. Miss Teen USA Solinger competed as Miss Iowa Teen USA in the 1992 Miss Teen USA pageant, broadcast from Biloxi, Mississippi on 25 August 1992. Although the pageant was to be televised live, the threat of Hurricane Andrew meant the pageant had to be recorded earlier. Both Solinger and eventual first runner-up, Angela Logan of Oklahoma were taped \\"winning\\" the pageant to maintain suspense. Only Solinger's crowning moment was shown on television as the legitimate titleholder. Solinger would become the first and only Miss Teen USA from Iowa and only the second teen from her state to place in the national pageant. Iowa would not place again until 1995 and 2003. Miss USA Solinger won the title of Miss Iowa USA in 1998, and competed in the 1998 Miss USA pageant alongside Shauna Gambill of California who was Miss Teen USA in 1994. This would be the last time any former Miss Teen USA titleholder would take part in a Miss USA pageant. Before them, Kelly Hu competed in 1993 and Brandi Sherwood in 1997. This would also be the second and last time two Miss Teen USA winners would compete in the same Miss USA pageant. The only other time this happened was in 1984, when Ruth Zakarian and Cherise Haugen competed with a Miss Teen USA sash, following an old rule from the Miss Universe Organization that allowed them to compete without going through the state pageant system. After completing her year as Miss Iowa USA, Jamie crowned her sister Jaclyn as Miss Iowa USA 1999. They are one of few pairs of sisters to compete at Miss USA, and only second to win the same title in subsequent years. It would not happen again until 2003-2004 when sisters Alicia and Justine Michioka won consecutive Miss Hawaii USA titles.

First World War Punch went to Peace Avenue school, a temporary school. In 1914 when he was 16, he enrolled in mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta, but when war broke out he quit to enlist as an infantryman in the Canadian Army, and served with the 196th Western Universities Battalion for one year as a company clerk.

Punch transferred from the 21st Reserve Unit to the RFC School of Instruction at the Acton Aerodrome, northwest of London.\\"1909 to 1920: Acton Aerodrome spearheads the burgeoning UK aircraft industry.\\" Hanger Hill Garden Estate: Acton Aerodrome. Retrieved: March 5, 2011. Punch became a bomber pilot and served with No. 211 Squadron, Royal Air Force, flying from the front line base at Petit Synthe, France. Serving from May 1918 until February 1919, Punch emerged as a skilled and able pilot of the Airco DH9 medium bomber. It was claimed he eventually shot down seven enemy aircraft, earning the distinction of being one of the few bomber pilots to become an ace. What is certain is that he and his gunner claimed an enemy aircraft that broke up on 4 November 1918 (shared with 2nd Lt W G Watson/Sgt. C Lamont). He attributed his success to having a skilled gunner, 2nd Lt. Jock Adam, and the pair of them worked as a team. Dick and Adam would complete 73 missions by the end of the war. Punch was awarded the DFC (Distinguished Flying Cross) at age 20 in 1919. The dispatch that accompanied the award noted that 2nd Lt. C.H. Dick had completed aerial assignments under fire with \\"persistence and gallantry.\\".\\"Eagle Biography: C.

Inter-war years Punch Dickins remained in France until March 1919 before he was demobilized and released from military service. He opted to return home with elements of the Canadian Expeditionary Force returning from an expedition to Siberia. Reaching Edmonton in May 1919, Dickins enrolled briefly in engineering at the University of Alberta until he received an offer from General Motors. By 1921 Punch had been awarded a Commercial Air Pilot's Certificate (No.161) as well as the Air Engineer's Certificate (No. 213) by the Air Board. He joined the new Royal Canadian Air Force in 1924 and served until 1927. As a veteran, Punch was assigned the rank of Flying Officer. One of his first duties was to prepare a report for the Edmonton Post Office on the use of aircraft as mail carriers. As a test and demonstration pilot, he was charged with the service introduction of the new Armstrong Whitworth Siskin fighter. Leaving the military for civil aviation, he was one of the first pilots to join Western Canada Airways, operating in Manitoba and Northern Ontario. He flew the first aircraft on the prairie airmail circuit of Winnipeg, Regina, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon, and Winnipeg. Soon, he and the bush pilots were also establishing a new frontier- the North. His wife, \\"Connie,\\" wrote a revealing account of their life in the north, I Married a Bush Pilot. Punch Dickins became a legend in the Arctic; flying more than 1,000,000 miles across the uncharted North, often in treacherous weather conditions, with few landing strips, unreliable weather reporting and navigation aids nearly useless -as flying so close to the magnetic north pole made compass navigation unreliable. He invariably used dead reckoning and hand-drawn maps to plot his way across the north of Canada. Dickins was responsible for a number of landmark flights. He flew one of the first aerial surveys of Canada in 1928 in a Fokker Super Universal (G-CASK). On 23 January 1929, Dickins delivered the first airmail to the Northwest Territories. Despite this early success Western Canada lost the government airmail contract to Commercial Airways, which had its own famous bush pilot in Wop May. He was also the first pilot to fly along the Arctic coastline, the first to fly over the Barren Lands in the Northwest Territories, and the first to fly the full 2,000 mile length of the Mackenzie River, which he covered in two days. In 1930 he flew the first prospectors into Great Bear Lake where they discovered uranium, later required for the Manhattan Project. In 1936 Punch conducted a 10,000 mile air survey of northern Canada. Second World War Prior to the Second World War Dickins became a general superintendent for CPR airline division. When war came Punch Dickins again entered the military, this time as the head of the Atlantic Ferry Command, which flew combat aircraft to Britain during the early years of the war. After 1942 Dickins emerged as one of the leading exponents of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan. His involvement was one of the reasons why the organization was able to train many thousands of combat fliers in Canada. Punch also managed six flight training schools. He finished the war years as a vice-president of Canadian Pacific Airlines before joining de Havilland Canada Aircraft Ltd. Post-Second World War C-FGYN Adlair Aviation Ltd. de Havilland Beaver (DHC2) Mk.I on floats In 1946 the de Havilland Canada company surveyed 80 veteran Canadian bush pilots to advise on specifications of a future utility transport for use in Northern and Arctic conditions. Punch provided input ranging from recommending an all-metal airframe, and the location of the battery removal hatch to providing doors on both sides of the fuselage for ease of docking. After consultation with company executives, Dickins joined the de Havilland Aircraft Company as a consultant. His expertise was called upon as the postwar design of the Chipmunk trainer came into fruition as a production aircraft. In 1947, as Director of Sales of de Havilland Canada, Punch was instrumental in launching the Beaver bushplane.\\"Beaver One.\\" Canadian Museum of Flight. Retrieved: January 10, 2010. Arguably his greatest legacy to bush flying was his contribution to the family of de Havilland Canada STOL (Short Takeoff and Landing) aircraft that have become the world leaders in this field. The DHC series of light transport aircraft for use in the north were heavily influenced by Dickins' experience and advice. The rugged Beaver and its offspring, the Otter, Twin Otter, Caribou, Buffalo and Dash 7 aircraft were employed worldwide in conditions as harsh and varied as tropical jungles and the Antarctic.\\"Dickins, C. H. 'Punch' National Historic Person: Fort McMurray, Alberta.\\" Parks Canada, March 15, 2012. Retrieved: October 3, 2013. Dickins continued working with de Havilland Canada for many years, becoming their sales agent. He travelled all over the world and was responsible for thousands of sales both in civil and military markets. Honours and legacy Near the end of his career, Punch Dickins was honoured as a pioneer of Canada's rich aviation heritage. In the North, Punch was christened \\"The Snow Eagle\\" and \\"Canada's Sky Explorer.\\" Punch Dickins was the second recipient of the Trans- Canada (McKee) Trophy in 1928. He was named an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1968, and the Government of Canada named him one of the most outstanding Canadians of the country's first century. He was also a co-founder of the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame and was inducted as a member in 1974.Dr. Joe Anderson of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and Mayor of the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo Don Scott dedicate a commemorative plaque and monument to aviation pioneer, C.

Known as Davidsonville Road, the highway runs from MD 214 in Davidsonville north to MD 3 in Crofton. MD 424 connects U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 301 with the two communities in central Anne Arundel County. The highway was constructed from Davidsonville to what is now MD 450 in the late 1920s. MD 424 was extended to what is now MD 3 in the late 1940s. The highway's interchange with US 50 opened in the early 1950s when the U.S. Highway was relocated between Bowie and Annapolis. MD 424 temporarily extended south to MD 2 in the early to mid-1950s and north to the Little Patuxent River in the 1970s and early 1980s. Route description View north near the south end of MD 424 at MD 214 in Davidsonville MD 424 begins at an intersection with MD 214 (Central Avenue) within the Davidsonville Historic District. The south leg of the intersection is county-maintained Birdsville Road. MD 424 heads northwest out of Davidsonville as a two-lane undivided road and passes to the east of the historic homes Mount Airy and Indian Range, which are located along Mount Airy Road. The highway curves north and intersects Governors Bridge Road, which heads west toward the historic one-lane Governor's Bridge across the Patuxent River. MD 424 veers northwest, expands to a four-lane divided highway, and has a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with John Hanson Highway, a freeway that carries US 50, US 301, and unsigned Interstate 595. A park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses is located at the southeast corner of this interchange. MD 424 reduces to two lanes, veers north, and passes to the west of the historic home Rosehill before intersecting MD 450 (Defense Highway) on the southeastern edge of Crofton. The highway passes by the historic home Linthicum Walks and along the northeastern edge of the planned community. MD 424 expands to a four-lane undivided highway at Riedel Road before reaching its northern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway). The west leg of the intersection is Conway Road, a county highway that crosses the Little Patuxent River a short distance to the west. MD 424 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from MD 450 north to MD 3 in Crofton. History MD 424 was constructed as a wide gravel highway from what was then MD 254 (now MD 214) in Davidsonville north to US 50 (now MD 450) in 1929 and 1930. By 1934, the Maryland State Roads Commission recommended the highway be expanded to a width of for its whole length. Much of the highway was expanded from in 1944. MD 424 was extended northwest to US 301 (now MD 3) at a place called Conaways in 1949. The state highway's interchange with the Annapolis- Washington Expressway, which became part of US 50, was constructed between 1950 and 1952 concurrent with the portion of the freeway between Bowie and Parole. The MD 424 designation was extended south along Birdsville Road to MD 2 in 1951 but truncated at Davidsonville by 1956. During that period, Birdsville Road was improved with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface in 1953 and 1954. Signage on MD 2 at Birdsville Road still reads \\"TO MD 424\\". MD 424 was extended north from MD 3 along Conway Road to the highway's bridge across the Little Patuxent River by 1978; the bridge itself was constructed in 1966. The highway's northern terminus returned to MD 3 by 1985. MD 424 was expanded to a divided highway when a pair of new bridges were constructed at its interchange with US 50 and US 301 in 1994. The highway was expanded to four lanes on its northernmost mile in Crofton by 1999.

Bush played in the major leagues from 1923 to 1938 and again in 1945. The pitcher played for the Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Bees, St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds in his seventeen-year professional baseball career. Baseball career =Chicago Cubs= Bush was originally drafted and signed by the Chicago Cubs in 1919 for $1,000. After attending the now defunct Tupelo Military Institute in Mississippi, Bush made his major league debut for the team that year on September 17, 1923. In his only game of the season, Bush came in the ninth inning and gave up one hit while striking out two. He returned with the Cubs the following season as a dual-duty starter and reliever. Bush pitched to a 2‚Äì5 record in sixteen games, half of which he started. He threw four complete games and finished four others. In 80 innings of work, he gave up 91 hits and 36 earned runs, and struck out 36 batters. In the following few seasons, Bush started to take a larger role as a reliever. Bush led the league in saves in 1925, with four, and again in 1929 when he had eight. He also led the league in relief wins that season and the following season. After finishing the 1926 campaign fourth in the league with a 2.86 earned run average in a primarily relief setting, Bush started more games than he relieved the following season. Despite giving up 79 walks while only striking out 62 batters, he had a 10‚Äì10 record on the year, with a 3.03 ERA. Bush started 22 of his 36 games, including a marathon on May 14, 1927, in which Bush and Boston Braves starter Charlie Robertson duelled for eighteen innings. Bush won the game after Robertson tired, surrendering five runs in the 18th inning. In the National League since then, only Carl Hubbell in 1933 and Vern Law in 1955 have matched Bush's marathon performance. Bush's ERA rose to 3.83 the next year, but he did post a 15‚Äì6 record in 42 games, 24 of which he started. Bush followed up with a career year in 1929. He finished the year on top of the league in saves and games pitched, and fourth in the league for wins. Also that year, Bush ranked twelfth in the NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. Even more impressive, Bush had a streak of eleven straight wins until it was broken by a relief loss on August 12 against the Braves. Bush was a large contributor to the team's pennant-winning season, in which they finished on top of the NL with a 98‚Äì54 record. Bush was most dominant in the 1929 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. Bush pitched two games in the series, starting one and relieving another. Bush started Game 3 and pitched a complete game, surrendering only one run on nine hits. Despite the Cubs' loss of the Series in five games, Bush pitched a total of eleven innings with 4 strikeouts and gave up just one run. After the success of the 1929 season, Bush had a disappointing season in 1930. In 225 innings of work, Bush posted a 15‚Äì10 record with a 6.20 ERA, one of the worst in the league that season. He gave up 291 hits, fifth highest in the league, and led the league in earned runs allowed with 155 and wild pitches with 12. In November 1930, writer F.C. Lane wrote in Baseball Magazine about Bush's unique pitching windup: Bush had an improved season in 1931, thanks to performances such as a September 13 one- hitter against the Braves. He finished the year with a 16‚Äì8 record and a 4.49 ERA, in 180.1 innings of work. The following year, the Cubs again won the pennant behind Bush's 19‚Äì11 record and 3.20 ERA. That year, Bush finished the year third in the league for wins and 23rd in the NL MVP voting. The Cubs were pinned up against the New York Yankees in the 1932 World Series. It was an infamous matchup, known now for the general tension and fighting between both teams. (A fiery bench-jockey, Bush helped lead Chicago's mean-spirited heckling of Babe Ruth; \\"The Bambino\\" was unfazed, as evidenced by his legendary \\"called shot\\" home run in Game 3.) Bush did not fare well this time around in the World Series. As the starting pitcher for the Cubs in Game 1, Bush gave up eight runs on three hits, and walked five in just five innings of work, en route to a 12‚Äì6 Yankees win. Bush started Game 4, and lasted less than an inning. He hit Babe Ruth and gave up two hits and one earned run and was plucked from the pitching mound. For the series, Bush finished with a 0‚Äì1 record and 14.29 ERA, and gave up nine earned runs in less than six innings of work. Bush bounced back in 1933, finishing with his first 20-game winning season. He tied with Dizzy Dean and Ben Cantwell for the second most wins in the National League while also ranking among the NL's top ten with four shutouts (4th), 20 complete games (8th), and a 2.75 ERA (9th). Early in the 1933 season, Bush challenged Dizzy Dean to a mid-game fight; in describing their rivalry, Bush declared: ‚ÄúI get more satisfaction out of beating that guy [Dean] once than I do winning from anyone else twice.\\" Bush followed up with another solid season in 1934, his last with the Cubs. On November 22, 1934, just a little over a month after the season, Bush was traded along with outfielder Babe Herman and Jim Weaver to the Pittsburgh Pirates for left- handed pitcher Larry French and future Hall of Famer Freddie Lindstrom, also then playing outfield after spending most of his career at third base. Bush left the Cubs after twelve years with the team and finished as one of the club's winningest pitchers with a record of 152‚Äì101. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Bush did not show much improvement in 1935 with the Pirates. He did, however, place his name into the record books. On May 25, the Pirates played the Braves in one of Babe Ruth's final games. Ruth put on a performance, collecting four hits including three home runs and knocking in six runners. The first home run shot came off pitcher Red Lucas, while the last two came off Bush. The last home run was Ruth's career home run #714, and was a mammoth of a shot. It was the first home run to clear the right field grandstands at Forbes Field and was reportedly measured as a bomb. It was the last home run ‚Äî in fact, the last hit of any kind ‚Äî in Ruth's major league career, which ended less than a week later. Bush later described the Babe's final blast: \\"He [Ruth] got ahead of the ball and hit it over the triple deck, clear out of the ballpark. I'm telling you, it was the longest cockeyed ball I ever saw in my life.\\" Despite Ruth's Goliath performance, Waite Hoyt, Ruth's former Yankee teammate, came in relief for Bush and won the game 11‚Äì7, albeit after initially blowing the save. The Pirates sent the 34-year-old Bush to the bullpen for the 1936 season. The transition did not go well with Bush as he gave up 49 hits in just 34.7 innings of work, and posted a 5.97 ERA. =Journeyman= Midway through the season, on July 20, 1936, the Pirates released Bush. He was subsequently signed by the Boston Bees (the former Braves). The Bees used him primarily as a starter and his stats improved, as a result. Despite pitching with below a 3.60 ERA in both 1936 and 1937, the St. Louis Cardinals bought Bush from the Bees months prior to the start of the 1938 season. On May 7, after coming in relief in six games, Bush was released by the Cardinals. Bush's career seemed to be over, however, he did come back to the majors seven years later, at age 43. Since many teams were affected by players leaving to fight in World War II, ex-players like Bush, Babe Herman and Hod Lisenbee were signed as replacements. The Reds signed Bush prior to the 1945 season, and used him as a closer. Despite picking up one save in four relief appearances, the Reds released Bush on June 2, 1945. Bush's career was finished, this time for good. The Mississippi Mudcat finished his career with a 176‚Äì136 pitching record and a 3.86 ERA over 2722 innings and 542 games‚Äì308 as a starter, 234 in relief. Bush was a better than average fielding pitcher in his major league career, recording a .974 fielding percentage, which was 14 points higher than the league average at his position.. On June 23, 1934, after committing an error on a sacrifice bunt by Hal Schumacher at Wrigley Field, Bush handled the next 179 total chances (33 putouts, 146 assists) without an error to finish out his career. Bush also managed the Battle Creek Belles of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in parts of two seasons spanning 1951‚Äì52. Guy Bush died at age 83 on July 2, 1985 of cardiac arrest after working in his garden in Shannon, Mississippi.

Fire Saturday, 11 February 1989 at 17:42 PM Company 38 rolled up to find roughly 1/2 of an abandoned ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped one-story elementary school with fire through the roof. The old building, located at 2455 Bankhead Highway NW in the Center Hill neighborhood, had been vacant for several years and was for sale by the Board of Education. Vandals had stripped the building of wiring and piping and most of the windows were broken out. Many holes were punched in the plaster on wood lathe walls in the older portions of the building so fire moved very rapidly. The original building formed the bottom of the ‚ÄúU‚Äù and some tough firefighting saved the legs of the ‚ÄúU‚Äù due to the change in construction from the wood frame with brick veneer of the original building to block walls and a Tectum roof deck over the newer sections. The lack of wood in the roof design slowed the fire slightly and gave the responding companies time to get lines laid and make a stand. Eventually the incident grew to a Three Alarm Fire including Automatic Aid from Fulton County Company 11. Control was gained at 19:07 after two Ladder Pipes, four deluge guns and numerous hand lines were operated. Firefighter Fairus Elder of Company 16 injured a knee during overhaul operations.

Playing career After a successful junior career with the WHL's Tri-City Americans, Levins was selected by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft. At the NHL level, Levins was used primarily as a grinder and physical presence, as he had difficulty replicating the offensive numbers he had produced in the minors. Levins ultimately played in only nine games in Winnipeg, spending the majority of his time with their farm team, the Moncton Hawks. He was claimed by the Florida Panthers in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft and after 29 games was dealt to the Ottawa Senators in 1994 in a multi-player deal which saw Bob Kudelski going to Florida. It was in Ottawa that Levins would spend the majority of his NHL career. He would later play briefly with the Phoenix Coyotes before his NHL career came to an end, and he played the rest of his professional career in the minors (IHL, AHL and UHL) and then in Germany (DEL) for Kassel Huskies, Eisb√§ren Berlin and Revierl√∂wen Oberhausen before heading to the British Ice Hockey Superleague to play for the Sheffield Steelers.

It is the second installment in the Slumber Party Massacre trilogy, and stars Crystal Bernard, and Atanas Ilitch. The film follows Courtney, from the first film, as she and her friends are attacked by a supernatural killer with a power-drilled guitar. Slumber Party Massacre II grossed $1.3 million at the box office on a budget of $500,000. Despite a largely negative reception, the film has attracted a small cult following among fans of the slasher genre. A sequel, Slumber Party Massacre III, was released in 1990. Plot Courtney Bates, who survived the events of the first film, is now a senior in high school. She invites her crush, Matt, to stay at a condominium for her birthday weekend with her and her friends, Amy, Sheila, and Sally. Upon arriving, two of the girls' boyfriends, Jeff and T.J., show up at the house. That night, Courtney has a dream of the killer from the first film, who is now reincarnated as a greaser and armed with a drill bit guitar, and awakens on the kitchen floor. That day, her visions grow violent but she is comforted when Matt arrives. Sally disappears and the group is unable to find her, but she later returns to the house, having left to go to the store. Courtney and Matt are left alone. Matt surprises Courtney with a birthday cake and the two begin to have sex. The killer impales Matt through the chest and chases Courtney downstairs, where he confronts the group, who have just returned. The killer impales Sally with the drill. Sheila and T.J. flee, while Courtney, Amy, and Jeff leave in Jeff's car. Jeff is impaled by the killer, and Courtney and Amy flee back to the house. Sheila and T.J. run to a nearby house for help, but the killer catches up to them and T.J. is killed. Sheila manages to return to the condominium before the killer murders her as well. Courtney and Amy escape but the killer pursues them through a construction site, where Amy falls to her death. Courtney uses a oxyacetylene torch to light the killer on fire, finally killing him. Sometime later, Courtney wakes up next to Matt, but he morphs into the killer. She then awakens inside a psychiatric ward and screams frantically, as a drill bursts through the floor and the credits roll. Cast Production Filming of Slumber Party Massacre II took place in Los Angeles, California in June 1987 under the working title Don‚Äôt Let Go. The budget was approximately $500,000. Release =Box office= The film was given a limited release theatrically in the United States by New Concorde on October 16, 1987, and grossed $1.3 million at the box office on a budget of $500,000. =Home media= It was subsequently released on VHS by Nelson Entertainment. The film has been released on DVD three times. The first release came from New Concorde Home Entertainment in September 2000. Extras included actor bios along with trailers for Slumber Party Massacre, Slumber Party Massacre II and Sorority House Massacre II. The company re-released the film on a double feature DVD alongside the original The Slumber Party Massacre in July 2003. These versions are both currently out of print. On October 5, 2010 Shout! Factory released Slumber Party Massacre, Slumber Party Massacre II and Slumber Party Massacre III on a two-disc special edition DVD set. It has since been released on Blu-ray in a double feature with its successor. The Shout! Factory release includes an extended, unrated version of the film, never before seen on home video. It was pieced together using three different sources by Editor/Director Dustin Ferguson. Reception Leonard Klady of the Los Angeles Times compared the film's supernatural elements to A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), adding: \\"Writer-director Deborah Brock simply fails to give her film style or wit. The grisly shenanigans are as inane and illogical as the rationale behind making this effort.\\" TV Guide awarded the film two out of four stars, noting that it follows in the \\"vaguely feminist tradition\\" of the first film, adding: \\"The rockabilly killer is probably the most entertaining slasher ever to grace the screen--sort of like Elvis Presley playing Norman Bates, complete with musical numbers.\\" In The Gorehound's Guide to Splatter Films of the 1980s, Scott Aaron Stine writes: \\"You can't get much more an insufferable viewing experience than this slasher flick-cum-musical.\\" References External links * * Category:1987 films Category:1987 horror films Category:1980s slasher films Slumber 2 Slumber 2 Category:American sequel films Category:American slasher films Category:Massacre (franchise) Category:1987 directorial debut films ","title":"Slumber Party Massacre II"},{"id":"6647964","text":"Akshay Venkatesh (born 21 November 1981) is an Australian mathematician and a professor (since 15 August 2018) at the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study. His research interests are in the fields of counting, equidistribution problems in automorphic forms and number theory, in particular representation theory, locally symmetric spaces, ergodic theory, and algebraic topology. He is the only Australian to have won medals at both the International Physics Olympiad and International Mathematical Olympiad, which he did at the age of 12. In 2018, he was awarded the Fields Medal for his synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory. He is the second Australian and the second person of Indian descent to win the Fields Medal.  Early years  Venkatesh was born in Delhi, India and his family emigrated to Perth in Western Australia when he was two years old. He attended Scotch College. His mother, Svetha, is a computer science professor at Deakin University. A child prodigy, Venkatesh attended extracurricular training classes for gifted students in the state mathematical olympiad program, and in 1993, whilst aged only 11, he competed at the 24th International Physics Olympiad in Williamsburg, Virginia, winning a bronze medal. The following year, he switched his attention to mathematics and, after placing second in the Australian Mathematical Olympiad, he won a silver medal in the 6th Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad, before winning a bronze medal at the 1994 International Mathematical Olympiad held in Hong Kong. He completed his secondary education the same year, turning 13 before entering the University of Western Australia as its youngest ever student. Venkatesh completed the four year course in three years and became, at 16, the youngest person to earn First Class Honours in pure mathematics from the University. He was awarded the J. A. Woods Memorial Prize as the most outstanding graduate of the year from the Faculties of Science, Engineering, Dentistry, or Medical Science. While at UWA he was also one of the founding members of the Honours Cricket Association.  Research career  Venkatesh commenced his PhD at Princeton University in 1998 under Peter Sarnak, which he completed in 2002, producing the thesis Limiting forms of the trace formula. He was supported by the Hackett Fellowship for postgraduate study. He was then awarded a postdoctoral position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he served as a C.L.E. Moore instructor. Venkatesh then held a Clay Research Fellowship from the Clay Mathematics Institute from 2004 to 2006, and was an associate professor at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. He was a member of the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) from 2005 to 2006. He became a full professor at Stanford University on 1 September 2008. After serving as Distinguished Visiting Professor at the IAS in 2017-2018, he returns to the IAS as a permanent faculty member in mid-August 2018.  Recognition  Venkatesh was awarded the Salem Prize, given to a \\"young mathematician judged to have done outstanding work in Salem's field of interest--the theory of Fourier series\\" and the Packard Fellowship in 2007. In 2008, he received the US$10,000 SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, given for \\"outstanding contributions to areas of mathematics influenced by the great Indian mathematician, Srinivasa Ramanujan\\" and \\"only awarded to those under the age of thirty-two (the age of Ramanujan at his time of death).\\" The prize was presented at the International Conference on Number Theory and Modular Forms, held at SASTRA University in Kumbakonam, Ramanujan's hometown. In 2010, he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (Hyderabad) and spoke on the topic \\"Number Theory and Lie Theory and Generalisations.\\" For his exceptionally wide-ranging, foundational and creative contributions to modern number theory, Venkatesh was awarded the Infosys Prize in Mathematical Sciences in 2016. In 2017 he received the Ostrowski Prize, which is awarded every two years for \\"outstanding achievements in pure mathematics and in the foundations of numerical mathematics.\\" In 2018, he was awarded the Fields Medal, commonly described as the Nobel Prize of mathematics, becoming the second Australian (after Terence Tao) and the second person of Indian descent (after Manjul Bhargava) to be so honoured. The short citation for the medal declared that Venkatesh was being honoured for \\"his synthesis of analytic number theory, homogeneous dynamics, topology, and representation theory, which has resolved long-standing problems in areas such as the equidistribution of arithmetic objects.\\" University of Western Australia Professor Michael Giudici said of his former classmate's work that \\"[i]f it was easy for me to explain, then he wouldn't have received the Fields Medal\\". Australian mathematician and media personality Adam Spencer said that \\"[t]his century will be built by mathematicians, whether it's computer coding, algorithms, machine learning, artificial intelligence, app design and the like\\" and that \\"we should acknowledge the magnificence of the mathematical mind.\\" Director of the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute Professor Geoff Prince said \\"Akshay is an exciting and innovative leader in his field whose work will continue to have wide-ranging implications for mathematics\\" and a worthy recipient of the Fields medal \\"given his contribution to improving mathematicians' understanding of analytic number theory, algebraic number theory, and representation theory\\". The long citation for his Fields Medal describes Venkatesh as having \\"made profound contributions to an exceptionally broad range of subjects in mathematics\\" and recognises that he \\"solved many longstanding problems by combining methods from seemingly unrelated areas, presented novel viewpoints on classical problems, and produced strikingly far- reaching conjectures.\\" Venkatesh's \\"use of dynamics theory, which studies the equations of moving objects to solve problems in number theory, which is the study of whole numbers, integers and prime numbers\\" was recognised in the award. \\"His work uses representation theory, which represents abstract algebra in terms of more easily-understood linear algebra, and topology theory, which studies the properties of structures that are deformed through stretching or twisting, like a M√∂bius strip.\\" He described his work in 2016 as \\"looking for new patterns in the arithmetic of numbers\\". On receiving the award, which is presented every four years, Venkatesh said \\"A lot of the time when you do math, you're stuck, but at the same time there are all these moments where you feel privileged that you get to work with it. You have this sensation of transcendence, you feel like you've been part of something really meaningful.\\"  Contributions to mathematics  Venkatesh has made contributions to a wide variety of areas in mathematics, including number theory, automorphic forms, representation theory, locally symmetric spaces and ergodic theory, by himself, and in collaboration with several mathematicians. Using ergodic methods, Venkatesh, jointly with Jordan Ellenberg, made significant progress on the Hasse principle for integral representations of quadratic forms by quadratic forms. In a series of joint works with Manfred Einsiedler, Elon Lindenstrauss and Philippe Michel, Venkatesh revisited the Linnik ergodic method and solved a longstanding conjecture of Yuri Linnik on the distribution of torus orbits attached to cubic number fields. Venkatesh also provided a novel and more direct way of establishing sub-convexity estimates for L-functions in numerous cases, going beyond the foundational work of Hardy‚ÄìLittlewood‚ÄìWeyl, Burgess, and Duke‚ÄìFriedlander‚ÄìIwaniec that dealt with important special cases. This approach eventually resulted in the complete resolution by Venkatesh and Philippe Michel of the sub-convexity problem for GL(1) and GL(2) L-functions over general number fields.

Researchers have shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behavior that applies knowledge to new situations, communicating needs and desires within a social group and responding to training cues.  The brain  = Brain size = The brain of the domesticated cat is about long, and weighs . If a typical cat is taken to be long with a weight of , then the brain would be at 0.91% of its total body mass, compared to 2.33% of total body mass in the average human. Within the encephalization quotient proposed by Jerison in 1973, values above 1 are classified big brained, while values lower than 1 are small brained. The domestic cat is attributed a value of between 1‚Äì1.71; relative to human value, that is 7.44‚Äì7.8. The largest brains in the family Felidae are those of the tigers in Java and Bali. It is debated whether there exists a causal relationship between brain size and intelligence in vertebrates. Correlations have been shown between these factors in a number of experiments; however, correlation does not imply causation. Most experiments involving the relevance of brain size to intelligence hinge on the assumption that complex behavior requires a complex (and therefore intelligent) brain; however, this connection has not been consistently demonstrated. The surface area of a cat's cerebral cortex is approximately ; furthermore, a theoretical cat weighing has a cerebellum weighing , 0.17% of the total weight. = Brain structures = According to researchers at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, the physical structure of the brains of humans and cats is very similar. The human brain and the cat brain both have cerebral cortices with similar lobes. The number of cortical neurons contained in the brain of the cat is reported to be 763 million. Area 17 of the visual cortex was found to contain about 51,400 neurons per mm3. Area 17 is the primary visual cortex. Both human and feline brains are gyrencephalic, i.e. they have a surface folding. Analyses of cat brains have shown they are divided into many areas with specialized tasks that are vastly interconnected and share sensory information in a kind of hub- and-spoke network, with a large number of specialized hubs and many alternative paths between them. This exchange of sensory information allows the brain to construct a complex perception of the real world and to react to and manipulate its environment. The thalamus of the cat includes a hypothalamus, an epithalamus, a lateral geniculate nucleus, and additional secondary nuclear structures. = Secondary brain structures = The domestic cat brain also contains the hippocampus, amygdala, frontal lobes (which comprise 3 to 3.5% of the total brain in cats, compared to about 25% in humans), corpus callosum, anterior commissure, pineal gland, caudate nucleus, septal nuclei and midbrain. = Neuroplasticity = Grouse et al. (1979) ascertained the neuroplasticity of kittens' brains, with respect to control of visual stimulus correlated with changes in RNA structures. In a later study, it was found that cats possess visual-recognition memory, and have flexibility of cerebral encoding from visual information. = Brain and diet = A cognitive support diet for felines is a food that is formulated in order to improve mental processes like attention, short and long-term memory, learning, and problem solving. Claims for cognitive support appear on a number of kitten formulations to help with brain development, as well as diets aimed at seniors to help prevent cognitive disorders. These diets typically focus on supplying Omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids, taurine, vitamins, and other supporting supplements that have positive effects on cognition. The omega-3 fatty acids are a key nutrient in cognition for felines. They are essential for felines as they cannot be synthesized naturally and must be obtained from the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids that support brain development and function are alpha-linolenic acid, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Fish oils, fish and other marine sources provide a very rich source of DHA and EPA. Alpha-linolenic acid can be acquired from oils and seeds. Omega-6 fatty acids are also needed in feline cognition diets. The important omega-6 fatty acid that plays a role in brain support and cognition is arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid, or AA, is found in animal sources such as meat and eggs. AA is required in cat diets, as felines convert insignificant amounts of it from linoleic acid due to the limited enzyme delta-6 desaturase. Like DHA, arachidonic acid is often found in the brain tissues of cats and seems to have a supporting role in brain function. In a 2000 study completed by Contreras et al., it was found that DHA and AA made up 20% of the fatty acids in the mammalian brain. Arachidonic acid makes up high amounts in the membrane of most cells and has many pro-inflammatory actions. Taurine is an amino acid, which is essential in cat diets due to their low capacity to synthesize it. Taurine has the ability to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in the brain, it plays a role in many neurological functions, especially in the visual development. Without taurine, felines can have an abnormal morphology in the cerebellum and visual cortex. When cats were fed a diet deficient in taurine, this led to a decrease in the concentration of taurine in the retina of the eye. This resulted in deterioration of the photoreceptors, followed by complete blindness. Choline is a water-soluble nutrient that prevents and improves epilepsy and cognitive disorders. Supplementation is part of therapy for cats with seizures and feline cognitive dysfunction, despite this treatment being mostly based on anecdotal evidence and research done on dogs. It is the precursor to nerve chemicals like dopamine and acetylcholine, making it important for proper functioning of the nervous system.  Intelligence  A sleeping cat. Much like humans, cats experience complex dreams while sleeping, involving long sequences of events that can be retained and recalled. Intelligence through behavioural observation is defined as a composite of skills and abilities. The WAIS test is a measure of intelligence in adult Homo sapiens. The test scores on four criteria: verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, working memory and processing speed.Soto, Timothy. (2013) Processing Speed Index Encyclopedia of Autism Spectrum Disorders In a comparative evaluation from WAIS criteria, cats are generally fair in intelligence. In controlled experiments, cats showed that they had fully developed concepts of object permanence, meaning that sensorimotor intelligence is completely developed in cats. For human infants, tests involving multiple invisible displacements of an object are used to assess the beginning of mental representation in the sixth and last stage of sensorimotor intelligence. The cats' searches on these tasks were consistent with representation of an unsensed object and fully developed sensorimotor intelligence. The working memory for object permanence of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiments as being 16 hours. In 2009, an experiment was conducted where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen. When presented with one string, cats had no trouble getting the treats, but when presented with multiple strings, some of which were not connected to treats, the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings, leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do.B. Osthaus Cats have complex dreams while sleeping, retaining and recalling long sequences of events while they are asleep, as many other animals do. A dreaming cat will sometimes have rapid, uncontrolled facial, whisker, paw, and abdominal movements.  Memory  Taken as a whole, cats have excellent memories. In experimental conditions, the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an information-retention or recall of a duration totalling as much as 10 years. However, relationships with humans, individual differences in intelligence, and age may all affect memory. Cats easily adapt to their current environment because they can adapt their memories of past environments throughout their lives.Stock, Judith A. Pet Place. 1 January 2011. Web. 24 March 2011.Pawprints and Purrs. Cat Health. 11 October 2010. Web. 24 March 2011. = In kittens = The period during which the cat is a kitten is the time when the cat learns and memorizes survival skills, which are acquired through observation of their mothers and playing with other cats. Playing, in fact, constitutes more than fun for a kitten, for it is essential for ranking social order, building hunting skills, and generally exercising for the adult roles. The first two to seven weeks are a particularly critical time for kittens, for it is during this period that they bond with other cats. It has been suspected that without any human contact during this time, the cat would forever mistrust humans, or would at least take many times longer than with such early exposure before the mistrust might begin to erode. They also may not extend trust developed with a select group of familiar nonthreatening humans as readily to strangers. Many cats with exposure during this period as kittens still do not automatically trust strangers. = In older cats = Just as in humans, advancing age may affect memory in cats. Some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans. A slowing of function is normal, and this includes memory. Aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information. Cats lose brain cells as they age, just as humans do.Memory Loss With Aging. Family Doctor. 22 January 1996. Web. 24 March 2011. The older the cat, the more these changes can affect its memory. There have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats, but there is some speculation that, just like people, short- term memory is more affected by aging. In one test of where to find food, cats' short-term memory lasted about 16 hours. = Diseases = Diseases, such as feline cognitive dysfunction (FCD) ‚Äì a condition similar to Alzheimer's disease in humans ‚Äì could also affect cat memory. Symptoms of FCD include disorientation, reduced social interaction, sleep disturbances, and loss of house training. FCD causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment.  Learning capacities  Edward Thorndike conducted some key experiments on cats' learning capacity. In one of Thorndike's experiments, cats were placed in various boxes approximately with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it. The cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by \\"trial and error with accidental success.\\" Though cats did perform worse on occasion, Thorndike generally found that as cats continued the trials, the time taken to escape the boxes decreased in most cases. Thorndike considered the cat to follow the law of effect, which states that responses followed by satisfaction (i.e. a reward) become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future. Thorndike was generally skeptical of the presence of intelligence in cats, criticising sources of the contemporary writing of the sentience of animals as \\"partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of facts for investigation.\\" An experiment was done to identify possible observational learning in kittens. Kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a non-related adult cat, and sooner than the ones who, being placed in trial and error conditions, observed no other cat performing the act. Even though cats will occasionally reach up with a paw to put a person's hand on the exact spot where the cat wants to be scratched, or stretch up to indicate they want a door opened that they cannot reach or turn without opposable thumbs, behaviours they would likely have to learn through observation, social interaction, and accumulated experience even without being trained by humans specifically to perform these tasks, these behaviours have mainly been discussed anecdotally, and more studies would be needed before researchers can conclude how developed the cats' theory of mind may be. The term copycat comes from popular belief that cats, in an extension of their instinctual tendency to copy each others' stalking, pouncing, chasing, and wrestling to improve their hunting skills, will follow any sufficiently enticing movement by a familiar cat, human, or other accustomed nearby nonthreatening animal. Theory of mind may be helpful for them to be able to learn the potential evasive actions of different types of prey animals, without automatically engaging empathy for what they are about to kill.  Domestication effects  Cat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat. The process of domestication has allowed for closer observation of cat behaviour and in the increased incidence of interspecies communication,Boone 1956Fox 1980 and the inherent plasticity of the cat's brain has become apparent as the number of studies in this have increased scientific insight. Changes in the genetic structure of a number of cats have been identified as a consequence of both domestication practises and the activity of breeding, so that the species has undergone genetic evolutionary change due to human selection (although this human selection has been coupled with an initial naturally occurring selective set of cats possessing characteristics desirable for the sharing of human habitation and living in Neolithic urban environments). Cats' intelligence may have increased during their semi-domestication: urban living may have provided an enriched and stimulating environment requiring novel adaptive behaviours. This scavenging behaviour would only have produced slow changes in evolutionary terms, but such changes would have been comparable to the changes to the brain of early primitive hominids who co-existed with primitive cats (like, for example, Machairodontinae, Megantereon and Homotherium) and adapted to savannah conditions. Cat's urban living is, however, unlikely to indefinitely improve the animal's intelligence: consider the fossil-based family tree of placental mammals above; the feline line diverged many years previously from the primate line; the cat both feral and domesticated is likely to be maintained in an evolutionary stasis by its niche position in the food web.

The Seneca leader Red Jacket was said to have practiced his speeches at Shequaga Falls, located nearby in the present-day Town of Montour Falls.

Catherine's Town was destroyed by the Sullivan Expedition of 1779, one of more than 40 Iroquois villages decimated by the rebel colonial forces in retaliation for British- Iroquois raids in the eastern Mohawk Valley. At the time the town was reported to have 30 houses, fields of corn, and fruit orchards, all of which were burned, in addition to the people's winter stores of corn. Other names for the village during the colonial era were French Catherine Town, Catherine's Landing, Catherinestown, and Catharine Town, all after Montour. In the late 18th century, as new European-American settlers began to develop it, the village was known as Havana. It was later renamed as Montour Falls, New York.

The character debuted in Detective Comics #470 (February 1978) and was created by Steve Englehart and Walt Simonson. Silver St. Cloud is typically depicted as a romantic interest of Bruce Wayne. The character appeared on the second season of Gotham and was played by Natalie Alyn Lind. Publication history Created by Steve Englehart and Walt Simonson, Silver St. Cloud debuted in Detective Comics #470 (February 1978). The issues featuring her earlier appearances have been collected in trade paperback form as Batman: Strange Apparitions. Fictional character biography St. Cloud is a socialite residing in Gotham City, hosting parties for the rich and influential. She later becomes a successful event planner outside Gotham. =Detective Comics debut (Batman: Strange Apparitions)= Silver St. Cloud is Bruce Wayne's love interest in stories from Detective Comics #469‚Äì476, 478 and 479, later reprinted as a trade paperback collection of those stories titled Batman: Strange Apparitions. St. Cloud first meets Bruce Wayne following the Batman's defeat of new villain Doctor Phosphorus in a battle that occurred at a nuclear power plant on the ocean. She soon begins dating Bruce Wayne. She suspects from the start that Bruce is hiding something, citing his interest in crime reports and his encounters with Batman as evidence of a secret. When Bruce Wayne is captured and replaced by Hugo Strange in a prosthetic disguise, Silver quickly notices Wayne is not acting like himself and contacts Dick Grayson (Robin) to tell him about Wayne's strange behavior. Her insight and quick action leads to Robin rescuing Bruce. Silver is one of the few characters to have discovered Batman's secret identity. Her relationship with Bruce was initially in trouble due to his repeated disappearances. However, over time she was able to piece together the clues and eventually recognize her lover in the Batman costume. Silver confirms her suspicions by calling out to Bruce while he battled the villain Deadshot, causing him to turn and allowing Silver to recognize Batman's chin as the chin of Bruce Wayne. The initial appearances of Silver also represent the first time that it is explicitly recognized that Bruce Wayne or even Batman has engaged in a sexual relationship. Silver witnesses Batman fighting the Joker. After defeating the Joker, Batman meets with Silver. She reveals to Batman that she knows his secret and that she still loves him. She says that she could not be with him because she could not stand worrying about him each night. She then ends the relationship, asking him not to see her again. Silver's breakup with Bruce has repercussions in the following issues, where Batman takes out his frustration over the failed relationship on a couple of criminals. Most of his fury becomes concentrated on one criminal, whom he punches repeatedly. Bruce tells Alfred Pennyworth that he blames his crimefighting persona for driving Silver away, and for a time muses whether he should give up being Batman forever. =Siege= In the Legends of the Dark Knight story arc \\"Siege\\" (plotted by Archie Goodwin), St. Cloud briefly returns to Bruce Wayne's life while organizing a mercenaries' convention in Gotham, but is severely injured by the convention's leader when she discovers a plot to assault the city. =Batman: Dark Detective= Silver returns once again in Steve Englehart's story arc Batman: Dark Detective, a sequel to Batman: Strange Apparitions. In this series, her relationship with Bruce Wayne evolves further, to the point that Silver prepares to leave her fianc√©, a campaigning senator, to be with him. However, her fianc√©'s arm and leg are cut off in the Joker's booby traps while he attempts to find her in the Joker's house.

The various grades are defined by the United States Department of Agriculture, and assessments are based primarily on the fatness of the cow to be culled. Cows are culled from herds for a variety of reasons, including poor production, age, or health problems. A carcass grade (or expected carcass grade) is used to determine selling prices for cull cows, which are estimated to comprise 20% of the beef available to consumers in the United States. Grades are determined based on an animal's fat content and body condition. The most common grades, from best to worst, are \\"breakers\\" (fleshy, body condition 7 or above), \\"boners\\" (body condition 5 to 7), \\"lean\\", and \\"light\\" (thin, body condition 1 to 4).

Ratified by the Australia Capital Territory (ACT) Legislative Assembly on the 1 July 2004, it was the among first of its kind to define and enshrine human rights into Australian law by establishing civil, political, economic, social and culture rights. The unprecedented legislation followed the proposal extended by ACT Bill of Rights Consultative Committee. This proposal embodied a community wide deliberation, designed to assess public sentiment toward Human Rights within the ACT. Consequently, this dialog would go on to highlight the popularity of an ACT Charter of Human Rights among the populous. While this piece of legislation established newly held Human Rights, the act itself does not inhibit already established rights and freedoms . The Act explicitly outlines within section 7, \\"Rights apart from act\\", that rights established within the document are not exhaustive. Additionally, this legislation draws distinct limitations, exclaiming that the Human Rights outlined, are accountable to \\"reasonable limits\\" enacted by law, such that, they are \\"demonstrably justified\\" throughout civilisation. Additionally, the Act established an Australian Capital Territory Human Rights Commissioner while also empowering the ACT Supreme Court to facilitate compliance of legislation. Sections of the Human Rights Act 2004 (The full text of the Act is available online.) This section outlines the significant segments of the Human Rights Act 2004 that grant Australian rights within the A.C.T. This will include Part 2 - Human Rights, Part - 3 Civil and Political Rights, and Part - 3A Economic, Social and Culture Rights. Part 1- Preliminary is not included in the following summary because it does not contribute to the establishment of Human Rights in the A.C.T. Part 2 ‚Äì Human Rights: What are human rights ? The 2004 Act establishes human rights by connecting civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Part 2 ‚Äì Human Rights: Who has human rights? The Human Rights Act maintains only individuals can possess human rights. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Recognition and equality before the law The Human Rights Act solidifies recognition and equality before the law through three pillars. Firstly, the Act enshrines the right of the individual to be recognised before the law as a person. Secondly, every individual retains the right, detached from prejudice or difference, to enjoy their Human Rights. To conclude, all individuals are warranted an equitable defence before the law and individuals shall be treated as equals before the law, without prejudice. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Right to life This title sets out the individual's ‚Äò‚Äôright to life‚Äô‚Äô; it states ‚Äò‚Äôno-one may be arbitrarily deprived of life‚Äô‚Äô. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Protection from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading way The following section prohibits torture of individuals, medical or scientific experimentation in the absence of freely obtain permission from the individual and the punishment and/or treatment of an individual in a ‚Äò‚Äôcruel, inhuman, or degrading‚Äô‚Äô manner. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Protection of the family and children The Human Rights Act upholds the protection of family and children by establishing two focal points. Firstly, the Act maintains that family should be afforded protection within the community because it‚Äôs the ‚Äò‚Äônatural and basic group unit of society‚Äô‚Äô. Secondly, all children maintain the right to safety, unaccompanied by differentiation or prejudice. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief Section 14 supports an individual‚Äôs right to freedom of ‚Äò‚Äôthought, conscience and religion‚Äô‚Äô by outlining two subsections. Firstly, the right to arrogate a religion or faith of ones choosing. What‚Äôs more, the ability to express religion or faith by ‚Äò‚Äôworship, observance, practice and teaching‚Äô‚Äô is instilled. This definition extends publicly or privately on an individual or collective basis. Secondly, no individual can be pressurised into narrowing their freedom to maintain or express their faith through ‚Äò‚Äôworship, observance, practice or teaching‚Äô‚Äô. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Freedom of expression This title facilitates the right to express oneself irrespective of boarders, media, art, or action. Additionally, the individual's right to an opinion in the absence of intercession is outlined. Part 3 ‚Äì Civil and political Rights: Retrospective criminal laws This section mandates that no individual can be found guilty of transgression, if such a transgression was not enshrined as an offence in law when undertaken. Additionally, harsher punishment cannot be appointed retrospectively. That is, criminal offences cannot exact punitive retribution greater than the damages that would be awarded at the time of the offence. Part 3 ‚Äì Children in the Criminal Process There are four pillars to children in the criminal process. Firstly, incriminated persons should be segregated from all implicated children. Secondly, the handling of the child must be congruent to a non- implicated child of the similar age. Thirdly, a trial must be produced in timely fashion. To concluded, should a child be convicted, the behaviour toward this child must be conducted analogously to a non-implicated child of similar age. Part 3A ‚Äì Economic, social and Culture Rights: Right to an education The following section details the three core components of the right to education. Firstly, all children will have access to a suitable education based on the needs of the child for free. Secondly, vocational, continuing training, and further education are the right of all Australians. Thirdly, the previously described rights are subject to actualisation without discrimination and compliance with a parent or guardians religious and/or moral obligations, so long as, these convictions adhere to the minimal standards enacted by law. Case Law The Human Rights Act of 2004 has provided the basis for numerous judicial rulings within the Australian court system. The following section outlines courts cases where the Human Rights Act of 2004 influenced judicial rulings. Imran Hakimi v Legal Aid Commission (A.C.T) The ACT Law Courts building housing the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. Hakimi sought Romano's representation in a criminal defence matter. Hakimi did not possess the necessary resources required for his defence. As such, Hakimi applied for legal aid and it was granted, however, in place of monetary assistance, the Legal Aid Commission (A.C.T) approved the services of a lawyer. Mr. Hakimi found this disagreeable, he wanted to obtain the services of Mr. Romano. Consequently, Romano argued that the Human Rights Act of 2004 granted Hakimi the power to contract his services and the that Legal Aid Commission (A.C.T) was solely responsible for the remuneration of those services under the Human Right Act 2004 section 22. Accordingly, the Legal Aid Commission (A.C.T) claimed, that Romano's interpretation of section 22 was not the intention of the provision and that there were reasonable limitations on this provision. In conclusion, Justice Refshauge of the Supreme Court found that \\"common sense and international jurisprudence\\" dictated the Human Rights Act does not pronounce an unconditional right to be represented by a lawyer of the accused's choosing, citing R v Williams 2006. As a result, Mr Hakimi's application was unsuccessful. R v Kalachoff Kalachoff was facing trail for the offence of \\"recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm\\". For this trial, Kalachoff applied to the Legal Aid Commission (A.C.T) in order to acquire renumeration for the presiding counsel. In response, the Legal Aid Office (A.C.T) refused to provide the required funding. As such, Kalachoff's presiding counsel argued that under the Human Rights Act 2004, Kalachoff's right to a fair trial had been violated. Justice Burns of the Supreme Court found this argument to be \\"misguided\\". Justice Burns pointed out, that the Human Rights Act grants individual legal assistance before the law and should justice depend upon it, this assistance will be appointed at no cost. In making these points Justice Burns explained, that these rights should not be conflated into a compelled \\"hybrid guarantee\\" of funding for a defendant's chosen legal defence. The Justice maintains, that such a position violates the Legal Aid Act 1977 (A.C.T). This resulted in the rejection of Kalachoff's appeal. Dennis Michael Nova V The Queen (2012) The case of Dennis Michael Nova v The Queen (2012) was heard in the Supreme Court by Justice Richard Refshauge who evaluated the halt in legal proceedings pertaining to Nova's charges being brought to trial. The decision of the court utilised common law and the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) to reach a verdict. With respect to common law, Justice Refshauge acknowledged the \\"appalling delay\\" in the proceedings, however, the Justice was unconvinced Nova would experience prejudice relating to matters of fair trial. Additionally, Justice Refshauge pointed out the delay was not the result of \\"inaction on the part of authorities\\". As such, Justice Refshauge remained dissatisfied with the idea that the defendant's trial would be tainted by prejudice. In addressing common law, Justice Refshauge moved to examine the parameters under the Human Rights Act 2004. The court investigated the basis for a stay under section 22 ‚Äì Rights in Criminal Proceedings. Section 22 outlines that an individual \\"charged with a criminal offence\\" holds the right to a trail unencumbered by excessive postponement. Justice Refshauge explained that a delay in proceedings does not itself constituted a violation of the Act. Nonetheless, given the three year and four-month delay in bringing this matter to trail, Justice Refshauge concluded that the defendant's rights were violated, citing section 22 of Human Rights Act. In Justice Refshauge's ruling, this breach was acknowledged on the record. Criticisms and Approbation The Human Rights Act of 2004 was at the forefront of establishing Human Rights in Australia. Being the first of its kind, the Act's efficacy and scope are debated by legal scholars. This section outlines criticism and approbation of Act. Jon Stanhope who served on council for A.C.T civil liberties as the president points out, that the Human Rights Act is ‚Äò‚Äôone of the most important pieces of legislation‚Äô‚Äô passed in Australia. Nevertheless, Stanhope acknowledges that ‚Äò‚Äôthe act is not an end in itself‚Äô‚Äô but will be used to encourage norms and customs that respect Human Rights. Congruent with the former, Helen Watchirs the president of the A.C.T Human Right Commission and Gabrielle McKinnon a director on the Australian National University research project into Human Rights Act levy heavy criticism. Watchirs and McKinnon describe the moderate influence of the Human Rights Act within the judicial system. The duo comment, that a ‚Äò‚Äôgreat many cases‚Äô‚Äô have been adjudicated without careful analysis and scrutiny of raised provisions pertaining to the Human Rights Act. Conversely, Micheal Walton a senior lecture of Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy school stated, that this piece of legislation provides an honest accounting of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Notwithstanding, Walton takes issue with specific sections of the Act. For example, when an individual‚Äôs rights have been violated, under this act, there is no path to renumeration through litigation. Additionally, George Williams a Scientia Professor at the University of New South Wales and Lara Kostakidis-Lianos a member of the University of New South Wales law journal wrote about the connection between the Human Rights Act and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The pair comment that the Act‚Äôs biggest advantage is the board spectrum of knowledge available. By utilising this knowledge to iteratively refine itself, this legislation may be Australia‚Äôs greatest tool to protect rights and responsibilities despite concerns of opaque terminology. Jim McGinty a retired Attorney-General of Western Australia continues by describing the legislation as ‚Äò‚Äôground- breaking‚Äô‚Äô and providing an ‚Äò‚Äôexpress list‚Äô‚Äô of civil and political protections. McGinty comments, that unlike previous protections, the Human Rights Act establishes a connection between the individual and the government; without this partnership, the rights enshrined in the Act may become brittle, similar to analogous protections afforded within other legislative accounts. Amendments: Humans Rights Amendment Act 2008 (The full text of the Act is available online.) The Human Rights Amendment Act 2008 clarified various areas of confusion in Human Rights Act of 2004. Enshrined by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the following amendments came into effect on the 4th of March 2008. Interpretation of law and human rights This section sought to elucidate the interpretation of Territory law. Dictating that when congruous to a legislations‚Äô aim, interpretation must be consistent with Human Rights (Austlii, 2008). Notice to Attorney-General and Commission The following amendment specifies who the Supreme Court should communicate with, in the event, a case is heard that relates to an individual exercising a Human Right. It is made explicit, that both the Attorney-General and the Human Rights Commissioner should be notified.

It is part of the Cincinnati Public School District. It was founded as one of the first public schools in the United States in 1831. History =Old Woodward Building = Front of the old building Woodward was one of the first public schools in the country. The land for the original school was donated by William Woodward and his wife Abigail Cutter in 1826 to provide free education for poor children who could not afford private schooling. Their remains are buried on school grounds in the Over-the-Rhine area of Cincinnati (and it is a fixture of student lore that Abigail's ghost haunts the building). The Woodward Free Grammar School opened on the site in 1831 and was the first free public school in the city. The original two-story school building was replaced in 1855. On the day after his election, President Elect William Howard Taft, who graduated from Woodward High School in 1874, laid the cornerstone of a third building, which opened to students in 1910 (). The site is also linked to the Underground Railroad. William Woodward built a home on the site in 1832, where Levi Coffin and his wife, Catharine, lived from 1856 to 1863. Coffin (known as \\"The President of the Underground Railroad\\"), sheltered over one hundred fugitive slaves each year on their way to freedom in Canada. The home was first occupied by Henry Rucher, an early principal and math teacher at the Woodward school, and it was commonly known as the Rucher House. It later served as the Good Samaritan Hospital (still in operation at its later Clifton Heights location). In 1865 it became St. Luke's Hospital, where disabled Civil War soldiers were treated. It was replaced by residential homes in 1874, which were demolished to clear ground for the new Woodward school building in 1907. The brick, stone, and terra cotta building, designed by Gustav Drach, had some of the most modern facilities of its day, including flush toilets, central heating, and two swimming pools. It is notable for its many Rookwood Pottery drinking fountains and tile fixtures, many of them gifts from student clubs and graduating classes in the early 1900s. Also notable are the stained glass windows of the same period in the main entryway, the largest of which is a memorial mural of \\"The Landing of William Woodward at Cincinnati in Fall of 1791\\", which was part of the 1855 construction and was preserved after that building was destroyed. The current five-story building has 150 rooms and of space, a third of which is unusable (including the swimming pools on the top floor). The building is listed in the Over-the-Rhine (South) Local Historic District and the Over-the-Rhine National Register Historic District. =Bond Hill= In 1953 Woodward High School moved to a new location in Bond Hill, and the older building was designated Abigail Cutter Junior High School until the School for Creative and Performing Arts took over the entire facility in 1977. Woodward High School has since moved four times, in addition to opening a secondary campus near its current location on Reading Road. Woodward High School won the Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships for baseball in 1931 and 1945 and for basketball in 1988. In August 2006, the City of Cincinnati opened Woodward Career Technical High School, which features a mixture of college-preparatory and vocational education. With the new addition, the original campus was now called Woodward Traditional High School. In June 2011, demolition of the \\"Woodward Traditional High School\\" building was begun and the original 1953 Woodward High School building has now been completely demolished. A synthetic turf football field, baseball field, and fieldhouse will be built in place on the 1953 building.

Premiering on September 14, 1968, this 60-minute program featured new adventures of the DC Comics superheroes Batman, Robin and Batgirl alongside shorts from The New Adventures of Superman and The Adventures of Superboy. Series overview This series marked the animation debut of Batman, his supporting cast and some of their classic enemies like Joker, Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman, Mr. Freeze, Scarecrow, Mad Hatter, and some villains exclusive to the series. The success of The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure in 1967 had prompted Filmation to produce a Metamorpho pilot and begin development on other similar series. These plans were cancelled when CBS secured the animation rights to Batman in the wake of ABC's recent success with the Batman live action television series. Going into production close to the start of the 1968 TV season, what would become The Batman/Superman Hour required Filmation to pull as many additional animators from other projects as they could spare to ramp up production. This series was the first time Olan Soule and Casey Kasem performed as the voices of Batman and Robin. When The New Adventures of Batman was produced in 1977, Adam West and Burt Ward reprised the roles they had originally played in the live action TV series. Soule and Kasem would return several times to reprise their roles in 1972's The New Scooby-Doo Movies, 1973's Super Friends, 1977's The All-New Super Friends Hour, 1978's Challenge of the Super Friends, 1979's The World's Greatest Super Friends, and starting in 1980 Soule voiced the character in the 7 minute shorter episodes that were produced through 1983. These 1980‚Äì1983 episodes aired under the generic Super Friends title. Kasem would go on to voice Robin with Adam West as Batman in 1984's Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and 1985's The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. In 1969, the series was repackaged into 30-minute episodes without the Superman segments and renamed Batman with Robin the Boy Wonder. Batman would next appear in The New Adventures of Batman in 1977. In 1985, Warner Home Video released five selected episodes of the series on VHS as part of the \\"Super Powers\\" video collection. These videos were re-released in 1996 and are out of print. In 1996, episodes were included in The Superman/Batman Adventures on the USA Network. They later aired on the Cartoon Network and Boomerang. Episodes The Superman portion of the program consisted of new 6-minute shorts from Filmation's The New Adventures of Superman and The Adventures of Superboy. The Batman half of The Batman/Superman Hour consisted of new shorts. One story was presented in two 6 minute segments and one story in a single 6 minute segment. Thirty-four stories were produced.

Its structure and form are a typical example of the Shakespearean sonnet. The poet begins by stating he should not stand in the way of \\"the marriage of true minds\\", and that love cannot be true if it changes for any reason; true love should be constant, through any difficulties. In the seventh line, the poet makes a nautical reference, alluding to love being much like the north star is to sailors. Love also should not fade with time; instead, true love is, as is the polar star, \\"ever-fixed\\" and lasts forever. > The movement of 116, like its tone, is careful, controlled, laborious‚Ä¶it > defines and redefines its subject in each quatrain, and this subject becomes > increasingly vulnerable. It starts out as motionless and distant, remote, independent; then it moves to be \\"less remote, more tangible and earthbound\\"; the final couplet brings a sense of \\"coming back down to earth\\". Ideal love is deteriorating throughout the sonnet and continues to do so through the couplet. Structure Sonnet 116 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet. The English sonnet has three quatrains, followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form abab cdcd efef gg and is composed in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The 10th line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / Within his bending sickle's compass come; (116.10) This sonnet contains examples of all three metrical variations typically found in literary iambic pentameter of the period. Lines 6 and 8 feature a final extrametrical syllable or feminine ending: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó /(√ó) That looks on tempests and is never shaken; (116.6) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus. (√ó) = extrametrical syllable. Line 2 exhibits a mid-line reversal: √ó / √ó / √ó / / √ó √ó / Admit impediments. Love is not love (116.2) A mid-line reversal can also be found in line 12, while lines 7, 9, and 11 all have potential initial reversals. Finally, line 11 also features a rightward movement of the third ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, \`√ó √ó / /\`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic): / √ó √ó / √ó √ó / / √ó / Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, (116.11) The meter demands that line 12's \\"even\\" function as one syllable. Analysis =Overview= Sonnet 116 is one of Shakespeare's most famous love sonnets, but some scholars have argued the theme has been misunderstood. Hilton Landry believes the appreciation of 116 as a celebration of true love is mistaken, in part because its context in the sequence of adjacent sonnets is not properly considered. Landry acknowledges the sonnet \\"has the grandeur of generality or a 'universal significance',\\" but cautions that \\"however timeless and universal its implications may be, we must never forget that Sonnet 116 has a restricted or particular range of meaning simply because it does not stand alone.\\" Carol Thomas Neely writes that, \\"Sonnet 116 is part of a sequence which is separate from all the other sonnets of Shakespeare because of their sense of detachment. They aren't about the action of love and the object of that love is removed in this sequence which consists of Sonnets 94, 116, and 129\\". This group of three sonnets does not fit the mold of the rest of Shakespeare's sonnets, therefore, and they defy the typical concept and give a different perspective of what love is and how it is portrayed or experienced. \\"Though 116 resolves no issues, the poet in this part of the sequence acknowledges and accepts the fallibility of his love more fully than he could acknowledge that of the young man's earlier\\". Other critics of Sonnet 116 have argued that one cannot rely on the context of the sonnet to understand its tone. They argue that since \\"there is no indisputably authoritative sequence to them, we cannot make use of context as positive evidence for one kind of tone or another.\\" Shakespeare does not attempt to come to any significant conclusion within this particular sonnet because no resolution is needed. =Quatrain 1= The sonnet begins without the poet's apparent acknowledgment of the compelling quality of the emotional union of \\"true minds\\". As Helen Vendler has observed, \\"This famous almost 'impersonal' sonnet on the marriage of true minds has usually been read as a definition of true love.\\" This is not a unique theme of Shakespeare's sonnets. Carol Neely observes that \\"Like [sonnet] 94, it defines and redefines its subject in each quatrain and this subject becomes increasingly concrete, attractive and vulnerable.\\" Shakespeare tends to use negation to define love according to Lukas Erne, \\"The first and the third [quatrains], it is true, define love negatively: 'love is not...'; Love's not...'. The two quatrains are further tied together by the reappearance of the verbs 'to bend' and 'to alter'.\\" Love is defined in vague terms in the first quatrain. \\"The stress on the dialectical definition of what love is not accentuates the dogmatic character of this sonnet with which Shakespeare suggests in verse to his interlocutors what true love is: true love is like a marriage sealed before a higher entity (God or His creation), which testifies to its duration, intensity, stability and resistance. A Love of this type watches over the unstable and peregrine life of men at the mercy of their inner dismay and the real world's tempests\\" (E. Passannanti). Garry Murphy observes that the meaning shifts with the distribution of emphasis. He suggests that in the first line the stress should properly be on \\"me\\": \\"Let ME not to the marriage of true minds...\\"; the sonnet then becomes \\"not just a gentle metaphoric definition but an agitated protest born out of fear of loss and merely conveyed by means of definition.\\" C.R. B. Combellack disputes the emphasis placed on the \\"ME\\" due to the \\"absence from the sonnet of another person to stand in contrast. No one else is addressed, described, named, or mentioned.\\" Murphy also claims that \\"The unstopped first and second lines suggest urgency in speech, not leisurely meditation.\\" He writes that the short words when delivered would have the effect of \\"rapid delivery\\" rather than \\"slow rumination\\". Combellack questions this analysis by asking whether \\"urgency is not more likely to be expressed in short bursts of speech?\\" He argues that the words in the sonnet are not intended to be read quickly and that this is simply Murphy's subjective opinion of the quatrain. Murphy believes the best support of the \\"sonnet itself being an exclamation\\" comes from the \\"O no\\" which he writes a person would not say without some agitation. Combellack responds that \\"O no\\" could be used rather calmly in a statement such as \\"O no, thank you, but my coffee limit is two cups.\\" If anything, Combellack suggests, the use of the \\"O\\" softens the statement and it would require the use of different grammar to suggest that the sonnet should be understood as rapid speech. The poetic language leaves the sort of love described somewhat indeterminate; \\"The 'marriage of true minds' like the 'power to hurt' is troublesomely vague open to a variety of interpretations.\\" Interpretations include the potential for religious imagery and the love being for God, \\"Lines one and two echo the Anglican marriage service from the Book of Common Prayer.\\" The concept of the marriage of true minds is thought to be a highly Christian; according to Erne, \\"The mental picture thus called up in our minds of the bride and bridegroom standing up front in a church is even reinforced by the insistence on the word alter/altar in the following line.\\" =Quatrain 2= The second quatrain explains how love is unchanging according to Neely, \\"Love is a star, remote, immovable, self-contained, and perhaps, like the 'lords and owners of their faces,' improbably and even somewhat unpleasantly cold and distant.\\" The second quatrain continues Shakespeare's attempt to define love, but in a more direct way. Shakespeare mentions \\"it\\" in the second quatrain according to Douglas Trevor, \\"The constancy of love in sonnet 116, the \\"it\\" of line five of the poem, is also ‚Äì for the poet ‚Äì the poetry, the object of love itself.\\" Not only is there a direct address to love itself, the style Shakespeare's contemplation becomes more direct. Erne states, \\"Lines five to eight stand in contrast to their adjacent quatrains, and they have their special importance by saying what love is rather than what it is not.\\" This represents a change in Shakespeare's view that love is completely undefinable. This concept of unchanging love is focused in the statement, \\"'[love] is an ever-fixed mark'. This has generally been understood as a sea mark or a beacon.\\" The image of a ever-fixed mark is elusive, though, and can suggest also a \\"symbol\\" whose meaning is well established in the esoteric tradition and Christian iconography. The symbol is in fact an ever- fixed mark that is unbent by climatic changes such as a transient tempest. The ever-fixed mark, from the point of view of this kind of theological reading, cannot symbolize a beacon given that a beacon is subject to erosion and is therefore not eternal. The image of the tempest is allegorically a circumstance and condition, and represents the human life struggling before the fixity of the symbol.(E. Passannanti, 2000) During the Reformation there was dispute about Catholic doctrines, \\"One of the points of disagreement was precisely that the Reformers rejected the existence of an ever-fixed, or in theological idiom, 'idelible' mark which three of the sacraments, according to Catholic teaching, imprint on the soul.\\" This interpretation makes God the focus of the sonnet as opposed to the typical concept of love. The compass is also considered an important symbol in the first part of the poem. John Doebler identifies a compass as a symbol that drives the poem, \\"The first quatrain of this sonnet makes implied use of the compass emblem, a commonplace symbol for constancy during the period in which Shakespeare's sonnets were composed.\\" Doebler identifies certain images in the poem with a compass, \\"In the Renaissance the compass is usually associated with the making of a circle, the ancient symbol of eternity, but in sonnet 116 the emphasis is more upon the contrasting symbolism of the legs of the compass.\\" The two feet of the compass represent the differences between permanent aspects of love and temporary ones. These differences are explained as, \\"The physical lovers are caught in a changing world of time, but they are stabilized by spiritual love, which exists in a constant world of eternal ideals.\\" The sonnet uses imagery like this to create a clearer concept of love in the speaker's mind. =Quatrain 3= In the third quatrain, \\"The remover who bends turns out to be the grim reaper, Time, with his bending sickle. What alters are Time's brief hours and weeks‚Ä¶\\" and \\"Only the Day of Judgment (invoked from the sacramental liturgy of marriage) is the proper measure of love's time\\". The young man holds the value of beauty over that of love. When he comes to face the fact that the love he felt has changed and become less intense and, in fact, less felt, he changes his mind about this person he'd loved before because what he had felt in his heart wasn't true. That the object of his affection's beauty fell to \\"Time's Sickle\\" would not make his feelings change. This fact is supported by Helen Vendler as she wrote, \\"The second refutational passage, in the third quatrain, proposes indirectly a valuable alternative law, one approved by the poet-speaker, which we may label \\"the law of inverse constancy\\": the more inconstant are time's alterations (one an hour, one a week), the more constant is love's endurance, even to the edge of doom\\". Vendler believes that if the love the young man felt was real it would still be there after the beauty of that love's object had long faded away, but he \\"has announced the waning of his own attachment to the speaker, dissolving the \\"marriage of true minds\\"\\" Shakespeare is arguing that if love is true it will stand against all tests of time and adversity, no manner of insignificant details such as the person's beauty fading could alter or dissolve \\"the marriage of true minds\\". =Couplet= The couplet of Sonnet 116 Shakespeare went about explaining in the inverse. He says the opposite of what it would be natural to say about love. For instance, instead of writing something to the effect of 'I have written and men have loved', according to Nelson, Shakespeare chose to write, \\"I never writ, nor no man ever loved.\\" Nelson argues that \\"The existence of the poem itself gives good evidence that the poet has written. It is harder to see, however, how the mere existence of the poem could show that men have loved. In part, whether men have loved depends upon just what love is‚Ä¶Since the poem is concerned with the nature of love, there is a sense in which what the poem says about love, if true, in part determines whether or not men have loved.\\" Nelson quotes Ingram and Redpath who are in agreement with his statement when they paraphrase the couplet in an extended form: \\"If this is a judgment (or a heresy), and this can be proved against me, and by citing my own case in evidence, then I've never written anything, and no man's love has ever been real love.\\"\\" Vendler states \\"Therefore, if he himself is in error on the subject of what true love is, then no man has ever loved; certainly the young man (it is implied) has not loved, if he has not loved after the steady fashion urged by the speaker, without alteration, removals, or impediments\\". By restating his authority as poet and moral watch almost in a sacramental manner on the theme of love, by the use of a paradox, Shakespeare rejects that he may be wrong in stating that true love is immortal: the fact that he has indeed written a lot to the point of having reached sonnet 116 on the theme of love and acquired fame for that is self evident that the opposite cannot be true, that is: what he says cannot be an error (E. Passannanti). Men too have indeed loved as love is ingrained in poetry and only lyric poets can testify men's faculty of experiencing true love (E. Passannanti). Each of these critics agree in the essence of the Sonnet and its portrayal of what love really is and what it can withstand, for example, the test of time and the fading of physical attraction of the object of our love. The couplet is, therefore, that men have indeed loved both in true and honest affection (this being the most important part of the argument) as well as falsely in the illusions of beauty before just as Shakespeare has written before this sonnet.

Military Service  Niskayuna High School has a strong tradition of graduates who enter military service. Over 300 graduates have served in the various branches of the military, including 27 who attended the Naval Academy, West Point, or the Air Force Academy. Each year, the high school recognizes all of the graduates who entered military service on both Veterans' Day and Memorial Day. This includes 21 veterans from World War II and Korea who received Niskayuna High School Diplomas as part of \\"Operation Recognition\\". A television monitor is permanently housed in the school which continuously displays the names of all graduates and their branch of service throughout each school day. Each year on the Friday before Memorial Day, the high school holds a special ceremony for its 3 graduates who were killed in action during the Vietnam War: Robert Cragin ‚Äì Class of 1962 Born: June 21, 1944 Died: February 26, 1968 Killed in action in Gian Dinh, South Vietnam; Name is listed on Panel 41 E ‚Äì Row 36 of the Vietnam Memorial; Inducted into the Niskayuna High School Hall of Fame in 1990 Vernon Hovey ‚Äì Class of 1964 Born: June 16, 1946 Died: June 5, 1970 1st Lieutenant of the 101 Airborne, US Army Shot Down over Thua Thien, South Vietnam; Name is listed on Panel 9 W ‚Äì Row 14 of the Vietnam Memorial; Inducted into the Niskayuna High School Hall of Fame in 1990 Richard Starkey ‚Äì Class of 1965 Born: August 31, 1947 Died: September 17, 1969 Private 1st Class, United States Marine Corps 3rd Marine Regiment, Lima Company Died in ground combat in Quang Tri, South Vietnam; Name is list on Panel 18 W ‚Äì Row 106 of the Vietnam Memorial; Inducted into the Niskayuna High School Hall of Fame in 1990  Making National News  2019 - Gabriella Pizzolo (Class of 2021) plays Suzie on the hit Netflix Series Stranger Things 2016 ‚Äì Noah Chaskin (Class of 2016) is featured in Sports Illustrated 2016 ‚Äì Dominic Fallacaro (Class of 2004) wins a Grammy Award 2015 ‚Äì Garrett Whitley (Class of 2015) is drafted in the 1st Round of the Major League Baseball Draft 2015 ‚Äì Dr. John F.

Depending upon its chambering, it fired a 5.56 (0.223\\"), 5.7 mm or 6 mm projectile at muzzle velocities of up to 930 metres per second (3,051 feet per second). The rifle was first exported to the United States in 1993, but was not a commercial success. Design Caseless ammunition has been a popular military rifle concept since the end of World War II, but has never met with public approval due to its sole source nature (and it cannot be handloaded at home). The main benefits of caseless ammunition to the military are that ammunition can be made lighter, enabling soldiers to carry several hundred rounds, and the fact that case extraction is not required allows a faster automatic rate of fire, both of which are immaterial to the needs of the typical civilian shooter or hunter, who rarely wants to carry hundreds of rounds of ammunition, or is allowed to own an automatic firearm. Voere attempted to introduce caseless ammunition to civilian shooters in 1991 with the VEC-91. When chambered for 5.7 mm the rifle used a 5-round magazine, and it used a 4-round magazine when chambered in 6 mm. Two 15-volt dry cell batteries, located in the pistol grip, allowed it to fire approximately 5,000 rounds before the batteries needed to be replaced. The bolt contained no firing pin or striker, just a ceramic cap that would electronically detonate the primer via the battery charge. The cartridge was designed by Hubert Usel and is known as the Usel Caseless Cartridge (UCC). The round was encased in a block of solid nitrocellulose and because it was not an automatic rifle it did not have the problems with cooking-off that plagued earlier military attempts such as the Heckler & Koch G11, in which the built up heat of sustained fire caused rounds to detonate immediately upon entering the chamber, releasing more heat, and often resulting in an uncontrollable burst of automatic fire until the magazine was emptied (although this is a risk in normal metallic cartridge firearms as well). The VEC-91 was capable of great accuracy due to several factors inherent to the design, and several factors due to its implementation. First, the trigger activated a button, requiring little pressure. Second, the electronic ignition meant that there was no latency due to lock time, the firing sequence was almost instantaneous. With respect to the implementation, the rifle came with a 20\\" match grade premium barrel. Lastly, all ammunition came from one source, with the result that all rounds were identical within manufacturing tolerances. Voere built the rifle with a walnut stock in the Monte-Carlo design with a high cheek rest, schnabel forend, checkered grip and sling swivels intended for the hunting market. The trigger was adjustable from 0.5 oz to 5 lbs. The barrel was 20\\" in length and the rifle 39\\" overall. The proprietary nature of the rifle's caseless ammunition and supply chain problems prevented it from being successful in the United States, but Voere still produces the rifle for the European market, as of 2007.

Folkloristic morphology, then, is the study of the structure of folklore and fairy tales. Some pioneering work in this field was begun in the nineteenth century, such as Marian Roalfe Cox's work on Cinderella, Cinderella: Three Hundred and Forty-Five Variants of Cinderella, Catskin and, Cap O' Rushes, Abstracted and Tabulated with a Discussion of Medieval Analogues and Notes.\\"If The Shoe Fits: Folklorists' criteria for #510\\" However, folkloristic morphology took on much more form in the twentieth century, driven by the work of two researchers and theorists: Russian scholar Vladimir Propp and Finnish folklorist Antti Aarne. Antti Aarne's theories, enlarged and expanded by American folklorist Stith Thompson in 1961 and by Hans-J√∂rg Uther in 2004, look at motifs rather than actions - for example, \\"a soldier makes a deal with the devil\\" or \\"a soldier marries the youngest of three sisters\\". More than 2500 folk and fairy tales have been cataloged under this taxonomy; the AaTh or Aarne‚ÄìThompson number is as well-known to folklorists as Francis James Child's identification of ballads are to scholars of folk songs. Vladimir Propp was a Russian formalist scholar. He criticized Aarne's work for ignoring what motifs did in a tale, and analysed the basic plot, or action, components of Russian folk tales to identify their simplest irreducible narrative elements. His Morphology of the Folk Tale was published in Russian in 1928 and influenced Claude L√©vi-Strauss and Roland Barthes, though it received little attention from Western scholars until it was translated into English in the 1950s. In the Afanasyev's collection of Russian fairy tales, Propp found a limited number of plot elements or \\"functions\\" that constructed all. These elements occurred in a standard, consistent sequence. He derived thirty-one generic functions, such as \\"a difficult task is proposed\\" or \\"donor tests the hero\\" or \\"a magical agent is directly transferred\\".

He is currently the third base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously served as the baseball manager for various teams in the Los Angeles Angels system for 9 years. Baseball career Ebel attended San Bernardino Valley College. He was drafted in the 27th round (365th overall) of the 1986 amateur draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, but elected to attend Florida Southern College, where he was a member of the 1988 NCAA Division II championship squad. Ebel signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization as a free agent, and was named the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL) Player of the Year in his 1988 season with the rookie-level GCL Dodgers. He was promoted to the Vero Beach Dodgers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League (FSL) in 1989, and was a member of the 1990 FSL champions. In 1991, Ebel was promoted to the Albuquerque Dukes of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), where he served as a utility player. During the 1989, 1990 and 1991 off seasons, Ebel also played in the Australian Baseball League with the Dodgers Australian affiliate the Adelaide Giants. In 1991 he served as a player‚Äìcoach for the Bakersfield Dodgers of the Class A-Advanced California League, a position he held until 1994. He served as a player‚Äìcoach for the high-A San Bernardino Spirit, also of the California League, in 1995, before coaching full-time with the San Antonio Missions of the Class AA Texas League in 1996. He began his managing career in 1997 with San Bernardino, taking the reins of the club late in the season. He managed the Great Falls Dodgers of the Rookie-level Pioneer League in 1998, compiling a 40-35 record. In 1999, he managed the Yakima Bears of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League. He returned to San Bernardino in 2000, and led the club to the California League title. He moved to the Wilmington Waves of the Class A South Atlantic League the following year, where he posted a 75-63 record. In 2002, he led the Jacksonville Suns to the Class AA Southern League East Division Championship and served as the club's manager until 2004. After serving for seventeen years in the Dodgers organization, Ebel joined the Los Angeles Angels organization in 2005 as the coach of the Salt Lake Stingers of the PCL, which posted a 79-65 record under his guidance. After long-time bench coach Joe Maddon left the Angels organization to manage the Tampa Bay Rays, Ebel was appointed to the major league team's coaching staff as Mike Scioscia's third base coach.(another link) While Ebel was the third base coach, Scioscia and he advocated a more aggressive style of baserunning. On October 8, 2013, Ebel succeeded Rob Picciolo, who was fired by the Angels, as the bench coach in 2014. Ebel is known for his loud whistle, which he uses to relay defensive alignments, such as shifts, during games. Ebel has compiled a career managing record of 531-496 in eight seasons. For the 2018 season, Ebel returned to the third base coach role after Ron Roenicke was hired as the bench coach for the Boston Red Sox and Josh Paul being named the Angels bench coach. On November 28, 2018, he was named to be the new third base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The descriptions in the Aeneid of ‚Äòmighty Dis‚Äôs walls‚Ä¶wide buildings girt by a triple wall‚Äô,Virgil, The Aeneid (Penguin 1990) p. 178-9 gave Dante the impetus for his later and more formal description of the city of Dis.R Lansing, The Dante Encyclopedia (2010) p. 306 Description The iron walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels, the Furies, and Medusa.Dante Hell (Penguin 1975) p. 118 and 124 Dante emphasizes the character of the place as a city by describing its architectural features: towers, gates, walls, ramparts, bridges, and moats. It is thus an antithesis to the heavenly city, as for instance described by St. Augustine in his book City of God.Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 306. Among these structures are mosques,Dante, Inferno, 8.70 \\"meschite\\"; Ciardi's annotation to this verse: \\"To a European of Dante's time a mosque would seem the perversion of a church, the impious counterpart of the House of God, just as Satan is God's impious counterpart.

Immediately within the walls of the City are Heretics like Epicurus, who, having previously disbelieved in immortality, are forever imprisoned in red-hot tombs.Dante Hell (Penguin 1975) p. 128 Beyond are three rings of those who were violent‚Äîto others, to themselves (suicides), or to God (blasphemers).Dante Hell (Penguin 1975) p. 134-5 In yet deeper gulfs within the decaying city of Dis are the last two circles, of frauds and corruptors, and finally the traitors. Punished within Dis are those whose lives were marked by active-willed and obdurate, rather than venial sins:Dante Hell (Penguin 1975) p. 120 and p. 139 heretics, murderers, suicides, blasphemers, usurers, sodomites, panderers, seducers, flatterers, Simoniacs, false prophets, barrators, hypocrites, thieves, fraudulent advisors, sowers of discord, falsifiers, and traitors. Sinners unable to control their passions offend God less than these, whose lives were driven by malizia (\\"malice, wicked intent\\"): > Of every malice (malizia) gaining the hatred of Heaven, injustice is the > goal; and every such goal injures someone either with force or > fraud.11.22‚Äì24, as cited by Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 307. There is perhaps a distinction between malizia as the characteristic of circles seven and eight, and the matta bestialitade, \\"inhuman wickedness\\", of circle nine, which punishes those who threaten \\"the most basic civic, familial, and religious foundations of happiness\\".Storey, The Dante Encyclopedia, p. 307.

Isolation pitch is the sum of the transistor width and the trench isolation distance. As the isolation pitch shrinks, the narrow channel width effect becomes more apparent. The shallow trench isolation fabrication process of modern integrated circuits in cross- sections. Shallow trench isolation (STI), also known as box isolation technique, is an integrated circuit feature which prevents electric current leakage between adjacent semiconductor device components. STI is generally used on CMOS process technology nodes of 250 nanometers and smaller. Older CMOS technologies and non-MOS technologies commonly use isolation based on LOCOS.Quirk, Michael & Julian Serda (2001). Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology: Instructor's Manual , p. 25. STI is created early during the semiconductor device fabrication process, before transistors are formed. The key steps of the STI process involve etching a pattern of trenches in the silicon, depositing one or more dielectric materials (such as silicon dioxide) to fill the trenches, and removing the excess dielectric using a technique such as chemical-mechanical planarization. Certain semiconductor fabrication technologies also include deep trench isolation, a related feature often found in analog integrated circuits. The effect of the trench edge has given rise to what has recently been termed the \\"reverse narrow channel effect\\" or \\"inverse narrow width effect\\".A. Chatterjee et al., IEDM 1996.(conference announcement) Basically, due to the electric field enhancement at the edge, it is easier to form a conducting channel (by inversion) at a lower voltage. The threshold voltage is effectively reduced for a narrower transistor width. The main concern for electronic devices is the resulting subthreshold leakage current, which is substantially larger after the threshold voltage reduction.

It is also where the inferior epigastric vessels perforate the rectus abdominis. Superior to the arcuate line, the internal oblique aponeurosis splits to envelop the rectus abdominis muscle both anteriorly and posteriorly. Inferior to the arcuate line, the internal oblique and transversus abdominis aponeuroses merge and pass superficial (i.e. anteriorly) to the rectus muscle. Here, both Spigelian and exceedingly rare arcuate line hernias may occur. The arcuate line occurs about 1/2 of the distance from the umbilicus to the pubic crest, but this varies from person to person. Above the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis is surrounded by an anterior layer of the rectus sheath and a posterior layer. The anterior layer is derived from the external oblique aponeurosis and the anterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis. The posterior layer is made up of the posterior lamina of the internal oblique aponeurosis and the transversus abdominis aponeurosis. Inferior to the arcuate line, all three muscle aponeuroses make up the rectus sheath, that is now only anterior to the rectus abdominis and not posterior to it at all. Therefore, inferior to the arcuate line, the rectus abdominis rests directly on the transversalis fascia. If one dissects the anterolateral abdominal wall, the arcuate line may be difficult to see, since all the aponeuroses are translucent.

NLRP3 is expressed predominantly in macrophages and as a component of the inflammasome, detects products of damaged cells such as extracellular ATP and crystalline uric acid. Activated NLRP3 in turn triggers an immune response. Mutations in the NLRP3 gene are associated with a number of organ specific autoimmune diseases.  Nomenclature  NACHT, LRR, and PYD are respectively acronyms for: * NACHT ‚Äì _N_ AIP (neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein), _C_ 2TA [class 2 transcription activator, of the MHC, _H_ ET-E (heterokaryon incompatibility) and _T_ P1 (telomerase-associated protein 1) * LRR ‚Äì \\" _l_ eucine- _r_ ich _r_ epeat\\" and is synonymous with NLR, for or _n_ ucleotide- binding domain, _l_ eucine-rich _r_ epeat\\" * PYD ‚Äì \\" _P_ YRIN _d_ omain,\\" after the pyrin proteins The NLRP3 gene name abbreviates \\"NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3,\\" where NLR refers to \\"nucleotide-binding domain, leucine- rich repeat.\\" The NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 is also called: * cold induced autoinflammatory syndrome 1 (CIAS1), * caterpiller-like receptor 1.1 (CLR1.1), and * PYRIN-containing APAF1-like protein 1 (PYPAF1). Structure This gene encodes a pyrin-like protein which contains a pyrin domain, a nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motif. This protein interacts with pyrin domain (PYD) of apoptosis- associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). Proteins which contain the caspase recruitment domain, CARD, have been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune response.  Function  NLRP3 is a component of the innate immune system that functions as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). NLRP3 belongs to the NOD-like receptor (NLR) subfamily of PRRs and NLRP3 together with the adaptor ASC protein PYCARD forms a caspase-1 activating complex known as the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 in the absence of activating signal is kept in an inactive state complexed with HSP90 and SGT1 in the cytoplasm. NLRP3 inflammasome detects danger signals such as crystalline uric acid and extracellular ATP released by damaged cells. These signals release HSP90 and SGT1 from and recruit ASC protein and caspase-1 to the inflammasome complex. Caspase-1 within the activated NLRP3 inflammasome complex in turn activates the inflammatory cytokine, IL-1Œ≤. The NLRP3 inflammasome appears to be activated by changes in intracellular potassium caused by potassium efflux from mechanosensitive ion channels located in the cell membrane. It appears that NLRP3 is also regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), though the precise mechanisms of such regulation has not been determined. It is suggested that NLRP3 provides protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections by activating STAT6 and SPDEF.  Pathology  Mutations in the NLRP3 gene have been associated with a spectrum of dominantly inherited autoinflammatory diseases called cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). This includes familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle‚ÄìWells syndrome (MWS), chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular (CINCA) syndrome, neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), and keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria. Defects in this gene have also been linked to familial Mediterranean fever. In addition, the NLRP3 inflammasome has a role in the pathogenesis of gout, hemorrhagic stroke and neuroinflammation occurring in protein-misfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and prion diseases. Amelioration of mouse models of many diseases has been shown to occur by deletion of the NLRP3 inflammasome, including gout, type 2 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and atherosclerosis. The compound Œ≤-Hydroxybutyrate has been shown to block NLRP3 activation, and thus may be of benefit for many of these diseases. Deregulation of NLRP3 has been connected with carcinogenesis. For example, all the components of the NLRP3 inflammasome are downregulated or completely lost in human hepatocellular carcinoma.  Inhibition  The NLRP3 inflammasome has garnered attention as a potential drug target for a variety of diseases underpinned by inflammation. The diarylsulfonylurea MCC-950 has been identified as a potent and selective NLRP3 inhibitor. Nodthera and Inflazome, have entered phase I clinical trials with NLRP3 inhibitors.

They then pass through Eunoe to have the memories of their good deeds in life strengthened. Upon completing his or her sentence in Purgatory, a soul is washed in the rivers Lethe and Eunoe (in that order) by Matilda. It is unclear who Matilda was in real life, but, nonetheless, her function is to cause the penitent to forget his or her sins (now that these sins have been purged) and then sip from the waters of Eunoe so that the soul may enter heaven full of the strength of his or her life's good deeds.

Due to her natural and skilled barrel riding technique, she is considered the best female barrel rider in the world. Through her passion, courage and skill, Rochelle has been a pioneer for the advancement of Women's surfing over the past two decades. Ballard's mastery of big waves and support of women's surfing, rank her among surfing history's most elite. She also co- founded International Women's Surfing (IWS) and has appeared in several movies and television shows, most notably Blue Crush, Step Into Liquid, and Beyond the Break. In 2012, she became the ISA World Masters World Champion. During her years on tour, Ballard won 7 world championship events and in 2004, she was runner-up to the World Championship title. In 1997, at the Billabong Pro at Burleigh Heads, Gold Coast, Australia, Rochelle scored two perfect 10 barrel rides against Layne Beachley in the semifinals and went on to win the event, after beating Lisa Anderson in the finals. To this day, Ballard still holds the women's world record for scoring two perfect 10s in a single heat. Rochelle currently resides on the island of Kauai, where she owns and operates Surf Into Yoga. Biography and Highlights Ballard was born Rochelle Gordines in Montebello, CA. on February 13, 1971.Rochelle Ballard - IMDb Her parents moved to the island of Kauai in Hawaii when she was six months old. The waves in Kauai are considered as some of the best in world and with the encouragement of four-time World Champion and Kauai resident Margo Oberg, she started surfing at 12 years old. Oberg had been a top surfing professional for more than three decades and was a mentor to Rochelle when she was first learning to surf the massive and dangerous waves that seasonally come to Kauai's north shore. ‚ÄúI really admired her big wave surfing,‚Äù said Rochelle in Christina Lessa's book Women Who Win. ‚ÄúShe received so much respect for what she did. She took me out surfing quite a bit one year, spent time with me, gave me pointers, and encouraged me to brave larger waves. I developed a love for surfing, a love that is almost impossible to express. There‚Äôs an energy in the water that gives you every kind of feeling: peace, excitement, fear, a huge adrenaline rush, discouragement, frustration. The nature of surfing is such that you can‚Äôt control the waves. You have to flow with them and find the rhythm of the ocean in order to work with it and experience what the ocean has to offer. Surfing is an art‚Äîwe draw a new line on each wave we ride. It‚Äôs also a science. You need to study the patterns of the ocean. And it‚Äôs an ongoing lesson, because every few years, the tides completely change.‚Äù Rochelle began surfing local competitions and then advancing to state competitions, and then on to nationals, and then on to the world amateur titles where she placed fourth in the World in 1988 and 1990.Matt Washaw, The Encyclopedia of Surfing. Retrieved 10 June 2017. Her successes qualified her to surf professionally on the World Championship Tour in 1991. In 1991, the same year she went pro, she married cinematographer Bill Ballard. When she wasn't competing she was appearing in and helping her husband to produce a long string of women's only surf movies including the original Blue Crush. Since then she has been featured on local and national news as well as magazines such as Surfing, TW Surf, Surfer, SG Magazine, Surfing Girl, Women Outside, Women's Sports and Fitness, Fit Magazine, Sports Illustrated Women, People, National Geographic as well as some international magazines. She received multiple awards over the years by the surfing community and in surfer magazine polls for best female performance, best tube ride, most influential women surfer and most popular women surfer. Ballard served as a stunt double in Universal Pictures motion picture titled Blue Crush in 2002. She also starred in A Girls Surf Addiction, a surf film that O'Neill released in 2004. She also helped produce a \\"yoga for surfers\\" video series. In 2001, she starred in the surfing documentary 7 Girls. She co-founded International Women's Surfing (IWS) and, together with O'Neill, launched the successful Rochelle Ballard Surf Camp series which focuses on advanced surfing techniques, cross training and education. Although Ballard never won a world title, she came close in 2004, winning second, and she has been a top-10 finisher since 1994. Her passion for the ocean and fearlessness in huge waves has made her an icon of women's surfing. Ballard currently resides on the island of Kauai, where she operates a surf, yoga and wellness business called Surf Into Yoga.

Abrams, Inc.. The book comes with a CD containing music based on a music competition that occurs in the middle of the story. Like many of Base's books, the book has minimal text written in verse along with large detailed pictures. The inspiration for the story came from the author's wanting to write something about music, having played in a band prior to his career as an author and illustrator. Plot summary The story follows the adventures of a young groob, named Sprocc, who loves to play with his splingtwanger (a guitar-like instrument). On his homeworld, planet Blipp, creativity is stifled and only the traditional music passed down from many generations is allowed. This stagnant environment quickly becomes too much for the artistic Sprocc and he improvises his own music, this nearly gets him exiled from his homeworld. But, he decides \\"life on Blipp for him was through\\", so he goes to an urban planet where he meets a variety of aliens. There he makes some new friends and learns of a competition for the \\"Worst Band in the Universe\\". The irony of this title is that within the context of the stagnant music environment, a creative band would be considered bad and the most creative band considered the \\"Worst\\". However, after winning the competition, Sprocc learns that the contest is a sham run by the same imperial authorities stifling music creativity. Sprocc and his bandmates are sent in exile to the junkyard planet, Wastedump B19, where Sprocc meets another exile called Skat. After a persistent effort by Sprocc, eventually Skat is persuaded to help Sprocc, his bandmates, and the other exiles build a ship, that is powered by music, and return to Blipp one year later. After returning to Blipp, the music exiles perform a grand show but are eventually stopped by the imperial authorities. However, the elder leader of Blipp comes out and explains that the old ways are no longer viable, that Sprocc and his friends represent the new generation of music creativity, and that they should be embraced and supported. With their authority stripped away, the Imperials can do nothing but watch the new generation and their new music. The book comes with a bonus CD. The CD covers some of the music performed at the \\"worst band in the universe competition\\" in the novel. All the music was written and performed by Graeme Base.
