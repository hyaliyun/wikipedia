He was part of an important artistic family that included his siblings Silvestre (composer), Ferm√≠n (painter) and Rosaura (actress). Life He was often imprisoned for his political activism, almost from the time he was a boy (from the age of 14‚Äì15 years) and was still a minor when he was sent for the first time to the maximum-security jail of those days: the Islas Mar√≠as. He participated in the Railwaymen's Movement in 1958, for which they imprisoned him again. In 1968 he was accused of being the \\"intellectual author\\" of the student movement that culminated in the Tlatelolco massacre, so he was arrested and sent to the Palacio de Lecumberri prison (aka The Black Palace), where he wrote one of his more popular books: El apando (The Punishment Cell) (A. Revueltas 1998; Valle, Alv√°rez Gar√≠n, and J. Revueltas 1970). Jos√© Revueltas was a revolutionary from the start, because he practiced that which soon would become his most important pedagogical proposal: Academic Self-intervention, a product of his own form of studying reality by means of theoretical knowledge that supplies the reading. For this reason he left secondary school because they went very slowly and he dedicated himself, from then on, to visiting libraries and acquiring books. He was a complete man with many facets, bound to the necessities of the proletariat, of the people, he was dedicated on all the fronts in which he participated to the task of socializing and of politicizing society, the latter task a revolutionary one. He used literature, cinematographic scripts, the academy, partisan participation and the street to promote his project. He joined the Mexican Communist Party in 1928, but was expelled in 1943 for his criticisms of the organisation's bureaucratic practices and for one of the best analyses of the left in Mexico: Ensayo de un proletariado sin cabeza (Essay on a Proletariat without a Head). He founded the Liga Espartaquista (Spartacist League) and the Partido Popular Socialista (Popular Socialist Party, or PPS), from which he also was expelled for questioning and criticizing the errors of the left.

It serves people who have been committed by the court as mentally ill and dangerous. It was established as St. Peter State Hospital in 1866 under the Kirkbride Plan. The original building is mostly demolished though the hospital is still active. History In 1866, the Minnesota Legislature approved the building of a state hospital for the insane, hoping to reduce the growing amount of mentally ill people in jails throughout the state. They first had to find an area willing to deed of land for the hospital. St. Peter leaders bought a farm for $7,000 and lent it to the state. The hospital was constructed in 1866 in the Kirkbride design. A fire destroyed the men's ward of the hospital on November 15, 1880. Dr. C.K. Bartlett was the superintendent of the hospital in its early years before resigning in 1894. Its first patient checked in December 6, 1866. The hospital soon became overcrowded, so the state built 3 other facilities in Rochester, Fergus Falls, and Anoka. The St. Peter location remained the main hospital. Other hospitals also opened to reduce the population of patients but either closed or turned into retirement homes for the elderly. In 1911, the Asylum for Dangerous Insane officially opened on the campus of the St. Peter Hospital. The name was later changed to the Minnesota Security Hospital (MSH) in 1957. After the attempted assassination of Bishop Patrick Heffron of the Diocese of Winona, Reverend Louis M. Lescher was committed to this hospital until his death in 1943. In 1982, the current MSH building opened. The original hospital has since been demolished. The coordinates of the original hospital are . Records Records documenting the population and activities in the security hospital, including admission and transfer book (1911-1938), admissions index (1911-1963), daily movement of population record, dangerous insane (1911-1913), and scrapbook (1937-1987) kept by longtime Medical Director Dr. Charles G. Sheppard are available for research use.

Due to overcrowding, some patients will be transferred to St. Peter's Regional Treatment Center; This is done by random selection upon intake. The facility was previously the Anoka Asylum and in 1937 the name was changed to the Anoka State Hospital. The hospital provided care for mentally ill men starting in 1900 and for women in 1906. As a hospital for the mentally ill, until 1999, it housed thousands of patients, both male and female. It was once again renamed in 1985 to the current name. History The hospital was founded as a state asylum in 1900 as a residence for mentally ill men and starting in 1906 for women. The city of Anoka was chosen over Hastings to help with overcrowding in mental institutions in St. Paul. Of the first 100 men brought to the asylum, 86 died and were buried on site in numbered graves. By 1948, the hospital itself was severely overcrowded, with a majority of the population being women. In the 1960s and 1970s many residents were moved out into nursing homes for better care. In 1985 the site was renamed the Anoka Metro Regional Treatment Center. It was closed in 1999 and was given to Anoka County.

AMRTC is accredited by the Minnesota Medical Association to provide Continuing Medical Education for physicians. As of January 1, 2014, AMRTC is working with Minnesota Community Offender Management to provide volunteer opportunities to inmates of the minimum security Plymouth Work House (ACF) Controversies In the 1970s there were a number of issues with the patients who would escape the hospital grounds. The patients would shoplift, start fires and loiter. Female patients would also be lured off the hospital grounds and be sexually assaulted by members of the community. In 1976 a patient escaped, broke into a nearby home and murdered a woman, Mary Galbraith. On May 29, 2019, workers at the AMRTC picketed demanding better protections after a worker was assaulted by a patient. Anoka Police had been providing security to the establishment through December 2018, but ended the arrangement because officers were limited in what kinds of actions they could take in what is considered a hospital situation. On January 30, 2020, a patient escaped AMRTC by climbing over a fence. Police responded and tried to apprehend the patient, but he was able to steal a police car by entering through the passenger-side door and led police on a short pursuit. The patient stopped a few blocks away and surrendered to police.

Most Sikhs live in the province of Punjab, a part of the larger Punjab region where the religion originated in the Middle Ages, with some also residing in Peshawar in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. Nankana Sahib, the birthplace of Guru Nanak Sahib Ji, the founder of Sikhism, is located in Pakistan's Punjab province. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Sikh community became a powerful political force, with Sikh leader Ranjit Singh founding the first Sikh empire, which had its capital in Lahore, the second-largest city in Pakistan today. At the time of the Partition of India in 1947, more than 2 million Sikhs lived in Pakistan and significant populations of Sikhs inhabited the largest cities in the Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad. After the Partition of India in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while many Muslim refugees from India settled in Pakistan. In the decades following Pakistan's independence in 1947, the Sikh community began to re-organize, forming the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (PSGPC) to represent the community and protect the holy sites and heritage of the Sikh religion in Pakistan. The Pakistani government has begun to allow Sikhs from India to make pilgrimages to Sikh places of worship in Pakistan and for Pakistani Sikhs to travel to India. Demographics According to the Government of Pakistan's National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), there were 6,146 Sikhs registered in Pakistan in 2012. A 2010 survey by the Sikh Resource and Study Centre reported 50,000 Sikhs living in Pakistan. Most are settled in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed by Sindh and Punjab.https://www.dawn.com/news/1410442 Other sources, including the US Department of State, claim the Sikh population in Pakistan to be as high as 20,000. Pakistani Sikh diaspora Many Pakistani Sikhs have emigrated to countries like the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. According to the UK's 2001 census, there were 346 Pakistani Sikhs in the UK. There is also a growing Pakistani Sikh expatriate community in the United Arab Emirates. Before the partition of colonial India Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Lahore Prior to independence in 1947, 2 million Sikhs resided in the present day Pakistan and were spread all across Northern Pakistan, specifically the Punjab region and played an important role in its economy as farmers, businessmen, and traders. Significant populations of Sikhs inhabited the largest cities in the Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi and Faisalabad (Lyallpur). Lahore, the capital of Punjab, was then and still is today the location of many important Sikh religious and historical sites, including the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh. The nearby town of Nankana Sahib has nine gurdwaras, and is the birthplace of Sikhism's founder, Guru Nanak Sahib. Each of Nankana Sahib's gurdwaras are associated with different events in Guru Nanak Sahib's life. The town remains an important site of pilgrimage for Sikhs worldwide. Sikh organizations, including the Chief Khalsa Dewan and Shiromani Akali Dal led by Master Tara Singh, condemned the Lahore Resolution and the movement to create Pakistan, viewing it as welcoming possible persecution; the Sikhs largely thus strongly opposed the partition of India. Independence of Pakistan (1947) Exterior of Panja Sahib Gurdwara in Hasan Abdal The largest Sikh population in Pakistan is found in Peshawar, in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, where the Pashtun law of \\"nanawati\\" (protection) spared the scale of violence which had raged across the Indus River in Punjab. Despite the longstanding tensions between the Sikh and Muslim communities in South Asia, the Pashtuns were tolerant towards the religious minority of Sikhs. There are small pockets of Sikhs in Lahore and Nankana Sahib in Punjab. Many of the Sikhs and Hindus of West Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan migrated to India after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. These Sikh and Hindu refugee communities have had a major influence in the culture and economics of the Indian capital city of Delhi. Today, segments of the populations of East Punjab and Haryana states and Delhi in India can trace their ancestry back to towns and villages now in Pakistan, including former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. There has been an influx of Sikhs refugees from Afghanistan to Pakistan due to the turbulent civil war and conflicts that have ravaged neighboring Afghanistan, and many of these Sikhs have settled in Peshawar. \\"The Heart-rending Story of Afghani Sikhs\\" 4 October 2006 Afghanistan, like Pakistan, has had small Sikh and Hindu populations. There has been a massive exodus of refugees from Afghanistan into Pakistan during the past 30 years of turmoil up to the reign of the Taliban and the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001. Due to Pakistan's porous borders with Afghanistan, large numbers of Afghanistan's minority communities, based mainly around the cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Jalalabad have fled, and some Sikhs have joined their kinsmen in Peshawar and Lahore. The Pakistani Sikh community in modern times Kanga, Kara and Kirpan - three of the five articles of faith endowed to the Sikhs. They have mainly kept a low profile within the monolithic Muslim population of Pakistan. Though, Pakistan maintains the title of Islamic state, the articles twenty, twenty-one and twenty-two in chapter two of its constitution guarantees religious freedom to the non-Muslim residents. Since independence in 1947, relations between Pakistan's minorities and the Muslim majority have remained fairly and politically stable. From 1984 to 2002, Pakistan held a system of separate electorates for all its national legislative assemblies, with only a handful of parliamentary seats reserved for minority members. Minorities were legally only permitted to vote for designated minority candidates in general elections. The regime of former President General Pervez Musharraf had professed an agenda of equality for minorities and promotion and protection of minority rights, however, the implementation of corrective measures has been slow. Considerable amount of Sikhs are found in neighbourhood called Narayanpura of Karachi's Ranchore Lines. The historical and holy sites of Sikhs are maintained by a Pakistani governmental body, the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, which is responsible for their upkeep and preservation. The emergence of the Sikh community within Pakistan Gurudwara in Layallpur Faisalabad After the independence of Pakistan and the migration of nearly all Sikhs to India the Sikh community's rights were diminished as their population decreased.\\"Partition Of The Punjab - 1947\\" 12 November 2006 The Pakistani Constitution states that Sikhism is a monotheistic religion. Recently the Sikh community within Pakistan has been making every effort possible to progress in Pakistan. For example, Hercharn Singh became the first Sikh to join the Pakistan Army. For the first time in the 58-year history of Pakistan there has a Sikh been selected into Pakistan's army. Prior to Harcharan Singh's selection in the Pakistani army no individual person who was a member of the Hindu or the Sikh community were ever enrolled in the army, however; the Pakistani Christian community has prominently served in the Pakistan Armed Forces and some had even reached the ranks of Major Generals in the army, Air Vice Marshals in the Pakistan Air force and rear Admiral in the Pakistan Navy. It has received various awards for gallantry and valor. Moreover, members of the tiny Parsi community have some representation in the Armed Forces. First time in the history of Pakistan as well as in the history of Lahore a Sikh person has been appointed as a traffic Sub Inspector. Dr. Gulab Singh who is just 25 years old, is a practising homeopathic doctor and he is from the same place as Harcharan Singh (Nankana Sahib). Gulab Singh is fluent in Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto, Saraiki, Sindhi, and little bit of English. Other prominent Sikhs are Inspector Amarjeet Singh of Pakistan Rangers and Lance-naik Behram Singh of Pakistan Coast Guard. In yet another contribution to the Pakistani Sikh community, Pakistan Government enacted the Sikh marriage act, Anand Marriage act, in November 2007. This Sikh marriage act allows not only the Sikhs in Pakistan, but also Sikhs living in anywhere in the world to register in Pakistan with the Sikh marriage act.\\"Pakistan Minister gives assurances for enacting Sikh Marriage Act\\" 24 November 2007 Many pilgrim Sikhs couples from abroad have reaffirmed their marriage vows in Pakistan under the Sikh marriage act. Notable Sikh Politics Ramesh Singh Arora became the first Sikh member of Provincial Assembly of the Punjab of Pakistan after he was nominated by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)). Another Sikh, Dr. Suran Singh has been nominated to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf following the 2013 elections. Music The first Pakistani Sikh musician also emerged on the music industry in 2009, Jassi Lailpuria, launched his first song on independence day entitled, Sohna Pakistan. A Sikh named Taranjeet Singh is an VJ, anchor and host on PTV channel. Rupinder Singh Magon (Rup Magon), from the band Josh, is also a superstar in Pakistan and is popular among the youth of the country. Although he lives in Canada but travels to Pakistan for concerts and television engagements. He, along with his bandmate Qurram Hussain, was also part of Coke Studio.

By the end of the reporting period (May 2007) the Shi'a leader had not been identified.International Religious Freedom 2007 (Released October 2007, covers period of June 2006 to May 2007) Background Early Immigration Muslim immigration occurred in moderate numbers in Nicaragua in the late 19th century. The majority were Palestinian Arab Muslims; the immigration constituted one of the largest waves of immigration to Central America. Although the exact number of Palestinians is not available, Guzm√°n writes \\"it is possible that from the end of the nineteenth century until 1917, when the Ottoman Empire entered its final decline, during World War I, 40 Palestinian families arrived in Nicaragua\\". This early wave of immigrants quickly lost their Islamic roots and blended into the local population, often by adopting a Christian heritage due to intermarrying and government pressure. At different points during the 1890s to the 1940s Nicaragua, and many other Latin American countries, established laws or issued ordinances that restricted the entry of Arabs, forbade the stay of Arabs already present in the country and curtailed the expansion of their commercial activities. Immigration: 1960s through 2000 Palestinians celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Nicaraguan revolution in Managua waving Palestine and Sandinista flags. The second group of immigrants in the 1960s was better educated, but not any more oriented towards Islam than the first. This group was affected by two major events in Nicaragua: the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake, and the Nicaraguan Revolution in 1979. At that time, many of the former Palestinians immigrated to North America or returned to Palestine. Those that stayed suffered greatly and their families were further assimilated into Christianity. The latest and smallest group of √©migr√©s was in the early 1990s. Many of these were immigrants returning to Nicaragua who had since become more aware of their Muslim heritage from exposure in North America or Palestine. These immigrants also possessed a stronger Islamic identity than previous groups, enabling an Islamic reawakening by the community.The Islamic Bulletin, Islam in Nicaragua By 2000 it was estimated that there were 500 families of Palestine Arabs and Palestinian descendants in Nicaragua. The Palestinians that arrived in Nicaragua were mostly Christians and a small number of Muslims, the majority of which came from rural villages near Ramallah, Jerusalem, Beit Jala and Bethlehem. The total population of Palestinians in Nicaragua ranks as the largest Arab community in Central America. Recent developments According to Fahmi Hassan, President of the 'Asociaci√≥n Cultural Nicarag√ºense-Isl√°mica, the Muslim population consists primarily of Arabs who immigrated from Palestinian territories and Lebanon, in addition to a number of indigenous converts.Edwin S√°nchez, Primer Im√°n de Nicaragua . El Nuevo Diario. Domingo 14 de Marzo de 2004 In 1999, the first masjid (mosque) was constructed in the country on a parcel of land measuring three thousand meters in the San Juan district (Ciudad Jardin) with a capacity for nearly one thousand people. The masjid provides introductory courses on Islamic doctrine, as well as a place for performance of the congregational Friday prayer (Salaat al-Jummah) and Ramadan activities. Although the small Muslim community initially lacked finances, they were assisted by contributions from a delegation of Panamanian Muslims. Besides its characteristic minar, the liturgical office has a library, prayer room, administrative office, children's area, and a school. Religious seminars are offered for both men and women; Spanish language pamphlets are also distributed.Elhamalawy, Salma Celebrating Ramadan from Chile to China. October 2003 Additionally, another new Islamic Center was recently inaugurated, called the Centro Cultural Isl√°mico Nicarag√ºense. It is operated by a group of Shiite Muslims and their main goal is the propagation of Islamic teachings. Population of Shiite Muslims existed in Nicaragua from migration of Iranian refugees escaping Iranian Revolution of 1979 and escaping turmoil of Iran‚ÄìIraq War of the 1980s, the Iran‚ÄìNicaragua ties strengthened the influence of Shia Islam. Most Shi'ite Muslim Nicaraguans are of Iranian blood, they may still speak Persian and/or other Iranian language, aside from Arabic and Spanish. in the 2018 protests in Managua there was little identified participation by the Muslim community  References   External links  *Latino Dawah *El Nuevo Diario (in Spanish) *Valeria Imhof (2003).

It used the same gas operated, rotating bolt system as the rifle but fired from an open bolt and had a much heavier fixed barrel. There were some minor cosmetic changes from the rifle, including a beefier front hand grip and enlarged handguards around the barrel. The stock was modified slightly to support the shooters shoulder and provides a grip for the support hand. The carrying handle was removable and its mounting can be used for a variety of optics. The AS70/90 light machine gun had been introduced by Beretta as a response to the requests of the Italian Army, which by the time (late 1980s) was looking for a more compact and handy squad automatic weapon to replace in this role the MG-42/59 (Italian license-made version of the German Rheinmetall MG3 machine-gun). The AS70/90 anyway never passed well the extremely stringent trial tests it underwent by the Alpini troops of the Italian Army. The open bolt working system made this gun more sensitive to the penetration of dirt and other elements which caused frequent jamming and malfunctions. Furthermore, the AS70/90 fed only by STANAG magazines; and although this includes the possibility of using the high- capacity (100-rounds) Beta C-Mag, this was still too little for the necessity of the Italian Armed Forces, who basically wanted a belt-fed weapon with magazine-feeding possibility as an emergency optional. As a result, the AS70/90 was discarded, the FN MINIMI light machine-gun being adopted instead (and being since manufactured under license in Italy by Beretta). The AS70/90 never interested any other customer, and quickly went out of the Beretta Defence/Police catalogues. The very few samples manufactured are today in the hands of Beretta itself and of the Italian Armed Forces, which make no use of it.

The numbering plan area (NPA) 304 was established in October 1947, with one of the original 86 area codes. Area code 681 was added to the same area in an overlay plan that took effect on March 28, 2009. History Due to West Virginia's low population, the state was one of the last remaining states with only one area code. With the growth of telecommunication services, in particular proliferation of cell and mobile phones and fax machines, news reports in 2007 indicated that West Virginia would soon need a new area code. On January 29, 2008, the West Virginia Public Service Commission voted 2-1 for a split of numbering plan area 304, while commission chairman Michael Albert dissented in favor of an overlay. The proposed split had Charleston and points south (Huntington, Bluefield, Beckley) staying in 304, while the northern and eastern portions of the state (Wheeling, Morgantown, Clarksburg, Parkersburg) would have received a new area code.WV to get second area code . Associated Press, 2008-01-29. However, telecommunications providers were overwhelmingly in favor of an overlay, instead of a split. Most of the state's telecommunications providers wanted to spare their northern West Virginia customers, particularly in rural areas, the burden of having to change their numbers‚Äìwhich would have required reprogramming of all cell phones. They were still able to ask the Commission to reconsider, or appeal to the West Virginia State Supreme Court, for an overlay instead of a split. An overlay would have had the effect of assigning a total of 15.6 million numbers to a state of just over 1.8 million people. Over the following two weeks, numerous state and local government officials and various business interests voiced strong opposition to a split, in favor of the overlay option. Even Governor Joe Manchin voiced his support of an overlay. Several telecommunications providers then officially appealed to the Public Service Commission for an overlay, which was unanimously approved by all three commissioners on February 13, 2008. It was the first example of an entire state previously only served by a single code being overlaid. This example has since been followed by Idaho, where area code 208 was overlaid with 986 in 2017. At one time, 932 was reserved for use as a future area code in West Virginia, but there has since been a 304-932 exchange code assigned in Charleston. In any event, West Virginia is not currently projected to need another area code in the foreseeable future. Implementation dates for 681 code Implementation dates for permissive and mandatory ten-digit local dialing, as well as the effective date of the overlay, were announced in Neustar NANPA's Planning Letter #375, issued March 21, 2008. * Permissive ten-digit local dialing of numbers in the existing 304 area code would begin no later than July 26, 2008. (During this period, local 304 calls could still be dialed with just seven digits.) * Mandatory ten-digit local dialing of existing 304 numbers took effect on February 28, 2009. (Calls within 304 dialed with just seven digits became extinct; a recorded message informed them of the new dialing procedure.) * New numbers with the 681 area code became available on March 28, 2009, one month after the start of mandatory ten-digit dialing. * A test number for determining if routing to the new area code is in effect from any West Virginia telephone number, 681-990-TEST (8378), went into service on December 28, 2008 and remained active through June 28, 2009.

The northern tip of the Canal Area is on the left, with Pickleweed Park in the central foreground. The Canal Area comprises two neighborhoods of San Rafael, California, designated by the city as the \\"Canal Waterfront\\" and the \\"Canal.\\" The Canal Area is bounded on the east by San Francisco Bay, on the north by the San Rafael Canal and on the south and west by Highways 101 and I-580 and by San Quentin Ridge. Land use is split almost evenly between residential and non-residential (commercial/industrial) uses.San Rafael 2020, Neighborhoods Neighborhood Element of the San Rafael General Plan, pp. 88-97, Accessed 2006-12-29 The Canal Area provides a substantial portion of the low-income housing in Marin County, one of the most affluent counties in the United States, along with Marin City. It is also the location of transportation and waste management facilities serving Marin County and the North Bay.  Demographics and housing  Most of San Rafael's low-income residents live in the Canal Area, along with many affluent residents. There is at least one concern (on Harbor Way) that rents slips for boats that people can live aboard legally. The more affluent residents live in the houses constructed in the 1960s right on the Canal and in two housing developments in the eastern part of the Canal's residential area: Baypoint Lagoons (constructed in the late 1990s) and Spinnaker Point (constructed earlier). Some real-estate agents refer to these two developments as being in \\"East San Rafael\\", to avoid the stigma of the name \\"Canal Area\\". This area provides a location for workers who hold low- income jobs that are essential to the functioning of the community to live close to their place of employment. Although the majority of residents in this area are low-income workers, most of the apartments in which they live are neither subsidized nor less expensive than comparable apartments elsewhere in San Rafael.  Parks and public facilities  Between the newer housing developments and the Bay is a paved path called Shoreline Park, which is a scenic place to take a walk or a bike ride. Along with a bike path owned by the Spinnaker Point Homeowner's Association (which forms the West side of the square), Shoreline Park forms a square 0.25 miles (400 m) long and 0.25 miles (400 m) wide. The easiest way to visit Shoreline Park is to visit Pickleweed Park, then to walk east along the north side of the square. Pickleweed Park is home to a large community center and to soccer fields and a playground. There are many dozen, perhaps hundreds, of stores, shops, offices and other commercial operations in the West and the South of the area (including most of San Rafael's auto-body shops). Country Club Bowl, Marin County's only surviving bowling center, is located here.  Large land users  Industrial Light and Magic occupied many tens of thousands of square feet of office space here and in 1997 built a \\"main stage\\" here for the production of movie special effects. The main stage is still in use, but most of the office space was moved to San Francisco in 2005.

From the February 1997 issue to the June 1999 issue, it appeared as a serial in the Japanese manga magazine Nakayoshi. Kodansha compiled the twenty-seven chapters into five bound volumes and published them from October 1997 to September 1999. It is a fantasy adventure tale about a young girl called Yuuki Wakasa, who one day acquires a magical red stone. The stone allows her to travel to Takamagahara (È´òÂ§©Âéü \\"High Plane of Heaven\\"), the dream world, when she sleeps, and can only return to Nakatsukuni (‰∏≠„ÉÑÂõΩ \\"middle country\\"), the real world, when she goes to sleep in the dream. Yuuki discovers that she must save the sun, Amaterasu, from being trapped and destroyed in Takamagahara, or the light will be lost from both worlds forever. The manga has been translated and republished in German by Egmont Manga & Anime from November 2002 to May 2003, and English by Tokyopop from August 2004 to August 2005. The series has since gone out of print.  Characters  ; : Yuuki Wakasa is the heroine of the story. Because of her mother's personality she has to look after her three brothers, Kousuke, the oldest brother, and the twins Youichi and Youji. She uses Seiza for punishment. She is a loud, outgoing and clumsy 5th grader that can make everyone shut up. She was once a normal fifth grader until a strange stone fell from the sky in her hands. After that she was sent to find the four other stone bearers and save Amaterasu. Unlike the others, Yuuki travels between Nakatsukuni and Takamagahara in the same body. She is easily moved to tears by the plights of nature caused by noncaring humans. Yuuki is also called \\"Horizon Girl\\". She is also the next Lady Amaterasu. She also has a crush on Takaomi, which later on confesses her feelings towards him. ; : Takaomi Kai is a boy in Yuuki's class and her crush. He has an older brother, but he never appears in the manga. In Nakatsukuni, he has a mellow attitude and cares about Yuuki which is about the only thing he has in common with the Takaomi in Takamagahara. The one in Takamagahara is 15 years old and a leader of a band of thieves. His hobbies are eating, sleeping, and hitting on every girl he meets. He says that he does it to be polite. He is very aggressive and violent. He also has a mysterious mark on his forehead. : Takaomi also is the recipient of a magic stone. He too has a part in the legend as he finds out after rescuing Princess Kana from the crystal snake. King Tsukuyomi reveals that Takaomi's role in the legend is to transform into the god of destruction and eat Amaterasu. This will destroy both worlds. ;Binga : Karyubinga, or Binga to Yuuki, is a female bird. When Yuuki uses her powers, she can make Binga bigger anytime she likes. Only those with a magic stone can talk with Binga. Binga has a fiery temper. ; : Souta Inaba is in Yuuki's class. He enjoys studying and is very smart (which he often likes to point out, especially to Nachi). He tends to argue quite often with Nachi. In Takamagahara, Souta is a long-haired priest who predicts the future by dropping his stone into water. They use his fortune-telling skills to make money in Takamagahara, seeing as all of the others tend to get fired from their jobs because of their constant arguing. He has been researching \\"the end of the legend,\\" and tells Yuuki that he never thought that he'd be part of that legend. Souta has a fear of ghosts. The symbol on his stone is \\"sariyasu\\" (cloth). ; : He goes to the same school as Yuuki, but is not in the same class. He's sort of a bully, and is said to have beaten a junior high student. He has an older sister (which was never shown), and he doesn't spend much time studying. He first meets Yuuki and the others in Takamagahara when he attacks Takaomi for the bounty on his head. He then finds a magic stone in the net that the poacher used, and that's when he gets his memories from Nakatsukuni. He then meets Yuuki in Nakatasukini when he discovers that she checked out a book from the library that he was going to borrow, telling her afterwards that there is another student in his class with a magic stone. He has a crush on Miss Nakime. ; : In Nakatsukuni, Keima is Taizou's classmate. He loves to recycle things and invent things from the trash the gathers. He's good in school. In Takamagahara, he is an innovator. He still loves to sift through trash. He is 15 years old. ; : In Nakatsukuni, Nachi is Yuuki's classmate. He is good at sports, but he puts no effort into his studying. He will grow up to inherit his parents' company. He has a crush on Takaomi. In Takamagahara, he is the only one with a different gender. He is a 16-year-old girl. Nachi still has a crush on Takaomi. ; Miss Nakime : Miss Nakime is Lady Amaterasu's assistant. She is smart, calm, but very lonely. She can't communicate with the magic stone holders very well. Taizou has a crush on her. She is losing energy as she supports Lady Amaterasu. She was the one who initiated the Amanoiwato Project. Development Among the elements Tachikawa incorporated in Dream Saga from Japanese mythology are the sun goddess Amaterasu (center) and the myth Amano-Iwato. Manga artist Megumi Tachikawa created Dream Saga during the time that her previous serial, Saint Tail, was concluding. The genre, fantasy, was the first to be decided on, and she decided to draw on mythology. She consulted several books on the mythologies of different cultures, ruling out Greek mythology, as she felt that it was often seen in manga, and Chinese mythology, because one of her earlier works had dealt with it. Japanese mythology was decided on, as she and her editor felt that it was \\"familiar, but seldom-seen.\\" The concept for the five magic stones was inspired by the Japanese fantasy novel Nannsou Satomi Hatsuken-Den by Bakin Takizawa, which centers on eight canines, each possessing a ball that corresponds to a virtue (e.g. loyalty and knowledge). Despite drawing on mythology for Dream Saga, she included original elements, such as the 'Horizon Girl'. She also deviated from the mythology by altering the role of Tsukuyami, originally brother to Amateratsu, and using the myth of Takama-ga-hara, the home of the gods, only as a basis for Dream Sagas spiritual world. Aspects from other mythologies also appear in the manga: the character Karyubinga is derived from a legendary bird of the same name in Indian mythology. For the language of Takama-ga-hara, Tachikawa combined syllables primarily from English, Indian, Spanish, and Turkish. Release Written and illustrated by Megumi Tachikawa, the twenty-seven chapters of Dream Saga appeared as a serial in the Japanese manga magazine Nakayoshi from the February 1997 issue to the June 1999 issue. The chapters were collected into five bound volumes by Kodansha and published from October 1997 to September 1999. Tokyopop licensed Dream Saga for an English-language release in North America in 2003. It published the five volumes from August 10, 2004, to August 9, 2005. Tokyopop's translation has since gone out of print. Dream Saga has also been translated into German by Egmont Manga & Anime. Volume list  Reception  The first volume of Dream Saga placed 68th on ICv2's list of the 100 bestselling graphic novels for July 2004, with 1429 copies sold.

It is located in the Elk Mountains along a four-wheel-drive road east of Marble and northwest of Crested Butte. Crystal was a mining camp established in 1881 and after several decades of robust existence, was all but abandoned by 1917. Many buildings still stand in Crystal, but its few residents live there only in the summer. History In 1874, geologist Sylvester Richardson discovered promising deposits of silver near the confluence of the North Fork and South Fork of the Crystal River in Gunnison County. In the years that followed, the Ute native american tribe was removed from the area and prospectors began mining operations, creating a new mining camp in 1880. A year later, on August 6, 1881, the Gunnison County court held a session and voted for the incorporation of Crystal City, which was made official on June 8, 1881. At its height of prosperity in the mid-1880s, Crystal had over 500 residents, a post office, a newspaper (the Crystal River Current which was later replaced by The Silver Lance), a pool hall, the Crystal Club (a popular and exclusive men's club), a barber shop, saloons, and hotels. During the 1880s and 1890s, when miners began to inhabit Crystal and the surrounding area, fire was used to clear the land in order to begin mining. Thousands of acres were set ablaze removing old growth trees and altering the pattern of vegetation in the area. This allowed for several mines near crystal to prove productive, among the largest being the Black Queen, Lead King, and Sheep Mountain Tunnel. Silver, lead, and zinc were the primary metals produced, but getting the ore out of the valley was a continuing problem. The nearest rail stations were in Crested Butte and Carbondale, and distant, respectively. These routes out of Crystal were, in places, not much more than a trail. While work to improve the paths continued years after the establishment of Crystal, the routes never amounted to more than narrow wagon trails during the years the mines shipped ore. As a result, the majority of the ore was taken to the stations by jack train with up to 100 mules. The remoteness of Crystal hindered its success. The transport of ore out to the depots in Crested Butte and Carbondale (via Marble) and the resupply of basic necessities and mail into Crystal were a challenge in the snow-free months and difficult to impossible during the winter. Deep snow and late-lying snow drifts were hindrances and avalanches, rock slides, and wet, slick ledge roads were dangerous and sometimes deadly. Transportation difficulties cut into profits and by 1889 Crystal was in decline with the winter population being less than 100. Despite the silver panic of 1893 , while many other mines throughout the country were shutting down, Crystal still supported multiple mining operations. In fact that same year, the historic Crystal Mill was built by George C. Eaton and B.S Phillips. The pair were promoters of the Sheep Mountain Tunnel and Mining Company, and the building, then known as the Sheep Mountain Tunnel Mill, was built to supply power to that and surrounding mines. Water from the Crystal River was dammed and used to provide electricity for air drills and ventilation for miners. The powerhouse used the flow of the Crystal River to power an air compressor, and the compressed air was piped to the mines to run pneumatic drills. This system was so efficient that soon after, a stamp mill was built to crush and concentrate the silver ore for shipping. This innovation saved the mining operations for a few years, but crystal continued to decline and soon the population had dwindled to eight by the year of 1915. in 1917 the mines and the Sheep Mountain powerhouse were closed, and Crystal was largely vacated.

Print https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5187127.pdf In 1938, after many years of Crystal having been abandoned, Emmet Shaw Gould of Aspen, CO traveled to Crystal searching for ore to run through a recently purchased mill. he bought several mining claims along with the city lots with the cabins still standing. The area stayed in his possession, though it was never made profitable again by means of mining. Eventually, ownership was transferred to one of Gould's daughters, Dorothy Tidwell of Treasure Mountain Ranch, Inc. In 1985, while owned by Tidwell, Crystal was nominated and selected for a place in the National Register of Historic Places Inventory by the Gunnison County Courthouse. United States.

In July the average temperature is 56.8 degrees Fahrenheit, and in January the average temperature is 13.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The highest recorded temperature in the area was 106 degrees Fahrenheit on July 21, 2005. The lowest recorded temperature was -23 degrees Fahrenheit on January 13, 1963. There are an average of 90 days each year with temperatures above or equal to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and 140 days a year with recorded temperatures below or equal to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual rainfall in inches is 10.63, while yearly annual snowfall in inches is 45.  Parent Rock  The rock in the Elk Mountain Range in the area surrounding Crystal is composed primarily of (90%) sedimentary material, including mostly course elastics, shale, and limestone. The last 10% is mostly igneous rock. The Maroon Mountains formations (which are the closest notable mountains to the valley town of Crystal) are composed of mostly sandstone and siltstone, which are course elastic rocks and are exposed for the most part. Fine elastic rocks cover a fifth of Crystal. Glacial remain and out-wash created the sandy loam material which fill the valleys in the area, including the bottom of the Crystal River which runs through the valley in Crystal and surrounding towns.  Topography  The elevation of Crystal is centered at 8,950 ft, however the area in and around crystal ranges from 8,500 ft to peaks of 13,500 ft. The land is well drained, and the rock types such as limestone create very steep slopes common in the Rocky Mountains. The area is described as having classically alpine terrain in characteristics, and the sources of the areas streams are mainly glacial cirques. Barren parts of the mountains that are at elevations low enough to support vegetation growth are primarily unable to support much vegetation due to the steep slopes and the large accumulation of shale rocks. Overview Crystal is vacated in the winter but there are a few summer residents. The town does see visitors, most passing through to recreate in the area. The upper Crystal River Valley is nestled between two wilderness areas: the Maroon Bells‚ÄìSnowmass Wilderness to the north and the Raggeds Wilderness to the south. Photography, hiking, peak bagging, mountain biking, and four-wheel- drive and off-highway vehicle touring are common activities. Fly fishing and hunting (deer and elk) are also popular. Today Crystal is best known for one of the most photographed historic sites in Colorado, the Crystal Mill, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Transportation Gunnison County Road 3 connects Crystal to Marble. Much of the road is a rocky shelf road, suitable for four-wheel drive only. Forest Road 317 (a.k.a. Gothic Road) connects Crystal to Crested Butte via Schofield Pass. It traverses the Devils Punchbowl, considered among the most dangerous four-wheel drive trails in the state.

This covenant is sometimes also referred to as the Law of Moses, Mosaic Law, or the 613 Mitzvot, or commandments (singular: mitzvah). Historical-critical scholarship The concept of a covenant began long before the biblical era, specifically the beginnings of Israel. According to George E. Mendenhall,George E. Mendenhall covenants were originally established as legal customs and then later were replicated in the field of religion. These covenants were created on the basis of an oath, a promise between two parties followed by performance. Engaging in an oath implied that the more powerful party would ensure that the other received proper punishment if it were to default. In the case of religion, the god(s) would be carrying out punishment. Such covenants assured that either blessings or curses be enacted in response to the circumstances. The initial covenant between God and Abraham follows the form of the suzerain covenant; what is significant is that Israel has no duties to uphold; the covenant is not conditional. Future covenants between Israel and God would be conditional. This is clearly expressed in Deuteronomy 11:13-21, recited twice-daily as part of the foundational prayer, the Shema. This passage declares that as long as Israel is faithful to God it will be blessed with ample crops but should it follow other gods the land will not support it. The cost of not following this covenant is hard. In addition to the legal influence in regards to the creation of covenants, Mendenhall also addresses the theory behind blood ties and their significance to the concept of a covenant. As stated in the bible, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are the descendants of Israel and because of their shared blood, they consequently form a bond. This blood tie is compared to the tie that is established by a covenant, and implies that without their shared blood, covenants would be the only way to ensure such unification of a religious group. Furthermore, Mendenhall notes two additional theories noting how covenants may have begun with the work of Moses, or are even thought to have been established during a true historical event with a valid setting. Regardless of the theories, the creation of covenants may be a mystery to scholars for centuries to come, however, the use of covenants evidenced throughout the biblical sources is an undeniable fact. According to Mendenhall, the covenant was not just an idea, but actually a historical event. This event was the formation of the covenant community. Wandering the desert, the clans left Egypt following Moses. These people were all of different backgrounds, containing no status in any social community. With all these circumstances they formed their own community by a covenant whose texts turned into the Decalogue. The Israelites did not bind themselves to Moses as their leader though and Moses was not a part of the covenant. Moses was just seen as a historical figure of some type sent as a messenger. The Israelites followed the form of the suzerainty treaty, a particular type of covenant common in the Near East and were bound to obey stipulations that were set by Yahweh, not Moses. In addition to Mendenhall's input and perspective, WeinfeldM. Weinfeld argues that there are two forms of covenants to have occurred throughout the Hebrew Bible: 1.) the obligatory type & 2.) the promissory type. These translate to a ‚Äúpolitical treaty‚Äù as evidenced by the Hittite Empire, and a ‚Äúroyal grant‚Äù as shown through the covenants tied to Abraham and David. A treaty entails a promise to the master by the vassal and ultimately protects the rights of the master. This consequently works in a manner that promotes future loyalty of the vassal since the suzerain had previously done favors for them. A grant on the other hand pertains to an obligation from the master to his servant thus ensuring protection of the servant's rights. This method of covenant emphasizes focus on rewarding loyalty and good deeds that have already been done. Weinfeld supports his characterization of a treaty by identifying the parallels exposed through the covenant between Yahweh and Israel. Similarly, he utilizes the Abrahamic and Davidic covenant to reveal its correspondence with a royal grant. In spite of the numerous theories revolving covenants in the ancient Near East, Weinfeld ensures his readers that the covenants exposed in the Old Testament fall beneath one of the two plausible types he has identified, either an obligatory type or a promissory type. In an article comparing covenants and forms of treaties common at the time, Mendenhall focuses on Hittite suzerainty treaties. These treaties, established between an emperor (suzerain) and inferior king (vassal), were defined by several important elements. The treaties were based on past aid or good fortune that the suzerain had previously delivered unto the vassal and the obligations that the vassal, therefore, had to the suzerain. This foundation for a treaty relationship is similar to the foundation for the Mosaic covenant and the Decalogue, according to Mendenhall. God had delivered the Israelites from Egypt in the Exodus, and they therefore are obligated to follow the commandments in the Decalogue. As the vassal, God has no further obligations towards the Israelites‚Äîbut it is implied that God will continue to protect them as a result of the covenant.Mendenhall, George E. (Sept. 1954). \\"Covenant Forms in Israelite Tradition\\". The Biblical Archaeologist (New Haven, Conn.: The American Schools of Oriental Research) Judaism In the Hebrew Bible, God established the Mosaic covenant with the Israelites after he saved them from slavery in Egypt in the story of the Exodus. Moses led the Israelites into the promised land known as Canaan. The Mosaic covenant played a role in defining the Israelite kingdom (c. 1220-c. 930 BCE), and subsequently the southern Kingdom of Judah (c. 930-c. 587 BCE) and northern Kingdom of Israel (c. 930-c. 720 BCE), and Yehud Medinata (c.539-c.333 BCE), and the Hasmonean Kingdom (140-37 BCE), and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-136 CE), and Rabbinic Judaism c. 2nd century to the present. Rabbinic JudaismJewish Encyclopedia: Gentiles: Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah asserts that the Mosaic covenant was presented to the Jewish people and converts to Judaism (which includes the biblical proselytes) and does not apply to Gentiles, with the notable exception of the Seven Laws of Noah which apply to all people. Christianity A depiction of the famous Sermon on the Mount of Jesus in which he commented on the Old Covenant. Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.Such as etc. See also : \\"The central thought of the entire Epistle is the doctrine of the Person of Christ and His Divine mediatorial office.... There He now exercises forever His priestly office of mediator as our Advocate with the Father (vii, 24 sq.).\\" Painting by Carl Heinrich Bloch, Danish painter, d. 1890. The Mosaic covenant or Law of Moses, which Christians generally call the \\"Old Covenant\\" in contrast to the New Covenant, has played an important role in the shaping of Christianity. It has been the source of serious dispute and contention seen in Jesus' expounding of the Law during his Sermon on the Mount, the circumcision controversy in early Christianity, and the Incident at Antioch which has led scholars to dispute the relationship between Paul of Tarsus and Judaism. The Book of Acts says that after the ascension of Jesus, Stephen, the first Christian martyr, was killed when he was accused of speaking against the Jerusalem Temple and the Mosaic Law. Later, in , the Council of Jerusalem addressed the circumcision controversy in early Christianity.

The song is a murder ballad, telling of a young woman lured into the forest where she is killed and buried in a shallow grave. Many variants of the story have the villain as a ship's carpenter who promises to marry Polly but murders her when she becomes pregnant. When he goes back to sea, either he is haunted by her ghost, confesses to the murder, goes mad and dies, or the ship will not sail. He denies the murder and is ripped to pieces by her ghost.(for example) Full English; Henry Hammond Manuscript Collection (HAM/5/34/26) https://www.vwml.org/record/HAM/5/34/26 Retrieved 2017/05/04 \\"The Gosport Tragedy\\" There are a number of extant broadside copies of \\"The Gosport Tragedy\\", the earliest known version. It is a lengthy ballad composed of rhymed couplets, sixteen verses of eight lines each. A copy at the Lewis Walpole Library has an estimated date of 1760 to 1765. In \\"The Gosport Tragedy: Story of a Ballad\\", D.C. Fowler argued that the events described in the song may have taken place in 1726.D.C. Fowler, \\"The Gosport Tragedy: Story of a Ballad\\", Southern Folklore Quarterly 43 (1979), 157-96. The ship, identified as the Bedford often \\"lay at Portsmouth\\" as in the song. Fowler found evidence that a ship's carpenter on the Bedford by the name of John Billson died at sea on September 25, 1726, and that there was a Charles Stewart among the crew members at the time, as noted in some versions. The tragic protagonist, \\"Molly\\", does not seem to have been buried at the Parish Church of St. Mary's Alverstoke, the presumed \\"Gosford Church\\", as claimed in the song. Although hardly conclusive, a number of subsequent commentators have regarded Fowler's scenario as plausible. Later revisions In the nineteenth century, considerably shortened and altered broadside versions began appearing under a wide range of titles including \\"Love and Murder\\", \\"The Cruel Ship's Carpenter\\", \\"Polly's Love\\", \\"The Cruel Ship-Carpenter\\", \\"Nancy's Ghost\\", \\"Molly the Betray'd\\" and \\"The Fog-bound Vessel\\". The protagonist frequently appears as \\"Polly\\" (though not \\"pretty Polly\\") and the locale is often given as Worcester, although the names of Molly and Gosport appear in some, and there is little doubt of the connection with the \\"Gosport Tragedy\\". Modern use In the United States, the song had gained new life as a banjo tune by the time of its earliest recordings in the mid-1920s: John Hammond's \\"Purty Polly\\" of 1925 and 1927, and the \\"Pretty Polly\\" versions of B.F. Shelton and Dock Boggs, both of 1927. American versions of the song, such as those of B.F. Shelton and Dock Boggs, tend to begin in the first person (\\"I courted Pretty Polly...\\") and switch to the third person for the murder (\\"he stabbed her to the heart\\"); Judy Collins' 1968 recording featured alternating verses switching back and forth between Polly and Willie's perspectives. American versions also tend to either omit the reason for killing Pretty Polly or portray him as a spurned suitor, and Willie's subsequent madness or haunting by Polly's ghost, with the remorseful killer instead turning himself in and confessing to the police. The ballad is the musical basis for \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown\\" by Bob Dylan who played \\"Pretty Polly\\" himself in his early years. Woody Guthrie used the tune of \\"Pretty Polly\\" for \\"Pastures of Plenty\\". David Lindley's version alters the ending and has Polly draw a razor and kill Willie instead. The song was performed by Hilarie Burhans for the closing credits of the sixth episode of Season 2, \\"Something Very Expensive\\" of the HBO series Deadwood. The song was sung by Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) in Season 2 Episode 4 of the Netflix original series House of Cards. In the DC Universe TV series Doom Patrol, one of Crazy Jane's alternate personalities is named Pretty Polly. The alter named Karen mocks her by singing the song at her.

Background  The name Rastafari is taken from Ras Tafari, the title (Ras) and first name (Tafari Makonnen) of Haile Selassie I before his coronation. In Amharic, Ras, literally \\"head\\", is an Ethiopian title equivalent to prince or chief, while the personal given name T√§f√§ri (teferi) means one who is revered. The origin of Rastafari came from Jamaica and Ethiopia. Jah is a Biblical name of God, from a shortened form of Jahweh or Jehovah found in Psalms 68:4 in the King James Version of the Bible. Most adherents see Haile Selassie I as Jah or Jah Rastafari, an incarnation ofGod the Father, the Second Advent of Christ \\"the Anointed One\\", i.e. the Second Coming of Jesus Christ the King to Earth.The Rastafari way of life encompasses the spiritual use of cannabis and the rejection of the degenerate society of materialism, oppression, and sensual pleasures, called Babylon. Rastas assert that Zion (i.e., Ethiopia) is a land that Jah promised to them. To achieve this, they reject modern western society, calling it \\"Babylon\\", which they see as entirely corrupt due to materialism and greed. \\"Babylon\\" is considered to have been in rebellion against \\"Earth's Rightful Ruler\\" (Jah) ever since the days of the Biblical king Nimrod. The lion is a symbol for Rastafari because it appears on the Imperial Ethiopian flag, used in Haile Selassie I's Ethiopia.  Marcus Garvey  Marcus Garvey, a native Jamaican, speaking on the topic of the creation of an African state for displaced Africans, told his followers to ‚Äúlook to the East Africa, for the crowning of the Black King.\\" This was also to influence the minds of the masses of black people from continuing to worship King George of England. Marcus Mosiah Garvey was referring to Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, the only remaining African Monarch of Biblical ancestry. However, some found a more literal interpretation. Among some of these were working class Jamaicans, who saw Garvey as a prophet, and more specifically the reincarnation of John the Baptist. Consequentially, when Ras Tafari of Ethiopia was crowned Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1930, many saw the prophecy fulfilled, and proclaimed King Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia Jah, or God. The movement has had strong cultural, social, and political effects on both Ethiopia and Jamaica, but to date, little scholarly research has been done on the effects of the movement on the United States of America. But this is not to say that such influences and affections do not exist in America, which many Rastafari see as the epitome of Babylon, and the hearth of all evil in the world. This does not stop Rastafari from immigrating to America, as a considerable influx of Jamaican Rastafari made the United States their new home during the 1960s and 1970s. The Rastafari movement played a vital role in the shaping of local United States society and culture, as was seen in the socio-cultural accomplishments of Marcus Garvey, the effects of localized Rastafari community building on the greater metropolitan area, and through the medium of Rastafari riddims, or reggae music. Adding to the idea that the United States is \\"Babylon\\" some American Rastas don't believe that the United States is Babylon due to the Revolutionary War against Britain. Marcus Garvey was one of the most influential elements of the Rastafari Movement on the United States. Marcus Mosiah Garvey Jr. was born into working class Jamaica on 17 August 1887. At the age of 13, Garvey was already learning to influence the masses through an internship at his grandfather's newspaper printing business in Jamaica. It was not long before Garvey began preaching his ideals of Black Nationalism, as well as political and economic independence. In 1910, the young prophet began to spread his messages to countries of Latin America, such as Panama and Costa Rica. In 1914, Garvey would find his way to the United States. These ideals would greatly influence American society for generations to come, and were seen as a prelude to the Civil Rights Movement.  The Universal Negro Improvement Association  Foremost, Marcus Garvey sought to organize blacks worldwide to give them an influential voice in society through overwhelming numbers. To do so, Garvey established the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which appealed to Negroes everywhere, calling for them to ‚Äúreorganize, link up (their) strength, morally, financially, educationally, and physically‚Äù. After failed attempts to create a following in Jamaica, Garvey relocated the UNIA to Harlem, in New York City, where membership grew rapidly and enthusiastically. By 1920, Garvey had over 2,000,000 members in over 1,000 local chapters of the UNIA. The UNIA had two principal goals: to establish black independence politically, and economically. Initially, Garvey came to America to preach his prophecy of Black Nationalism through Back to Africa movement. Under this action, displaced Africans would return to the land of their ancestors where they would create a prosperous African state, and lead Africa to become an influential world power. In 1924, with the financial assistance of the more than 2,000,000 members of the UNIA, Garvey sought to purchase 1 million acres (4000 km¬≤) of land from the African country of Liberia. This land would serve as the place of repatriation Garvey had spoken of for nearly two decades. However, only 11 days after Garvey agreed to purchase the land, Firestone Tires, with the aide of the US government, stole the land from under Garvey's nose. Firestone paid an unprecedented price to purchase what Garvey saw as his land. This was, effectively, the end of the back to Africa movement. Although the movement was essentially a failure, it deeply affected America by showing the power of the black community, effectively giving them an influential voice within society. It showed that blacks would not stand for white oppression, and had the ability to organize and fight back against corruption. Overall, the back to Africa movement showed that blacks had the power to pool together and play an active role in political affairs.  The Negro Factories Corporation  Instituted on January 20, 1920, the Negro Factories Corporation sought to create corporations which would employ only blacks, as well as produce commodities only sold to black consumers. As Marcus Garvey proclaimed himself: ‚ÄúNegro producers! Negro distributors! Negro Consumers!‚Äù Garvey's ideal of an all black economy that could eventually supply black consumers across the globe was not only ambitious, but to an extent also successful. Under Garvey's guidance, independent black grocery stores, restaurants, Laundromats, tailor shops, millinery stores, and publishing houses were created. The Negro Factories Corporation had vital impacts on the United States. It proved to society that blacks were economically able, and could operate successfully and independently as business men and entrepreneurs. More importantly, it gave blacks across the country initiative and hope, as well as the secular identity required to prosper in American society.  The Black Star Line  Marcus Garvey's most famous initiative of black societal reform came from the institution of the Black Star Line. Created as an offshoot of the Negro Factories Corporation, and designed to correlate with the Back to Africa movement, the Black Star Line was announced on June 23, of 1919. The Black Star Line was created as a shipping company that would link black communities in America, Jamaica, Canada, Central America, and Africa. Ideally, the Black Star Line would transport black labored goods, including raw materials and manufactured items, to black consumers across the globe. To purchase the company's first ship, as well as to get the shipping line to sea, Garvey had to raise $500,000, which he did though the sale of stocks to only blacks. This economic enterprise was so important to the black community, that over 15,000 spectators came to see the S.S. Fredrick Douglass take sail for its first trip to Jamaica. However, the company eventually folded in 1922, with net losses estimated to be over $1,000,000. But the Black Star Line still had profound effects on America, giving blacks the opportunity to invest in stock was new to the country, and thus gave them a modernized way of investing their money. Again, it proved that blacks could act as successful business men and contribute economically to America. The fact that the Black Star Line was an independent black movement showed that blacks were capable of organizing international businesses. The social and cultural results of the Black Star Line were unheard of in the 1920s, and consequently presented blacks with more economic and social opportunities than ever before.  Rastafari community building  With Rastafari unable to bring themselves to Zion until the day of repatriation, they decided to bring Zion to their home, which for more and more Rastafari was Babylon (the United States). As Jamaican Rastafari began to immigrate to the United States in the 1960s and 1970s, small, localized, and homogeneous Rastafari communities began to spring up across the country. Such communities appeared in Philadelphia, Boston, Hartford, Miami, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, and most notably New York City. Specifically in New York City, six different Rastafari communities exist in five different boroughs. Most influential of these communities are Crown Heights and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. Generally, the building of localized Rastafari communities occurs through the establishment of Rastafari Community centers, schools, tabernacles, as well as Rasta Culture Stores.  The process  All Rastafari communities must undergo the community building process, which begins small, and then grows larger. The initial part of the community consists of extremely small Rastafari centers, where Rastas go out of convenience, but not necessarily to congregate with other Rastafari. The goal of these centers is to bring Zion-like elements to their respective Exodus communities. Examples of such centers are smoking yards or weed gates, where Rastafari go to smoke ganja, or marijuana, which they believe purifies the soul and brings one closer to the Almighty Jah. Another example of such centers are Rastafari stores, such as supermarkets where Rastafari goods may be purchased. These stores range from ital foods stores, to reggae record stores, to specialized medical stores. The second level of community building occurs with the greater organization of Rastafari truly into a community. This often coincides with the creation of large churches, which provides the Rastafari with an organized and active community in which to carry out further Rasta evangelicalism. In Jamaican Rastafari practices, organized congregations are frowned upon, and finding Jah is seen as a personal passageway, but churches are essential for Rasta worship in America. These churches offer an array of opportunities, including Sunday schools for the youth, ‚Äúrastalogical‚Äù counseling, Ital cooking classes, sewing and knitting, craft building and language instruction courses. Additionally, churches provide public recognition of individual Rastafari, as well as the movement overall. All for one and one for all. Localized community building influenced America in the sense that they introduced the greater metropolitan area to the Rastafari community. American non-Rastas were welcome at Rastafari hang outs, such as dance halls or reggae record stores. By building a community, the individual Rastafari attained a sense of belonging and fellowship. These small pocket societies contributed to the growing diversity of American society, and thus helped to further establish America for what it was known: a cultural melting pot.  Reggae  Reggae was known in Jamaica as a popular dance move until 1968, when the Toots & the Maytals released their single ‚ÄúDo the Reggay‚Äù. From this point on, Reggae referred to a genre of music centered on a steady and regular beat played on a rhythm guitar, called the ‚Äúbang‚Äù, and biblical lyrics pertaining to Rastafari ideology. In Jamaica and around the world, reggae, and especially the music of Bob Marley, was used as a medium to bring about social and political change. This was seen in Zimbabwe‚Äôs independence movement in the 1980s, as Bob Marley‚Äôs hit song Zimbabwe is today seen as a second national anthem. But what is unique about reggae is that it rarely strays from its Rastafari roots‚Äîreggae lyrics have a universal Rastafari theme. Despite the fact that reggae has not always been as popular in America as in Jamaica, reggae music has deeply affected American culture, not only through the radio waves, but also through the ways of the Rasta man.  Bob Marley  Bob Marley was and is reggae music's most transcendent figure. He lived in Delaware briefly before returning to Jamaica to pursue his musical career, which was discernibly influenced by musical genres then popular in the US. Along with his band the Wailers, Marley was able to become the first international music star to rise to prominence from the 'Third World'. Although Marley was initially very popular in Jamaica for the better part of a decade with the Wailers being Jamaica's biggest stars for a much of that time, it was a slower climb to international fame for both Marley and Reggae music. The first two 'official' Wailers albums, 'Catch a Fire' and 'Burnin' received great critical acclaim, but sales were less than impressive. However, after the split of the original Wailers and the release of 'Natty Dread' in 1974 as well as the 1975 'Live\\" album, Marley's music and message began to take hold specifically in England (UK), where Bob Marley and The Wailers' two performances at the Lyceum Ballroom are regarded as two of the most influential concerts ever to take place in that country. In 1976, Bob Marley and The Wailers \\"Rastaman Vibration\\" LP cracked the American charts peaking at #8, as well as producing Marley's only Hot 100 single 'Roots Rock Reggae'. All of Marley's follow- up LPs with the exception of \\"Babylon by Bus\\" placed in the US Billboard Top 100, and his message only continued to grow, having a profound effect on a large element of American society, very specifically on white American society. Marley's 'Exodus' released in 1977 is considered his crossover LP placing at #15 and #20 on the Black Albums Chart and Billboard Chart respectively. Towards the later half of Bob Marley's career, his message began to pick up steam in America's black community, a segment of US society that had long remained impervious to the impact of Bob Marley and Reggae music. However, a series of legendary shows at Harlem's Apollo Theatre in 1979 coupled with the release of the militant Pan-African oriented 'Survival', as well as an appearance at the Amandla Festival in the same year, began to elevate Marley's reputation in the eyes of black America. By the time of Marley's passing in 1981, the Rastafari faith had developed progressively, e.g. in the creation of the 'Twelve Tribes' sect which Marley himself was a member of. In the US (as in other parts of the world) the music press played a crucial role for Rastafari to be heard, felt and seen. Even though it wasn't fully understood, and occasionally mocked or ridiculed, the Rastafari lifestyle was essentially (as far as the western press was concerned) indistinguishable from reggae music. The Rastafari faith or way of life remains largely misunderstood. However, as a result of Bob Marley's international reputation in life as well as his enormous posthumous success which only continues to grow, the Rastafari movement in the United States has multiplied considerably since Marley died in 1981. The influence of reggae music and its association with Rastafari reached a peak with the success of Rasta artists such as Marley, his wife Rita Marley, Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, and many others. The reputation of reggae music in general and Bob Marley in particular only continues to gain new respect among younger generations of appreciative fans and the Rastafari message has, along with this popularity, found its place alongside some of the world's great philosophies and ideologies. Even if Rastafari is not universally embraced, concepts of it are widely accepted and appreciated, due largely to the popularity of Bob Marley and reggae music. Marley is considered in many Rasta circles to be a prophet, and holds a similar standing with many people throughout the world who do not identify themselves as Rastafari.

Adopted in 1969 (hence the designation), it was ahead of its time with the use of synthetics and cold hammer-forged barrels for durability. Aside from being the Austrian Army's standard issue sniper rifle, it is also used by several law enforcement organizations. It is extremely accurate and several international competitions have been won using an SSG-69 with accuracy being sub 0.15 mrad (0.5 moa). There are several variants made with mostly cosmetic differences, the only anomaly being the SSG-PIV using a 409 mm barrel with a 1:250 mm (1:10 inches) twist designed to handle heavy subsonic ammunition in conjunction with a suppressor. The bolt action uses rear-locking lugs (in common with the SMLE), rather than the more common front-locking lugs. This, and the fact that it is only produced in the 'short action' length, limits the chambering to non- magnum calibres, a legacy of a military weapon designed only to fire the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge. It is essentially a target/police/military weapon, but with its caliber and inherent accuracy, it lends itself to hunting that requires longer distance shots.

The military complex has been converted into a museum of the Indonesian independence struggle which was opened in 1992. It is located in front of Gedung Agung and near the Kraton Yogyakarta (Sultan's Palace). History The Fortress Fort Vredeburg in the early 20th century. In 1760, after the foundation of the new Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat, the Dutch governor of North Java coast Nicolaas Harting requested a fort to be built in Yogyakarta. The barracks was built on a plot provided by Sultan Hamengkubuwono I, the first fort was a simple wooden fort with four bastions. Later in 1767 the fortress was extended and converted into a more permanent structure under supervision of a Dutch architect Frans Haak. After its completion in 1787 the fort was named Fort Rustenburg (\\"resting fort\\" in Dutch).Benteng Vredeburg, jogjatrip.com In 1867 the old fort was destroyed by an earthquake. The fort was rebuilt and renamed Fort Vredeburg, which in the Dutch language means \\"peace fort\\" due to peaceful co-existence of the fort and the Kraton of the Sultan. Later in 1942, during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the fortress was taken over by the Japanese army and made into the army's headquarters and war prison. After the Japanese left in 1945, Fort Vredeburg served the Indonesian Army as a military command post, barracks and prison for suspected members of the communist party. The museum In 1947 the ceremonies on honoring Budi Utomo's 40th founding anniversary was held in the fort. At the occasion, Ki Hadjar Dewantara expressed the idea of converting the fortress into a cultural institution. To realize this, a newly set up foundation took charge of the gradual restoration of the former fort. An agreement was concluded to have a cultural institution in the fort, between Daoed Joesoef, the Minister of Education and Culture and Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX in 1980. As a result, major renovation of the building took place in 1982. In 1984 Nugroho Notosusanto, the new Minister, changed the original plans and instead, created a museum intended to showcase Indonesia's struggle for independence. The museum was officially opened on 23 November 1992. Yogyakarta was devastated by an event that damaged a large number of buildings and cultural properties in the region, including the fort. It was repaired later afterwards. Exhibition The museum includes collections of old photographs, historical objects and replicas. A diorama portraying Indonesia's journey for independence is also displayed in the museum. The original design included 93 of these diorama showcases, however when the museum opened in 1992, only 30 of them were finished. Another 18 showcases have been added as of March 1996. All events depicted in the diorama's showcases took place in Yogyakarta and its surrounding region. The dioramas cover various events from the capture of Pangeran Diponegoro in 1830 to Sukarno's return to Jakarta in 1949. The dioramas are divided into 2 sections: one depicts remarkable events (33), such as the founding of Muhammadiyah or Taman Siswa; and another focusing on war and struggle (15) such as guerrilla warfare during the independence war.

Training at the Kingscliff club near the Queensland border, and coached by Greg Salter, Watson became Australian champion in the 50-metre backstroke in 1996. However, as it was not an Olympic event, he did not gain national selection until 1997, when he competed at the 1997 FINA Short Course World Championships in Gothenbu, Sweden. In 1998, he made his international long-course debut at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where he won a silver medal in the 100-metre backstroke and a gold medal in the medley relay. Josh was Australia's first male Backstroke World Champion when he won the 200m Backstroke at the 1999 FINA Short Course World Championships in Hong Kong. He also won bronze in the 100-metre backstroke at the 1999 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Sydney. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Watson swum the backstroke leg in the heats of the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, before being replaced by Matt Welsh in the team that trailed the United States team home in the final. Watson was also a finalist in the 100-metre backstroke, where he was narrowly beaten into fourth place. Watson continued to be selected in the same role (except for a self-imposed break in 2002) until the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, when he failed to qualify for the semifinals of the 100-metrebackstroke. This enabled him to collect a gold medal in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay at the 2001 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan.

The townlet rests at a bend on the Ros' River, some 16 kilometres from Korsun- Shevchenkivskyi, the district center. Population:  History  Situated on the Ros' River, water surrounds most of the historically settled areas of Stebliv, which is also protected by cliffs and natural ramparts. Given the evidence of Trypillian, Scythian, and Chernyakhov culture settlements, the area has been populated for quite some time, and was very often the site of fierce battles. In 1036, Yaroslav the Wise built a fortress at Strebliv which overlooked the southernmost lands of Rus, and it stood there until the eventual Mongol invasion. Stebliv was later settled by Cossacks who took part in several uprisings against the Polish rule of the territory, particularly the fateful Khmelnytsky Uprising. On March 15, 1648, Khmelnytsky's forces routed Polish forces who had taken a superior tactical position between Stebliv and Korsun. In 1664, hopelessly outnumbered by 20,000 Polish troops, which had an additional force of 15,000 Tatars in support, the residents of Stebliv advanced on their enemies and fought to their deaths; the town was destroyed after their defeat. Famous natives Stebliv was the birthplace of Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky, a prominent Ukrainian 19th-20th century writer; his original house has been preserved as a museum in Stebliv dedicated to his life and work. The famous Ukrainian dancer and choreographer Vasyl Avramenko was also born in Stebliv.

It is the only member of the genus Panterpe. This is a common to abundant bird of montane forest canopy above 1400 m, and also occurs in scrub at the woodland edges and clearings. This bird is 4.3 inches long and weighs .2 ounces. It has a straight black bill and dusky feet. The adult fiery- throated hummingbird has shiny green body plumage, a blue tail, and a white spot behind the eye. It often looks dark, but when the light catches it at the right angle, it shows a brilliant blue crown, yellow-bordered bright orange throat, and violet-blue chest patch. The genders are similar, but young birds have rufous fringes to the head plumage. The call is a high-pitched twittering. The female fiery-throated hummingbird is entirely responsible for nest building and incubation. She lays two white eggs in a bulky plant-fibre cup nest 2‚Äì4 m high at the end of a descending bamboo stem or on a rootlet under a bank. Incubation takes 15‚Äì19 days, and fledging another 20‚Äì26.

Set in New York City, the plot focuses on the paths of Slevin Kelevra (Hartnett), Lindsey (Liu), two feuding crime lords known as The Boss (Freeman) and The Rabbi (Kingsley), and a mysterious hitman known as Mr. Goodkat (Willis). It was the first Weinstein Company film to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Two bookies are separately ambushed and murdered by their unseen killers; elsewhere, a young man is killed by a sniper. In a bus terminal, a young man is approached by Goodkat, who tells the story of Max and the Kansas City Shuffle: two decades earlier, Max borrowed money from the mob to bet on a fixed horse race, only for the horse to die mid-race. To set an example to make sure nobody else would try to bet on a fixed race, the mob killed Max, his wife and young son Henry. Goodkat describes the \\"Kansas City Shuffle\\", a misleading double bluff, then tricks and kills the young man, taking the body in a truck. In New York City, Slevin Kelevra is staying in his friend Nick Fisher's apartment and, upon being visited by Nick's neighbor Lindsey, discusses Nick's disappearance and why his apartment was unlocked. Lindsey suggests that Nick may be missing and, after she leaves, Slevin is kidnapped by two henchmen, who take him to \\"The Boss\\". Mistaking Slevin for Nick, The Boss orders him to repay a large gambling debt or kill the son of his rival, \\"The Rabbi\\"; The Boss believes The Rabbi is responsible for assassinating his son (seen in the intro), and wants The Rabbi's homosexual son, Yitzchok \\"The Fairy\\", to be killed in revenge. Slevin returns to the apartment, but is kidnapped again, this time by two of The Rabbi's Jewish henchmen. Like the Boss, The Rabbi also mistakes Slevin for Nick, and also demands he repay a large gambling debt. Slevin tells The Boss he will kill The Fairy. Concurrently with Slevin visiting the mob bosses, it becomes apparent Goodkat is somehow involved in both sides and is responsible for Nick's debts being called in, and that he plans to kill Slevin after The Fairy dies and make it look like they both committed suicide. Slevin and Lindsey go out to dinner, where Slevin arranges a date with The Fairy. Slevin is approached by Detective Brikowski, who is investigating The Boss and The Rabbi. Brikowski, who used to bet big with one of the murdered bookies, has also been informed that Goodkat is back in town for the first time in twenty years and think there's a connection between The Boss, The Rabbi, Goodkat, and Slevin. The detective hassles him again later and Slevin reveals his full name. Slevin arrives for his date at The Fairy's apartment and fatally shoots him, only for Goodkat to appear. Rather than shoot Slevin, however, Goodkat finishes The Fairy, revealing Slevin and Goodkat are working together. Slevin then brings the bus terminal victim's body, revealed to be Nick Fisher, into the apartment while Goodkat kills The Fairy's bodyguards. Together, they blow up the apartment and the bodies, faking Slevin's death in the process. Goodkat and Slevin kidnap The Boss and The Rabbi, with both awakening restrained in The Boss's penthouse. Slevin appears and explains the overarching twist: Slevin is Henry, the son of the ill-fated Max, and the mobsters who killed Max were The Boss and The Rabbi. Goodkat is revealed as the assassin hired to kill young Henry, who after an attack of conscience took him in and raised him instead. Slevin reveals after twenty years later, he and Goodkat killed the mobsters' bookies and stole the ledgers in the process. After identifying Nick as owing a great deal of money to both sides, they killed him and stole his identity. Then Slevin murdered The Boss's son in order to get The Boss to contract Goodkat to murder The Rabbi's son in revenge. Goodkat took the contract to kill The Fairy from The Boss and convinced The Rabbi he'd protect The Fairy on the condition they both call in Nick's debts, granting Slevin and Goodkat unhindered access to the heavily guarded mobsters as their ally, under his Nick Fisher alias. After revealing his identity, Slevin suffocates The Rabbi and The Boss by taping plastic bags over their heads, killing them the same way they killed his father. Since Lindsey earlier photographed Goodkat while investigating Nick's disappearance, Goodkat shoots her to protect his identity. While Brikowski is hunting for Slevin he gets a phone call from his boss and learns the meaning of the pseudonym Slevin Kelevra: \\"Lucky Number Slevin\\" was the horse his father had bet on, and \\"Kelevra\\" is Hebrew for bad dog, mirroring Goodkat's name. It is revealed that Brikowski murdered Slevin's mother to pay his own gambling debts twenty years ago. As he hears this story Brikowski resigns himself to his fate as Slevin, showing real anger for the first time, appears in Brikowski's backseat and shoots him finishing his masterpiece of revenge. Sometime later at the bus terminal Slevin is met by Lindsey, and it is revealed that Goodkat's informed Slevin he had to murder Lindsey because she had a picture of him. It's also revealed around the same time that Slevin explained his true identity to Lindsey and helped fake her death. When Goodkat appears, aware of the trickery, Slevin explains he had to save Lindsey and didn't think Goodkat would understand. Since Goodkat had saved Slevin as a boy he states he understood and agrees to leave Lindsey alone. Goodkat gives Slevin back his father's old watch and then disappears into the crowd. Flash back twenty years to when Goodkat first spared young Henry, they drive away and Goodkat turns on the radio to a song titled \\"Kansas City Shuffle\\".

Rachel Saint was born in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. She attended the Philadelphia School of the Bible (now Cairn University) and then worked at the Keswick Colony of Mercy in New Jersey. Career Rachel Saint was sent out by the Wycliffe Bible Translators, trained by Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International). Her first missionary assignment was to the Piro and Shapira in Peru, but she had an interest in the Huaorani in Ecuador. In February 1955, she and Catherine Peeke went to a missionary station near Huaorani territory, where Rachel Saint's brother was working. Rachel Saint started learning the Huaorani language with the help of Dayuma, a Huaorani woman who had left her people after a dispute and was sheltered by missionaries. In January 1956, five missionaries in the area were killed by Huaorani people, including her brother Nate Saint, who had come to Ecuador in 1948. As a result, Rachel Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the tribe. In 1957, she embarked on a tour of the United States together with Dayuma, appearing with Billy Graham at Madison Square Garden and on Ralph Edwards' television show This Is Your Life. In the summer of 1958, Rachel Saint returned to the Huaorani in Ecuador and, together with Elisabeth Elliot, the wife of James (Jim) Elliot, who had been killed by the Huaorani, continued to evangelize. In February 1959, they were able to move into a Huaorani settlement. Where the five American men had failed to gain entrance into the Huaorani society, these two unarmed women (as well as Elliot's little daughter) were not perceived as a threat. Rachel continued in her labor to create a dictionary of the Huaorani language that she had begun before the death of the five missionaries. Criticism When criticism of Rachel Saint's actions at the missionary reservation emerged, in 1973, SIL sent the anthropologist James Yost to investigate. Yost had worked for more than ten years amongst the Huaorani. His report was highly critical of Saint's work and, in 1976, SIL ordered her to retire. Rachel Saint decided to leave the SIL, but to continue her work with the Huaorani. Rachel Saint went back to the US, raised funds and returned to Ecuador to work with the Huaorani. She also appears in Joe Kane's book, Savages, in which she is criticized for the negative effects her proselytizing allegedly had on the lifestyle of those Huaorani who chose to live in her village. Rachel Saint died in Quito from cancer on November 11, 1994. She was buried in To√±ampare, Ecuador, where she had lived with the Huaorani. Film * Trinkets and beads.

The film is based on the true story of the Strelzyk and Wetzel families, who on September 16, 1979, attempted to escape from East Germany to West Germany in a homemade hot air balloon, during the days of the Inner German border-era, when emigration to West Germany was strictly prohibited by the East German government. It was the final theatrical film directed by Delbert Mann. Plot The film opens with a brief summary of 1961's then-current conditions in East Germany and nature of the border zone, featuring stock footage such as Conrad Schumann's jump over barbed wire in Berlin as the Berlin Wall is being built. In April 1978, in the small town of P√∂√üneck, Thuringia, a teenager, Lukas Keller, attempts to escape East Germany by riding a bulldozer through the Inner German Border Zone. However, he is shot by automatic machine guns and left for dead by the guards; his family is informed while having a picnic with their friends, the Strelzyks and the Wetzels, and the entire Keller family are taken away by the police. Finally fed up with his life under the GDR regime, Peter Strelzyk proposes a daring plan to his friend G√ºnter Wetzel: they will build a balloon to carry themselves and their families (eight people total) over the border to West Germany. They purchase 1,255 square yards of taffeta (claiming it is for a camping club); G√ºnter sews the fabric together with a sewing machine in his attic and Peter experiments for months to construct a hot air balloon burner. Of course, they face setbacks: fires while trying to inflate the balloon, struggles to build a burner with sufficient power, extremely suspicious neighbors, and doubts about the plan's workability from G√ºnter's wife, Petra. Eventually, Peter and G√ºnter then stop seeing each other, to avoid suspicion for when the Strelzyks escape. Peter and his eldest son, Frank, complete the burner and, after extensive testing, manage to inflate the balloon. On July 3, 1979, the four members of the Strelzyk family attempt to fly out. They successfully take off, though they are spotted by the border guard (who do not know what to make of it); however, a cloud dampens the balloon and the burner, and they crash within the border zone, only a few hundred feet from the fences, and the balloon floats away. Miraculously, they escape the zone, return to their car and drive home. Meanwhile, the border guard finds the balloon and the Stasi, led by Major Koerner (played by G√ºnter Meisner), begins an investigation to find whoever built it, so they can prevent them from trying again. Initially distraught over his failure, Peter is convinced by his sons to try again, as they did fly and no one was hurt, and now the Stasi will stop at nothing to find them. Peter convinces G√ºnter to help him and both families begin work on a larger balloon to carry them all out. Petra agrees to go with the plan, especially since her mother in West Berlin is very sick. Having identified the initial launch area, the Stasi begins closing in on P√∂√üneck. The Strelzyks and Wetzels purchase smaller quantities of taffeta from various stores to avoid suspicion, but they are running out of time. In one scene, Peter tries to buy taffeta, claiming it is for his group of Young Pioneers; the manager leaves him to notify the Stasi, prompting Peter to leave the store. They eventually finish the balloon, but have no time to test it. On September 15, 1979, the families prepare to move out while the Stasi finds blood pressure medicine belonging to Peter's wife, Doris, at the place where the first balloon initially landed. They contact the pharmacy and run through all the people whom the medicine is prescribed to, eventually coming to Doris. Their neighbor (a member of the Stasi) identifies them as acting suspiciously; the families leave only minutes before the Stasi arrives at their homes. They reach their launch point while the border is placed on emergency alert. The balloon is inflated and the burner is lit. Both families climb into the balloon's basket and cut their ropes. A fire is started in the cloth, but it is quickly put out by G√ºnter and they later see a hole in the balloon and hope it will hold. As they fly over, the balloon is spotted and Koerner pursues them in a helicopter. Eventually, the burner runs out of propane and they descend; the border guard is mobilized to find them. The balloon lands in a clearing, with all eight people unharmed. Peter and G√ºnter scout to find out where they are. They are found by a police car. Peter asks if they are in the West; puzzled, the police officer says \\"Of course you are\\". Overjoyed, Peter and G√ºnter light their signal flare. The families all then happily embrace each other over the amazing success of their journey.

After 131 years as an independent entity, in 2000 MEETH affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital, a 652-bed acute care hospital, established in New York City in 1857 and located at 77th Street (between Park and Lexington Avenues) in Manhattan. MEETH is recognized in medical circles for its long history of contributions in developing the fields of ophthalmology, otolaryngology and plastic surgery. MEETH provides thousands of patients a year with treatment in its ambulatory surgery facilities. History Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital was granted a charter from the New York Legislature to found a voluntary, non- profit Eye and Ear hospital on May 9, 1869. The hospital was founded based on the purpose \\"to alleviate the suffering of the poor and the cultivation and diffusion of sound knowledge of all that relates to the diseases of the eye and ear.\\" The founders of this institution included prominent citizens of the time and pioneers in the field of medicine and surgery, a group of 17 men: including 14 laymen and 3 physicians. They hoped to help those afflicted by impaired vision and hearing. On October 15, 1869, Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital was opened in a rented brownstone at 233 East 34th Street. The Hospital, which had 13 beds and an outpatient clinic, was supported primarily through charitable donations and no provision was made for private patients. Patients were asked to pay what they could, if they could, and most of them were not able to pay anything. However, the space was not adequate to accommodate the large number of patients seeking medical help there. In the first 14 months of its existence, the hospital treated 1,717 patients, and 294 operations were performed in its quarters. Efforts were initiated almost immediately to raise funds for a larger, more suitable and permanent facility. The first permanent facility of Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital was located on Park Avenue and 41st Street and was completed and opened on October 3, 1881. This 75-bed Hospital quickly became a nationally recognized center for the treatment of Eye, Ear and Throat diseases and by the late 1800s patients were coming from across the United States seeking the specialized care provided by the physicians at Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital. With the number of patients increasing substantially each year, it was not long before the facilities of Manhattan Eye and Ear on Park Avenue became overburdened. On November 1, 1906, the Hospital moved to new quarters at 210 East 64th Street. The seven story building, which served as the Hospital's primary inpatient facility for the next 76 years, is still in use, currently housing the outpatient department and administrative offices. The Annex on 63rd Street was completed in 1917, increasing the Hospital's working capacity by 30%. In 1925, three floors were added to the main hospital building on East 64th Street. In the ensuing years, many renovation projects were undertaken to upgrade and improve this facility. However, by the late 1970s the Hospital was inadequate to accommodate the 10,000 inpatients and the nearly 100,000 outpatients treated annually, and plans were initiated for a new seven floor addition to the Hospital's complex. In addition to totally replacing the Hospital's inpatient facilities and surgical suites, the new building allowed expansion of research programs. Many world-renowned physicians have been associated with MEETH, including its founders Cornelius Agnew and Daniel B. St. John Roosa, Charles Kelman, Lawrence Yannuzzi, David Gilbert Yates. In 1999 the Board of Directors of MEETH adopted a plan to sell the real estate on East 64th Street, terminate its residency program and close all hospital functions. case summary The Supreme Court of New York County denied the petition associated with this plan, finding instead that the closure was not proper and not the only available alternative. Subsequently, in 2000 the MEETH instead affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital in a merger in which no money was exchanged according to press reports.\\"Deal Struck to Save Upper East Side Hospital\\" New York Times, January 15, 2000 In January, 2004 Olivia Goldsmith, a novelist, died at MEETH after elective facial surgery \\"Looks to Die For\\" by Ralph Gardner Jr., 2/16/2004, New York Magazine and in February, 2004, another patient (Susan Malitz) died at MEETH during a face-lift. Both incidents attracted national attention at the time.\\"Struck Twice\\" by Beth Landman, 3/8/2004, New York Magazine Medical specialties Today, Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is a center for postgraduate training of ophthalmologists, otolaryngologists and plastic surgeons. Ophthalmology ‚Äì eye care Medical care is provided for the diagnosis and treatment of afflictions of the eye, including issues such as cataracts, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.

He has served on Gonzaga's coaching staff since 1989, and has been a constant on the sidelines throughout a period that has seen the Bulldogs rise from mid-major obscurity to consistent NCAA Tournament contenders. He has led the Bulldogs to the NCAA Tournament in every season during his tenure as head coach, a stretch that has garnered the Bulldogs recognition as a major basketball power despite playing in a mid-major conference. Biography Early life and education Few was born in Creswell, Oregon, the son of a Presbyterian pastor, and was a star point guardWithers, BraveHearts, p. 52. at Creswell High School, graduating in 1981. He originally attended Linfield College, hoping to play basketball and baseball, but he was troubled by the after effects of a dislocated shoulder he suffered while playing football as a senior at Creswell.Withers, BraveHearts, pp. 52-53. He then transferred to the University of Oregon, hoping to play baseball there, but the Ducks had dropped their varsity baseball program by the time he arrived in Eugene. He graduated from Oregon with a B.S. in physical education in 1987. Coaching career =Assistant coach= Few entered the coaching profession even before receiving his degree, serving as an unpaid part-time assistant at his alma mater of Creswell High School starting in 1983, and advancing to a paid position from 1986 to 1988.Withers, BraveHearts, p. 53. During this time, he also worked at Oregon's summer basketball camps. After a season as an assistant at another Oregon school, Sheldon High School in Eugene, he moved to Spokane, Washington, joining the Gonzaga staff as a graduate assistant in 1989 under Dan Fitzgerald.Withers, BraveHearts, p. 42.Gonzaga lists his first season as 1990, but both its official basketball website and basketball media guide consistently refer to seasons by the calendar year in which they end. He had some familiarity with the program, as he had befriended Dan Monson, then a Gonzaga assistant and later the head coach, during his time working the Oregon basketball camps. In 1990, he was promoted to a full-time assistant. As an assistant, Few helped lead Gonzaga to its first four postseason appearances‚Äîthe 1994, 1996, and 1998 National Invitation Tournaments and the 1995 NCAA Tournament. In April 1999, Monson, who had just finished his second year as Gonzaga head coach, promoted Few to associate head coach. This was immediately following the season in which Gonzaga became the nation's basketball darlings, making a run through the NCAA tournament, defeating Minnesota, Stanford, and Florida, to advance to the Elite Eight. In the West Regional finals Gonzaga lost to eventual national champions UConn by five points. When Monson left in late July to take the open head coaching job at Minnesota, Few, who had been designated as Monson's successor, was promoted to head coach. =Head coach= Taking over after Monson's abrupt departure, Few was able to maintain the Gonzaga program's success from his very first season and prevent the Bulldogs from being a one-year wonder and sinking back into obscurity. He led them into the NCAA Sweet Sixteen each of the first two years. He was only the second head coach in the nation to achieve this feat since the NCAA tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The following year (2001‚Äì02), Few set an all-time record for NCAA Division I men's coaches by collecting 81 wins in his first three years as a head coach. The record stood until 2010 when Brad Stevens of Butler surpassed it. In 2017, Mark Few became the 3rd fastest coach to reach 500 wins in NCAA Division I history. The program's success has continued as Gonzaga has made the NCAA tournament in every one of Few's 21 completed seasons; indeed, he has been on hand for every postseason appearance in school history. The Bulldogs have also advanced to the WCC Tournament title game in every season during Few's tenure. The Zags have won their way to every WCC Tournament championship game since 1998, and all but one since 1995. With Few as head coach, the Gonzaga program produced its first five first-team All-Americans in Dan Dickau, Adam Morrison, Kelly Olynyk, Nigel Williams-Goss, and Rui Hachimura. All five have played in the NBA, along with Richie Frahm, Blake Stepp, Mario Kasun, Ronny Turiaf, Austin Daye, Jeremy Pargo, Robert Sacre, Elias Harris, David Stockton, Domantas Sabonis, Kyle Wiltjer, Zach Collins, Johnathan Williams, Brandon Clarke, and Zach Norvell. Few was named the West Coast Conference Coach of the Year for six consecutive seasons (2001 through 2006). The 2006‚Äì07 season may well have been one of his better coaching jobs, as the team faced what could be called a \\"perfect storm\\": *Adam Morrison, a first-team All-America in 2005-06, chose to leave Gonzaga for the NBA with a year of eligibility left. *The Zags played an especially brutal nonconference schedule, with no fewer than nine opponents that would make the NCAA tournament. *The team's second-leading scorer and leading rebounder in 2006‚Äì07, Josh Heytvelt, was suspended after being arrested on drug charges in February 2007, and did not play again during the season. The Zags ended the regular season at 21‚Äì10, their first season with double digits in losses since 1997‚Äì98, which was also the last season to date in which they failed to make the NCAA tournament. It had generally been thought that Gonzaga would have to win the WCC tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. However, Gonzaga would go on to win the conference tournament, notably beating a Santa Clara team in the final that had earlier handed the Zags their first home-court loss in nearly four years. They would go out in the first round of the NCAA tournament to Indiana. A year later, despite losing to San Diego in the conference title game, the Bulldogs garnered an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament. On March 21, 2009, Few notched his 254th win as Gonzaga's head coach with a second-round victory in the NCAA Tournament, passing his former boss Fitzgerald as the winningest coach in school history. During the 2012-13 season, Few led the Bulldogs to the #2 ranking in both major polls, the highest national ranking at the time in school history. Few broke that record a week later when the Bulldogs surged to #1 in both polls for the first time. It was also the first time a WCC school had ascended to the top spot since San Francisco in 1977. Gonzaga went on to receive its first #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament in school history, as well as a then school record 32 wins. During the 2014-15 season, Few led the Zags back to the #2 ranking in both major polls, along with a then school record 22-game winning streak. Few guided Gonzaga to a #2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, his first Elite Eight appearance as head coach, and a then school record 35 wins. In 2016-17, Few led the Zags to arguably their greatest season in school history. They stormed through the regular season, starting with a school record 29-game winning streak, which also broke the record for consecutive wins to start a season. By February, they had surged back to #1 in the polls. The winning streak and #1 ranking were lost when the Bulldogs lost to BYU on February 25. As it turned out, it would be the Bulldogs' only loss of the regular season. Gonzaga went on to receive a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the second time in school history, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time in school history, losing to North Carolina in the National Championship. The Zags set a new school record with 37 wins, which was also tied for the second-most wins in NCAA Division I history. They also made the deepest NCAA Tournament run by a WCC team since San Francisco reached three consecutive Final Fours from 1955 to 1957. Mark Few was named as the National Coach of the Year in 2016-17 by the Associated Press, Naismith, and the USBWA, awarded with the Henry Iba Award. In 2018-19, Mark Few's #3 Gonzaga defeated #1 Duke 89-87 in the Maui Invitational final to beat Duke for the first time and to beat a top ranked team for the first time in team history. National team career Few was the head coach of the United States national team at the 2015 Pan American Games, where he led the US to a bronze medal. In 2019, Few was elected as the assistant coach of the national select team, a 13-player squad which helps the national team train. He helped the national team prepare for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Personal life Few and his wife Marcy, married by his father in 1994, have three sons and one daughter. They have organized a charity golf tournament under the Coaches vs. Cancer umbrella. Since the tournament began in 2002, it has raised over $1 million for the American Cancer Society. Few is an avid fly fisherman. He has chosen to stay at Gonzaga in part to provide stability for himself and his family, turning away coaching offers from larger schools over the years.

They are usually set up as not-for-profit trusts, and have as their goal the improvement of their population's health. History In the early 1990s, general practitioners (GPs) were joining together to form independent practitioner associations. They did this to better negotiate with the purchasers of healthcare at that time. Prior to the introduction of PHOs, general practitioners were paid using a fee-for-service model. For every person that went through their door, the GP received a set amount of money from the New Zealand Government. For some time, the Government had been trying to introduce a capitation model, that is, give practices a set amount of money depending on the population they served. The formation of the voluntary IPAs gave the Government an important stepping stone to introduce capitation-based funding. The Ministry of Health introduced PHOs under the Primary Health Care Strategy to replace the independent practitioner association system in 2001, and the first PHOs formed in July 2002.Ministry of Health. Primary health organisations (PHOs). Retrieved 16 January 2011. By May 2008, 82 PHOs had been established and authorised. More than half have since merged with other PHOs or otherwise ceased operation, and 31 PHOs operated as of July 2019.Ministry of Health. Primary health organisations (PHOs). Retrieved 28 July 2019. Structure and goals A primary health organisation is structured as a not- for-profit organisation with both community and provider representation. They maintain a list of their enrolled populations for which they receive funding. PHOs include general practitioners, nurses, and other health providers such as pharmacists and physical therapists. Funding Primary health organisations are allocated funds depending on the characteristics of their enrolled population (a form of capitation). The PHO receives a set amount of money from the district health board for every member, depending on their age, sex, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. They are also allocated funds for health promotion, individuals with special care requirements, as well as for rural practice. Health care providers that are part of PHOs also have the right to charge fees to their patients for each visit. PHOs may also receive funding through contracting with the Ministry of Health, district health boards or other organisations such as Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Usually these contracts are to provide specific services or to pass on additional subsidies to target patient groups (over and above ordinary capitation subsidies). This policy costs the Government more money to implement, and the expected proportion of each GP visit paid by the Government is higher than it has been previously.

It was staffed entirely by technocrats who reported directly to the Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. The significance of the National Resources Commission stemmed from the leading role it played in industrial development during the two decades of Kuomintang \\"tutelage\\" over China. The National Resources Commission was secretly formed as the National Defense Planning Commission (ÂúãÈò≤Ë®≠Ë®àÂßîÂì°ÊúÉ) in 1932 in Nanjing with a staff of fifty technical experts to plan industrial mobilization in preparation for the Second Sino-Japanese War. The immediate catalyst for the formation of the National Defense Planning Commission was the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Its immediate goal was to design and implement defense-related industries to make China self-sufficient in impending war with Japan. The National Defense Planning Commission was renamed the National Resources Commission in 1935 to reflect its role beyond defense-related industries. It soon grew into a large bureaucracy that was involved in managing a large state-owned industrial sector and in coordinating foreign trade. By 1947, it had a staff of 33,000 who supervised 230,000 workers, mostly in public enterprises. Due mainly to the nationalization major industries by the Nationalist Government, the NRC would gain control of 70% of Chinese industry. The National Resources Commission was particularly interested in surveying and exploiting natural minerals and ores, and succeeded in importing entire industrial plants and sending its personnel to train abroad. The engineers of the National Resources Commission were influenced by Sun Yat-sen's Industrial Development and tied the need for economic \\"reconstruction\\" with national defense. The NRC successfully moved major industries into the Chinese interior when the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Chongqing. To supply the government-controlled areas with electricity, the NRC proposed to build the Three Gorges Dam (the National Defense Planning Commission had made the first ever engineering survey of the site in 1932), though the project would not come to fruition until the 1990s. At the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the staff of the NRC was split. A portion of the NRC stayed in mainland China to work under the new People's Republic of China, while the rest fled to Taiwan with the KMT. A number of former NRC engineers rose to top government posts in Taiwan, including one premier (Sun Yun-suan) and eight ministers of economic affairs. In contrast, many NRC leaders who stayed behind in mainland China later found themselves persecuted during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Cultural Revolution for having been a part of the old order. The Republic of China government on Taiwan abolished the NRC in 1952. It functions were overtaken by the Council on U.S. Aid and the Industrial Development Commission.

The ancient temple is dedicated to god Vishnu. Its fame is credited to the legend of god Shiva‚Äôs marriage to goddess Parvati witnessed by Vishnu at this venue and is thus a popular Hindu pilgrimage sites. A special feature of this temple is a perpetual fire, that burns in front of the temple. The flame is believed to burn from the times of the divine marriage. Thus, the temple is also known as Akhand Dhuni temple. The temple courtyard is also the source of a water stream, which fills three sacred bathing ponds (kunds) nearby. Etymology The word \\"Triyugi Narayan\\" is formed of three words \\"tri\\" means three, \\"yugi\\" denotes the period of time ‚Äì Yuga and \\"Narayan\\" is another name of Vishnu. Pilgrims have been offering wood to the fire in the havana-kund (fireplace) since the three Yugas ‚Äì hence the place is given the name \\"Triyugi Narayan\\". Yuga in Hindu philosophy is the name of an epoch or era within a cycle of four ages. The four Yugas are Satya Yuga (1,728,000 human years), Treta Yuga (1,296,000 years), the Dvapara Yuga (864,000 years) and finally Kali Yuga (432,000 years), which is the present Yuga. The name \\"Akhand Dhuni temple\\" also originates from the eternal flame legend, \\"Akhand\\" means perpetual and \\"Dhuni\\" means flame. Legend Wall carvings in Ellora Caves- A scene depicting the wedding of Shiva (four armed figure, right) and Parvati (two armed, left). According to Hindu dharma, goddess Parvati was daughter of Himavat or Himavan ‚Äì the personification of the Himalayas. She was the rebirth of Sati, the first wife of Shiva ‚Äì who sacrificed her life when her father insulted Shiva. Parvati initially tried to allure Shiva by her beauty, but fails. Finally, she won Shiva by practising rigorous penance at Gauri Kund, which is away from Triyuginarayan. Pilgrims visiting Triyuginaryan temple also visit the Gauri Kund temple, dedicated to Parvati, which is the base camp for trek to Kedarnath Temple.Gauri Kund Mythology states that Shiva proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi, before they got married in the small Triyuginarayan village at the confluence of Mandakini and Sone-Ganga rivers. Triyuginarayan is believed to be the capital of Himavat. It was the venue of the celestial marriage of Shiva and Parvati, during the Satya Yuga, witnessed in the presence of the holy fire that still burns eternally in front of the temple in a Havana-kund or Agni-kund, a four-cornered fireplace on the ground. Vishnu formalised the wedding and acted as Parvati's brother in the ceremonies, while the creator-god Brahma acted as the priest of the wedding, that was witnessed by all the sages of the times. The exact location of the wedding is marked by a stone called Brahma Shila, in front of the temple. The greatness of this place is also recorded in a sthala-purana (a scripture specific to a pilgrimage centre). According to the scripture, pilgrims who visit this temple consider the ashes from the burning fire as holy and carry it with them. It is also believed that ashes from this fire are supposed to promote conjugal bliss. Before the marriage ceremony, the gods are believed to have taken bath in four kunds or small ponds namely, Rudra-kund, Vishnu-kund and Brahma-kund. The inflow into the three kunds is from the Saraswati-kund, which ‚Äì according to legend ‚Äì originated from Vishnu's navel. Hence, the water of these kunds is considered to cure infertility. The ashes from Havana-kund are supposed to promote conjugal bliss. Structure The Triyuginarayan temple resembles the temple of Kedarnath in architectural style and hence attracts a lot of devotees. The present shrine is also called as Akhand Dhuni temple. It is believed to have been built by Adi Shankaracharya. Adi Shankaracharya is credited with building many temples in the Uttarakhand region. The shrine houses a silver, 2-foot image of god Vishnu (Narayana), accompanied with consort ‚Äì goddess of wealth Lakshmi and the goddess of music and learning ‚Äì Saraswati. In front of the temple, the havana-kund with the eternal flame - the witness of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati - is situated. Devotees add samidha (sacrificial offerings of wood) to the flame and collect the ashes as blessings. A stone called the Brahma Shila ‚Äì in front of temple ‚Äì is regarded as the exact spot of the divine marriage. A water stream called Saraswati Ganga originates in the courtyard of the temple. It fills all the holy ponds in the vicinity. The ponds of Rudra Kund, Vishnu Kund, Brahma Kund and Saraswati Kund are holy spots situated near the temple.Rudra Kund is for bathing, Vishnu for cleansing, Brahma for sipping and Saraswati for offering libations. Triyuginarayan Temple ‚Äì OCT 2014 Pic1 Triyuginarayan Temple ‚Äì OCT 2014 Pic2 Geography The Triguninarayan village is located at an altitude of about away from Sonprayag, the confluence of Mandakini and Songanga rivers. The geographical belt is away from Sonprayag that extends to between Triyugninarayan and Toshi villages with an average altitude of that has favourable agro-climatic conditions for growing horticultural crops such as apple and stone fruits. During the three winter months, the area is covered by snow. Access Access to the Triyuginarayan village where the temple is located is about from Sonprayag on motorable road till the temple. There exist a few trek routes too, like a short trek of via Sonprayag on the Ghuttur ‚ÄìKedarnath bridle path that passes through thick forest area is involved to reach the temple precincts. From Kedarnath, which is to the south of this temple the total trekking distance is about . Ghuttur is around from Sonprayag, which is connected by road with Haridwar and other important hill stations of the Garhwal and Kumaon Hills. The nearest airport is Dehra Dun, from Triyuginarayan, but it is better to start the journey from Delhi. Rishikesh is the nearest railway station, from the site. The Triguninarayan temple is also accessed by trekking. A popular trekking or excursion route followed is from Mussoorie. The trek route followed from Mussorie, which involves 17 days of trekking, passes through Tehri, Mala (road point), Belak, Budakedar-Ghuttu-Panwali Kanta, Triyuginarayan and Kedarnath in that order. Apart from this trekking route, the Department of Tourism, Government of Uttarakhand, to encourage tourism has identified and developed six major circuits, which includes the Rudraprayag‚ÄìKedarnath circuit, covering temples at Rudraprayag, Tungnath, Okhimath, Madhyamaheshwar, Guptkashi, Triyuginarayan and Kedarnath, along the Mandakini River valley.

Income tax In the Netherlands, residents pay income tax on their worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on income sourced in the Netherlands only. Income tax is collected by Tax and Customs Administration. For purposes of determining income tax, income is divided into the following three categories, so called boxes:  Box 1: income from work and home ownership  A progressive tax rate with two tax brackets applies to income in Box 1. In the past, there were four brackets, the highest of which was 72%, but in 1990 it was changed to 60%, and in 2001 it became 52%. The four bracket-system was changed to a two bracked- system in 2020, with the lower incomes taxed for 37.35% and the higher incomes for 49.50%. Certain expenditures, referred to as personal allowances, can be deducted from income prior to tax calculation. Examples of personal allowances are donations to eligible charities, maintenance costs, medical or study expenses. Taxpayers above the official retirement age are entitled to a reduced tax rate.  Box 2: financial interest in a company  A flat tax rate of 25% applies to income from substantial interest in a company. A substantial interest in a company is defined as owning at least 5% of its shares, options or profit-sharing certificates; either by the taxpayer themselves or together with their tax partner.  Box 3: savings and investment  Box 3 concerns income from wealth. Wealth is calculated as value of assets (such as savings or shares) minus any debts. Income from wealth is taxed at a 30% rate. For tax purposes, a fixed return on savings and investments is presumed, based on the average distribution of Box 3 assets (capital mix). Presumed gains are calculated each year based on market returns realized in the past. A tax allowance on capital yields is provided. For income taxes, tax year is equivalent to calendar year. Tax return shall be submitted before May 1 of the subsequent year. Married couples shall submit a joint assessment, except for the case when a divorce petition has been filed. Value added tax The value added tax system follows EU regulation. For value added tax there are three categories: foods and essentials, non-foods and luxuries, and special goods. These three categories have rates of 9%, 21%, and 0%, respectively. The non-foods and luxuries percentage was increased from 19% to 21% on 1 October 2012, while the foods and essentials percentage was increased from 6% to 9% percent on 1 January 2019. The special goods cover: * Goods that are exported * Goods that haven't been introduced yet * Catch of Fish * Excised goods * International transport of people  Import VAT  Unlike in some other member states of the EU, the Dutch tax regime allows deferral of import VAT payment. Instead of conducting payment at the time when goods are imported to the EU, the VAT payment may be deferred to periodic VAT return. The import VAT needs to be reported; however, as the amount may be deducted from the corresponding period VAT return, the deferral can prevent cash flow disadvantage arising from paying import VAT immediately at time of import to the EU. Corporate tax Generally, private and public companies with Dutch residency are subject to corporate income tax on their worldwide income. Corporate tax rate is based upon taxable amount, which equals taxable profit in the corresponding year minus deductible losses. In 2018, for taxable amount below ‚Ç¨200,000, a 20% tax rate was applicable. Taxable amount of ‚Ç¨200,000 and above was taxed at a 25% tax rate. The corporate tax rates are both due to decrease by 1 percentage point in 2019, 1.5 percentage point in 2020 and further 1.5 percentage point in 2021; resulting in a 16% tax rate in the first bracket and 21% tax rate in the second bracket. Corporate tax year is equivalent to calendar year unless stated otherwise in the company‚Äôs articles of association. Tax year typically follows a 12-month period; deviations are possible in the first year of incorporation.  Innovation box  To foster innovation research, an innovation box provides tax relief for innovative activities. Profits derived from self-developed intellectual property (including royalties) that qualify for the innovation box are subject to a reduced tax rate. Since January 1, 2018, the effective tax rate applicable to corporate income in the innovation box is 7%. This feature of the tax framework provides a notable tax incentive for research and development activities in the Netherlands.  Substantial holding exemption  If qualified for a substantial holding exemption, a parent company is fully exempt from paying tax on the dividends and capital gains it receives from a subsidiary. Substantial holding is defined as holding at least 5% of shares in the subsidiary. The subsidiary concerned may have both Dutch or non- Dutch residency; the equal tax treatment allows non-Dutch subsidiaries to better compete with local ones. Substantial holding exemption prevents double corporate taxation of profits. This feature of the tax regime makes the Netherlands an attractive location for European headquarters. To qualify for substantial holding exemption, at least one of three conditions (tests) must be met: # Motive test: shareholding in the subsidiary does not serve as a mere portfolio investment. # Effective tax rate test: according to Dutch tax standards, a reasonable effective tax rate is applicable to the subsidiary (that is, an effective tax rate of at least 10%). # Asset test: less than 50% of total assets of the subsidiary are low-taxed free portfolio investments.  Tax groups with subsidiaries  In the Netherlands, a parent company and one or more of its subsidiaries may form a tax group if certain conditions are met: Primarily, the parent company shall hold at least 95% of shares in the subsidiary. Moreover, the parent company and the subsidiary need to be established in the Netherlands, follow the same financial year and apply the same accounting policies. Members of a tax group are treated as a single taxpayer by tax authorities. Key advantages of fiscal unity are that losses incurred by one company may be deducted from profits generated by other members of the group, and that fixed assets may be transferred between companies without corporate income tax consequences. Property tax Property tax or land value tax is claimed annually by municipalities. A fraction of the value of real estate (about a per mille) is defined as onroerendezaakbelasting (OZB). The money collected from the real-estate owners in its area can be used by the municipality to maintain the infrastructure (roads etc.). The real- estate values are estimated independently and updated annually. Taxation varies dramatically over different regions and municipalities. In addition to the property tax itself, there is a complicated additional taxation system for different infrastructural support systems: water-level management, water cleaning, waste management etc. Property tax does not belong to personal allowances deductible for income tax purposes. Inheritance tax The inheritance tax (successierecht) charges beneficiaries of an inheritance received from Dutch residents. In case of emigration, Dutch nationals are considered Dutch residents for further 10 years. Inheritance tax rate ranges from 10% to 40%. A part of inheritance is exempt from taxation; the amount exempted depends on the relationship of beneficiary to the deceased person. Wealth tax Possessions like savings, shares, houses that are not the primary living etc. are taxed when a tax payer (filing single) has more than ‚Ç¨ 30,360 (this is the amount for 2019). For couples, this tax-free amount is double. Consumer goods like cars and furniture, that are not held as an investment, are excluded. The tax rate comes in tiers, and the following numbers are for 2019 and will be updated in future years: it is a 0.58% tax for ‚Ç¨ 30,361 to ‚Ç¨ 102,010 of assets, 1.34% for ‚Ç¨ 102,010 to ‚Ç¨ 1,020,096 and 1.68% on any euros of assets above ‚Ç¨ 1,020,096. Gift tax The gift tax (schenkingsrecht) charges the beneficiary of a gift.

The equestrian events for the 1956 Games, however, were held in Stockholm, Sweden, five months earlier, due to Australian quarantine regulations, and three Egyptian riders competed in the show jumping events. None of the athletes won individual medals and they failed to place in the team competition due to one rider's failure to finish the individual tournament. Background Prior to 1956, Egypt had sent athletes to six editions of the Summer Olympic Games and the 1906 Intercalated Games.The 1912 Olympic report lists Egypt as having sent a fencer to those Games, but there is uncertainty as to whether he actually competed. Egypt, along with Iraq and Lebanon, boycotted the 1956 Games, held in Melbourne, Australia, in protest of Britain and France's involvement in the Suez Crisis, as they supported Israel's invasion of Egypt in an attempt to regain control over the recently nationalized Suez Canal. The equestrian events, however, were held several months earlier than the rest of the Games in Stockholm, Sweden, due to Australian horse quarantine regulations that prevented them from being held in Melbourne. This allowed three Egyptian equestrians to compete at the 1956 Olympics. Equestrian Show jumping Egypt's three riders, Omar El-Hadary on Auer, Gamal Haress on Nefertiti II, and Mohamed Selim Zaki on Inch'Allah, all competed both individually and as part of the a team in the jumping events. Zaki and Haress were veterans of the 1952 Summer Olympics and would go on to represent the United Arab Republic at the 1960 edition. They finished ninth and joint-21st (with Andrey Favorsky) respectively in the 1956 individual jumping tournament. El-Hadary, in his only Olympic appearance, failed to finish the second round, which also led to Egypt not being placed in the team competition.

He was arrested in Afghanistan in 2004 while documenting the exploits of a vigilante group led by U.S. mercenary Jonathan \\"Jack\\" Idema. Caraballo was implicated as an associate of Idema and was charged with entering the country illegally (later dropped), running a private prison, and torture. He was sentenced to an eight-year prison term (later reduced on appeal to two years) and incarcerated in Afghanistan's Pul-e-Charkhi prison. Throughout his trial and imprisonment, Caraballo insisted that he was not involved in the alleged torture, and that he was officially embedded in what he believed was a legitimate military operation. While in prison, Caraballo sought to distance himself from Idema and eventually converted to Islam. He has said his conversion was initially a survival tactic in prison in order to gain the respect of Afghan inmates. There was at least one attempt on his life while he was incarcerated and that he was almost lynched during a prison riot started by other inmates with suspected links to the Taliban and al Qaeda. Caraballo used a satellite phone to call CNN journalist Anderson Cooper as the riot was occurring to say his life was in danger. One prison official, claiming that Caraballo was \\"never in danger\\" during the riot despite threats made against him, questioned why he refused to accept offers of protection and emerge from his cell. However, Caraballo has emphatically stated that he refused to leave the relative security of his cell because of the chaotic and dangerous situation still happening inside cellblock. Still, Caraballo managed to make peace with one of the prisoners who he said had tried to seize the prison and helped teach a few inmates and guards some English.

During the Canadian government's first sanctioning of Alpha Flight and its parent organization, Department H, Madison remained in the third-tier Gamma Flight program, while Bochs and his cybernetically-controlled robot, Box, reached the Beta Flight level. Madison had a fleeting relationship with fellow Gamma Flight member Diamond Lil, but the two would drift apart for some time. When the Canadian government cut Department H's funding, Madison left the organization completely and found employment digging ditches. Roger Bochs and Omega Flight While Madison was continuing with his own life, Box and Diamond Lil were subsequently recruited by Jerome Jaxon as members of Omega Flight, with the intention of destroying James Hudson, now known as Guardian, and Alpha Flight. However, Roger Bochs only accepted the offer of Jaxon's android assistant, Delphine Courtney, in order to defeat Omega Flight from within, as he remained loyal to Guardian. Jaxon would, as a result, use the Box robot himself against Guardian in battle, only to be electrocuted by the feedback in Box's control helmet when Guardian used his own suit's energy to disable the robot. Shortly thereafter, Guardian was uncontrollably thrust into the space-time continuum by his overloading battlesuit, appearing to have been disintegrated to his wife Heather. After Alpha Flight returned to Canada, Roger Bochs (who was still working independently) recruited Madison to rebuild his damaged Box robot, in order to seek revenge against Omega Flight. Roger and Madison were able to reconfigure Box using a sort of \\"living metal\\", which allowed Bochs to physically merge with the robot, freeing him from his physical limitations. While Madison remained behind, Roger joined up with Alpha Flight, only to end up donating Box to the disembodied soul of Walter Langkowski, a.k.a. Sasquatch. Shortly thereafter, Guardian reappeared in Vancouver, fighting an armored criminal. The rest of Alpha Flight was astonished to see their former leader alive, but it was a ruse; \\"Guardian\\" was, in fact, Delphine Courtney, reconfigured to duplicate the abilities of Guardian's battlesuit as well as his appearance. Courtney, acting as Guardian, led Alpha Flight to the West Edmonton Mall, where they encountered Omega Flight, looking for revenge, as well as to recover their lost member, Smart Alec. Driven from the mall by the sudden appearance of the Beyonder, Omega Flight, led by Courtney disguised as Guardian, ran into Madison in the parking lot. Madison used his abilities to fend off the Omegan Flashback, inadvertently killing one of Flashback's future selves. He then turned to Courtney, forcing her to remove her Guardian mask, and then turned her inside out, destroying Courtney. Madison expressed his disappointment with Diamond Lil for turning criminal, and turned her and the rest of Omega Flight over to the authorities while he met up with Alpha Flight inside the mall, witnessing the Beyonder's departure. Joining Alpha Flight Madison and Roger worked together to reconstruct the interior of the house Walter Langkowski had inherited on Tamarind Island, which had been gutted by Walter's ancestor, Gilded Lily. The reconstructed house was dubbed \\"Mansion Alpha\\", and would serve as Alpha Flight's headquarters for a while.Alpha Flight #20 ff. Heather Hudson, having taken leadership of Alpha Flight during this period, researched her missing (and presumed deceased) husband's files on Madison Jeffries, and discovered the existence of his brother Lionel. The database made no mention of Lionel's madness, and when she traveled to the hospital where he was kept, she was surprised to find out that he was a patient, and not a staff member. Heather inadvertently allowed Lionel to use his powers, freeing himself and disfiguring Heather in the process. Madison was forced to confront Scramble once again, but this time Madison forced Lionel to use his power upon himself, allowing Scramble to regain a measure of sanity.Alpha Flight #30 Madison and Roger re-created Guardian's battlesuit from the remains of Delphine Courtney as a side-project, much to Heather's dismay, as the suit had been responsible for her husband Mac's apparent demise. However, after the Scramble incident and being kidnapped by Deadly Ernest, Heather decided to don the battlesuit, modified by Madison to fit her, and took the name Vindicator. Madison served Alpha Flight largely in a support role, rather than as an active combatant, by applying Roger Bochs' designs (and a few of his own, learning from Roger) to create and repair Alpha Flight's technological equipment, such as the Omnijet. Madison was kidnapped by Kara Killgrave, the Purple Girl, when she feared reprisal from Alpha Flight for her manipulation of Northstar. However, Madison would soon take to looking after Kara as a sort of father figure for a time, in the absence of her biological father, the criminal known as the Purple Man. The fact that Kara would look up to Heather as a mother figure while a member of Alpha Flight may have also contributed to Madison and Heather's budding romance. Against Lionel Jeffries Lionel Jeffries had become the head of the New Life Clinic, where he used his mutant powers to heal injured Alphans. However, Lionel's mental instability had not been completely cured, and he had secretly begun experimenting again. Madison became suspicious when Lionel used his powers to radically alter Roger Bochs, severely reducing his body fat and giving him new legs, so that Bochs could impress teammate and girlfriend Aurora. Lionel's powers had no effect on the recently revived Sasquatch, who now inhabited the body of the recently deceased Snowbird, and could not affect the mysterious illness that had befallen Northstar, leading to growing doubts in the other Alphans, particularly Vindicator. Despite the fact that Walter Langkowski was now in a female body (and having begun using the name Wanda Langkowski), Bochs still felt threatened by Aurora's former boyfriend. At the same time, Bochs's new legs were deteriorating, because they had been taken from corpses (and not Bochs's own mass as he had been led to believe). Driven to insane jealousy, Roger joined with Box and attacked Sasquatch. Kara was injured during the fight. Forced to defend the rest of the team against his friend, Madison forcibly removed Bochs from Box, taking control of the robot. In his paranoid state, Bochs began to believe that Madison had intended to take Box from him all along. Bochs was taken back to the New Life Clinic, where Lionel would physically join with Roger to become the lifeform Omega. The new being nearly devastated Alpha Flight with Lionel's metamorphic abilities combined with Roger's design ability. Madison, having picked up some of Roger Bochs's skills while working together, reconfigured the Box robot to be able to utilize Madison's own powers while merged, allowing Box to transform into any form Madison could imagine. Madison was finally able to reach what was left of Bochs's sanity long enough to cause Omega to stop its attack, and Madison, turning Box into a giant cannon, destroyed Omega. Madison, Heather, and Lil After losing several other members of Alpha Flight, the team consisted of three primary members: Vindicator, Box, and Sasquatch and junior members Purple Girl, Manikin, Goblyn and Pathway. When the rest of the team was captured by Bedlam, a failed creation of Department H, Box teamed up with Wolverine to defeat Bedlam and save Alpha Flight. Soon after, Alpha Flight was attacked by the Great Beasts, and Box used Bedlam's Arctic base to increase his own size in order to physically battle Tundra. Shortly thereafter, Box discarded much of the matter absorbed from Bedlam's base in launching Alpha Flight into deep space, with his remaining body forming a starship. Alpha Flight would eventually return to Earth by way of the Dreamqueen's dimension. During this time, Madison and Heather pursued a romantic relationship, and the two were engaged shortly after returning to Earth and disbanding Alpha Flight. However, the engagement was fraught with difficulty, as the Dreamqueen and subsequently Llan the Sorcerer forced Alpha Flight back together, and gave the two little time for romance. It was during the final fight with the Dreamqueen that Lillian Crawley (a.k.a. Diamond Lil) re-entered Madison's life. Lil, having been paroled with the intention of being recruited into Canada's new official superteam, Gamma Flight, ended up fighting side-by-side with Alpha Flight instead. Although Madison reaffirmed his love for Heather during the final battle with Llan, the discovery that Guardian was, in fact, alive brought an end to the engagement. After Alpha Flight had regained official status with the Canadian government, Madison and Lil remained with Alpha Flight for a time, fighting together as teammates. Madison provided support for Lil after she had discovered a lump in her breast; due to her virtually indestructible body, a biopsy was not possible with existing Earth technology, but an alien weapon recovered during an invasion of Toronto, modified by Madison, allowed a biopsy to be performed. The cyst proved benign, and shortly thereafter, Madison and Lil were married, after which they retired from active duty. They were pressed into service once more during the Infinity Crusade, before Alpha Flight was again disbanded as an active team. Gemini and Weapon X After a period of downtime, Alpha Flight was again reactivated, with a mysteriously younger James Hudson as leader of the team. Much to Lil's dismay, Madison rejoined the team, although this time not as Box. On the new team's first mission, however, the criminal organization the Zodiac kidnapped and brainwashed Madison, convincing him to become Gemini (with a modified Boxbot as his \\"twin\\"). Lil was kidnapped by Department H which conducted experiments on her. Even after these events were rectified, more troubles occurred. Lil was once more kidnapped, but this time by the agents of the revamped Weapon X program and taken to their Neverland death camp. Madison was also kidnapped and brainwashed by the program as well. Its director, Malcolm Colcord, kept Madison in a small room in a secluded corner of the facility, commissioning him to create the Neverland camps. Madison was frequently brainwashed to keep him submissive to Colcord. Due to a series of events within the organization, a schism was formed between Colcord and his second- in-command, Brent Jackson. Jackson gathered a contingent of loyal followers and attempted to usurp power from Colcord. In the midst of the commotion, Madison saved Colcord's life, escorting him and Aurora to safety, despite Colcord's abusive behavior towards him. Madison Jeffries was one of the few mutants to retain their superhuman powers during the M-Day event. X-Club Jeffries is approached by Beast to join his scientist team that deals with the Mutant Birth Crisis because they need someone who is good with machinery. Jeffries claims he wanted to get away from people after being brainwashed into making Automated Mutant Death Camps so he moved away to create and get smarter. His robots learn to adapt and self replicate and decide they don't need him any more. They seal off the bunker and try to kill him. He plants a bomb and joins Beast's team.Uncanny X-Men #505 After Beast has finished gathering his science squad, they head back to base where he introduces them to their final member, Kavita Rao. Together they hold a meeting where Beast explains everything about how the Decimation occurred.Uncanny X-Men #508 He later goes back in time to the year 1906 along with the rest of the X-Club and PsylockeUncanny X-Men #512 and helps raise Asteroid M from the bottom of the ocean.Dark Avengers #8 During the final battle against Norman Osborn's forces on Utopia, he teams up with Doctor Nemesis and Psylocke to take on Dark Beast.Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1 Jeffries suffers a major loss during Necrosha, when Diamond Lil is killed by Mortis. Jeffries uses his abilities to craft a glass coffin for her and she is buried at sea. During the events of Second Coming, Madison and the rest of the X-Club are shut out of Utopia by Bastion as he attempts to kill off the remaining mutant population. Jeffries has developed an attraction to Danger, the humanoid-robotic manifestation of the X-Men's Danger Room.Uncanny X-Men #529 Madison Jeffries later appears as a member of the Utopians alongside Elixir, Karma, Masque, Random, and Tabitha Smith.All-New X-Men #40 Powers and abilities Madison Jeffries is a mutant gifted with the ability to technokinetically restructure all inorganic materials such as glass, plastic, and metal into anything within his imagination, including remote manipulation and control of devices made of such elements, even ones not of his own creation. Recently, his powers seem to have evolved a secondary mutation of full technopathy, being able to communicate with artificial intelligences such as machinery and robotics. As a fringe benefit of his secondary mutation, Madison can technoformically merge with the Box armor. Gaining increased strength on a level with the Thing, stamina, and resistance to injury as well as an array of technological devices such as boot rockets, various scanners, and assorted weapons. Madison can reconfigure the Box armor to any form he can conceive, including various vehicle modes. Using Madison's powers, the Box armor can also absorb additional mechanical materials to increase its size and mass as needed. At maximum size he managed to fight evenly with Tundra, the strongest of the Great Beasts. However, while merged with Box, Madison can only transmute the armor itself, and must separate from Box to use his powers to affect other materials without absorbing them into the armor. Similar to fellow mutant scientific specialists Forge, Doctor Nemesis or Sage. Mr. Jeffries has the natural intuitive talent for mechanical and cybernetic engineering which enables him to naturally understand, ascertain and implement the potential constructive formation that certain technological pieces can take. A trait which most telepaths remark as his mind working more like a computerized machine than that of a human being. Other versions Age of Apocalypse In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Madison Jeffries had joined Apocalypse's cause and was a member of the Brotherhood of Chaos, an elite religious group affiliated to the Church of the Madri. Jeffries was sent with the other members to prevent the Great Sentinel Airlift in Maine, however, a small squad of X-Men, the Amazing X-Men, had come assist in the Sentinel Evacuation of Northern America. Box reprogrammed the Sentinels to target the X-Men, though the X-Men were later able to reverse Box's efforts. Box was able to conceal himself and pose as a human during the evacuation along with Copycat. They were discovered at a checkpoint and provided a distraction for the Reavers to pass through, but were subsequently hunted down by Weapon X and Jean Grey with the former slaying Box in the process. Age of X-Man In the Age of X-Man reality, Madison Jeffries is the History Instructor of the 10th Year class within the Summers Institute Of Higher Learning, located in Winchester, New York.Age of X-Man ‚Äî NextGen #1 (February 2019) House of M In the House of M reality, Madison Jeffries had also been forced by Weapon X to create weapons that would be used on his fellow mutants. His brother, Lionel, had also been a captive of the Weapon X program. Though the Jeffries brothers were eventually liberated when Magneto established himself as monarch, they both suffered from severe mental issues. Magneto found them embarrassing, so he did not keep the Jeffries brothers clos, yet he deemed them too valuable and resourceful to not make any use of them. As such, Magneto positioned in the Central American country of Santo Rico (after overthrowing the mutant El Toro) where they oversaw the mining of its precious metal ores. They ruled the country despotically and experimented on its residents for years until Hood's Masters of Evil invaded Santo Rico. Madison and Lionel both grow significantly in size and power by physically absorbing dozens of Santo Ricans and the mined minerals. Regardless, they were outnumbered by the Masters who killed the Jeffries brothers in order to conquer Santo Rico.House of M: Masters of Evil #3 Weapon X: Days of Future Now In the alternate future depicted in Weapon X: Days of Future Now, Madison's ever-improving Boxbots have gained a sentience of their own, one of them even calling itself Master Mold.

She is most famous for her invention of the spanning- tree protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. She also made large contributions to many other areas of network design and standardization, such as link-state routing protocols. More recently she has invented the TRILL protocol to correct some of the shortcomings of spanning-trees. She is currently employed by Dell EMC.  Early life  Perlman grew up near Asbury Park, New Jersey. She is Jewish.https://jwa.org/people/perlman-radia Both of her parents worked as engineers for the US government. Her father worked on radar and her mother was a mathematician by training who worked as a computer programmer. During her school years Perlman found math and science to be ‚Äúeffortless and fascinating‚Äù, but had no problem achieving top grades in other subjects as well. She enjoyed playing the piano and French horn. While her mother helped her with her math homework, they mainly talked about literature and music. Despite being the best science and math student in her school it was only when Perlman took a programming class in high school that she started to consider a career that involved computers. She was the only woman in the class and later reflected \\"I was not a hands-on type person. It never occurred to me to take anything apart. I assumed I'd either get electrocuted, or I'd break something\\".  Education  As an undergraduate at MIT Perlman learned programming for a physics class. She was given her first paid job in 1971 as part-time programmer for the LOGO Lab at the (then) MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, programming system software such as debuggers. Working under the supervision of Seymour Papert, she developed a child- friendly version of the educational robotics language LOGO, called TORTIS (\\"Toddler's Own Recursive Turtle Interpreter System\\"). During research performed in 1974‚Äì76, young children‚Äîthe youngest aged 3¬Ω years, programmed a LOGO educational robot called a Turtle. Perlman has been described as a pioneer of teaching young children computer programming. As a math grad at MIT she needed to find an adviser for her thesis, and joined the MIT group at BBN Technologies. There she first got involved with designing network protocols. Perlman obtained a B.S. and M.S. in Mathematics and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT in 1988. Her doctoral thesis at MIT addressed the issue of routing in the presence of malicious network failures. When studying at MIT in the late 60s she was one among the 50 or so women students, in a class of about 1,000 students. To begin with MIT only had one women‚Äôs dorm, limiting the number of women students that could study. When the men‚Äôs dorms at MIT became coed Perlman moved out of the women‚Äôs dorm into a mixed dorm, where she became the \\"resident female\\". She later said that she was so used to the gender imbalance, that it became normal. Only when she saw other women students among a crowd of men she noticed that \\"it kind of looked weird\\".  Career  She is most famous for her invention of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which is fundamental to the operation of network bridges, while working for Digital Equipment Corporation. Perlman is the author of a textbook on networking and coauthor of another on network security. She holds more than 100 issued patents. She was a Fellow at Sun Microsystems and has taught courses at the University of Washington, Harvard University and MIT, and has been the keynote speaker at events all over the world. Perlman is the recipient of awards such as Lifetime Achievement awards from Usenix and the Association for Computing Machinery‚Äôs Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM).  Spanning Tree Protocol  Perlman invented the spanning tree algorithm and the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). While working as a consulting engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1984 she was tasked with developing a straightforward protocol which enabled network bridges to locate loops in a local area network (LAN). It was required that the protocol should use a constant amount of memory when implemented on the network devices, regardless of how large the network was. Building and expanding bridged networks was difficult because loops, where more than one path leads to the same destination, could result in the collapse of the network. Redundant paths in the network meant that a bridge could forward a frame in multiple directions. Therefore loops could cause Ethernet frames to fail to reach their destination, thus flooding the network. Perlman utilised the fact that bridges had unique 48 bit MAC addresses, and devised a network protocol so that bridges within the LAN communicated with one another. The algorithm implemented on all bridges in the network allowed the bridges to designate one root bridge in the network. Each bridge then mapped the network and determined the shortest path to the root bridge, deactivating other redundant paths. Despite Perlman's concerns that it took the spanning tree protocol about a minute to react when changes in the network topology occurred, during which time a loop could bring down the network, it was standardised as 802.1d by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Perlman said that the benefits of the protocol amount to the fact that \\"you don't have to worry about topology\\" when changing the way a LAN is interconnected. Perlman has however criticised changes which were made in the course of the standardisation of the protocol. From the paper \\"An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in an Extended LAN\\": :: Algorhyme :: I think that I shall never see :: A graph more lovely than a tree. :: A tree whose crucial property :: Is loop-free connectivity. :: A tree which must be sure to span :: So packets can reach every LAN. :: First the root must be selected. :: By ID it is elected. :: Least cost paths from root are traced. :: In the tree these paths are placed. :: A mesh is made by folks like me :: Then bridges find a spanning tree.  Other network protocols  Perlman was the principal designer of the DECnet IV and V protocols, which are part of the DECnet network protocol suite for peer-to-peer network architectures. She also made major contributions to the Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). Perlman has collaborated with Yakov Rekhter on developing network routing standards, such as the Open System Interconnection Routing Protocol (IDRP), which allows routers in packet switching networks to communicate with one another across broadcast domains. At DEC she also oversaw the transition from distance vector to link-state routing protocols. Link- state routing protocols had the advantage that they adapted to changes in the network topology faster, and DEC's link-state routing protocol was second only to the link-state routing protocol of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). While working on the DECnet project Perlman also helped to improve the intermediate-system to intermediate-system routing protocol, known as IS-IS, so that it could route the Internet Protocol (IP), AppleTalk and the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) protocol. The Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol relied in part on Perlman's research on fault-tolerant broadcasting of routing information. Perlman subsequently worked as network engineer for Sun Microsystems, now Oracle. She specialised on network and security protocols and while working for Oracle obtained more than 50 patents.

The flight of this species is erratic. They are found in Africa, South Asia and South-east Asia extending to parts of Australia. Description Subspecies leda (nominate) and ismene, larva and pupa Wet- season form: Forewing: apex subacute; termen slightly angulated just below apex, or straight. Upperside brown. Forewing with two large subapical black spots, each with a smaller spot outwardly of pure white inwardly bordered by a ferruginous interrupted lunule; costal margin narrowly pale. Hindwing with a dark, white-centred, fulvous-ringed ocellus subterminally in interspace two, and the apical ocellus, sometimes also others of the ocelli,on the underside, showing through. Underside paler, densely covered with transverse dark brown striae; a discal curved dark brown narrow band on forewing; a post-discal similar oblique band, followed by a series of ocelli: four on the forewing, that in interspace 8 the largest; six on the hindwing, the apical and subtornal the largest. Dry-season form: Forewing: apex obtuse and more or less falcate; termen posterior to falcation straight or sinuous. Upperside: ground colour similar to that in the wet-season form, the markings, especially the ferruginous lunules inwardly bordering the black sub-apical spots on forewing, larger, more extended below and above the black costa. Hindwing: the ocellus in interspace 2 absent, posteriorly replaced by three or four minute white subterminal spots. Underside varies in colour greatly. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen in both seasonal forms brown or greyish brown: the antennae annulated with white, ochraceous at apex. Ecology Resident butterflies are known to fight off visitors to the area during dusk hours. This chase behaviour is elicited even by pebbles thrown nearby. The caterpillars feed on a wide variety of grasses including rice (Oryza sativa), bamboos, Andropogon, Rotboellia cochinchinensis, Brachiaria mutica, Cynodon, Imperata, and millets such as Oplismenus compositus, Panicum and Eleusine indica. Adults feed mainly on nectar, and in rare cases visit rotting fruits.

Career The band was originally formed in South London in 1977, by guitarist and lead vocalist Dennis Greaves. Taking bassist Peter Clark with him, they recruited Kenny Bradley on drums, and vocalist and harmonica player Mark Feltham. They originally called themselves 'Stan's Blues Band', and for two years built up a local following in London clubs. In 1979, while playing at The Thomas A'Beckett pub in the Old Kent Road they accepted an offer from former musician Mickey Modern to manage them, and it was he who persuaded them to change the band's name to something sharper. Greaves chose Nine Below Zero after the Sonny Boy Williamson II song. At that time Modern was a musician signed to A&M; Records; after producing the band's demos he persuaded A&M; to give him a record label with which to launch this band's career. Modern named the label M&L; Records. Under Modern's creative direction and production, the band went full-time, and in 1980 released their first album, Live at the Marquee, which was recorded on 16 June 1980. Bradley on drums was replaced by Stix Burkey. By the end of that year they were one of the most popular club attractions in London, pulling in audiences from other genres, particularly the new wave of British heavy metal, attracted by their high-energy fast tempo sound. They headlined at the Hammersmith Odeon and featured respected bluesman Alexis Korner, a long-time champion of new electric blues talent. In 1981, they released second album, Don't Point Your Finger, produced by Glyn Johns. Johns complained the bass was too basic for the new songs, so taking his advice the band subsequently replaced bass player Clark with Brian Bethell. There was a period when Nine Below Zero appeared on television almost weekly. The band appeared on The Chris Tarrant Show, The South Bank Show, O.T.T., The Old Grey Whistle Test, and the BBC2 comedy series The Young Ones (performing \\"11+11\\" on the first episode, \\"Demolition\\"). They also supported The Kinks and The Who on a tour. Don't Point Your Finger climbed to number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. Their third album, Third Degree, contained \\"11+11\\", written by Greaves and Modern. The album was their highest placing appearance on the UK Albums Chart, spending six weeks in the chart and reaching number 38. Nevertheless, the band decided to split, although Bethell later had some success with The Blow Monkeys whilst Feltham went into session work, most notably for Rory Gallagher. Modern often put the idea to reform Nine Below Zero to Arnold but the latter was managing The Truth, and considered Nine Below Zero as a move backward. However, with IRS Records interest in The Truth wavering in 1990, Modern persuaded Feltham and Greaves to reunite for a tenth anniversary concert. Modern also persuaded Arnold who now worked at Harvey Goldsmith Ents to promote the band at the Town and Country Club, which they did to a sell-out success. Suitably encouraged, they decided to stay together, with Gerry McAvoy and Brendan O'Neill (ex-Rory Gallagher's band) added on bass and drums. In 1992, Feltham left due to musical differences and was replaced by the session harp-player, Alan Glen. Feltham subsequently returned in 2001 and the band have continued to tour and record, still popular due to having developed a cult following. In 1995, Billy Boy Miskimmin was recruited on harmonica. In the mid-1990s Nine Below Zero appeared at the Salle des Fetes, St. Jean de la Ruelle, Loiret, France. A successful gig that encouraged the Fabulous Thunderbirds to emulate them some months later. In 2005, their track \\"Go Girl\\" was included in the Of Hands and Hearts: Music for the Tsunami Disaster Fund compilation album. In 2007, Nine Below Zero performed two acoustic concerts, producing the DVD Bring It On Home, including a live CD. Blues guitarist Gary Moore joined the band on stage to promote the DVD. In August 2008, Nine Below Zero appeared at the Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire and later opened for Chuck Berry at The 100 Club. In 2009, the band started working towards a show to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the release of their debut album, Live at the Marquee. A chance meeting with Glenn Tilbrook from Squeeze resulted in an offer to record a new album that Greaves and Feltham had been writing all year. The offer was gladly accepted and the band went into 45 RPM studios in London to record the cclaimed and self-penned It's Never Too Late - their first collection of new songs since Refrigerator. European tours followed and Jools Holland and Paul Jones asked the band to guest on their shows. With the critical acclaim of It's Never Too Late, they were approached by Glenn Tillbrook again in 2011, this time to make a new record together under the name of The Co-operative. All was finished in July 2011 and one track, the Beatles song \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" was used on a Mojo magazine special celebrating the 40-year anniversary of the release of the Beatles album Abbey Road. The band played a few dates with Tilbrook as a rehearsal for a mini tour in 2012. The end of 2011 saw Gerry McAvoy play his last show for Nine Below Zero and pursue a new solo career. His band is called Band of Friends and does regular shows each year at Ballyshannon in the memorial honoring Rory Gallagher and across UK and Europe. Recent work 2012 saw the return of Brian Bethell who played on Third Degree. The new lineup started performing in January with shows in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, as the band enter their 35th year. Following on from 2012's remastered re-release of Nine Below Zero's live debut Live at the Marquee came a double instalment; remastered editions of the first two studio albums Don't Point Your Finger and Third Degree, each with a separate disc of bonus material, was released on 24 February 2014 through Universal Music. A nationwide month-long 22-date tour in support of The Stranglers began on 27 February 2014. The band then undertook a 35th Anniversary tour in Autumn 2014. The second half of 2016 saw the release of the band's first \\"big band\\" album, this new line made their live debut at Glastonbury Festival in June after which the big band toured extensively through the autumn and beyond. On 27 October 2018, the band played King George's Hall, Blackburn, supporting Bruce Foxton's From The Jam, with Russell Hastings performing lead vocals with songs from The Jam's All Mod Cons.

He is best known for his comedic portrayals. Biography Nishimura was born on December 12, 1960 in Toyama, Toyama, Japan. While he attended Toyo University to study photography he met K≈çki Mitani, a script writer for radio and playwright who aspired to be an actor and who turned his attention to the theatre. In 1983, Nishimura, Mitani and others including the actors Zen Kajiwara and Kazuyuki Aijima formed the Tokyo Sunshine Boys, a comedy troupe that grew in popularity over the following ten years. They produced the popular play 12 Gentle Japanese, a parody of Reginald Rose's 12 Angry Men. When 12 Gentle Japanese was adapted to film, Nishimura did not form part of the cast. In the 1990s the success of the Tokyo Sunshine Boys brought Nishimura parts in television dramas, notably a part in Furikaereba Yatsuga Iru and as the flamboyant Shintaro Imaizumi in K≈çki Mitani's Furuhata Ninzaburo. With the release of the K≈çki Mitani film adaptation of the play Radio no Jikan in 1997, Nishimura won acclaim for his portrayal of a radio producer‚Äîa role for which he won the Best Supporting Actor award from the Japanese Academy Awards as well as a Blue Ribbon Award. The Tokyo Sunshine Boys disbanded in 1998, but most of its actors, including Nishimura, continued to work in television.

He was the elder son of Count Edzard II of Ostfriesland and his wife Princess Katarina of Sweden, eldest daughter of King Gustav I of Sweden. In 1602 Enno III's troops laid siege to Emden, without success; On 8 April 1603 Enno had to sign the Treaty of The Hague in which he not only accepted the presence of a Dutch garrison in Emden, but agreed to pay the costs for the Dutch garrison. In 1609 the conflict broke out again; the Emders were victorious in a skirmish at Greetsiel and temporarily occupied the Count's residence at Aurich. In 1611 the Dutch garrisoned troops in Leerort. On 24 May the Accord of Osterhusen was signed, which limited the sovereignty of the Count of East Frisia, stated the rights of the Estates (including Emden) and legitimised the Dutch garrison in Leerort. Family and children Enno III was married twice. Firstly, he married Countess Walburgis of Rietberg (1556‚Äì1586), daughter and heiress of Count John II of Rietberg, Lord of Esens, Stedesdorf and Wittmund and Countess Agnes of Bentheim-Steinfurt. Countess Walburgis, a descendant of Hero Oomkens von Esens, brought the estates of Harlingerland and Rietberg to East Frisia. They had three children: # Sabina Catherine (11 August 1582 - 31 May 1618), married on 4 March 1601 to her uncle Count John III of East Frisia (1566 - 29 September 1625) # Agnes (1 January 1584 - 28 February 1616), married on 15 August 1603 to Prince Gundakar of Liechtenstein (30 January 1580 - 5 August 1658) # John Edzard, (10 May 1586 - 20 May 1586), buried in Esens (St. Magnus) Countess Walburgis of Rietberg died only few days after her son. Allegedly she was poisoned. Stine Essken was burnt at the stake for this. After the male line of the counts of Rietberg became extinct, the counts of East Frisia became their successor due to the marital connection of Enno III with Walburgis. On 28 January 1598 Enno III married Anna of Holstein-Gottorp, (27 February 1575 - 24 April 1625), daughter of Duke Adolf of Holstein-Gottorp. They had five children: # Edzard Gustav (15 April 1599 - 18-19 April 1612) # Anna Maria (23 June 1601 - 4 September 1634), married on 4 September 1622 to Duke Adolf Frederick I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. # Rudolf Christian, Count of East Frisia (25 June 1602 - 17 June 1628) # Ulrich II, Count of East Frisia (16 July 1605 - 11 January 1648) married on 5 March 1631 Juliana of Hesse-Darmstadt (14.

Created by writer Brandon Choi and artist Jim Lee, she first appeared in WildC.A.T.S. #1 (August 1992), which was produced by Jim Lee's studio, WildStorm comics, and published by Image Comics. After WildStorm and its properties were purchased by DC Comics in 1999, the character continued as a character in books under the WildStorm imprint, until DC discontinued the WildStorm imprint in December 2010.Ching, Albert (September 21, 2010). \\"DC Co- Publishers Announce End of WILDSTORM Imprint, Zuda\\". Newsarama. A new incarnation of the character was created as part of the main DC Universe in September 2011, as part of DC's company-wide relaunch of its title, The New 52. Publication history Wildstorm The first Voodoo series was a four-issue limited series, published in 1997 and written by Alan Moore. DC Comics In June 2011, DC Comics announced that the character would be incorporated into the main DC Universe in an ongoing series written by Ron Marz and drawn by Sami Basri as part of The New 52, a relaunch of DC Comics' properties. Josh Williamson was announced as the new writer of the comic book, starting with Voodoo #5, because DC wanted to take the story in a different direction. Fictional character biography Priscilla Kitaen was a stripper before being rescued by the WildC.A.T.s from the Daemonites. Voodoo had a gift called the \\"Sight\\", allowing her to perceive if a person was possessed by a Daemonite, and being able to separate daemonites from the bodies they were possessing which made her very important to both the WildC.A.T.s and the Daemonites. Voodoo joined the WildC.A.T.S and revealed even greater powers, such as telepathy and the ability to develop animal-like traits, such as sprouting claws from her fingertips. She was later trained by Zealot in the martial arts of The Coda and developed an attraction towards Spartan. Her Daemonite ancestry was not revealed until she entered into a coma after being shot. Void entered in her mind through a computer, and it was revealed that one of her ancestors, a Kherubim, was possessed by a Daemonite. When the WildC.A.T.s travelled to Khera, home planet of the Kherubim, Voodoo was separated from her friends because of her Daemonite heritage. She was relocated to a Daemonite ghetto and discovered that the war between Khera and Daemonites had been over for centuries. More importantly she discovered that most Daemonites were not evil as she always was led to believe; the Daemonites on Earth were all highly fanatical soldiers, but on Khera the Daemonites were citizens. She managed to find the other WildC.A.T.s and confronted Zealot, who shamed her as being of an inferior race in front of the Coda sisterhood. Voodoo became disgusted with the Kherans and renounced Zealot, her former teacher. Despite this she then helped the WildC.A.Ts to stop an assassination attempt on Zealot and she too turned away from Khera. The WildC.A.T.s returned to Earth, but Voodoo could not forget Khera and Zealot's behaviour. Disappointed by her life as a superhero, she left the WildC.A.T.s. Priscilla moved to New Orleans to return to stripping. As she arrived, she met two men, Carry-4 and Attibon. Carry-4 took Voodoo to The Midnight Lounge, where the owner, Christian Charles, offered her a job as one of his dancers had disappeared. She became friends with Purity, another stripper. Needing a place to stay, Attibon took her to a hotel, the Royale, where she met Freeda, a former prostitute and Saturday, a former hitman. These three later revealed themselves as Erzulie, Papa Legba and Baron Samedi. Soon it became clear that Christian Charles had been murdering his dancers to bathe in their blood, an arcane ritual to resurrect his dead father, a dark magician. Christian had help from Carry-4 who was, in reality, Mait' Carrefour. Priscilla and lieutenant David Dove, the police officer investigating the murders, arrived in time to save Purity, but Christian had absorbed enough blood to summon his dead father. Priscilla faced him and channelled Erzulie. Despite all their power, Christian and his father could not resist her dance and Priscilla lured him back to the Royale. Inside the Royale, Baron Samedi, Erzulie, and Papa Legba waited for Christian and his father, telling them that they disturbed the balance. The three pointed the Charles' towards a door where they faced Damballa, causing the Royale to explode. The experience made Priscilla decide to learn more about voodoo magic and she became an apprentice to a mambo. Several months later, she briefly rejoined the WildC.A.Ts, but left again when the team disbanded following Zealot's apparent death. She moved in with Dr. Jeremy Stone, but despite her attempts to get closer to him, he often locked himself up in his lab. Unknown to Priscilla, Jeremy had fallen in love with her and was developing a method to remove the Daemonite-genes from her. Voodoo had no direction to her life at this time, but a Daemonite, disguised as an elderly man followed her around. Priscilla was given a credit card from the Halo Corporation under the name Marlowe. While tracking this credit card, Voodoo was attacked by a serial killer called Samuel Smith, who was trying to kill Jacob Marlowe and all his relatives. It turned out that Jacob had defeated Smith's grandfather, a criminal with superhuman powers and now Samuel wanted revenge. He surprised her, and his powers seriously injured her, separating her legs from her body and injuring her throat. Spartan, now Jack Marlowe, and Grifter took down Smith later. Grifter also convinced Jeremy that his plan to heal Voodoo from her Daemonite-side might not be welcomed at all by Voodoo. While she was treated in the hospital, she amazed the medical staff by quickly recovering from her throat injuries. She quickly grew annoyed by the medical staff until she noticed a Daemonite among them. Soon afterwards, the Daemonite confronted her. He told her that he was not an enemy, but a rare conscientious objector among the Daemonite military and that she should see him as her grandfather. He instructed her in the proper use of her Daemonite powers of time manipulation and regeneration and within several hours, Voodoo had regrown her legs. Before leaving, he also convinced Priscilla to start a relationship with Jeremy. This relationship has ended recently; an aspect of her telepathic powers is that they increase with physical intimacy, and Voodoo's willingness to be intimate with other men to use them was, despite his protests, not something with which Jeremy could cope. The break-up fight was ended when Priscilla intentionally angered him to the point that he grew in size. With the resulting loss of intellect that comes with his size growth, he forgot they were fighting, and she took the opportunity to leave. (as of Worldstorm #2) When DC Comics' character Captain Atom was stranded in the Wildstorm reality, Voodoo and the other WildC.A.T.S were sent to capture him. Voodoo displayed magnetic abilities that allowed her to control the metal of his uniform, and even disrupt the flow of iron in his bloodstream. However, when she attempted to use her telepathy to probe his mind, he connected her brain to all of the information in the world, which overloaded her mind and rendered her unconscious. WildC.A.T.s vol. 4 No longer a superhero, Priscilla Kitaen is, at the start of this series, once again a stripper - now dancing for oil sheiks and billionaires. However, despite her telling Hadrian that it had been \\"years since [they] were superheroes together,\\" it was clear that their former passion was not dimmed, and they ended up in bed together. She now appears to be an employee of the Halo Corporation once more, with Hadrian offering to triple her current wages. Ongoing series Following the events of Flashpoint, Voodoo is one of the many Wildstorm characters who were brought over into the mainstream DC Universe, with her entire history now rewritten. In her DC Universe iteration, Priscilla Kitaen is a Human-Daemonite hybrid who works as a Daemonite spy, using her shapeshifting abilities and limited telepathy to blend in with humans and learn intelligence about metahumans and other possible threats to the Daemonites. Priscilla works undercover as a stripper under the alias Voodoo.Voodoo (vol. 2) #1 (Sept. 2011) It is eventually revealed that Priscilla was born a human, but was abducted and genetically engineered into a Daemonite half-breed after a fire killed her mother.Voodoo (vol. 2) #4 (Dec. 2011) Further complicating her identity issues, Voodoo learns that she is a clone of the real Priscilla Kitaen, who has been held captive by Voodoo's pursuers, the Black Razors, for several months.Voodoo (vol. 2) #5 (Jan. 2012) Upon learning this, Voodoo takes aggressive action against the Daemonite High Council, but is persuaded to stop her attack when she is offered a higher ranking position that would put her in charge of all earthbound Daemonite clone forces.Voodoo (vol. 2) #7 (Mar. 2012) Powers and abilities Wildstorm Voodoo is a telepathic human-Kherubim hybrid with Daemonite ancestry and possesses \\"the Sight,\\" the ability to see Daemonites who have possessed humans. Along with this, she can use her powers to separate Daemonites from their hosts and has shown the ability to do this to other organisms that have been bonded. She can read and manipulate the thoughts and emotions of others, and even shut off people's minds. Her powers increase proportionate to physical intimacy, enabling her greater ability to psychically manipulate and read others. Early on, she was able to shapeshift into a humanoid wolf-like state, complete with fur and claws, and in this state her personality became savage and feral. Later this power was changed so that she shifted into a Daemonite form. An elderly Daemonite appeared to her and taught her the use of her hidden powers of regeneration and time- manipulation. Zealot has trained her in the martial arts of The Coda. She was also mentored in the use of Voodoo magic by a High Voodoo Priestess. Voodoo has displayed the power to control magnetic fields, and can move and manipulate ferrous metals with her mind. She can control the trace amounts of iron in a person's bloodstream. The New 52 In The New 52 reality, because she is a Daemonite/human hybrid, her powers have changed; Voodoo lost the sight, regeneration, magnetic and magical powers. But she has shape shifting and telepathy powers; and the productions of projectile quills and the secretion of poison. Her shape shifting powers allow her to copy humans or animals that she touched; and the creation of wings and weapons like a spear. Also her shape shifting has been used to provide a limited form of camouflage, as she can take on the colors of other objects which she might be standing in front of. Voodoo now has limited mind-reading capabilities; however she is unable to control her own mind when she uses these abilities, thus leaving herself vulnerable to counter telepathy. Also she has the abilities to survive in harsh environment, as seen when she functions in the environment of Europa (the moon of Jupiter), without any form of protection. The Daemonites have trained her in hand-to-hand combat and in espionage.

Here appears an umib≈çzu with scales and a fin. Umib≈çzu (Êµ∑Âùä‰∏ª) from Bakemono no e (ÂåñÁâ©‰πãÁπ™, c. 1700), Harry F. Bruning Collection of Japanese Books and Manuscripts, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. is a paranormal phenomena or y≈çkai from Japanese folklore. Other names include or . Little is known of the origin of umib≈çzu but it is a sea-spirit and as such has multiple sightings throughout Japan. Normally, umib≈çzu appears to sailors on calm seas which quickly turn tumultuous. It either breaks the ship on emergence or demands a bucket or barrel from the sailors and proceeds to drown them. The only safe way to escape an umib≈çzu is to give it a bottomless barrel and sail away while it is confused. Concept They appear and disappear in the oceans, often at night, and it is thought that they would suddenly appear on what was previously a calm sea surface as a giant's black b≈çzu head and destroy ships. They are often a few meters to a few tens of meters in length, so they are seen as quite large, but there are also tales about relatively small ones. Like funay≈´rei, there are often many tales that seem to be about hallucinations, and often the difference between them is not clear. They would say \\"lend me a ladle,\\" and sometimes the funay≈´rei that come to sink ships are considered the same as umib≈çzu. However, unlike the funay≈´rei who come with stormy weather, umib≈çzu sometimes appear at seas with no abnormalities (and in this case, once the umib≈çzu was seen, the weather would start getting stormy), so it's pointed out that these could be things that actually exist that were seen incorrectly. Some examples of things that could have been seen incorrectly include sea organisms, cumulonimbus clouds, big waves, and other natural phenomena. Also, umib≈çzu would often come in swarms as naked b≈çzu-like beings and attack ships, and they would do things like cling on to the hull and scull as well as put out the basket fire. It is said that they would sometimes let out a voice saying \\"yaa yaa\\" while swimming, and when hit with the scull would let out shrieks of \\"aitata\\". Their weakness is tobacco smoke, and it is said that if one is unlucky enough to encounter one, having one of those ready can lead to being saved. Legends by area In the T≈çhoku region, there is a custom of sacrificing to the gods the first fish caught when fishing, and it is said that if this is not followed, an umib≈çzu would appear and destroy the boat and kidnap the boat owner. The nurarihyon that appears often in Bisan Seto has a large round head and as they float towards the boat, they would then slowly sludge (nurari) away and then unexpectedly (hyon) float approaching the boat again. They would do this several times over to mess with people. In Cape Shiriya, Higashid≈çri, Shimokita District, Aoyama Prefecture, it is said that people eaten by sharks would become \\"m≈çjabune\\". They can be repelled by melting some miso and letting it into the sea. The \\"umikoz≈ç\\" told about in the Kamo District, Shizuoka Prefecture is a boy covered with hair all the way to the sides of the eye, and it is said that they would approach fishing lines with a grin. Also, in Mikonohama, Kii Province, a small animal called the \\"mokuri kokuri\\" that resembles a weasel would go to the mountains on March 3 and to the sea on May 5, and they have the shape of a human, but would expand and contract at will and disappear as soon as they appear, and extract from the butts of people who come to wheat fields at night. They have a jellyfish- like shape, and are said to come floating in swarms above the ocean. During the Mongol invasions, they were considered to be the spirits of those who died in water, and their name was ateji for Mongolian Koguryo. In the Kitauwa District, Ehim Prefecture, the sea would become white at night and a \\"shirami\\", also called \\"shirami y≈´ren\\", would come swimming, and fishers would call these idiots. However, it is said that if they hear \\"idiot\\", they'd get angry and cling on to the scull and give a bad time. On Sado Island, the \\"tateboshi\\" are a monster said to stand at a height of 20 meters who would aim at ships and try to flip them over. Umib≈çzu are also said to change their appearance, and in Kesennuma ≈åshima, Miyagi Prefecture, there are tales of them shapeshifting into a beautiful woman and engaging in swimming contests with humans. There is also a similar tale in Iwate, but there it is said that those who accept the challenge would be swallowed down instantly. In Uwajima, Ehime Prefecture, there are tales where they would shapeshift into a zat≈ç (blind person) and kill human women. Also, while there are many legends of them attacking humans, in Uwajima there is the legend that those who see an umib≈çzu would life a long life. There are also umib≈çzu with strange appearances. In Wakayama Prefecture, something called the \\"umib≈çzu of Kemiura\\" would appear and disappear. In Meiji 21, or 1888, December 26, the Miyako Shinbun reported that at Mii-dera, Wakayama Prefecture, there was an umib≈çzu like a large monkey with a height of about 7‚Äì8 shaku (about 2.1‚Äì2.4 meters) and a weight of about 60‚Äì70 kan (about 225‚Äì263 kilograms). It is said to have had brown hair, orange eyes, and had the mouth of a crocodile, the torso of a fish, the tail of a lobster, and the cry of a bull. In Nagano Prefecture, there are umib≈çzu who live in rivers, unusual through all provinces. According to legend, they live in rivers near Kaesa, Nakano, and had giant bodies and black heads that looked like big Buddha statues. Only their upper bodies were said to be above water.„ÄéÁï∞Áïå„ÅÆÈóá„Å´Ë†¢„ÅèÁôæÈ¨ºÂ§úË°å„ÅÆ‰ºùË™¨Â¶ñÊÄ™„ÅÆÊú¨„Äè 1999Âπ¥3Êúà1Êó• BOOKSESOTERICAÁô∫Ë°å 224„Éö„Éº„Ç∏ Outside Japan, there are half-human legends about sea monks and sea bishops. In classical literature According to the essay, the Kans≈ç Jigo (ÈñëÁ™ìËá™Ë™û) of the Kansei era, in Kaizuka, Izumi (now Kaizuka, Osaka Prefecture), an umib≈çzu would rise up and stay above ground for 3 days, and children were warned not to go out until it returned to the sea. In the essay Us≈ç Kanwa (Èõ®Á™ìÈñëË©±), in Kuwana (now Mie Prefecture), it was said that umib≈çzu would appear at the end of the month so it was forbidden to set sail during that time, but it is said that one sailor broke this ban and went out to sea whereupon an umib≈çzu appeared and asked, \\"am I fearsome?\\" to which the sailor answered, \\"there is nothing as fearsome as navigating through the whole world,\\" at which the umib≈çzu disappeared. Similarly, there is a legend about a \\"zat≈ç gashira\\" (blind man head), a blind b≈çzu that appears above the sea, and it would ask people \\"am I fearsome?\\" and if one acts scared by saying \\"I'm scared\\" or \\"please help\\", it would say \\"you should not be going out to sea at the end of the month\\" and disappear. From the Kii Z≈çdan Sh≈´, \\"In Crossing Irago, for Just One Woman, about Being Put on a Boat and Taken by a Shark\\"The word \\"shark' was missing from the original text, and in \\"Edo Kaidan Sh≈´, J≈ç\\" (Ê±üÊà∏ÊÄ™Ë´áÈõÜ ‰∏ä, \\"Edo Kaidan Collections, First Part\\") (Iwanami Shoten, 1989), it was added by the literary proofreader, Mamoru Takada. In the Kii Z≈çdan Sh≈´ of the Edo Period are statements about umib≈çzu called \\"kuro ny≈´d≈ç\\" (black priest initiates). A boat was going Ise Province (now Mie Prefecture) to Cape Irago and a boatman named Zenchi refused to have \\"just one woman\\" on,\\"just one woman\\" refers to having only one female among the boat's passengers, and was considered a taboo at sea. so he forcefully took his wife on the boat, and it encountered a large storm. The shipowner believed that the dragon god was angered, at least in part due to the women on board, and despite throwing into the sea things that he thought a dragon might like, the storm still did not calm, and finally the kuro ny≈´d≈ç appeared. It had a head 5 to 6 times the size of a human, glittering eyes, a horse-like mouth that was 2 shaku (about 60 centimeters) in length. It is said that Zenchi's wife made her resolve and tossed herself into the ocean, and the kuro ny≈´d≈ç gulped down that woman, upon which the storm stopped. These umib≈çzu are said to be fallen dragon gods who would demand sacrifice. In the Haidaoyizhi (Êµ∑Â≥∂ÈÄ∏Âøó) by Wang Dahai, under the name of \\"umi osh≈ç\\" (sea priest), it was written to be a y≈çkai resembling a human but has a tear from mouth to ear, and would make a big laughter upon finding a human. Umi osh≈ç are said to be feared because when they appear, a storm surge always follows. It is also theorized that these are sea turtles seen as y≈çkai. In the Honch≈ç Goen (Êú¨ÊúùË™ûÂúí) of the H≈çei era, there are writings about umib≈çzu called \\"fune ny≈´d≈ç\\" (boat priest initiate) and they had a height of 6 to 7 shaku and had no eyes, nose, or limbs, and upon seeing one, it was considered necessary to say nothing and pretend to have seen nothing, because if one says even something like \\"what was that?\\" it would sink the boat in an instant. Also, in Yura, Awaji Island (now Sumoto), it is said that one can be spared by tossing the most precious cargo into the sea. Recent sightings In April 1971, off the coast of Onagawa, Oshika District, Miyagi Prefecture, a fishing boat, the 28th Konpira Maru, was travelling to New Zealand to fish for tuna, when the boat's long line was suddenly cut, and a large creature surfaced from the water. It had many grey-brown wrinkles on its body and eyes that were about 15 centimeters in diameter, a collapsed nose, and no mouth to be seen. Half its body was submerged in murky water so its whole body could not be ascertained, but it was said to leave a trail. It is said that as they got ready to poke it with a harpoon, the monster disappeared into the sea. When an officer of the research lab, the Eny≈ç Suisan Kenkyujo, at branch office in Yaizu heard of this account, he supposed that it was likely that the fishermen were mistaking an organism, like a fish or whale, for a monster. In another eyewitness account, the half of its body that appeared from the water surface was about 1.5 meters in length, so by inferring that its whole body was several times that length, they said that they never heard of an organism like that. These accounts of strange events was published in Mainichi Shimbun on July 17 of the same year. Similar creatures In China, there is the legend of the kikokutan (È¨ºÂì≠ÁÅò) no kai, and according to research, it is said to be related to Japan's funay≈´rei and umib≈çzu, but it has a different appearance. It is thought that when a boat goes on the sea above a kikokutan, its appearance was described by the words Ê≤°È†≠, without a head, ÈöªÊâã, having one hand, and Áã¨Ë∂≥, having one leg, and it was short, and the bald monster would attempt to overturn the ship (on having no hair, this part of their appearance is the same).ÈÇ£Ë∞∑ÊïèÈÉé „Äé„ÄåÈ≠î„Äç„ÅÆ‰∏ñÁïå„Äè Ë¨õË´áÁ§æÂ≠¶Ë°ìÊñáÂ∫´ 2003Âπ¥ p.243  Origin  The origin of umib≈çzu is unclear as there are no stories specifically referencing what caused its creation or its first appearance. One theory about the origin of umib≈çzu is that they are the spirits of dead priests who were thrown into the ocean by Japanese villagers for some reason or another. Because their bodies have nowhere to be laid to rest, their souls inhabit the oceans and haunt it in the shape of a dark shadow, reaping its revenge upon any souls unlucky enough to come across it.  Physical attributes  In the early Edo period scroll Bakemono no e, umib≈çz is shown to have a shaved, smooth head and appears to be all black but it also looks like a mix between a dog and possibly a sea serpent and an octopus (see image). Its arms end in what resembles hand made up of five tentacle-like appendages constituting a hand. It also has a longer body with fins running down its spine as the lower body disappears underwater, once again obscuring our view of its lower body and continuing the mystery of what its lower body looks like. Similar to most legends, the eyes are opened wide and it is smiling. There are two tentacle-like appendages coming from its face which could be feelers of some sort. This is the only occurrence of these feelers and they do not appear in any other legends or accounts. The presence or sighting of an umib≈çzu is widespread and not an uncommon occurrence. Physically, it is often represented as a large, black humanoid figure which only ever rises from the ocean to about its waist, never revealing its lower half. According to most accounts, no one knows what the lower half of an umib≈çzu looks like and thus this figure is shrouded in mystery. Some posit it has tentacles like an octopus while others suggest it is purely humanoid and has two legs like the monks and Buddhas it resembles. The humanoid figure generally appears to be up to 10 meters tall, but can come in a variety of sizes. The sheer size of the y≈çkai helps it to drown the sailors and break the ships it comes upon in the seas. Some stories claim an umib≈çzu can break a ship in half with its hands or by swinging its arms. The body is jet black like that of a shadow with a shaved, smooth head like those of the monks and Buddhas of Japan. This is the only tie to Buddhism or any type of religion in most umib≈çzu legends which seems strange. Normally, if a y≈çkai looks a certain way it is to accomplish something specific to the spirit but umib≈çzu seems to have no ties to Buddhism in anything beyond its appearance. Some accounts suggest umib≈çzu appear to be praying and constantly smiling while their two, round eyes are opened wide in a constant stare. One common theme in every account is the eyes which seem to pierce the sailors and stands out in stark contrast with the black void of its skin. Some accounts suggest umib≈çzu has two arms like a human and others suggest they resemble tentacles like that of an octopus.  Manifestations  Umib≈çzu always appear only in the ocean, usually during peaceful waters and fair weather. These fair conditions would normally put the sailors at ease as they are literally \\"sailing on smooth waters\\" but the possible presence of a malicious spirit put many sailors on edge in these times of peaceful sailing. Upon its sudden rising from the ocean, causing waves and sometimes flipping ships or breaking them with its emergence, umib≈çzu is accompanied by the winds begin to blow and waves toss the ship about. The appearance of an umib≈çzu alone causes this dramatic shift in weather which puts any ship in immediate peril, not only from being capsized by the waves but also from being crushed by the y≈çkai. This could be a mixing of the funay≈´rei legends which suggests these y≈çkai appear during storms at sea. With very few first person sightings which are recorded or passed on, umib≈çzu tends to have characteristics with other y≈çkai. Similar to the funay≈´rei, umib≈çzu either breaks the ship with its arms or it demands a barrel from the sailors which it consequently uses to drown the sailors by scooping up water and dumping it into the ships deck. Funay≈´rei use ladles to drown sailors in some Japanese legends while some accounts of umib≈çzu claim it appears with a ladle for the same purpose. The only way to escape from an umib≈çzu safely is to give it a bottomless barrel, such that it cannot scoop up water, thereby giving the sailors a chance to escape. While it is confused and attempting to scoop up the water in a futile effort, the sailors have just enough time to sail away to safety. The y≈çkai seems to be foolish in the way it does not understand why it cannot scoop water with the bottomless barrel, possibly showing the superiority of humans over y≈çkai in general. Normally, a chance encounter with umib≈çzu is deadly for all and as such there are very few instances of first-person accounts of an umib≈çzu encounter. Any survivors of such an encounter are due to their giving a bottomless barrel or if there were a shipwreck survivor adrift in the ocean who washed ashore. Edo-period obake karuta card depicting an umib≈çzu Usually called the \\"sea monk\\" (umi means sea and b≈çzu means monk), umib≈çzu has no ties to religion in any of its actions or sightings. Victims of this y≈çkai are random and have no ties to any action or belief. Sailors who were attacked were of no specific sect or religion as they are only ever described as pitiable sailors, the victims of an attack.

Warblade starred in two of his own miniseries, Warblade: Endangered Species in 1995 and The Razors Edge: Warblade in 2004/2005. Fictional character biography Warblade is the special codename picked by Reno Bryce, a long-green-haired artist. In his youth, Reno's parents were killed by the alien Daemonites. Reno survived and swore vengeance against them, dedicating his life to the martial arts to avenge them. He was kidnapped by the organization known as Cyberdata, brainwashed and transformed into a member of their strike team, the S.H.O.C.s. His teammate Misery used her powers to make him think that he was in love with her and quickly changed the focus of her manipulations to Ripclaw. She was revealed to be a traitor and Warblade killed her. After this, Ripclaw attacked Reno, thinking that he was the traitor, as well for his feelings for Misery, and almost killed him. Reno was found bleeding in Gamorra by Jacob Marlowe. He was saved by Jacob, and joined his Daemonite hunting team, the WildC.A.T.s. Like many of the WildC.A.T.s, Reno turned out to be half human and half Kherubim, (also known as a \\"Gifted One\\" for his match of human/Kherubim parents) a race of aliens that had fought the Daemonites for millennia. Warblade met Ripclaw (at this time a member of the Cyberforce) again and after quite some fighting between their teams and the two men themselves, Ripclaw finally saw through all the lies and deception upon Misery's defeat and realized that it was Misery who was the traitor. After the realization that Warblade had not been lying at all, and had been trying to help him the entire time, they became friends and allies. During his time with the WildC.A.T.s, Reno fought Pike, a half human, half Kherubim assassin. During a Native American ritual, Pike had taken the drug peyote and had a vision of himself killing a WildC.A.T.s member, a goal he would dedicate the rest of his life to. Their first fight ended indecisive. Reno went with the WildC.A.T.s to Khera, home of the Kherubim, where he met other shapeshifters like himself. He became an apprentice to the ancient shapeshifter Lord Proteus at the Shaper's Guild and learned many new ways to use his powers. He was disappointed when fellow WildC.A.T.s members Voodoo and Spartan uncovered the darker side of Kheran society. The WildC.A.T.s left Khera soon afterwards and returned home. Back home, Reno stayed with the team and began a relationship with Jules, Emp's assistant. Soon afterwards the team disbanded following the apparent death of their teammate Zealot. Reno retired and focused on his art. Pike hadn't forgotten his vision though. He attempted to kill Warblade and managed to disperse Warblade's molecules with an explosion that also killed Reno's girlfriend, Jules. Reno was able to literally pull himself back together and wanted revenge. He tracked Pike to Sarajevo, where they fought again. This time Warblade won and he killed Pike and added the final insult to the dying Pike: even if Pike had killed Warblade, he would have failed his quest, because the WildC.A.T.s had been disbanded for months. Afterwards he fell into a state of depression, that eventually led to the loss of his powers and his hands. After a little soul searching, some violent confrontations that almost led to his death, and an experimental drug given to him by the scientist responsible for suppressing his alien genes, he regained his powers. Reno returned to New York City and retired as a superhero. He became a full-time artist again, though he still met up with his teammate Grifter from time to time. He was forced to use his powers again during one of his expositions, when the Kherubim Brotherhood of the Sword turned a large part of New York's population into bloodthirsty creatures. He appeared briefly during the Captain Atom: Armageddon storyline, before the new Void entity Nikola Hanssen rebooted the Wildstorm Universe into WorldStorm. WildCats vol. 4 Warblade is one of the several WildCats that Hadrian has managed to recruit; under the black- ops codename of \\"Cutlery Kid,\\" he is deep in Kaizen Gamorra's extraterrestrial colony, providing intelligence back to Spartan on Earth. The New 52 Warblade has been announced to have a role in the new series, The Ravagers as Rose Wilson's partner. Warblade is one of the chief members of the Ravagers, the personal army for N.O.W.H.E.R.E.. As such, he follows the orders of N.O.W.H.E.R.E.'s leader Harvest. During the Culling, Warblade was among the members of the Ravagers that tested the survivors of the kill-or-be-killed tournament. During the altercation, several test subjects of the Colony escaped. Along with Rose Wilson, Warblade was tasked with tracking down some of the escapees, as well as to kill Caitlin Fairchild. He is killed by Deathstroke.Ravagers #1 In other media * Warblade appeared in the Wildcats animated series. His voice was provided by Dean McDermott. Here Warblade discovered his powers when he becomes part of the group, in the first episode. Because of this, he was the group's rookie, a position occupied by Voodoo in the comic book. While still an expert martial artist, he's also a computer expert which becomes useful in the overall plot. * Warblade stars in a solo mini-comic series called Warblade: Endangered Species (#1-4). Warblade makes a trip once a year to Japan, to hone his Martial Arts skills, although this time, he's traveling with the intentions of killing his former best friend‚ÄîOne who has been possessed by a Daemonite during their time in Cyberdata together.

The main approach road ran from the end of Deansgate, near Manchester Cathedral, passing over the River Irwell, the Manchester-Salford boundary and Chapel Street; a second approach road led up from Blackfriars Road. Most of the station was in Salford, with only the 1929 extension to platform 3 east of the Irwell in Manchester. Construction and opening The station was built by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and opened on 30 June 1884. The station had five platforms: 1 and 2 were bays and 3, 4 and 5 were through. Platforms 4 and 5 were reached by a footbridge from near the station entrance. The opening of Exchange allowed the LNWR to vacate Manchester Victoria station to the east, which it (and its predecessors, including the Liverpool and Manchester Railway) had shared with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (and its predecessors) since 4 May 1844. From 16 April 1929, Exchange had a platform link with the adjacent Victoria, when an eastward extension of platform 3 over the Irwell bridge was opened, meeting Victoria's platform 11, thus creating Europe's longest platform at ; it could accommodate three trains at once. Eastbound goods train in 1966 Services Exchange station served trains to Liverpool Lime Street, Huddersfield, Leeds, Hull Paragon and Newcastle Central; also Warrington Bank Quay, Chester and North Wales. Local LNWR passenger trains operated via Walkden to Bolton Great Moor Street and via Tyldesley to Wigan North Western. View westward, along Platforms 2/3 in 1966 The station originally provided alternative services from Manchester to London Euston. Between 1884 and 1943, the Great Western Railway operated a competing passenger train service from Chester General station via Frodsham, Warrington Bank Quay and Eccles to Manchester Exchange. Second World War damage The station suffered hits by several German incendiary bombs during the Christmas 1940 Manchester Blitz. On 22 December, the station roof was severely damaged, portions of which were never replaced. Fires took extensive hold on the building which could not be re-opened for passengers until 13 January 1941. Closure The railway station was closed on 5 May 1969 and all remaining services were redirected to Manchester Victoria. Despite closure, the station remained operational for newspaper trains until the 1980s. Manchester produced several 'northern editions' until the newspaper revolution. The nighttime operation was very busy with several trains being loaded and readied for departure to various trans-Pennine destinations (Halifax / Huddersfield / Leeds / York etc.). After many years of remaining relatively intact (with trains still running beneath the train shed until the track layout was redesigned), it continued to operate as a car park for some years. In July 2017, Q-Park opened a brand new car park called Deansgate North, restoring the original red brickwork of the Exchange Station.

Associated with the dawn, they are described as youthful divine twin horsemen in the Rigveda, travelling in a chariot drawn by horses that are never weary. They are known for rescuing people and aiding them in various situations.  Origin  The A≈õvins are an instance of the Proto-Indo-European divine horse twins. Reflexes in other Indo-European historics include the Baltic A≈°vieniai, the Greek Castor and Pollux; and possibly the English Hengist and Horsa, and the Welsh Bran and Manawydan. The first mention of the Nasatya twins is from the Mitanni documents of the second millennium BCE, where they are invoked in a treaty between Suppiluliuma and Shattiwaza, respectively kings of the Hittites and the Mitanni.KBo 1 1. . Excerpt http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/suppiluliuma_shattiwaza_treaty.htm  Etymology and epithets  Sukanya praying to Aswini kumaras to reveal her husband's identity In the Rigveda, the A≈õvins are always referred to in the dual, and do not have individual names, although Vedic texts differentiate between the two A≈õvins: \\"one of you is respected as the victorious lord of Sumakha, and the other as the fortunate son of heaven\\" (RV 1.181.4). They are called several times div√≥ n√°pƒÅtƒÅ, \\"grandsons of Dya√∫s (the sky-god)\\". The twin gods are also referred to as NƒÅÃÅsatyƒÅ (possibly \\"saviours\\"; a derivate of nasat√≠, \\"safe return home\\"), a name that appears 99 times in the Rigveda. The epithet probably derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *nes- (\\"to return home (safely)\\"), with cognates in the Avestan NƒÅÃä≈ãhaiŒ∏ya, the name of a demon, as a result of a Zoroastrian religious reformation that degraded the status of prior deities, in the Greek hero Nestor, and in the Gothic verb nasjan (\\"save, heal\\").  Associations  The A≈õvins are often associated with rescuing mortals and bringing them back to life. Rebha was bound, stabbed, and cast into the waters for nine days and ten nights before being saved by the twins. He was explicitly described as \\"dead\\" (mam·πõvƒÅÃÅ·πÉsam) when the twins \\"raised (him) up\\" (√∫d airayatam) to save him (RV 10.39.9). Similarly, Bhujyu was saved after his father or evil companions abandoned him at sea, when the twins ‚Äú[brought] (him) home from the dead ancestors‚Äù (niv√°hantƒÅ pit·πõÃÅbhya ƒÅÃÅ, 1.119.4). The Rigveda also describes the A≈õvins as \\"bringing light\\": they gave \\"light-bringing help\\" (sv√†rvatƒ´r‚Ä¶≈´tƒ´ÃÅr, 1.119.8) to Bhujyu, and \\"raised (Rebha) up to see the sun\\" (√∫d‚Ä¶a√≠rayata·πÉ sv√†r d·πõ≈õ√©, 1.112.5). The A≈õvins also raised up Vandana, rescued Atri from a fissure in the earth and its heat, found Vi·π£·πáƒÅp≈´ and returned him to his father, restored the youth of CyavƒÅna and Kali, brought Kamady≈´ as a wife for Vimada, gave a son to Vadhrimatƒ´ (whose husband was a steer), restored the eyesight of ·πöjrƒÅ≈õva, replaced the foot of Vi≈õpalƒÅ with a metal one, made the cow ≈öayu give milk, gave a horse to Pedu, and put a horse‚Äôs head on Dadhya√±c. The A≈õvins are associated with honey, which was likely what was offered to them in a sacrifice. They are the chief deities in the Pravargya rite, in which they are offered hot milk. They are also associated with the morning pressing of Soma, because they are dual deities, along with Indra and VƒÅyu and Mitra and Varu·πáa. They also are the last deities to receive Soma in the AtirƒÅtra, or Overnight Soma Ritual. The A≈õvins are invoked at dawn, the time of their principal sacrifice, and have a close connection with the dawn goddess, U·π£as: she is bidden to awaken them (8.9.17), they follow her in their chariot (8.5.2), she is born when they hitch their steeds (10.39.12), and their chariot is once said to arrive before her (1.34.10). They are consequently associated with the \\"return from darkness\\": the twins are called ‚Äúdarkness slayers‚Äù (tamoh√°nƒÅ, 3.39.3), they are invoked with the formula \\"you who have made light for mankind\\" (yƒÅÃÅv‚Ä¶jy√≥tir j√°nƒÅya cakr√°thu·∏•, 1.92.17), and their horses and chariot are described as \\"uncovering the covered darkness\\" (apor·πáuv√°ntas t√°ma ƒÅÃÅ p√°rƒ´v·πõtam, 4.45.2). The chariot of the A≈õvins is repeatedly mentioned in the Rigveda. Their chariot has three chariot-boxes, three wheels, three turnings, and three wheel rims. The emphasis on the number 3 is symbolized in the sacrifice with its three soma pressings. The chariot is pulled by bulls, buffaloes, horses, birds, geese, and falcons. The chariot allows the A≈õvins to be quick and mobile and travel to a number of places, which is necessary to fulfill their role of rescuing people. S≈´ryƒÅ, the daughter of the Sun, is sometimes mentioned as the wife of the A≈õvins, and she rides with them in their chariot. Birth of Ashwinikumar  Rigveda The A≈õvins are mentioned 398 times in the Rigveda, with more than 50 hymns specifically dedicated to them: 1.3, 1.22, 1.34, 1.46‚Äì47, 1.112, 1.116‚Äì120, 1.157‚Äì158, 1.180‚Äì184, 2.20, 3.58, 4.43‚Äì45, 5.73‚Äì78, 6.62‚Äì63, 7.67‚Äì74, 8.5, 8.8‚Äì10, 8.22, 8.26, 8.35, 8.57, 8.73, 8.85‚Äì87, 10.24, 10.39‚Äì41, 10.143.  Puranas and Mahabharata Later Hindu texts like the Mahabharata and the Puranas, relate that the Ashwini Kumar twins, who were Raja -Vaidya (royal physicians) to the Devas during Vedic times, first prepared the Chyawanprash formulation for Rishi Chyavana at his Ashram on Dhosi Hill near Narnaul, Haryana, India, hence the name Chyawanprash.Panda, H; Handbook on Ayurvedic Medicines With Formulae, Processes And Their Uses, 2004, p10 In the epic Mahabharata, King Pandu's wife Madri is granted a son by each Ashvin and bears the twins Nakula and Sahadeva who, are known as the Pandavas.Hindu World: An Encyclopedic Survey of Hinduism.

Artistic work Hearman's works are characterised by surreal juxtapositions, eerie light, and strong emotive emphasis. There are recurring themes of floating heads (both of the human and animal kind), sleek aeroplanes, floral close-ups, and limitless roads. Hearman is particularly vague about the meanings of her works, preferring to let the viewers make their own interpretations. This is why she leaves all her works untitled. Influences Growing up in suburban Croydon, Hearman took to painting and drawing at a young age. As a child she had limited ability to travel, so her initial subjects were the landscape around her.

In 1982 the bank's name was changed to the State Bank of NSW and so was its mandate, to that of a standard commercial bank, although it had been operating in this way for some years. It did, however, keep its famous slogan 'We do more for you personally'. The Bank was 'corporatised' in 1990, under the State Owned Corporations Act 1989 (NSW) and the State Bank (Corporatisation) Act 1989 (NSW). On 14 May 1990 the existing State Bank was dissolved, and all of its assets and business undertaking were vested in an incorporated State Bank, limited by shares.Commissioner of Taxation v Bank of Western Australia Ltd; Commissioner of Taxation v State Bank of New South Wales (1995) Acquisitions In 1994 the bank was sold to Colonial, a financial services company.

Valentino Zeichen (24 March 1938 - 5 July 2016) was an Italian poet and writer. Biography Zeichen's origins are somewhat obscure, and his year of birth is unclear. In German language the word Zeichen means \\"sign\\", and it has been suggested that his birth name is Giuseppe Mario Moses, an almost certainly Jewish surname. Zeichen, however, denied this claim. Born in Fiume, Italy, (now Rijeka, Croatia), the son of an Italian-speaking Istrian gardener, Zeichen moved with his family to Parma as a refugee. In 1950 they moved to Rome, where Zeichen lived for the rest of his life, next to the Via Flaminia. He began to write poems at the age of 18, influenced by surrealist authors like Breton and Pr√©vert. His first work was published in 1969 on the literary review Nuova Corrente. Zeichen's first novel, Tana per tutti, was released in 1983. Zeichen's poetry has been praised for its ability to quickly hook the reader, and has a subtle humour within it. A literary award named after him, the Premio Zeichen, is held every December in Rome. Zeichen himself was the only member of the jury.

Basic research In 1992, Haley and a colleague, upon examining cerebrospinal fluid, reported levels of glutamine synthetase considerably higher in cases of Alzheimer's disease than in a control group, and suggested that this could be a biomarker to aid diagnosis. In 2005, Haley reproduced findings of gold salt removing mercury from molecules, and inferred support for the possibility of gold salts removing mercury from biological proteins. Yet Haley noted that the gold salts could themselves be toxic, and called for the extreme caution before applying gold salts in medical treatment.

The population was 4,544 (2005 estimate) in a total area of 451.6 km¬≤. The elevation of the municipal seat is 650 meters. Santo Ant√¥nio is a large producer of poultry. Location Santo Ant√¥nio is 190 kilometers from the state capital, Goi√¢nia and is part of the Sudoeste de Goi√°s Microregion. The highway connection from Goi√¢nia is BR-060. It has boundaries with the following municipalities: *north: Para√∫na *south: Santa Helena de Goi√°s *east: Acre√∫na *west: Rio Verde Geographical information The climate is moist tropical with high night-time temperatures. The rainy season is from October to March and the dry season is from April to September. Because of the hot and dry climate, the main vegetation is sparse cerrado. In the valleys there are still forests with sucupira, aroeira, pinda√≠ba and other species of trees. Santo Ant√¥nio da Barra is bathed by a vast river network, formed by the Verd√£o, which separates the municipality from Acre√∫na and Para√∫na; Verdinho, on the border with Rio Verde; and Ribeir√£o Lage, which forms the boundary with Santa Helena de Goi√°s. Electric energy is furnished by the Hidrel√©trica de Cachoeira Dourada, on the Parana√≠ba. History Occupation of the region began in 1951 when Joaquim Domingos da Silva and his wife Alventina Borges da Silva fixed a cross in devotion to Santo Ant√¥nio. In 1963 the settlement was elevated to the status of district of Rio Verde The first municipal school, Escola Municipal Ant√¥nio Gouv√™ia de Morais, was built in 1976 with the secondary school, Irm√£os Messias da Costa, being built in 1983.

While magnetic and optical data storage devices rely on individual bits being stored as distinct magnetic or optical changes on the surface of the recording medium, holographic data storage records information throughout the volume of the medium and is capable of recording multiple images in the same area utilizing light at different angles. Additionally, whereas magnetic and optical data storage records information a bit at a time in a linear fashion, holographic storage is capable of recording and reading millions of bits in parallel, enabling data transfer rates greater than those attained by traditional optical storage. Recording data Holographic data storage contains information using an optical interference pattern within a thick, photosensitive optical material. Light from a single laser beam is divided into two, or more, separate optical patterns of dark and light pixels. By adjusting the reference beam angle, wavelength, or media position, a multitude of holograms (theoretically, several thousands) can be stored on a single volume. Reading data The stored data is read through the reproduction of the same reference beam used to create the hologram. The reference beam's light is focused on the photosensitive material, illuminating the appropriate interference pattern, the light diffracts on the interference pattern, and projects the pattern onto a detector. The detector is capable of reading the data in parallel, over one million bits at once, resulting in the fast data transfer rate. Files on the holographic drive can be accessed in less than 0.2 seconds. Longevity Holographic data storage can provide companies a method to preserve and archive information. The write-once, read many (WORM) approach to data storage would ensure content security, preventing the information from being overwritten or modified. Manufacturers believe this technology can provide safe storage for content without degradation for more than 50 years, far exceeding current data storage options. Counterpoints to this claim are that the evolution of data reader technology has ‚Äì in the last couple of decades ‚Äì changed every ten years. If this trend continues, it therefore follows that being able to store data for 50‚Äì100 years on one format is irrelevant, because you would migrate the data to a new format after only ten years. However, claimed longevity of storage has, in the past, proven to be a key indicator of shorter-term reliability of storage media. Current optical formats ‚Äì such as CD ‚Äì have largely lived up to the original longevity claims (where reputable media makes are used) and have proved to be more reliable shorter-term data carriers than the floppy disk and DAT media they displaced. Terms used Sensitivity refers to the extent of refractive index modulation produced per unit of exposure. Diffraction efficiency is proportional to the square of the index modulation times the effective thickness. The dynamic range determines how many holograms may be multiplexed in a single volume data. Spatial light modulators (SLM) are pixelated input devices (liquid crystal panels), used to imprint the data to be stored on the object beam. Technical aspects Like other media, holographic media is divided into write once (where the storage medium undergoes some irreversible change), and rewritable media (where the change is reversible). Rewritable holographic storage can be achieved via the photorefractive effect in crystals: right *Mutually coherent light from two sources creates an interference pattern in the media. These two sources are called the reference beam and the signal beam. *Where there is constructive interference the light is bright and electrons can be promoted from the valence band to the conduction band of the material (since the light has given the electrons energy to jump the energy gap). The positively charged vacancies they leave are called holes and they must be immobile in rewritable holographic materials. Where there is destructive interference, there is less light and few electrons are promoted. *Electrons in the conduction band are free to move in the material. They will experience two opposing forces that determine how they move. The first force is the coulomb force between the electrons and the positive holes that they have been promoted from. This force encourages the electrons to stay put or move back to where they came from. The second is the pseudo-force of diffusion that encourages them to move to areas where electrons are less dense. If the coulomb forces are not too strong, the electrons will move into the dark areas. *Beginning immediately after being promoted, there is a chance that a given electron will recombine with a hole and move back into the valence band. The faster the rate of recombination, the fewer the number of electrons that will have the chance to move into the dark areas. This rate will affect the strength of the hologram. *After some electrons have moved into the dark areas and recombined with holes there, there is a permanent space charge field between the electrons that moved to the dark spots and the holes in the bright spots. This leads to a change in the index of refraction due to the electro-optic effect. right When the information is to be retrieved or read out from the hologram, only the reference beam is necessary. The beam is sent into the material in exactly the same way as when the hologram was written. As a result of the index changes in the material that were created during writing, the beam splits into two parts. One of these parts recreates the signal beam where the information is stored. Something like a CCD camera can be used to convert this information into a more usable form. Holograms can theoretically store one bit per cubic block the size of the wavelength of light in writing. For example, light from a helium‚Äìneon laser is red, 632.8 nm wavelength light. Using light of this wavelength, perfect holographic storage could store 500 megabytes per cubic millimeter. At the extreme end of the laser spectrum, fluorine excimer laser at 157 nm could store 30 gigabytes per cubic millimeter. In practice, the data density would be much lower, for at least four reasons: * The need to add error-correction * The need to accommodate imperfections or limitations in the optical system * Economic payoff (higher densities may cost disproportionately more to achieve) * Design technique limitations‚Äîa problem currently faced in magnetic Hard Drives wherein magnetic domain configuration prevents manufacture of disks that fully utilize the theoretical limits of the technology. Despite those limitations, it is possible to optimize the storage capacity using all-optical signal processing techniques.N. C. P√©gard and J. W. Fleischer, \\"Optimizing holographic data storage using a fractional Fourier transform\\", Opt. Lett. 36, 2551‚Äì2553 (2011) Unlike current storage technologies that record and read one data bit at a time, holographic memory writes and reads data in parallel in a single flash of light. Two-color recording Set up for holographic recording For two-color holographic recording, the reference and signal beam fixed to a particular wavelength (green, red or IR) and the sensitizing/gating beam is a separate, shorter wavelength (blue or UV). The sensitizing/gating beam is used to sensitize the material before and during the recording process, while the information is recorded in the crystal via the reference and signal beams. It is shone intermittently on the crystal during the recording process for measuring the diffracted beam intensity. Readout is achieved by illumination with the reference beam alone. Hence the readout beam with a longer wavelength would not be able to excite the recombined electrons from the deep trap centers during readout, as they need the sensitizing light with shorter wavelength to erase them. Usually, for two-color holographic recording, two different dopants are required to promote trap centers, which belong to transition metal and rare earth elements and are sensitive to certain wavelengths. By using two dopants, more trap centers would be created in the lithium niobate crystal. Namely a shallow and a deep trap would be created. The concept now is to use the sensitizing light to excite electrons from the deep trap farther from the valence band to the conduction band and then to recombine at the shallow traps nearer to the conduction band. The reference and signal beam would then be used to excite the electrons from the shallow traps back to the deep traps. The information would hence be stored in the deep traps. Reading would be done with the reference beam since the electrons can no longer be excited out of the deep traps by the long wavelength beam. Effect of annealing For a doubly doped lithium niobate (LiNbO3) crystal there exists an optimum oxidation/reduction state for desired performance. This optimum depends on the doping levels of shallow and deep traps as well as the annealing conditions for the crystal samples. This optimum state generally occurs when 95‚Äì98% of the deep traps are filled. In a strongly oxidized sample holograms cannot be easily recorded and the diffraction efficiency is very low. This is because the shallow trap is completely empty and the deep trap is also almost devoid of electrons. In a highly reduced sample on the other hand, the deep traps are completely filled and the shallow traps are also partially filled. This results in very good sensitivity (fast recording) and high diffraction efficiency due to the availability of electrons in the shallow traps. However, during readout, all the deep traps get filled quickly and the resulting holograms reside in the shallow traps where they are totally erased by further readout. Hence after extensive readout the diffraction efficiency drops to zero and the hologram stored cannot be fixed. Development and marketing In 1975, Hitachi introduced a video disc system in which chrominance, luminance and sound information were encoded holographically. Each frame was recorded as a 1 mm diameter hologram on a 305 mm disc, while a laser beam read out the hologram from three angles. Developed from the pioneering work on holography in photorefractive media and holographic data storage of Gerard A. Alphonse, InPhase conducted public demonstrations of the a prototype commercial storage device, at the National Association of Broadcasters 2005 (NAB) convention in Las Vegas, at the Maxell Corporation of America booth. The three main companies involved in developing holographic memory, as of 2002, were InPhase and Polaroid spinoff Aprilis in the United States, and Optware in Japan. Although holographic memory has been discussed since the 1960s, and has been touted for near-term commercial application at least since 2001, it has yet to convince critics that it can find a viable market. As of 2002, planned holographic products did not aim to compete head to head with hard drives, but instead to find a market niche based on virtues such as speed of access. InPhase Technologies, after several announcements and subsequent delays in 2006 and 2007, announced that it would soon be introducing a flagship product. InPhase went out of business in February 2010 and had its assets seized by the state of Colorado for back taxes. The company had reportedly gone through $100 million but the lead investor was unable to raise more capital.‚ÄúInPhase delays Tapestry holographic storage solution to late 2009‚Äù. Engadget.

He was music director of the Seattle Symphony for 22 years (1954‚Äì76). In that time he added more than 75 works, made recordings, premiered new pieces and led the orchestra on several tours. He expanded the orchestra's series of family and suburban outreach concerts. He is also known for his numerous transcriptions and arrangements for viola. Career Katims was born in Brooklyn and educated at Columbia University. His parents were from Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father changed the family surname from Katimsky some years after he arrived in New York. He started as a violinist but the Belgian-born violist, conductor and educator Leon Barzin advised him to switch to viola. Katims played with a number of chamber music ensembles, including the New York Piano Quartet, and was an extra violist with the notable Budapest String Quartet with which he collaborated for 15 years and made six highly regarded recordings, beginning in 1941. He played at various festivals like the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico. Katims gave viola master classes in China and Israel, taught at various colleges such as Juilliard in New York and Northwestern in suburban Chicago, as well as the University of Washington, and transcribed and edited viola music. He joined the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1943, replacing the well-known William Primrose on the first-desk of the section. During his decade with the orchestra, Katims developed a close relationship with conductor Arturo Toscanini and became his assistant. He conducted orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Boston Symphony, London Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra and Montreal Symphony. He organized a series of chamber music concerts titled Candlelight Musicales, in the Spanish Ballroom of the Olympic Hotel, with visiting soloists such as violinist Isaac Stern, cellist Leonard Rose and pianists Leon Fleisher and Claudio Arrau. Katims often would play his viola and his wife Virginia, the cello. One of Katims' major accomplishments in Seattle was the conversion of the Civic Auditorium into the Opera House. His leadership was crucial in securing public money for the project, the auditorium destined to be shared by Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet as well as the Seattle Symphony. In 1966, Katims was named Seattle's 'First Citizen' by the Seattle Real Estate Board,\\"Realtors Name Milton Katims 'First Citizen'\\" The Seattle Times, 6 December 1966, p. 1 and his portrait was featured on the cover of the Seattle telephone book. From 1976 to 1985 Katims served as Artistic Director of the University of Houston School of Music. His influence enabled the school to attract and hire several notable musicians, such as Carlisle Floyd, Elena Nikolaidi, and Abbey Simon, to the faculty. Later years/death The Pleasure Was Ours, a joint memoir by Katims and his wife Virginia, was published in 2004. He died in Shoreline, Washington in 2006, aged 96.

It is the largest botanical garden in Australia, specializing in native plants, with a collection of over 4000 species. Officially opened in 1988, it was known as Mount Annan Botanic Garden, until 2011. History and management The traditional custodians of the land now occupied by the gardens were the Dharawal indigenous Australian people. Later, it became dairy pasture land, before the land was acquired by the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust in 1984 and The Garden was opened to the public in 1988 by the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. The Gardens are managed by the Botanic Gardens Trust trading the Botanic Gardens & Centennial Parklands, that also has responsibility for the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney and the Blue Mountains Botanic Garden at . The Trust is a division of the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. The original name was Mount Annan Botanic Garden and the name was changed in 2011 to The Australian Botanic Garden, Mount Annan. From 2014, Save a Species Walk has been conducted to raise funds to support saving specific species. Description The garden consists of Australian Bushland with cultivated displays. It is the Australian Plant Garden of the Botanic Gardens Trust and includes not only picnic areas and over of walking tracks, but also a native flora research facility and the NSW PlantBank. Its themed features include: * Woodland Conservation Area * Woodland Picnic Area * Stolen Generations Memorial * The Australian PlantBank * Visitor Centre, Cafe & Playground * Lakeside Lawn * Connections Garden * Fig Tree Wedding Arboretum & Knot * Sundial of Human Involvement * Wollemi Discovery Walk * Big Idea Garden * Mountain Bike Trail * Wattle Garden * Banksia Garden * Callitris Grove * Kurrajong Arboretum * Mallee Eucalypts * The Blue Tree The Woodland Picnic Area highlights the endangered Cumberland Plain Woodland found within the estate. The Garden is also a haven for over 160 species of birds as well as wallaroos, wallabies and kangaroos that call the Garden home. With the rapid growth occurring in the Macarthur region it is fast becoming a wildlife corridor for our local native fauna. Mount Annan Botanic Garden covers a vast area and is accessible by two loop roads that traverse the site, however visitors will miss the beauty of the location if they do not stop throughout and walk around the different garden locations. From the top of Sundial Hill visitors have spectacular 360¬∞ views of the surrounding countryside including views of the Sydney skyline. Since inception, the Garden has undergone intense development including major changes to what was once the Terrace Garden that has been renamed to the Connections Garden, which is now the showcase of the estate. SeedBank The SeedBank was established in 1986 as an integral part of Mount Annan Botanic Garden. Its initial role was to provide wild collected seed for the development of this new Garden, particularly the Garden‚Äôs major collections of wattles, eucalypts and plants in the family Proteaceae. The NSW Seedbank continues to support the ongoing development of Mount Annan Botanic Garden, but today the Seedbank also plays a major role internationally in conservation and research. Plantbank A major new PlantBank building was opened in October 2013 by Her Excellency Professor Marie Bashir , at the time the Governor of New South Wales. Wollemi Pine Wollemi Pine protected by a steel cage The conservation and research includes the endangered Wollemi Pine that was discovered in 1994 in the Wollemi National Park, (part of the Greater Blue Mountains area), north-west of Sydney. The discovery of the species is considered to be one of the major botanical finds in recent history; it was previously thought to be extinct with only fossil records remaining. After the discovery, on or about 10 September 1994, the Wollemi Pine was first cultivated at Mount Annan in 1995.Dept of Environment and Climate Change, New South Wales official site, Botanic Gardens Trust. Prior to them becoming commercially available the trees were so valuable that they were grown inside steel cages to protect them from thieves. As part of the Conservation Management Plan for the pine, Mount Annan Botanic Garden is now home to the only publicly accessible collection of first generation pines (clonal replicas), in the Wollemi Walk of Discovery. The Walk was opened in March 2006 and is currently home to sixty of these Wollemi Pines. Lakes and weather station There are five major lakes in the Garden. Lake Gilinganadum and Lake Nadungamba are in the Northern section, passed by vehicles entering the Garden. In the centre are Lake Sedgwick and Lake Fitzpatrick; whilst in the South is the Wattle Garden lake. Beyond the Wattle Garden lie three even smaller unnamed lakes. To the east of Lake Nadungamba lies the Campbelltown Weather station, operated by the Bureau of Meteorology. Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living At the northern end of the Garden is the Macarthur Centre for Sustainable Living, which educates the local community on organic gardening. The Centre is home to a large community garden for those wishing to grow their own vegetables and other plants, but who have no space in their own backyard. The aim of the Centre is to promote sustainability, social equity, cultural diversity and economic stability. The site includes interactive displays of alternative energy production and use, waste water recycling, water and energy efficiency, waste avoidance and management. The facility functions to demonstrate how sustainability can be achieved at the individual household, community and regional levels.

Visual search can take place with or without eye movements. The ability to consciously locate an object or target amongst a complex array of stimuli has been extensively studied over the past 40 years. Practical examples of using visual search can be seen in everyday life, such as when one is picking out a product on a supermarket shelf, when animals are searching for food among piles of leaves, when trying to find a friend in a large crowd of people, or simply when playing visual search games such as Where's Wally? Much previous literature on visual search used reaction time in order to measure the time it takes to detect the target amongst its distractors. An example of this could be a green square (the target) amongst a set of red circles (the distractors). However, reaction time measurements do not always distinguish between the role of attention and other factors: a long reaction time might be the result of difficulty directing attention to the target, or slowed decision-making processes or slowed motor responses after attention is already directed to the target and the target has already been detected. Many visual search paradigms have therefore used eye movement as a means to measure the degree of attention given to stimuli. However, eyes can move independently of attention, and therefore eye movement measures do not completely capture the role of attention. Search types  Feature search  Feature search (also known as \\"disjunctive\\" or \\"efficient\\" search) is a visual search process that focuses on identifying a previously requested target amongst distractors that differ from the target by a unique visual feature such as color, shape, orientation, or size. An example of a feature search task is asking a participant to identify a white square (target) surrounded by black squares (distractors). In this type of visual search, the distractors are characterized by the same visual features. The efficiency of feature search in regards to reaction time(RT) and accuracy depends on the \\"pop out\\" effect, bottom-up processing, and parallel processing. However, the efficiency of feature search is unaffected by the number of distractors present. The \\"pop out\\" effect is an element of feature search that characterizes the target's ability to stand out from surrounding distractors due to its unique feature. Bottom-up processing, which is the processing of information that depends on input from the environment, explains how one utilizes feature detectors to process characteristics of the stimuli and differentiate a target from its distractors. This draw of visual attention towards the target due to bottom-up processes is known as \\"saliency.\\" Lastly, parallel processing is the mechanism that then allows one's feature detectors to work simultaneously in identifying the target.  Conjunction search  Conjunction search (also known as inefficient or serial search) is a visual search process that focuses on identifying a previously requested target surrounded by distractors possessing one or more common visual features with the target itself. An example of a conjunction search task is having a person identify a red X (target) amongst distractors composed of black Xs (same shape) and red Os (same color). Unlike feature search, conjunction search involves distractors (or groups of distractors) that may differ from each other but exhibit at least one common feature with the target. The efficiency of conjunction search in regards to reaction time(RT) and accuracy is dependent on the distractor-ratio and the number of distractors present. As the distractors represent the differing individual features of the target more equally amongst themselves(distractor- ratio effect), reaction time(RT) increases and accuracy decreases. As the number of distractors present increases, the reaction time(RT) increases and the accuracy decreases. However, with practice the original reaction time(RT) restraints of conjunction search tend to show improvement. In the early stages of processing, conjunction search utilizes bottom-up processes to identify pre-specified features amongst the stimuli. These processes are then overtaken by a more serial process of consciously evaluating the indicated features of the stimuli in order to properly allocate one's focal spatial attention towards the stimulus that most accurately represents the target. In many cases, top-down processing affects conjunction search by eliminating stimuli that are incongruent with one's previous knowledge of the target-description, which in the end allows for more efficient identification of the target. An example of the effect of top-down processes on a conjunction search task is when searching for a red 'K' among red 'Cs' and black 'Ks', individuals ignore the black letters and focus on the remaining red letters in order to decrease the set size of possible targets and, therefore, more efficiently identify their target.  Real world visual search  In everyday situations, people are most commonly searching their visual fields for targets that are familiar to them. When it comes to searching for familiar stimuli, top-down processing allows one to more efficiently identify targets with greater complexity than can be represented in a feature or conjunction search task. In a study done to analyze the reverse-letter effect, which is the idea that identifying the asymmetric letter among symmetric letters is more efficient than its reciprocal, researchers concluded that individuals more efficiently recognize an asymmetric letter among symmetric letters due to top-down processes. Top- down processes allowed study participants to access prior knowledge regarding shape recognition of the letter N and quickly eliminate the stimuli that matched their knowledge. In the real world, one must use prior knowledge everyday in order to accurately and efficiently locate objects such as phones, keys, etc. among a much more complex array of distractors. Despite this complexity, visual search with complex objects (and search for categories of objects, such as \\"phone\\", based on prior knowledge) appears to rely on the same active scanning processes as conjunction search with less complex, contrived laboratory stimuli, although global statistical information available in real-world scenes can also help people locate target objects. While bottom-up processes may come into play when identifying objects that are not as familiar to a person, overall top-down processing highly influences visual searches that occur in everyday life. Familiarity can play especially critical roles when parts of objects are not visible (as when objects are partly hidden from view because they are behind other objects). Visual information from hidden parts can be recalled from long-term memory and used to facilitate search for familiar objects. Reaction time slope It is also possible to measure the role of attention within visual search experiments by calculating the slope of reaction time over the number of distractors present, Generally, when high levels of attention are required when looking at a complex array of stimuli (conjunction search), the slope increases as the reaction times increase. For simple visual search tasks (feature search), the slope decreases due to reaction times being fast and requiring less attention. However, the use of reaction time slope to measure attention is controversial because non-attentional factors can also affect reaction time slope. Visual orienting and attention A photograph that simulates foveation One obvious way to select visual information is to turn towards it, also known as visual orienting. This may be a movement of the head and/or eyes towards the visual stimulus, called a saccade. Through a process called foveation, the eyes fixate on the object of interest, making the image of the visual stimulus fall on the fovea of the eye, the central part of the retina with the sharpest visual acuity. There are two types of orienting: *Exogenous orienting is the involuntary and automatic movement that occurs to direct one's visual attention toward a sudden disruption in his peripheral vision field. Attention is therefore externally guided by a stimulus, resulting in a reflexive saccade. *Endogenous orienting is the voluntary movement that occurs in order for one to focus visual attention on a goal-driven stimulus. Thus, the focus of attention of the perceiver can be manipulated by the demands of a task. A scanning saccade is triggered endogenously for the purpose of exploring the visual environment. A plot of the saccades made while reading text. The plot shows the path of eye movements and the size of the circles represents the time spent at any one location. Visual search relies primarily on endogenous orienting because participants have the goal to detect the presence or absence of a specific target object in an array of other distracting objects. Early research suggested that attention could be covertly (without eye movement) shifted to peripheral stimuli, but later studies found that small saccades (microsaccades) occur during these tasks, and that these eye movements are frequently directed towards the attended locations (whether or not there are visible stimuli). These findings indicate that attention plays a critical role in understanding visual search. Subsequently, competing theories of attention have come to dominate visual search discourse. The environment contains a vast amount of information. We are limited in the amount of information we are able to process at any one time, so it is therefore necessary that we have mechanisms by which extraneous stimuli can be filtered and only relevant information attended to. In the study of attention, psychologists distinguish between preattentitive and attentional processes. Preattentive processes are evenly distributed across all input signals, forming a kind of \\"low-level\\" attention. Attentional processes are more selective and can only be applied to specific preattentive input. A large part of the current debate in visual search theory centres on selective attention and what the visual system is capable of achieving without focal attention. Theory Feature integration theory (FIT) A popular explanation for the different reaction times of feature and conjunction searches is the feature integration theory (FIT), introduced by Treisman and Gelade in 1980. This theory proposes that certain visual features are registered early, automatically, and are coded rapidly in parallel across the visual field using preattentive processes. Experiments show that these features include luminance, colour, orientation, motion direction, and velocity, as well as some simple aspects of form. For example, a red X can be quickly found among any number of black Xs and Os because the red X has the discriminative feature of colour and will \\"pop out.\\" In contrast, this theory also suggests that in order to integrate two or more visual features belonging to the same object, a later process involving integration of information from different brain areas is needed and is coded serially using focal attention. For example, when locating an orange square among blue squares and orange triangles, neither the colour feature \\"orange\\" nor the shape feature \\"square\\" is sufficient to locate the search target. Instead, one must integrate information of both colour and shape to locate the target. Evidence that attention and thus later visual processing is needed to integrate two or more features of the same object is shown by the occurrence of illusory conjunctions, or when features do not combine correctly For example, if a display of a green X and a red O are flashed on a screen so briefly that the later visual process of a serial search with focal attention cannot occur, the observer may report seeing a red X and a green O. The FIT is a dichotomy because of the distinction between its two stages: the preattentive and attentive stages. Preattentive processes are those performed in the first stage of the FIT model, in which the simplest features of the object are being analyzed, such as color, size, and arrangement. The second attentive stage of the model incorporates cross-dimensional processing, and the actual identification of an object is done and information about the target object is put together. This theory has not always been what it is today; there have been disagreements and problems with its proposals that have allowed the theory to be amended and altered over time, and this criticism and revision has allowed it to become more accurate in its description of visual search. There have been disagreements over whether or not there is a clear distinction between feature detection and other searches that use a master map accounting for multiple dimensions in order to search for an object. Some psychologists support the idea that feature integration is completely separate from this type of master map search, whereas many others have decided that feature integration incorporates this use of a master map in order to locate an object in multiple dimensions. The FIT also explains that there is a distinction between the brain's processes that are being used in a parallel versus a focal attention task. Chan and Hayward have conducted multiple experiments supporting this idea by demonstrating the role of dimensions in visual search. While exploring whether or not focal attention can reduce the costs caused by dimension-switching in visual search, they explained that the results collected supported the mechanisms of the feature integration theory in comparison to other search-based approaches. They discovered that single dimensions allow for a much more efficient search regardless of the size of the area being searched, but once more dimensions are added it is much more difficult to efficiently search, and the bigger the area being searched the longer it takes for one to find the target. Guided search model A second main function of preattentive processes is to direct focal attention to the most \\"promising\\" information in the visual field. There are two ways in which these processes can be used to direct attention: bottom-up activation (which is stimulus-driven) and top-down activation (which is user-driven). In the guided search model by Jeremy Wolfe, information from top-down and bottom-up processing of the stimulus is used to create a ranking of items in order of their attentional priority. In a visual search, attention will be directed to the item with the highest priority. If that item is rejected, then attention will move on to the next item and the next, and so forth. The guided search theory follows that of parallel search processing. An activation map is a representation of visual space in which the level of activation at a location reflects the likelihood that the location contains a target. This likelihood is based on preattentive, featural information of the perceiver. According to the guided search model, the initial processing of basic features produces an activation map, with every item in the visual display having its own level of activation. Attention is demanded based on peaks of activation in the activation map in a search for the target. Visual search can proceed efficiently or inefficiently. During efficient search, performance is unaffected by the number of distractor items. The reaction time functions are flat, and the search is assumed to be a parallel search. Thus, in the guided search model, a search is efficient if the target generates the highest, or one of the highest activation peaks. For example, suppose someone is searching for red, horizontal targets. Feature processing would activate all red objects and all horizontal objects. Attention is then directed to items depending on their level of activation, starting with those most activated. This explains why search times are longer when distractors share one or more features with the target stimuli. In contrast, during inefficient search, the reaction time to identify the target increases linearly with the number of distractor items present. According to the guided search model, this is because the peak generated by the target is not one of the highest. Biological basis A pseudo-color image showing activation of the primary visual cortex during a perceptual task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) During visual search experiments the posterior parietal cortex has elicited much activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments for inefficient conjunction search, which has also been confirmed through lesion studies. Patients with lesions to the posterior parietal cortex show low accuracy and very slow reaction times during a conjunction search task but have intact feature search remaining to the ipsilesional (the same side of the body as the lesion) side of space. Ashbridge, Walsh, and Cowey in (1997) demonstrated that during the application of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to the right parietal cortex, conjunction search was impaired by 100 milliseconds after stimulus onset. This was not found during feature search. Nobre, Coull, Walsh and Frith (2003) identified using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that the intraparietal sulcus located in the superior parietal cortex was activated specifically to feature search and the binding of individual perceptual features as opposed to conjunction search. Conversely, the authors further identify that for conjunction search, the superior parietal lobe and the right angular gyrus elicit bilaterally during fMRI experiments. Visual search primarily activates areas of the parietal lobe. In contrast, Leonards, Sunaert, Vam Hecke and Orban (2000) identified that significant activation is seen during fMRI experiments in the superior frontal sulcus primarily for conjunction search. This research hypothesises that activation in this region may in fact reflect working memory for holding and maintaining stimulus information in mind in order to identify the target. Furthermore, significant frontal activation including the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were seen during positron emission tomography for attentional spatial representations during visual search. The same regions associated with spatial attention in the parietal cortex coincide with the regions associated with feature search. Furthermore, the frontal eye field (FEF) located bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex, plays a critical role in saccadic eye movememnts and the control of visual attention. Moreover, research into monkeys and single cell recording found that the superior colliculus is involved in the selection of the target during visual search as well as the initiation of movements. Conversely, it also suggested that activation in the superior colliculus results from disengaging attention, ensuring that the next stimulus can be internally represented. The ability to directly attend to a particular stimuli during visual search experiments has been linked to the pulvinar nucleus (located in the midbrain) while inhibiting attention to unattended stimuli. Conversely, Bender and Butter (1987) found that during testing on monkeys, no involvement of the pulvinar nucleus was identified during visual search tasks. There is evidence that the primary visual cortex (V1) creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide attention exogenously, and this V1 saliency map is read out by the superior colliculus which receives monosynaptic inputs from V1. Evolution There is a variety of speculation about the origin and evolution of visual search in humans. It has been shown that during visual exploration of complex natural scenes, both humans and nonhuman primates make highly stereotyped eye movements. Furthermore, chimpanzees have demonstrated improved performance in visual searches for upright human or dog faces, suggesting that visual search (particularly where the target is a face) is not peculiar to humans and that it may be a primal trait. Research has suggested that effective visual search may have developed as a necessary skill for survival, where being adept at detecting threats and identifying food was essential. Henri Rousseau, Jungle with Lion The importance of evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli was demonstrated in a study by LoBue and DeLoache (2008) in which children (and adults) were able to detect snakes more rapidly than other targets amongst distractor stimuli. However, some researchers question whether evolutionarily relevant threat stimuli are detected automatically. Face recognition Over the past few decades there have been vast amounts of research into face recognition, specifying that faces endure specialized processing within a region called the fusiform face area (FFA) located in the mid fusiform gyrus in the temporal lobe. Debates are ongoing whether both faces and objects are detected and processed in different systems and whether both have category specific regions for recognition and identification. Much research to date focuses on the accuracy of the detection and the time taken to detect the face in a complex visual search array. When faces are displayed in isolation, upright faces are processed faster and more accurately than inverted faces, but this effect was observed in non-face objects as well. When faces are to be detected among inverted or jumbled faces, reaction times for intact and upright faces increase as the number of distractors within the array is increased. Hence, it is argued that the 'pop out' theory defined in feature search is not applicable in the recognition of faces in such visual search paradigm. Conversely, the opposite effect has been argued and within a natural environmental scene, the 'pop out' effect of the face is significantly shown. This could be due to evolutionary developments as the need to be able to identify faces that appear threatening to the individual or group is deemed critical in the survival of the fittest. More recently, it was found that faces can be efficiently detected in a visual search paradigm, if the distracters are non-face objects,Simpson, E. A., Husband, H. L., Yee, K., Fullerton, A., & Jakobsen, K. V. (2014). Visual Search Efficiency Is Greater for Human Faces Compared to Animal Faces. however it is debated whether this apparent 'pop out' effect is driven by a high-level mechanism or by low-level confounding features. Furthermore, patients with developmental prosopagnosia, suffering from imparied face identification, generally detect faces normally, suggesting that visual search for faces is facilitated by mechanisms other than the face-identification circuits of the fusiform face area. Patients with forms of dementia can also have deficits in facial recognition and the ability to recognize human emotions in the face. In a meta-analysis of nineteen different studies comparing normal adults with dementia patients in their abilities to recognize facial emotions, the patients with frontotemporal dementia were seen to have a lower ability to recognize many different emotions. These patients were much less accurate than the control participants (and even in comparison with Alzheimer's patients) in recognizing negative emotions, but were not significantly impaired in recognizing happiness. Anger and disgust in particular were the most difficult for the dementia patients to recognize. Face recognition is a complex process that is affected by many factors, both environmental and individually internal. Other aspects to be considered include race and culture and their effects on one's ability to recognize faces.Kaspar, K. (2016). Culture, group membership, and face recognition. Commentary: Will you remember me? Cultural differences in own- group face recognition biases. Frontiers in Psychology, 7. Some factors such as the cross-race effect can influence one's ability to recognize and remember faces. Considerations Ageing Research indicates that performance in conjunctive visual search tasks significantly improves during childhood and declines in later life. More specifically, young adults have been shown to have faster reaction times on conjunctive visual search tasks than both children and older adults, but their reaction times were similar for feature visual search tasks. This suggests that there is something about the process of integrating visual features or serial searching that is difficult for children and older adults, but not for young adults. Studies have suggested numerous mechanisms involved in this difficulty in children, including peripheral visual acuity, eye movement ability, ability of attentional focal movement, and the ability to divide visual attention among multiple objects. Studies have suggested similar mechanisms in the difficulty for older adults, such as age related optical changes that influence peripheral acuity, the ability to move attention over the visual field, the ability to disengage attention, and the ability to ignore distractors. A study by Lorenzo-L√≥pez et al. (2008) provides neurological evidence for the fact that older adults have slower reaction times during conjunctive searches compared to young adults. Event-related potentials (ERPs) showed longer latencies and lower amplitudes in older subjects than young adults at the P3 component, which is related to activity of the parietal lobes. This suggests the involvement of the parietal lobe function with an age-related decline in the speed of visual search tasks. Results also showed that older adults, when compared to young adults, had significantly less activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and many limbic and occipitotemporal regions that are involved in performing visual search tasks. Alzheimer's disease Research has found that people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are significantly impaired overall in visual search tasks. Surprisingly, AD sufferers manifest enhanced spatial cueing, but this benefit is only obtained for cues with high spatial precision. Abnormal visual attention may underlie certain visuospatial difficulties in patients with (AD). People with AD have hypometabolism and neuropathology in the parietal cortex, and given the role of parietal function for visual attention, patients with AD may have hemispatial neglect, which may result in difficulty with disengaging attention in visual search. An experiment conducted by Tales et al. (2000) investigated the ability of patients with AD to perform various types of visual search tasks. Their results showed that search rates on \\"pop- out\\" tasks were similar for both AD and control groups, however, people with AD searched significantly slower compared to the control group on a conjunction task. One interpretation of these results is that the visual system of AD patients has a problem with feature binding, such that it is unable to communicate the different feature descriptions for the stimulus efficiently. Binding of features is thought to be mediated by areas in the temporal and parietal cortex, and these areas are known to be affected by AD- related pathology. Another possibility for the impairment of people with AD on conjunction searches is that there may be some damage to general attentional mechanisms in AD, and therefore any attention-related task will be affected, including visual search. Tales et al. (2000) detected a double dissociation with their experimental results on AD and visual search. Earlier work was carried out on patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) concerning the impairment patients with PD have on visual search tasks. In those studies, evidence was found of impairment in PD patients on the \\"pop-out\\" task, but no evidence was found on the impairment of the conjunction task. As discussed, AD patients show the exact opposite of these results: normal performance was seen on the \\"pop-out\\" task, but impairment was found on the conjunction task. This double dissociation provides evidence that PD and AD affect the visual pathway in different ways, and that the pop-out task and the conjunction task are differentially processed within that pathway. Autism Studies have consistently shown that autistic individuals performed better and with lower reaction times in feature and conjunctive visual search tasks than matched controls without autism. Several explanations for these observations have been suggested. One possibility is that people with autism have enhanced perceptual capacity. This means that autistic individuals are able to process larger amounts of perceptual information, allowing for superior parallel processing and hence faster target location. Second, autistic individuals show superior performance in discrimination tasks between similar stimuli and therefore may have an enhanced ability to differentiate between items in the visual search display. A third suggestion is that autistic individuals may have stronger top-down target excitation processing and stronger distractor inhibition processing than controls. Keehn et al. (2008) used an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging design to study the neurofunctional correlates of visual search in autistic children and matched controls of typically developing children. Autistic children showed superior search efficiency and increased neural activation patterns in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes when compared to the typically developing children. Thus, autistic individuals' superior performance on visual search tasks may be due to enhanced discrimination of items on the display, which is associated with occipital activity, and increased top-down shifts of visual attention, which is associated with the frontal and parietal areas. Consumer psychology In the past decade, there has been extensive research into how companies can maximise sales using psychological techniques derived from visual search to determine how products should be positioned on shelves. Pieters and Warlop (1999) used eye tracking devices to assess saccades and fixations of consumers while they visually scanned/searched an array of products on a supermarket shelf. Their research suggests that consumers specifically direct their attention to products with eye-catching properties such as shape, colour or brand name. This effect is due to a pressured visual search where eye movements accelerate and saccades minimise, thus resulting in the consumer's quickly choosing a product with a 'pop out' effect. This study suggests that efficient search is primarily used, concluding that consumers do not focus on items that share very similar features. The more distinct or maximally visually different a product is from surrounding products, the more likely the consumer is to notice it. Janiszewski (1998) discussed two types of consumer search. One search type is goal directed search taking place when somebody uses stored knowledge of the product in order to make a purchase choice. The second is exploratory search. This occurs when the consumer has minimal previous knowledge about how to choose a product. It was found that for exploratory search, individuals would pay less attention to products that were placed in visually competitive areas such as the middle of the shelf at an optimal viewing height. This was primarily due to the competition in attention meaning that less information was maintained in visual working memory for these products.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton. Its benefice is combined with that of St Peter, Swettenham. History The parish of Goostrey is first mentioned in the Domesday Book and a church or chapel was present by 1244. By 1617 a timber-framed chapel was present on the site which consisted of a nave and a chancel with a south aisle belonging to the Booths of Twemlow. In 1667 another south aisle was constructed for Edmund Jodrell and this was enlarged in 1711. In 1792 this chapel was demolished and the present church built between 1792 and 1796. Parish of Goostrey The ecclesiastical parish of Goostrey includes not only the civil parish of that name, but also that of Twemlow, named after the burial mounds or 'lows' found in this part of Cheshire, indicating that people lived here over four thousand years ago. The first documented mention of Goostrey is in the Domesday Book (1086), when most of the parish was held by William Fitz Nigel, Baron of Halton, and by Hugh de Mara, another follower of the Earl of Chester. They gave much land in Goostrey to endow the new abbey of Saint Werburgh in Chester, and later land in the parish was given to help endow the Vale Royal Abbey, near Northwich. The medieval history of the parish is recorded in grants and agreements which regulated the relations between the abbey at Chester and their local tenants. Occasionally these documents give an insight into the personal lives of the period. For example, in 1286 Honde Merlun broke into the church at Goostrey and took away all the ornaments; or when five brothers of William Eaton of Blackden were slain together and buried in the chapelyard in 1385. St Luke's Church St Luke's Church, a Church of England church, was built before 1220, but it was not until 1350 that the mother church of Sandbach allowed burials here. The parishioners of Goostrey frequently found the way to Sandbach impassable because of floods and must have rejoiced when the five mile (8 km) journey across the Rivers Dane and Croco was no longer necessary. The old church was timber framed, as Marton still is today, but all that remains from the Middle Ages of that church is the fifteenth century font. Three of the bells rang in the old building; the oldest was cast in 1606, the next recast in 1705, when the work cost ¬£5, and the third a little later. Of the other three, two were given in 1869 by Anna Maria Toler in memory of Mrs Thomas Hilditch, and the third is modern, dated 1912. The present ring consists of six bells, two of which were cast in 1869 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry by Mears & Stainbank, and the rest are by James Barwell, dated 1913. The organ was built in 1876 by Wadsworth. Some of the Communion Plates are eighteenth century and in 1719 a silver paten was given by Miss Dorothy Jodrell. It was made in London in 1715 by Samuel Wastell. A chalice and flagon, towards which Randle Armstrong gave ¬£20 in 1759, were made in that year by Fuller White of London. There is a modern paten, dated 1902, made in London, and there is a modern chalice given in memory of Sarah Elizabeth Knowles, made in Sheffield and dated 1931. The churchyard contains the war grave of a Canadian soldier of World War I. Parish records The parish registers, which are well preserved, date back to 1561. They contain a few interesting notes, such as one in 1661 when Marie Worthington, the wife of the minister of Goostrey, died, and after the entry is written the word 'scould' in a different ink. Another note among the next year's burials tells that Mr Whishall 'married five wives,' and later, in 1674, when James Dean married Margaret Hall, we read that she was his third wife 'all within the year'. At the back of the volume, among a list of notices relating to collections made in the chapelry, are documented donations sent to towns like Ripon in Yorkshire or Bridgnorth in Shropshire, as well as one contribution sent to Hugh Evans 'having his house and his household goods burnt in the county of Salop'. The registers also document how everyone agreed to the appointment of Mr Henry Newcome as minister on 7 October 1648, and it seems that even into the eighteenth century the inhabitants had some say in which clergyman was given the living of Goostrey, even though the final decision must have rested then as now with the vicar of Sandbach. Mr Newcome was a strict puritan, and forbade two of his most prominent parishioners from coming to Holy Communion for their frequent drinking. He left after eighteen months to become Rector of Gawsworth. The Churchwarden's Accounts are preserved from 1638 and explain the economics of parish life in other days. For example, in 1661, the font could be releaded for thirteen shillings, or a clock bought for two pounds three shillings and nine pence in 1658. Some things seem very cheap, as when the royal arms were painted and erected for two pounds three shillings and eight pence, and some very expensive, as when the book containing the new Communion Service of 1662, was purchased at a cost of twelve shillings, at a time when a labourer's weekly wage would not be much above half a crown. Sometimes information about the bill is scarce, as when the church was restored in 1711 at a cost of forty six pounds. Other account examples include 5000 bricks for two pounds five shillings in 1750. Construction In 1792 the wooden church being very cold, it was decided to build, at a cost of ¬£1,700, a new church to the design of the village bricksetter. No doubt the continual repairing and the alterations when new aisles were added to accommodate the gentry, had made a thorough rebuilding necessary, but the eighteenth century was no respector of ancient buildings. However they did leave us the old yew tree. In 1876 the church was restored and the interior re-furnished. It seems likely that the pulpit, lectern and sanctuary panelling were put in then. A new organ was given and a console in 1947 when the pipes were moved to the gallery. In 1961 a new altar was given and other furniture for the chancel which was rearranged to give more space between the choir pews. The stained glass, which may aptly be called post-Raphaelite, dates from about 1876; the east window being given in memory of Egerton Leigh, the second of that name to live at Jodrell Hall, the south west window being in memory of Mary Susan Armitstead, the young wife of William George, vicar of Goostrey from 1860 to 1907. They married in 1865; she died in 1868. Schools Across from the church is Goostrey Primary School. The earliest reference to a school is in 1640 when it was repaired. It was then next to the north wall of the churchyard where the old vicarage now stands, in a house which was also used as the court house for Goostrey Manor. This appears to have been pulled down in 1703. It may be then that the pupils moved across to the old school house, which is one of the oldest buildings in the village. In 1856 the main part of the present buildings were erected when the old days of a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk came to an end. The last of these schoolmasters, Jonathan Harding (1781‚Äì1862), is buried by the west end of the church; he had held his office for fifty two years. In 1977 the building of a new infants' department across the main road was undertaken. With this the old connection of church and school has been severed. People of Goostrey John Hulse, incumbent in the village from 1735 to 1754, left money to Cambridge University to found a professorial chair, which is still known by his name. Some families have achieved parochial renown by their memorials in church. The Kinseys whose last male representative died in 1814, acquired land here about 1380 by marrying one of the heiresses of the last Goostrey. The Armitsteads, who provided four vicars of Goostrey, three successively from 1859 to 1923, came from Horton in Ribblesdale in the middle of the eighteenth century, Lawrence whose memorial is on the north wall, purchased the Hermitage and Cranage estates. The Baskervyles whose memorials are in the north east corner of the chancel were squires of nearby Withington Hall from 1266 until 1954 when John Baskerville Glegg was buried at the east end of the church with his ancestors. On the south wall we read of the Booth family who lived at Twemlow Hall. The Booths originated from Barton near Manchester and were a family of note in the North West by the fifteenth century. Through marriage with a Venables heiress they acquired Dunham Massey and later a cadet branch by marriage with a Knutsford heiress obtained part of Twemlow whilst the other Knutsford heiress married a Jodrell from Yeardsley who obtained the other part. A Jodrell heiress in 1778 married Egerton Leigh of West Hall, High Legh, and in 1863 their grandson Colonel Egerton Leigh bought the other of the Twemlow Manor estate from the Booths. Leigh family sold most of their Jodrell and surrounding estates in 1924. Today most of the land here is owned by the families who farm it, though at the north east corner of Goostrey, Manchester University owns land where their radio telescope, Jodrell Bank overlooks a collection of Neolithic barrows.

The song \\"Sometimes\\" was featured in the Canadian TV program Flashpoint, being used in the Season 3 premiere episode titled \\"Unconditional Love\\". She has the distinction of being the only Australian to be featured in Flashpoint during its entire series run, the majority of artists featured on the program being from Canada or the USA. Biography Musical career Horsnell first picked up a guitar at the age of five, learning the classical and flamenco styles of play, and began busking at Manly Beach at the age of ten. By her late teens, she still had not really thought of continuing her music career ‚Äì she had her heart set on managing Woolworths ‚Äì until she won a spot on The Northern Composure CD and national songwriting competitions. From there she headed to London for a year, busking on a daily basis and working on her songwriting skills. Back home, Horsnell began her residency at the Excelsior Hotel in Glebe in 2000 and became regarded as one driving forces behind Sydney's blossoming \\"NuFolk\\" movement. Over the years at the Excelsior, she performed with some remarkable artists including Paul Greene, Andy Clockwise, Bertie Blackman, peregrine, Tim Ireland and Wesley Carr, while at the same time played host to many emerging artists, most notably Laura Imbruglia. Her residency continued for 4 years, but there were larger things afoot for the young songstress. In 2001, Horsnell independently released her first EP, Don‚Äôt Know What to Say, followed the next year her second EP Magic Mirror (produced by Garth Porter), which was soon picked up by radio across the country and led to her signing with Shock Publishing worldwide. Soon after, Horsnell was approached to write songs for popular children's show The Saddle Club and to score the soundtrack for the film Love in the First Degree. In 2003, Horsnell began work on her debut album, The Adventures of..., again with Garth Porter behind the desk. Its first single \\"Birds\\" earned her high rotation on the Triple J network. In 2004, she signed to Rounder records in Europe, after a demo of The Adventures of... found its way into the hands of Bert Pijpers of Rounder Records. The Adventures Of... was released in The Netherlands, Germany and the UK ‚Äì in February 2005, the album was released in rest of Europe. Horsnell even did a crash course in French to record the French version of the beatlesque pop gem \\"I Just Want Some Love\\" which helped The Adventures Of‚Ä¶ wind up as feature album on national radio in France that year. Having made no less than four tours of Europe over the years, she also played to a packed house at The Esplanade in Singapore in early 2005. Her Australian fans were satisfied when they finally saw the release of her album The Adventures of... in September 2005 through Inflatable Girlfriend Records/MGM. Horsnell has also managed many Australian tours, often with her band \\"the Inflatable Girlfriends\\" (ironically made up of male musicians), as support for The Frames, Josh Pyke, Bernard Fanning (Powderfinger), Lou Rhodes (Lamb) and Jason Mraz. She has supplied vocals for several songs used in television commercials, including McHappy Day, Johnnie Walker, Huggies, Women's Weekly, Bonds (company) and National Grid plc (in the United States). In addition, Horsnell and Elliot Wheeler came together in the side project \\"Forever Thursday\\", with Horsnell as the lead singer on the song \\"How Can It Be\\", music for a J.C. Penney advertisement shown during the 2007 Oscars. In 2008 Horsnell went back into the studio with producer Paul Mckercher (Augie March, Magic Dirt, Little Birdy, Eskimo Joe) to lay down 12 new tracks for her album Complicated Sweetheart. The first single from the album features a track \\"Mary Mary\\" and two bonus songs, \\"Christmas in the suburbs\\" and The Saints song \\"Massacre\\", and was released in July 2008. \\"Mary Mary\\" received immediate airplay on National Youth Broadcaster Radio Triple J and also FBi Radio, RRR and a number of other stations.

It was established by Hadiwijaya or Jaka Tingkir, Lord of Boyolali, after a civil war and was a successor to Sultanate of Demak. Hadiwijaya claimed to be a descendant of Brawijaya V, the last king of the Majapahit empire, and Trenggana, the sultan of Demak. In the last battle against the last claimant of Demak, the vicious Arya Penangsang, Jaka Tingkir commissioned his greatest vassal, Ki Ageng Pamanahan, and his son, Sutawijaya, to destroy Arya Penangsang's army. The two managed to defeat and kill Arya Penangsang and were thus awarded a fief in a forest called Alas Mentaok, now Kotagede, on which they founded their base for the future capital of Mataram Kingdom. Legend says King Hadiwijaya was so fond of Sutawijaya, he adopted him as the playmate of his heir, Prince Banawa. Hadiwijaya's rule was supposed to be succeeded by this weak-minded heir, but a rebellion by a vassal named Ario Pangiri forced the prince to seek asylum from his childhood friend Sutawijaya. Pledged to help, Sutawijaya gathered his army and defeated Ario Pangiri and seized the Pajang Palace. Prince Banawa then submitted his crown to Sutawijaya and thus ended the Kingdom of Pajang in 1586, when Sutawijaya founded the greatest Islamic kingdom in Java: Mataram Sultanate.

Dancers clear a circle (jam circle or dance circle) and dancers or dance couples take turns showing their best tricks while the remaining dancers cheer the jammers on. While some jam circles are staged, most form organically and spontaneously when the energy and mood is right. Jam circles The term originated during the swing era of dancing, probably borrowed or appeared in parallel with the expression \\"jam session\\" in music. Scenes with jamming may be seen in movies and musicals, such as Hellzapoppin. At the same time, this kind of dance behavior is not unusual in folk dances in various cultures all over the world and is often included in scenic performances when a group dance is interweaved with several solos. In Lindy hop, it is common for jam circles to take place on or around special occasions such as birthdays or weddings. In these cases, the person(s) being celebrated will usually stay in the circle for the duration of the jam and, rather than dance one song with one partner, will dance one song but swap partners many times throughout. For Flamenco dancing, the circle is called a juerga. Cypher circles Specific to the bboying culture, cypher circles hold the similar concepts as jam circles. When one or two bboys/bgirls get together to dance, it is known as jamming. But when enough bboys/bgirls get together to make a circle where one can break in, it is known as \\"cyphering\\". Cyphering takes place at nearly every bboying jam that takes place. It is a way to show one's experience, the flavor they put into their style, and in some cases, specifically to \\"burn\\" or \\"smoke\\" another breaker. Dance circles A variant of the 'show case' style jam circles is a circle where dancers within the circle swap partners from the outside. Less \\"showy\\" than a jam circle, these jams are to commemorate an occasion for the person(s) in the circle. Another way to consider the difference is that while the jam circles showcase ability, the dance circles here showcase dancers. For example, this kind of jam circle may be organized when a dancer from the local dance community celebrates a birthday, or is moving away. Other occasions for these jams include a welcome dance for new members and/or visitors. Many of these circles are a planned portion of the evening. The dancers of honor stay in the circle the whole time while other dancers from outside the circle cut in 'on the fly'. Dancers \\"break in\\", or \\"steal\\", their way into the middle by breaking the connection of the dancers and inserting themselves such that the person of honor continues dancing without missing a beat. Some scenes do this in an organized fashion (such as a line), however, many do so without rules. Such birthday jams are common in swing dance and hustle communities in the United States but not unusual in salsa or tango. While nerve-wracking for beginning dancers the jams do help to meet the local crowd. Dance off This form of jamming often occurs during prom, high school or college dance parties. What happens is that during the dances, the dancers would form a circle, and often, one by one, the dancers, individually or by a group, would come into the circle and display their dancing abilities. The style of dancing is popular amongst hip hop dancers. Charleston jams This variant of jam circle typically does not involve much of an audience. While a few competitions have staged Charleston jams and competitions, almost always they happen on their own when a few dancers start doing solo Charleston next to each other. Eventually the dancers form a circle and dance solo charleston while watching each other. These jams occur frequently at most Lindy Hop events.

It was originally prepared by Lord Macaulay with a great consultation in 1860 on the behalf of the Government of India as the Indian Penal Code. After the independence in 1947, Pakistan inherited the same code and subsequently after several amendments by different governments, in Pakistan it is now a mixture of Islamic and English Law. Presently, the Pakistan Penal Code is still in effect and can be amended by the Senate of Pakistan.  History  The draft of the (British) Indian Penal Code was prepared by the First Law Commission and it was chaired by Lord Macaulay. Its basis is the law of England freed from superfluities, technicalities and local peculiarities. Suggestions were also derived from the French Penal Code and from Livingstone's Code of Louisiana. The draft underwent a very careful revision at the hands of Sir Barnes Peacock, Chief Justice, and puisne Judges of the Calcutta Supreme Court who were members of the Legislative Council, and was passed into law in 1860, unfortunately Macaulay did not survive to see his masterpiece enacted into a law. Though it is principally the work of a man who had hardly held a brief, and whose time was devoted to politics and literature, it was universally acknowledged to be a monument of codification and an everlasting memorial to the high juristic attainments of its distinguished author. For example, even cyber crimes can be punished under the code.  Jurisdiction  Section 1. Title and extent of operation of the Code. This Act shall be called the Pakistan Penal Code, and shall take effect throughout Pakistan. * Section 4 The provisions of this Code apply also to any offence committed by:- * (1) any citizen of Pakistan or any person in the service of Pakistan in any place without and beyond Pakistan; * (4) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in Pakistan wherever it may be. Explanation: In this section the word \\"offence\\" includes every act committed outside Pakistan which, if committed in Pakistan, would be punishable under this Code. Extension of Code to extraterritorial offences.  Punishments  * Section 53. The punishments to which offenders are liable under the provisions of this Code are: * First, Qisas (\\"retribution\\"); * Second, Diyat; * Third, Arsh‚àí (Pre-specified Compensation); * Fourth, Daman (Compensation determined by court to be paid by the offender to the victim for causing hurt not liable to Arsh); * Fifth, Ta'zir (punishment, usually corporal, that can be administered at the discretion of a judge) * Sixth, Death; * Seventh, Imprisonment for life; * Eighth, Imprisonment which is of two descriptions, namely:-- :# Rigorous (i.e., with hard labour); :# Simple; * Ninth, Forfeiture of property; * Tenth, Fine First five punishments are added by amendments and are considered Islamic Punishments, and very few are sentenced to these punishments so far. Anyone who is sentenced to first five punishments can appeal to Federal Shariat court.

The label recorded regional rhythm and blues, rockabilly, blues and country music artists. Ram's pressings were made by RCA. Ram also issued recordings on the Clif Records and K Records labels. The label later moved to Nashville, Tennessee.Ram (RCS Label Listing) from the website of Emory University Ram recorded most of its music in the mid-1950s to early 1960s, but due to a tight budget, many of their recordings remained unreleased for decades. In 1994, Ace Records released a CD set of Ram recordings, including many which had never been issued. In 2018, the Academy Award-winning movie, Green Book, featured six songs from the Ram label.http://710keel.com/shreveport-music-featured-in-oscar-winning-green- bookhttp://www.ksla.com/2019/02/22/shreveport-singer-has-music-featured- acclaimed-movie-green-book  Royal Audio Music Recording Company   Founder  Mira Ann Smith, was a guitarist, pianist, and songwriter. She was also a fan of The Louisiana Hayride, a popular radio show broadcast out of Shreveport, Louisiana. She observed that many artists performing on the Hayride needed a place to record their music and saw the opportunity to open her own recording studio. In 1955, at the age of 29, Smith opened Royal Audio Music (Ram) Recording Co., located at 2439 Lakeshore Drive in Shreveport, Louisiana. Ram was the first commercial music studio in Shreveport, and Smith was one of the first women to own her own record company. Smith toured Louisiana and east Texas, seeking out skilled musicians to record in her studio. She crossed genre and racial boundaries and found artists who performed a variety of styles including rockabilly, R&B;, Swamp Pop, and country. In 1960, the studio moved to Greenwood Drive (in Shreveport), and included a built-in echo unit and separate vocal booths.  RAM Records  In 1955, a short time after opening the studio, Smith started her own record label, Ram Records. Smith discovered that RCA made custom pressings for Indie labels and decided to use their services.Topping, Ray. Shreveport Stomp, CD liner notes, Ace Records, 2001 In 1956, Ram released its first record titled, ‚ÄúYou Never Mention My Name‚Äù/‚ÄùJust For a While.‚Äù Mira Smith wrote both songs, and they were performed by country singer, Carol Williams. This release was also the first recording for 16-year-old steel guitar player, James Burton, who accompanied her. In 2001 Burton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 1956 Ram recorded their first rockabilly release, ‚ÄúYou Won‚Äôt Know Why ‚ÄòTil I‚Äôm Gone‚Äô‚Äù/ ‚ÄúWilson‚Äôs Blues No 1‚Äù by James Wilson and his band, The Jimmie Cats. Billboard gave the song a positive reviewTopping, Ray. Shreveport High Steppers, CD liner notes, ACE Records, 2001. Linda Brannon was Ram Records‚Äô first big-selling artist. In 1958, at age 17, she recorded the single, ‚ÄúWherever You Are‚Äù/‚ÄúJust Another Lie‚Äù (RAM #1478). Demand for the album was too great for the small Ram studio to handle, so Smith leased it out to Chess Records (Chess Records #1720) for distribution. Billboard reviewed the album and gave it a three star rating. ‚ÄúJust Another Lie‚Äù (written by Ernest Suarez) was later recorded by Brenda Lee (Decca #7-38269/Brunswick #LAT 8376) and Jackie DeShannon (Dot Records 45-15928). Margaret Lewis (Warwick) recorded many songs with the Ram label, including her song, ‚ÄúHoney (I Miss You Too)‚Äù which charted at #74 on the Hot Country Singles Chart on June 29, 1968. Lewis later became Smith‚Äôs songwriting partner. Smith and Lewis wrote more than 20 songs for Jeannie C. Riley and over 100 songs in total. Many of their songs made it to the Billboard Top 10 and together they won six BMI Awards. Lewis later married Mira Smith‚Äôs cousin, Alton Warwick. Other RAM artists: * Roy ‚ÄúBoogie Boy‚Äù Perkins, a.k.a. Ernest Suarez was a songwriter and musician who wrote \\"Just Another Lie\\" and many other songs for RAM artists. * Bobby Page and The Riff Raffs recorded many songs in the Ram studio.

Elwood Dugas), singer/pianist Roy ‚ÄúBoogie Boy‚Äù Perkins (a.k.a Ernest Suarez), tenor saxophonist Jimmy ‚ÄúScatman‚Äù Patin, and saxophonist Harry Simoneaux. Many of their songs remained in the Ram vault and were not released until 1994. The band‚Äôs songs have been played on several TV shows and feature films. Their song, ‚ÄúI Love My Baby‚Äù is played in the Academy Award winning movie, Green Book (2018). * The Lonesome Drifter (a.k.a Thomas Johnson), * Endom Spires (a.k.a.

Clif‚Äôs first success was with TV Slim (Oscar Wills) and his song ‚ÄúFlatfoot Sam‚Äù (Clif #103), written by his wife, Clara Wills. Slim had connections with Leonard Chess and was able to get Checker Records to distribute the song across the nation (Checker #870). Billboard gave the song a 77 rating. Flatfoot Sam has since been recorded by Tommy Blake (Sun Records #278), Paul Gayten (Argo Records #5277), Mickey Murray (SSS International #755),and Brian Setzer (for his 2005 album Rockabilly Riot! Volume 1: A Tribute to Sun Records (Surfdog Records #44068-2)). In 1959, the Clif Label released the songs ‚ÄúHot Tamales and Bar-B-Que‚Äù by Chico Chism and his Jetanairs.

The Lonesome Drifter (Thomas Johnson) and his single ‚ÄúEager Boy‚Äù/ ‚ÄúTear Drop Valley‚Äù (1958) is considered one of the more significant recordings from this label.  Studio Struggles  In an almost exclusively male business, Smith often found it difficult to find distribution and promotion services. Her cousin, Alton Warwick, was interviewed in 1994 and commented that he believed being a woman hindered her success, because people did not always take her seriously, especially with issues like financing. Due to her tight budget, she only promoted a few singles each year and was often forced to leave quality songs in the vault. Many of Ram‚Äôs recordings remained unreleased for decades.  Studio Closure  When the Louisiana Hayride closed On August 27, 1960 the Shreveport music scene had already faded significantly. As a result, the Ram label was struggling. A few years later, Smith closed the studio and moved to Nashville to focus on songwriting with Margaret Lewis. Myra and Margaret became partners and continued to own Ram Records and after Myra's death, Margaret Lewis- Warwick and her husband Alton Warwick continue to owned and operated Ram Records from Shreveport, Louisiana.

The service was set up in 1992, growing out of a shuttle service previously operated for students at Wall Hall College located near Watford connecting them to the other campuses of the University and the Polytechnic (Hatfield) before that. It provides student transport to the university from local areas as well as improving east-west travel across Hertfordshire and has opened up new links from North London. Services have expanded as the University has closed outlying sites at Watford and Hertford and developed the new de Havilland Campus on the site of the former Hatfield Aerodrome, Hatfield. Other developments on this site, including business premises for companies such as Veolia, DHL and EE Limited have also provided passengers. Uno also operate urban bus networks in St Albans and Northampton, as well as a network of routes between Milton Keynes, Bedford and Flitwick for Cranfield University. History Wright StreetLite at Showbus in September 2012 Uno was set up as an 'arm's length' company by the University of Hertfordshire in 1992. It has its own Board of Directors and is expected to run on a fully commercial basis. In 2005 it was re-branded Uno and the buses were repainted pink and purple, a departure from the previous grey and white livery. According to the University's student newspaper Universe, the reason for the re-branding \\"is to have a name that reflects the wider market the buses serve in the community, basically not just for the inhabitants of the University of Hertfordshire\\". Shortly after purchasing the St Albans operations of Centrebus in 2008, Uno helped to found a voluntary partnership of local authorities, the university and the bus and rail operators serving the city with the aim of co-ordinating and improving public transport across St Albans. The partnership uses powers under the most recent Transport Act as a Quality Network Partnership but is known publicly as 'Network St Albans'. Uno is currently the second largest bus operator in Hertfordshire. On 20 April 2009, Uno recast many of its services to integrate a number of the former Centrebus routes. Further changes took place on 28 September 2009, following the opening of the new University Of Hertfordshire Forum. These changes included improvements to late evening services and the extension of operating hours until as late as 3:30am for a select few routes. The main timetable change each year takes place in September to coincide with the start of the school, college and university academic year. In September 2012, Uno commenced operating in Northampton, initially taking over routes 18 and 19, both of which serve The University of Northampton. A third service, route 21, began operating in 2013, covering some of Northampton's eastern district and serving Northampton College.News of Bus Service Changes Northamptonshire County Council. In September 2013, Uno began operating a small network of routes between Milton Keynes, Bedford and Flitwick for Cranfield University. Uno timetable for route C1 On 25 July 2015, Uno became a contracted Transport for London operator when it commenced operating route 383.Tender News Bus Talk issue 31 December 2014 (Go-Ahead London) In November 2016, Uno's Northampton operations were shortlisted for the Top Independent Operator award in the national UK Bus Awards; they finished as a finalist.Results 2016 UK Bus Awards 2016 results In November 2018, Uno were shortlisted for several awards in the UK Bus Awards and won two - Marketing Initiative of the Year for the 'Comet' route (614/644) and Leadership & Inspiration for the MD, Jim Thorpe. UK Bus Awards 2018 results Previous route changes In March 2008, Uno purchased Centrebus's St Albans garage, taking over all Centrebus routes operating from there, including the S St Albans City route network, PB1 (a Potters Bar local route), various routes connecting St Albans with outlying towns and housing estates and a number of schools services provided under contract to Hertfordshire County Council. In April 2009, several former Centrebus services were integrated into the main network (mainly as services 620 and 621) while one further route (304) provided under contract to Hertfordshire County Council was transferred to Arriva Shires & Essex. In March 2010, a number of the routes around Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City, that only ran a couple of times a day or on one day a week, were lost to Sullivan Buses.Public Bus services Sullivan Buses The evening 620 service contract was also lost to Arriva Shires & Essex. The 694 service, introduced in September 2009 as a park and ride service between College Lane and Stanborough Lakes in WGC, was axed completely. In September 2011, changes were made to routes 607, 610, 615, 625, 635, 658, 659 (frequency changes/new services); route 700 (reduction in service as result of 625/635 changes; routes 602, 603, 622, 634, 636 and 712 (general timing changes) and withdrawal of route 641, with assurances that the peak hour connection would be kept on the route 341. However, in January 2012, the peak hour connection was lost from 341, along with shortening of some early and late journeys on the 602, 603, 620, 621, 622, 625, 635, 658 and PB1 services; the withdrawal of routes 604 and 634 outside of peak; and changing all evening 644 buses to run via Barnet via route 614). In March 2015, Uno took the 797 Greenline route that previously operated from Stevenage to London Victoria (Green Line Coach Station) on, operating a shortened version of the route between London and Hatfield, on weekdays.A degree of relief as University of Hertfordshire steps in to save 797 bus The Comet 20 February 2015\\"Uno, Hatfield\\" Buses issue 723 June 2015 page 95 The service was withdrawn the following year. Garages and buses A promotional bus advertising the PlusBus ticketing scheme in June 2010 Uno operates from a garage purpose built in 2003 at Gypsy Moth Avenue, Hatfield Business Park. Following the takeover of Centrebus' St Albans operations, Uno continued to operate them from the St Albans garage. However, this was subsequently closed and operations consolidated into Hatfield. As a result of winning the Northampton University contracts a depot has opened at the Park Campus of the university by September 2012. A similar arrangement also operates at Cranfield University following initiation of services between Milton Keynes and Bedford in September 2013. In September 2017 Uno launched a fleet of six brand-new, high specification buses on the 614/644 route between Hatfield and North London. Welwyn Hatfield Times 18 September 2017 The new buses are E400 City double deckers, made by Alexander Dennis. At the end of May 2018, Uno started operating six brand-new single decker buses made by MCV (MCV Bus and Coach) on Volvo's B8RLE chassis. The buses were branded 'Dragonfly', in reference to Hatfield's aircraft heritage, and allocated to route 610 (Luton - Hatfield - Cockfosters). The buses feature WiFi, USB charging sockets, on-board stop announcements and an innovative sofa at the front.'Route One magaine 23 May 2018 In February 2019, further investment by the company saw a fleet of 8 buses launched under the 'Tigermoth' brand for the 653 route - each bus named after the first eight female pilots from the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) - Joan Hughes, Margaret Cunnison, Mona Friedlander, Rosemary Rees, Marion Wilberforce, Margaret Fairweather, Gabrielle Patterson, and Winifred Crossley Fair - who were based at Hatfield in the Second World War.'Welwyn Hatfield Times6 Feb 2019 Ticketing The company participates in various county-wide ticketing schemes where appropriate, such as Plusbus (discounted combined rail and bus tickets), Intalink Explorer (a ticket allowing unlimited travel around Hertfordshire), and discounted travel for children with a Hertfordshire SaverCard.

Like the smaller towns of Montemitro and San Felice del Molise, Acquaviva Collecroce is home to a community of Molisian Croats, most of whom speak a particular Croatian dialect (known as simply na-na≈°o or na≈° jezik, meaning \\"our language\\") as well as Italian. There are differences in the dialects of the three towns, but they all descend from the Shtokavian-Ikavian dialect of Dalmatia. The language is considered an endangered diaspora language. Acquaviva is known for the production of a small, dark, zerniza figs grown there, as well as the fennel and white celery. History In the 12th century, Acquaviva was a base for the Knights of Malta. Though there is evidence of an earlier Slavic settlement in 1297, it is believed that the current inhabitants are not their descendants, but rather come from later migrations in the 15th and 16th centuries.Milan Re≈°etar, Le colonie serbocroate nell'Italia Meridionale, 1911. (Reprinted in 1996.) These migrations may have been caused by Ottoman incursions into the Balkans. Numerous inhabitants emigrated in two flows during the 20th century, and population is currently still decreasing (there were some 2,500 inhabitants in 1951, compared to the c. 730 of 2007). The first emigration took place between, roughly, 1900‚Äì1920, the emigrees heading towards the United States and Argentina. The second major flow took place in the 1950s, chiefly to Australia.

Education and family Taylor was born in Cambridge ‚Äî while his father (John) was Vice Principal at Ridley Hall ‚Äî and educated at St Lawrence College (where his father was headteacher). He read English at Trinity College, Cambridge, then read theology and trained for the ministry at St Catherine's Society and Wycliffe Hall (where his father was principal) at Oxford, and the Institute of Education. His father was later Bishop of Sodor and Man; his mother was Margaret Irene n√©e Garrett. Taylor married Margaret (Peggy) Wright on 5 October 1940, and they had three children. Priestly ministry He was ordained in the Church of England: made a deacon by Arthur Winnington-Ingram, Bishop of London, at St Paul's Cathedral on 18 December 1938, and ordained priest by Guy Smith, Bishop of Willesden, at St Paul's on Michaelmas (29 September) the following year.Who Was Who erroneously records that he was ordained deacon in 1956 and priest in 1957, whereas both Crockford's and the Church Times record 1938 and 1939, and these are consistent with his first curacy: 1938‚Äì1940. He spent five years engaged in Christian ministry in England, (from 1938‚Äì40 as a curate at All Souls, Langham Place, and then from 1940‚Äì43 as curate in St Helen's the Diocese of Liverpool). He then felt drawn to overseas missionary work; unable to do so immediately because of wartime travel restrictions, he obtained a teaching qualification at London University. In 1945, with the ending of World War II, he moved to Mukono, Uganda, as a missionary working in theological education. He returned to England in 1954 and worked for the International Missionary Council. In 1959 he became Africa Secretary of the Church Missionary Society, and in 1963 he succeeded Max Warren as its General Secretary, remaining in post until 1974. Episcopal ministry His nomination to the See of Winchester was announced 14 August 1974, he was elected and confirmed that winter, consecrated a bishop by Donald Coggan, Archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster Abbey on 31 January, and installed at Winchester Cathedral on 8 February 1975. He then served as Bishop of Winchester until his retirement on 28 February 1985, succeeding Falkner Allison, an old-fashioned Evangelical much-loved by all parties within the diocese. He was the first priest to be consecrated directly to the See of Winchester since William Day in 1595, and was respected throughout the diocese and beyond mainly by liberals and modernists, but failed to gain the trust of Anglo-Catholics. A product of Wycliffe Hall, with connections with All Souls, Langham Place, he was nevertheless a liberal evangelical rather than a conservative one. When first consecrated, he initially caused some amusement by refusing to wear a mitre and ordering that it be carried in front of him on a cushion in processions. After that one occasion he reverted to custom and wore it. Bibliography The most notable of his books were The Go-Between God (1972) and The Christlike God (1992), both of which remain in print. Enough is enough (1975) was an early book of the environmentalist movement, making the theological case for resisting consumerism and looking after our planet. *The Primal Vision: Christian Presence amid African Religion (London: SCM 1963; New Edition, SCM Classics 2001) *The Go-Between God: The Holy Spirit and the Christian Mission (London: SCM 1972; New Edition, SCM Classics 2002). *For All the World (1966) *Enough is enough (London: SCM: 1975) *The Growth of the Church in Buganda: An Attempt at Understanding (1980) *Weep Not for Me: Meditations on the Cross and the Resurrection (1986) *The Christlike God (London: SCM 1992). *Bishops on the Bible: Eight Bishops on the Role and Relevance of the Bible Today (1994) *A matter of life and death (London: SCM 1986) *Kingdom Come (1989) *A Christmas Sequence and Other Poems (1989) Posthumous collections: *The Easter God and his Easter People (2003) *The Incarnate God (2006) Biographical: * Poet, Priest and Prophet by David Wood.

Variants  Collectively, the variants of the FPS system were the most common system in technical publications in English until the middle of the 20th century. Errors can be avoided and translation between the systems facilitated by labelling all physical quantities consistently with their units. Especially in the context of the FPS system this is sometimes known as the Stroud system after William Stroud, who popularized it..  Pound as mass unit  When the pound is used as a unit of mass, the core of the coherent system is similar and functionally equivalent to the corresponding subsets of the International System of Units (SI), using metre, kilogram and second (MKS), and the earlier centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units (CGS). In this sub-system, the unit of force is a derived unit known as the poundal. :1\\\\,\\\\text{pdl} = 1\\\\,\\\\text{lb} \\\\cdot 1\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\text{ft}}{\\\\text{s}^2} The international standard symbol for the pound as unit of mass rather than force is lb.IEEE Std 260.1‚Ñ¢-2004, IEEE Standard Letter Symbols for Units of Measurement (SI Units, Customary Inch- Pound Units, and Certain Other Units) Everett (1861) proposed the metric dyne and erg as the units of force and energy in the FPS system. Latimer Clark's (1891) \\"Dictionary of Measures\\" contains celo (acceleration), vel or velo (velocity) and pulse (momentum) as proposed names for FPS absolute units.  Pound-force as force unit  The technical or gravitational FPS system,J. M. Coulson, J. F. Richardson, J. R. Backhurst, J. H. Harker: Coulson & Richardson's Chemical Engineering: Fluid flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer. is a coherent variant of the FPS system that is most common among engineers in the United States. It takes the pound-force as a fundamental unit of force instead of the pound as a fundamental unit of mass. In this sub- system, the unit of mass is a derived unit known as the slug. :1\\\\,\\\\text{slug} = 1\\\\,\\\\text{lbf} \\\\cdot 1\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\text{s}^2}{\\\\text{ft}} In the context of the gravitational FPS system, the pound-force (lbf) is sometimes referred to as the pound (lb).  Pound as force unit  Another variant of the FPS system uses both the pound-mass and the pound-force, but neither the slug nor the poundal. The resulting system is not coherent, lacking electrical or molar units, and is sometimes also known as the British engineering system, although rarely used nowadays in the United Kingdom.  Other units   Molar units  The unit of substance in the FPS system is the pound-mole (lb-mol) = . Until the SI decided to adopt the gram-mole, the mole was directly derived from the mass unit as (mass unit)/(atomic mass unit). The unit (lbf‚ãÖs2/ft)-mol also appears in a former definition of the atmosphere.  Electromagnetic units  The electrostatic and electromagnetic systems are derived from units of length and force, mainly. As such, these are ready extensions of any system of containing length, mass, time. Stephen Dresner gives the derived electrostatic and electromagnetic units in both the foot‚Äìpound‚Äìsecond and foot‚Äìslug‚Äìsecond systems. In practice, these are most associated with the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system. The 1929 \\"International Critical Tables\\" gives in the symbols and systems fpse = FPS electrostatic system and fpsm = FPS electromagnetic system. Under the conversions for charge, the following are given. The CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 1979 (Edition 60), also lists fpse and fpsm as standard abbreviations. ; Electromagnetic FPS (EMU, stat-) : 1 fpsm unit = 117.581866 cgsm unit (Biot-second) ; Electrostatic FPS (ESU, ab-) : 1 fpse unit = 3583.8953 cgse unit (Franklin) : 1 fpse unit = 1.1954588√ó10‚àí6 abs coulomb  Units of light  The candle and the foot- candle were the first defined units of light, defined in the Metropolitan Gas Act (1860). The foot-candle is the intensity of light at one foot from a standard candle. The units were internationally recognized in 1881, and adopted into the metric system.  Conversions  Together with the fact that the term \\"weight\\" is used for the gravitational force in some technical contexts (physics, engineering) and for mass in others (commerce, law),NIST Federal Standard 376B , p. 13. and that the distinction often does not matter in practice, the coexistence of variants of the FPS system causes confusion over the nature of the unit \\"pound\\". Its relation to international metric units is expressed in kilograms, not newtons, though, and in earlier times it was defined by means of a mass prototype to be compared with a two-pan balance which is agnostic of local gravitational differences. In July 1959, the various national foot and avoirdupois pound standards were replaced by the international foot of precisely and the international pound of precisely , making conversion between the systems a matter of simple arithmetic. The conversion for the poundal is given by 1 pdl = 1 lb¬∑ft/s2 = (precisely). To convert between the absolute and gravitational FPS systems one needs to fix the standard acceleration g which relates the pound to the pound-force. :1\\\\,\\\\text{lbf} = 1\\\\,\\\\text{lb}\\\\cdot g While g strictly depends on one's location on the Earth surface, since 1901 in most contexts it is fixed conventionally at precisely g0 = ‚âà .

During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople‚Äîthe most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community‚Äîfrom 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks. Between 1879 and 1885 he served as prelate of Van, after which he was forced into exile to Jerusalem. He was elected as head of the Armenian Church in 1892, however, he was enthroned more than a year later and served in that position until his death. He opposed the Russian government's attempt to confiscate the properties of the Armenian Church in 1903, which was later canceled partly due to his efforts. Khrimian further endorsed the liberation movement of the Armenian revolutionaries. He is a towering figure in modern Armenian history and has been affectionately called Khrimian Hayrik (hayrik is diminutive for \\"father\\"). A well-known defender of Armenian interests and aspirations, his progressive activities are seen as having laid the groundwork for the rise of Armenian nationalism and the consequent national liberation movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Early life, education, and travels Khrimian was born in the Aygestan (Aikesdan) quarter of Van. His father, a weaver, died when Mkrtich was a child and he was brought up by his uncle, Khachatur, a merchant. The root of his last name, Khrim, is the Armenian language term for Crimea, suggests a link his family had with the peninsula. He received informal education at parochial schools of Lim and Ktuts islands in Lake Van and Varagavank, where he studied classical Armenian, history, and ecclesiastical literature. Upon returning to Van in 1842, he embarked on a journey across the region and made a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. Khrimian wished to continue his education at a European university, but this desire was never realized. He lived in Constantinople from 1844 to 1846 where he made connections with Armenian intellectuals. Returning to Van in 1846, he married Mariam Sevikian. In 1847 he crossed to Persia and the Russian Caucasus, where he visited the Ararat plain, Shirak, and Nakhichevan. He lived in Alexandropol (Gyumri) for six months. In 1848 once again moved to Constantinople via Tiflis, Batumi, and Trabzon. From 1848 to 1850 he taught at an all-girl school in Constantinople's Khasgiugh (Hask√∂y) quarter. In 1851 he traveled to Cilicia where he was sent to report on the state of Armenian schools. By traveling and living in various Armenian-populated provinces, he acquired an intimate knowledge of the problems and aspirations of ordinary Armenians. He was upset with the apathy the upper and middle classes of the Armenian community of Constantinople showed towards provincial Armenians. Returning to Van in 1853, he found himself with no immediate family left; his wife, daughter, and mother had died. He thereafter decided to devote himself to a life in the Armenian Apostolic Church. In 1854, at age 34, Khirimian was ordained as vardapet (celibate priest) at the Aghtamar Cathedral in Lake Van. In 1855 he was appointed abbot of the Holy Cross Church in Scutari (√úsk√ºdar), near Constantinople. Khrimian began production of the periodical Artsvi Vaspurakan at a publishing house located next to his Scutari church. Van, Mush, and Constantinople A postcard depicting Khrimian and Varagavank. Below a quote from him encourages Armenians to keep persisting, as he promises a better future. Monasteries of Varag and Surb Karapet Khrimian returned to Van in 1857 and established the Zharangavorats School at Varagavank monastery. He founded a publishing house at the monastery, through which he resumed the publication of Artsvi Vaspurakan in 1859. Its publication continued until 1864. In 1862 he was appointed abbot of the Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush, which meant he was also the prelate of Taron. He revitalized the monastery and transformed it into a flourishing center. He founded a school there and a journal, called Artsvik Tarono. He succeeded in convincing the wali (governor) of the Erzurum Vilayet to lower taxes for Armenians. Patriarch of Constantinople On 20 October 1868, Khrimian was ordained as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 he was elected as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian community of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) class and the imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet in the eyes of the Sublime Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used the position to advance the interests and conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians. The Khrimian report, officially titled First Report on Provincial Oppressions needs to be understood in the context of the Tanzimat reforms (1839, 1856). Aimed at centralizing the administration and improving the tax base of the government, the reforms had not been effectively implemented in the more peripheral parts of the Empire, among them the Anatolian provinces. As a consequence, the local populations often suffered from double taxation, both from the central government and from the part of local tribal leaders who had access to tax farming rights, most of them Kurdish notables. Issues explicitly mentioned in Khrimian's report include: violence committed by tax farmers against the local population, forced conversions to Islam and other crimes committed out of religious fanaticism, over-taxation, and neglect of tax farmer duties, leading to harvest losses. The report also made several suggestions on how to address the above-mentioned problems: In particular, the Kurdish tribesmen were supposed to be disarmed and taught an agricultural lifestyle. Moreover, the report asked for the creation of an effective police force, with Armenians being allowed to serve at all levels, and for transparent communication of the Sublime Porte's orders. His outspokenness about the issues facing the Armenian population annoyed not only the Ottoman authorities but some of the Armenian wealthy elite as well. According to Gerard Libaridian, the promotion of rights of provincial Armenians \\"made him an enemy of many influential Armenians in Istanbul.\\" He was compelled to resign by the Ottoman government in 1873. Armayis Vartooguian wrote in 1896 that Khrimian \\"could have held the post of Patriarch of Constantinople for life had he not been driven to resign by the intrigues of the Turkish Government, which disliked him very much because of his zeal for the well- being of his flock.\\" Following his resignation, Khrimian dedicated his time to literary pursuits. Berlin Congress  In the aftermath of the 1877‚Äì78 Russo- Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers‚Äîwhich meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat of intervention) would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia. The Treaty of Berlin, which was signed on 13 July 1878, is considered a failure of the Armenian mission to the congress by historians. It failed to force the Ottoman government to implement real reforms. Panossian writes that all the Armenian delegation received were \\"toothless promises.\\" In the congress, Khrimian witnessed the Christian Balkan peoples (Serbs, Montenegrins, and Bulgarians) achieving independence or some degree of autonomy. After returning to Constantinople, Khrimian delivered a series of speeches \\"which secured him a place in the radicalisation of Armenian thinking, and the clear and forceful articulation of demands based on nationalist principles.\\" He gave a well-known sermon in which he called for the armament of the Armenians in order to fight for an independent Armenia. He told his flock that \\"Armenia, in contrast with the Christian states of the Balkans, did not win autonomy from the Porte because no Armenian blood had been shed in the cause of freedom.\\" Famous for its allegories, the sermon is considered to have initiated the Armenian revolutionary movement. In the sermon, he \\"used an analogy of a ladle and dish with the sword and freedom in explaining the Balkan countries' struggle for freedom during the Congress. For him, the freedom of Armenia was only possible through the use of armed force.\\" In particular, he stated: \\"There, where guns talk and swords make noise, what significance do appeals and petitions have?\\" He added: Prelate of Van and exile Khrimian and local Armenian notables in Van, December 1879 After his return from Europe, Khrimian was appointed Prelate of Van in 1879. He opened new schools, including the first agricultural school in Armenian lands. In the 1880s he supported the Armenian secret societies devoted to the cause of national liberation, such as Sev khach (\\"’ç÷á ’≠’°’π\\", Black cross) of Van and Pashtpan hayrenyats (\\"’ä’°’∑’ø’∫’°’∂ ’∞’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’µ’°÷Å\\", Defender of the Fatherland). The Ottoman government, which looked unfavorably on his activities, suspended him in 1885 and sent him to Constantinople, where he could be controlled by the authorities. Following the 15 July 1890 Kum Kapu demonstration, four representatives of the Armenian National Assembly (Khrimian, Garegin Srvandztiants, Matthew Izmirlian, Grigoris Aleatjian) presented a report criticizing the Ottoman government for the treatment of the Armenian peasantry. In December 1890, he was exiled to Jerusalem \\"under pretense of being on a pilgrimage.\\" He lived in the St. James monastery in the city's Armenian Quarter. Catholicos On 5 May 1892, an election held at Etchmiadzin unanimously elected Khrimian to the position of Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church. According to Vartooguian, \\"Khrimian's popularity was so overwhelming that any one opposing him would be recognized by the nation as a traitor. Khrimian was recognized as the standard of patriotism, and whoever sought the best interests of the nation could not but favor his election.\\" Vartooguian adds that the Russian imperial government was displeased with his election as they sought to incorporate the Armenian Church under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church in an attempt to Russify the Armenian population. Khrimian, aged 72, was not initially allowed to travel to Etchmiadzin by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. Over a year later, after the Russian emperor's request was he granted permission to travel, but only if he did not set foot in Turkey. According to Hacikyan et al., the Ottomans feared \\"excessive manifestations of jubilations by the Armenians.\\" The Ottoman government forbade Khrimian from traveling to Echmiadzin through their territory, and so he was required to travel via Jaffa, Alexandria, Trieste, Vienna, Odessa, Sevastopol, Batumi, and then Tiflis. Some 17 months after his election, he was enthroned as Catholicos on 26 September 1893. His Ottoman citizenship was revoked and he became a Russian subject. In 1895, he traveled to Saint Petersburg to meet the Russian Tsar Nicholas II to request the implementation of reforms in the Ottoman Empire's Armenian provinces. During the Hamidian massacres of 1894‚Äì96, Khrimian provided material assistance to the Armenian refugees. Among his other accomplishments were the renovations of numerous ancient monasteries and churches. In June 1903, the Russian government issued an edict to close down Armenian schools and confiscate the properties of the Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin. The act had the primary purpose of accelerating the process of Russification of the Armenian people and church. Khrimian collaborated with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF or Dashnaktsutyun) to organize mass demonstrations against the edict. According to the historian Rouben Paul Adalian, it was a combination of Dashnaktsutyun's popular resistance and Khrimian's personal defiance that resulted in the edict being canceled in 1905. In 1907, Khrimian clarified the relations between the patriarch of Constantinople and emphasized the primacy of the see of Echmiadzin. In September of that year he sent a letter to Nicholas II in which he called upon the Russian government to prevent the violence then facing the Ottoman Empire's Armenian population. Views and ideological influence Progressivism A 1906 painting of Khrimian by Vardges Sureniants depicting the moment he received the letter about the Russian decree ordering the confiscation of Armenian Church properties in 1903. In the 1860s and 1870s, Khrimian was, along with Harutiun Svadjian, one of the major liberal Armenian activists in the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, liberals like Grigor Artsruni, Mikael Nalbandian, and Stepanos Nazarian were active in the Russian Empire. Arra Avakian described him as a \\"very progressive educator.\\" American feminist Alice Stone Blackwell wrote in 1917: \\"All his views were progressive\\" and praised his promotion of female education: \\"He was a strong advocate of education for girls, and in one of his books, The Family of Paradise, he argues against the prevailing Oriental idea that husbands have a right to rule over their wives by force.\\" Derderian also noted his \\"belief in the importance of educating women\\" and his encouragement of \\"participation of women in spreading enlightenment principles.\\" Another author stated that he made \\"voluminous contribution to progressive Armenian intellectualism.\\" Vartooguian, writing in 1896, suggested that Khrimian \\"was a conservative in matters of the Church.\\" Nationalism Razmik Panossian writes that Khrimian had a powerful influence on Armenian nationalism. According to Panossian, he is the \\"single most important nineteenth century figure to have entered Armenian consciousness as the bearer of the radical message of national liberation\\". According to Tekkoyun, \\"Khrimian was a prominent figure in the formation of the Armenian nationalism.\\" H. F. B. Lynch, who visited Etchmiadzin in 1893, wrote about Khrimian in his book on Armenia: \\"With him religion and patriotism are almost interchangeable terms.\\" In the words of Adalian, Khrimian is \\"revered for his patriotic fervor and staunch defense of Armenian national interests.\\" Another author described him as a \\"major spokesman for Armenian nationalist aspirations on the international stage.\\" According to Tekkoyun, Khrimian \\"always advocated the awareness of laymen with nationalistic and patriotic ideas, which was possible only through the medium of journals and literature.\\" Khrimian particularly emphasized the use of vernacular language in his writings. Khrimian's view of Armenian nationalism as a cultural reawakening transformed into nationalism as an armed revolutionary movement in response to the repressive regime of Ottoman and Russian government as well as European policies towards Armenia. Khrimian explicitly endorsed the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutyun) in an 1896 letter to the Armenians of Van, in which he wrote: Before this the church had maintained a distance from the Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, to a certain degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation. Death and legacy Khrimian's tombstone at Etchmiadzin Cathedral courtyard Khrimian died on 29 October 1907. He was buried, like many of his predecessors, at the courtyard of Etchmiadzin Cathedral. Sculptor Sergey Merkurov made his death mask. Khrimian was revered by Armenians during his lifetime. He was called Hayrik (diminutive for \\"father\\") since his time as abbot of Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush in the early 1860s. Sarkis Atamian claims that \\"[n]o man, perhaps, in Armenian history, has come to symbolize the kind, wise, paternalistic leader of his flock as did Khrimian who was given the title Hairig (little father) in affection by his people.\\" Jack Kalpakian describes Khrimian as \\"second only to the mythical Haik as the nation's father figure.\\" Khrimian largely focused his efforts on the common people rather than the Armenian elite and is thus considered a \\"hero of the common people.\\" Catholicos Vazgen I (r. 1955‚Äì94) called Khrimian the \\"greatest revolutionary [of the Armenian peasantry]\\". Panossian writes that Khrimian was committed throughout his life to the betterment of the conditions of provincial Armenian and of Armenian rights in general. Khrimian has been described as \\"one of the few truly great figures in the history of the Armenian Church\\" and \\"one of the most famous and beloved national-religious figures of his time.\\" Another author called him \\"the most beloved Armenian patriarch of modern times.\\" Patricia Cholakian wrote of him: \\"a man of great personal holiness, had been among the first to inspire the persecuted Armenians to a love of learning and a sense of pride in their heritage.\\" The prominent linguist Hrachia Acharian called him a true Christian, a true patriot, and a true popular man. The Missionary Herald wrote in 1891 about Khrimian: \\"a man to whom all the Armenian nation look up to with great respect. He has labored honestly and earnestly for good of his nation.\\" Alice Stone Blackwell wrote of him in 1917 as \\"the grandest figure in modern Armenian history\\" and added that \\"He was deeply loved and venerated for his wisdom and saintliness.\\" Prominent Armenian poet Avetik Isahakyan wrote in a 1945 article: \\"The Armenian people will not forget him. The more time passes, the brighter his memory will become. He will look at the Armenian people from the depth of centuries and speak with a familiar language about her cherished aspirations and immortal goals.\\" Khrimian is the subject of paintings of several prominent Armenian artists, such as Ivan Aivazovsky, Yeghishe Tadevosyan, and Vardges Sureniants. Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness wrote a concerto titled Khrimian Hairig in October 1944. In his own words, \\"The music was inspired by a portrait of the heroic priest Khrimian Hairig, who led the Armenian people through many persecutions.\\" The composition was first commercially recorded in 1995 by the Manhattan Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Richard Auldon Clark. A school in Yerevan, Armenia's capital, founded by Khrimian in 1906 and renamed for the 26 Baku Commissars during the Soviet period, was renamed after him in 1989.

In this capacity during World War II, he maintained close ties with the Wehrmacht, while he served in the Allgemeine-SS (General SS). One of his specialities was the \\"Jewish question\\". After the war, Carell became a successful author, although critics claim that his books romanticized and whitewashed the Wehrmacht.  Career before and during World War II  Paul Karl Schmidt became a member of the Nazi Party in 1931 and a member of the SS in 1938. He graduated from university in 1934, and became an assistant at the Institute of Psychology of the Universit√§t Kiel in Germany. He held several positions in the Nazi Student Association. In the SS, Schmidt was promoted to the rank of Obersturmbannf√ºhrer in 1940. During the same year, he became the chief press spokesman for foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. In this position, he was responsible for the German Foreign Ministry's news and press division. Schmidt chaired the daily press conferences of the ministry, and was thus one of the most important and influential propagandists for Nazism during World War II. Recent studies confirm that his influence was at least on the same level as that of Otto Dietrich (Reichspressechef of Adolf Hitler) and of Hans Fritzsche (Pressechef of the Reichspropagandaministerium). Schmidt was also responsible for the German propaganda magazine Signal, which was published in several languages to tell the German side of the story in neutral and occupied countries during the war. Schmidt justified the Holocaust through his propaganda efforts. In May 1944, he gave advice on how to justify the deportation and murder of Hungarian Jews, to counter the potential accusation of mass murder: Schmidt was arrested on 6 May 1945 and interned for 30 months. It was left open for a long time whether he would appear as one of those indicted, or as a witness for the prosecution, during the war crimes trials. During the Ministries Trial, part of the Nuremberg Trials, he finally appeared as a witness for the prosecution, and portrayed himself as a fighter for democratic freedom of the press.N√ºrnberger Dokument Dokument NG-3590, Staatsarchiv N√ºrnberg; eidesstattliche Erkl√§rung Paul Carell Schmidt vom 13. November 1947  Post-war  After World War II, Schmidt became a writer. Aided by the network of 'old comrades' working in the publishing industry, he was able to secure assignments. Starting in the 1950s, he wrote for the popular magazine Kristall. He first used the pseudonym Paul Karell, and later Paul Carell. He worked as a freelance author under various noms de plume for newspapers such as Die Welt and Die Zeit (as P. C. Holm, among others). He also wrote for the magazines Norddeutsche Rundschau and Der Spiegel, and published some accounts of war stories for Der Landser, a West German pulp magazine featuring stories predominantly set during World War II. He was seen as an influential adviser to the German Axel Springer AG, where he wrote speeches for Axel Springer. From 1965 to 1971 the Office of the State Prosecutor of Verden in Germany investigated him for murder. But the investigation, which some claim should have clarified his role in the genocide of Hungarian Jews, ended without an indictment. Schmidt never had to face a trial for his activities during the war.Ermittlungsverfahren der Staatsanwaltschaft Verden gegen Dr. Paul Karl Schmidt u.a. wegen Mordes. Akte 412 AR-Nr. 1082 / 1965; Bundesarchiv, Au√üenstelle Ludwigsburg, neue Signatur (seit November 2003): B 162 AR 650 1082 In 1992 Carell claimed that even after the Battle of Stalingrad there was a possibility for Germany to win the war. In his view, it was primarily the command of Adolf Hitler that led to the defeat. The leadership of the Wehrmacht and very competent commanders such as Erich von Manstein could have achieved victory if not for Hitler's interference. Carell also claimed that the invasion of the Soviet Union was a preemptive attack to forestall an invasion of Germany by the Red Army. Writing career The success of his books Hitler Moves East (Unternehmen Barbarossa) and Scorched Earth (Verbrannte Erde) made Carell a leading post- war chronicler of the German side of World War II on the Eastern Front. His book Die Gefangenen (1980), dealing with German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union, was published by Ullstein-Verlag. These books generally had a positive media reception; Die Welt wrote, for example: \\"Helps to reduce the dislike between Germans and Russians (...) qualified as an historian.\\" Or the ': \\"Someone for whom the seriousness of the source and the value of documentation are more important than going for cheap thrills ‚Äì that is Paul Carell!\\"Der Spiegel 8/1967 vom 13. Februar 1967, Seite 107 Carell also wrote about Rommel and about the Allied invasion of Normandy. In his books, Carell portrays the Wehrmacht as heroes fighting for a lost cause. Carell presents the post-war revisionist messages first popularized by leading Wehrmacht ex-generals: *The German soldier fought a clean war imposed on him by an evil dictator (there is no mention of the war of aggression and annihilation, which the war in the East really was). *The Waffen-SS appear as soldiers just like all the rest *In the end, the overwhelming material and human resources of the enemy defeat the Germans Critics point out that Carell's works emphasize the German army's professionalism, sacrifice and positive encounters with civilians, and his books also suggest that the Wehrmacht freed the Russians from their Communist tyrants and restored their religious community. Critics also suggest that in Carell's works the army thus operated in a world distinct from the political sphere, and the culprits for any calamities that befell the Russian people rule this political sphere, namely the Nazi and the Communist parties. The thrust of this argument thus confirmed the high moral position of the German officer, perpetuating the myth of the \\"clean Wehrmacht\\". Carell's themes of anti-Communism also appealed to the U.S. public and garnered Carell repeat reprints. Carell is the author of: *Stalingrad: The Defeat of the German 6th Army.

Made of sponge cake to resemble a miniature actual Yule log, it is a form of sweet roulade. The original Yule log recipe emerged during the 19th century. It is traditionally made from a genoise, generally baked in a large, shallow Swiss roll pan, iced, rolled to form a cylinder, and iced again on the outside. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate buttercream, though many variations that include chocolate cake, ganache, and icings flavored with espresso or liqueurs exist. Yule logs are often served with one end cut off and set atop the cake, or protruding from its side to resemble a chopped off branch. A bark-like texture is often produced by dragging a fork through the icing, and powdered sugar sprinkled to resemble snow.Claiborne, Craig, The New York Times Cookbook, Harper & Row, New York, 1961; , p. 545. Other cake decorations may include actual tree branches, fresh berries, and mushrooms made of meringue or marzipan. The name b√ªche de No√´l originally referred to the Yule log itself, and was transferred to the dessert only after the custom had fallen out of use, presumably during the first half of the 20th century.

Armies The German Imperial Forces were under the command of Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha and numbered just over 1,500. They were armed with 1,625 modern rifles, 30 artillery pieces and 14 machine guns. The Herero were under the command of Samuel Maharero and ‚Äì in expectation of peace negotiations ‚Äì had assembled some 3,500-6,000 warriors along with their families. The total number of Hereros in the area is estimated at 25,000 to 50,000. The rest were armed with traditional close combat weapons called kirri. Preparations for battle From the opening of the Herero Revolt in January 1904 until June 11, 1904, the German military efforts had been directed by colonial Governor Colonel Theodor Leutwein.This summary is taken from Isabel V. Hull, Absolute Destruction: Military Culture and The Practices of War in Imperial Germany (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2005), Chapter 1. Leutwein combined a policy of military pressure with communication with the Herero to negotiate a settlement to the hostilities. The Germans achieved moderate military success in a series of skirmishes before cornering the Herero at the Waterberg Plateau. However, the Kaiserreich replaced Leutwein with Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha, expecting Trotha to end the revolt with a decisive military victory. The Waterberg Plateau where the Herero concentrated lay 100 km east of the railhead source of German supplies, so Trotha spent nearly three months (June, July, and part of August) transporting troops and supplies by ox-drawn carts to the site of the expected battle. In the meantime, the Herero, estimated around 60,000 men, women, and children, with an equal number of cattle, drew on meager grass and water supplies while awaiting overtures from the Germans. Battle Two shell casings from the battlefield at the Waterberg, found in October 2012 Memorial to fallen Herero warriors at the Waterberg Plateau Execution of Trotha‚Äôs battle plan began on August 11, 1904, after a careful buildup of troops and supplies. The German commander intended part of his force to squeeze the Herero south of the Plateau with columns from the east and west while two more columns would seal off the escape route to the south and southeast. The commander of the southeastern blocking column, however, failed to maneuver his troops into position in a timely fashion, and to communicate that fact to Trotha. Meanwhile, the western advancing column did not stop at the appointed line and pressed the Herero through the unclosed gap created by the failure of the southeastern troops. The bulk of the Herero and their cattle escaped eastward into the Omaheke Desert. The Waterberg military station was occupied by Herero mounted infantry and irregular guerrilla forces. These Herero forces were quickly defeated by colonial forces using breech-loading artillery and 14 Maxim belt-fed machine guns at the Battle of Waterberg on August 11, but the survivors escaped into the desert. Trotha and his staff were unprepared for their failure to decisively defeat the Herero. At the end of an attenuated supply line and occupying ground thoroughly foraged by the Herero, the Germans could not immediately pursue. While signaling to Berlin a complete victory and subsequent pursuit, Trotha began to move his force westward toward the railroad. The Germans had won a tactical victory by driving the Herero from Waterberg, but had failed in their intentions to end the Herero Revolt with a decisive battle. Trotha soon thereafter ordered the pursuit of the Herero eastward into the desert, intending to prevent Herero reorganization by depriving them of pastureland and watering holes. This campaign caused most of the deaths of Herero people during the Revolt, and resulted in the notorious extermination order of October 2, 1904.See also Helmut Bley, South West Africa Under German Rule, 1894-1914 (Evanston, Ill., Northwestern University Press, 1971); Jon Bridgman, The Revolt of the Hereros (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1981); Jan-Bart Gewald, Towards Redemption: A Socio-Political History of the Herero of Namibia between 1890 and 1923 (Leiden, 1996); and Kirsten Zirkel, \\"Military Power in German Colonial Policy: The Schutztruppen and Their Leaders in East and South West Africa, 1888-1918,\\" in David Killingray and David Omissi, eds., Guardians of Empire: The Armed Forces of the Colonial Powers, 1700-1964 (New York, 1999). The aftermath On 2 October, von Trotha issued the infamous extermination order: \\"Any Herero found within the German borders with or without a gun, with or without cattle, will be shot\\".Battle of Waterberg - Namibia (Part 2). While most Herero escaped the battle, their retreat led to the near extinction of their people in an act of genocide. Many of the refugee Hereros died of thirst and exhaustion during their trek through the desert. German patrols later found skeletons around holes 8‚Äì16 m (25‚Äì50 ft) deep dug in a vain attempt to find water. Tens of thousands of the Herero died of thirst, starvation, or disease. Those who attempted surrender were summarily shot. After Trotha's extermination order was countermanded by Berlin, captured survivors were sent to a concentration camp at Shark Island. Despite extensive German patrols and a large bounty offered for his capture, Samuel Maharero and about 1,000 of his men managed to cross the Kalahari into the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The British offered the Hereros asylum under the condition that they would not continue their revolt on British soil. The site of the battle is today located within Waterberg Plateau Park. A military graveyard exists where the German soldiers who perished in the Battle of Waterberg are buried. References External links * Isabel V.

In the northernmost corner of the county (i.e., the originally Norwegian parishes of S√§rna and Idre), a characteristic dialect reminiscent of eastern Norwegian is spoken. Otherwise, the different Dalecarlians can be regarded as Swedish and join the Swedish dialect group in G√§strikland, Uppland, and northern and eastern V√§stmanland. They also show some similarities with the dialects of the other counties bordering Dalarna. One usually distinguishes between the Dalecarlian mountain dialects, which are spoken in south-eastern Dalarna, and .Bengt Pamp, Svenska dialekter, Lund 1978, sid. 111  Geographical distribution of Dalecarlian proper  Dalecarlian dialects are generally classified geographically: *Ovansiljan, north of the Siljan lake: sockens Ore, Orsa, V√•mhus, √Ñlvdalen (Elfdalian dialect), Mora, Venjan, Soller√∂n. *Nedansiljan, south of the Siljan lake: sockens Boda, R√§ttvik, Bjurs√•s, √Öl, Siljansn√§s, Leksand, Gagnef. *Upper V√§sterdalarna: sockens Lima, Transtrand. *Lower V√§sterdalarna: sockens Malung, √Ñppelbo, J√§rna, N√•s, Floda, the parishes of Mockfj√§rd in Gagnefs socken. *Floda and Mockfj√§rd can be considered as a separate group. Very independent are Dalecarlian proper (especially in √Ñlvdalen, Mora and Orsa, to some extent also in Ore, R√§ttvik and Leksand), as well as western Dalecarlian. Elfdalian is the one of the Dalecarlian dialects that best kept their older features. This dialect attracted research early on, as it deviated very significantly from other Swedish dialects. In many ways, it is very archaic. In other ways, it has distinguished itself from the ancient language and developed special features that are rare in other languages. A characteristic for the \\"Dalecarlian dialect\\" is a pronounced split in a number of narrowly limited and easily distinguishable local dialects, which often only cover a single village or even part of a village. For strangers, Dalecarlian is virtually incomprehensible without special studies. However, this does not apply to the same extent about the R√§ttvik and Leksand dialects. They are more easily understood and can be considered to form a transition from the more archaic dialects. Such transition goals are also the goals of √Öl, Bjurs√•s and Gagnef. The Gagnef dialect approaches the western Dalecarlian dialects, which to some extent can also be regarded as transitional dialects, but which in many respects take on a more independent position, especially in the upper parishes. They may show similarities with neighbouring Norwegian dialects. From Gagnef, the leap is quite large to the Stora Tuna dialect, which belongs to the Dalarna mountain dialects, a relatively uniform and fairly normal Swedish dialect complex that covers the entire southern Dalarna (Stora Kopparberg, Hedemora and V√§sterbergslagen). The most deviant within this complex are the Sv√§rdsj√∂ and western mountain dialects, which are approaching H√§lsingem√•l and the western Dalecarlian language (over Grang√§rde and Floda). Mountain dialects are also spoken in the northern part of V√§stmanland. The mountain dialects connect quite closely with neighbouring Uppsala dialects, perhaps most with Eastern V√§stmanland's dialects. In everyday speech, many with Dalecarlian often also refer to regionally coloured \\"national languages\\" from Dalarna, that is, a lexical and morphologically \\"nationally\\" Swedish with a Dalarna characteristic intonation and prosody. In linguistics, one distinguishes between regionally coloured national languages and genuine dialects, and Dalecarlian is used exclusively for dialects in the latter sense.  Dalecarlian phonology  As with most dialects in northern and central Sweden, the Dalecarlian dialects have a supradental heavy-r and a cachuminal (with the tip of the tongue towards the trough) have thick-l. However, superdental numbers are more limited than usual, for example, rs often becomes ss (for example, Dalecarlian koss, Swedish kors, English cross), rn in southern Dalarna becomes r (for example, Dalecarlian bar, Swedish barn, English child, Dalecarlian bj√∂r, Swedish bj√∂rn, English bear, up to and including R√§ttvik, Leksand and V√§sterdalarna). In Dalecarlian proper is often nn, and rt, rd preserved without assimilation (from Gagnef northwards). l is not usually cachuminal after i and e, except in Dalecarlian proper, which in the case of l has gone its own way and can even partially use cachuminal l at the beginning of words, for example l√•ta. Dalecarlian has, in the usual way, lost -n and, as a rule, -t in unstressed endings, for example, Dalecarlian sola or sole, Swedish solen, English sun, Dalecarlian g√¢tu, Swedish gatan, English street, Dalecarlian biti, Swedish bitit, English bitten. Like other Upper Swedish dialects, they often have i in endings for the national languages e, for example Dalecarlian funnin, Swedish funnen, English found, Dalecarlian muli, Swedish mulet, English cloudy, Dalecarlian h√§rvil, Swedish h√§rvel, English h√§rvel (winding yarn on), has g-sounds, not j, in rg and lg, for example Dalecarlian and Swedish varg, English wolf, long vowel in front of m in many words, where the national language has short, for example Dalecarlian tima, Swedish timme, English hour, Dalecarlian t√∂m, Swedish tom, English empty. j has not disappeared without trace after k, g in words such as Dalecarlian √§ntja, Swedish √§nka, English widow, Dalecarlian bryddja, Swedish brygga, English bridge. As in the northern Swedes and in the northern dialects, g, k have also been softened to tj, (d) j, for example Dalecarlian s√§ttjin or s√§ttjen, Swedish s√§cken, English bag, Dalecarlian botja or botje Swedish boken, English book, Dalecarlian nyttjil, Swedish nyckel, English key. These traits characterise all Dalecarlian dialects. Characteristic of the vocal system in especially Upper Dalarna, with the exception of Dalecarlian proper, is the use of open and end a, which is used in a completely different way than in the national language: the open can occur as far and the closed as short, for example hara hare with open a in first, end in second syllable, katt, bakka, vagn with end, skabb, kalv with open a; open √• sound (o) is often replaced by a sound between √• and √∂; The u sound has a sound similar to the Norwegian u; √§ and e are well separated; the low-pitched vocals often have a sound of √§. Among the most interesting features of the dialects in √Ñlvdalen, Mora and Orsa is that they still largely retain the nasal vocal sounds that were previously found in all Nordic dialects. Furthermore, it is noticed that the long i, y, u diphthongs, usually to ai, √•y, au, for example Dalecarlian ais, Swedish is English ice, Dalecarlian kn√•yta, Swedish knyta, English tie, Dalecarlian aute, Swedish ute, English out. v has the Old Norse pronunciation w (like w in English),Elias Wess√©n, Svensk spr√•khistoria (√•ttonde upplagan), del 1, Lund 1969, sid. 37-38 l is usually omitted in front of g, k, p, v, for example, Dalecarlian k√•v, Swedish kalf, English calf, Dalecarlian fok and such Swedish folk, English folk, people. h is omitted, for example, Dalecarlian and, Swedish and English hand (in the √Ñlvdals-, Orsa- and Mora dialects, as well as in R√§ttvik and parts of Leksand). In the same way, many words have been added as h:n such as h√§ven, h√§lsklig, h√§gde. These features have the common Dalecarlian in common with the older Uppland dialects. A pair of ancient Nordic diphthongs remain in the western Dalecarlian dialects in Lima and Transtrand. The diphthong au, which in the Swedish state has pronounced √∂, has in these areas a slightly changed form, √¥u, for example d√¥u (Swedish d√∂d, English death). The ancient Swedish diphthongs ei and √∂y (which in Swedish became e and √∂ respectively) have been pronounced √§i, for example sk√§i (Swedish sked, English Spoon) and here (Swedish h√∂, English hay), respectively.

In Upper Dalarna, the declension has developed a peculiar development, in particular through the coincidence of different types of declension. In parts of Gagnef, for example, almost all nouns have the same inflection in plur: \\"\\" chorus \\"\\" men, \\"\\" chick \\"\\" girls, \\"\\" baror \\"\\" children, \\"\\" apple laurel \\"\\" apples; Requests. f. the guy, the flick, the baran, the apple . Instead, at least the \\"valley goal\\" (including parts of Leksand and Djura) and the western valley goals have preserved the old case-inflection, in particular the dative forms, for example \\"\\" in bu (d) about \\"\\" and d. In the sheds. (Also, otherwise, these many age- old features in terms of word-bending - as in the sound system - show, but these are not described here.) In the adjective inflection in southern Dalarna, plural is used without endings, for example all hands all hands, many walks many times, adj. on - in: rolin calm, on u (g): toku (g) tokig. Me, you, are usually called \\"\\"mug, dough, say\\"\\", \\"\\"springtime, andr√•m\\"\\" (southern Dalarna) are five. of ours, another.

It is called where, where electricity. been, havi el. h√§vi had, been, became, became. In Upper Dalarna the verb inflection is peculiarly developed, in the actual valley goal it is in some respects very old-fashioned. Regarding the vocabulary, a large number of peculiar and otherwise rare words are noticed, especially in the upper parishes. In southern Dalarna it is more normal. The moon is everywhere called the moon and spring is called the box (cf. Gotlandian the charge !), Words that include. a. Used by Dalarna's skull, Erik Axel Karlfeldt. Itji el. tji can be used instead of not . Adverbs on - e usually end in - a : inna, nera, √¥ppa as in V√§stmanland and G√§strikland. Mil is neutrum and trolley feminimum. The name tag is characteristic: the old farm names are used as family names and put before the baptismal name, for example Back P√§r Erssa.  References   Notes   Sources  * Adolf Noreen \\"Dalm√•let.

This song was not released in North America until Beatles '65 five months later. Structure According to musicologist Ian MacDonald, Lennon created the song based on the chords of Del Shannon's \\"Runaway\\" which had been a UK hit in April 1961. Author Bill Harry also wrote: \\"He just reworked the chords of the Shannon number and came up with a completely different song\\". With its poignant lyric and flamenco style acoustic guitars \\"I'll Be Back\\" possesses a tragic air and is eccentric in structure. Unusually for a pop song it oscillates between major and minor keys; appears to have two different bridges and lacks a chorus. The fade-out ending also arrives unexpectedly, being a half stanza premature. The metric structure also is unusual. The verse is in 6-measure phrases in time. The first and third bridges have a four- measure phrase in followed by a phrase with 2 measures of and one of ; the second bridge has a 4-measure phrase followed by 5 measures of and one of . Producer George Martin preferred to open and close Beatles albums using dominant material stating: \\"Another principle of mine when assembling an album was always to go out on a side strongly, placing the weaker material towards the end but then going out with a bang\\". Ian MacDonald points out however: \\"Fading away in tonal ambiguity at the end of A Hard Day‚Äôs Night, it was a surprisingly downbeat farewell and a token of coming maturity\\". Music journalist Robert Sandall wrote in Mojo magazine: \\"'I'll Be Back' was the early Beatles at their most prophetic. This grasp of how to colour arrangements in darker or more muted tones foreshadowed an inner journey they eventually undertook in three albums' time, on Rubber Soul\\". Recording The Beatles recorded \\"I'll Be Back\\" in 16 takes on 1 June 1964. The first nine were of the rhythm track, and the last seven were overdubs of the lead and harmony vocals, and an acoustic guitar overdub. The Anthology 1 CD includes take two of \\"I'll Be Back\\", performed in time. The recording broke down when Lennon fumbled over the words in the bridge, complaining on the take that \\"it's too hard to sing.\\" The subsequent take, also included on Anthology, was performed in the time used in the final take.

The character will make his cinematic debut in James Gunn's upcoming DC Extended Universe film, The Suicide Squad, portrayed by Michael Rooker. Fictional character biography Brian Durlin, better known as Savant, is the spoiled heir to an enormous fortune. Savant had moved to Gotham City to become a self-styled vigilante. However, after Batman discouraged his involvement in vigilantism because of his lack of care to protect others, he turned his own formidable computer skills into a profitable blackmailing business. Savant was joined in this by an ex-Russian KGB agent named Creote. Savant later kidnapped Black Canary in hopes to get the real identity of Batman from Oracle. However, he was soon defeated by her team.Birds of Prey Vol.1 #59 (November 2003) Oracle then made the decision to attempt to rehabilitate him, mainly in order to keep his data files on hundreds of real villains. Like his namesake, he is a genius; however, due to a chemical imbalance he exhibits a non-linear memory and seems to be quite forgetful. Savant has also exhibited feelings for Oracle, probably rooted in his envy of her computer skills. Savant went on, under Oracle's control, to clean up a Gotham neighborhood. However his unique methods lead Oracle to regret her decision. Savant and Creote then joined forces with The Huntress to take over the Gotham mafia by placing Huntress as capo. As part of a plan by Calculator to get to Oracle, Savant was kidnapped and tortured by agents of the Secret Society of Super Villains.Birds of Prey Vol.1 #88 (January 2006) However his non-linear memory helped him to resist the interrogation, making it appear to last only a few hours rather than the days it had really been. He was rescued by the Birds of Prey and out of anger pushed the villain Black Spider out of a window. Spider survived, meaning the Birds did not have to arrest Savant for murder, though he did end his association with Oracle.Birds of Prey Vol.1 #90 (March 2006) He and Creote turn up alongside dozens of former Birds of Prey and friends of Barbara to confront Spy Smasher.Birds of Prey Vol.1 #108 (September 2007) He is one of the villains sent to retrieve the Get Out of Hell free card from the Secret Six. Savant is seemingly attacked and murdered by The White Canary. After a failed attempt to keep him alive, a grieving Creote blames Oracle for this and shoots himself.Birds of Prey Vol.2 #2 (August 2010) However, it turns out that they both faked their deaths. They later appear in Oracle's base and abduct her, planning for her to reveal her secret identity to the world.Birds of Prey Vol.2 #3 (September 2010) They take Oracle to the top of the Gotham Dam, where Savant reveals that his distorted sense of time means that his torture at the hands of the Secret Society feels like it only happened five minutes ago and that he has been in constant mental agony for two years. He then reveals that the true purpose of bringing Oracle out to the dam was to have her witness his suicide and attempts to throw himself off the dam, but Oracle leaps from her chair and stops him, convincing Creote to help pull them up despite his promise to let Savant die. She then explains to a confused Savant that Creote is in love with him.Birds of Prey Vol.2 #4 (October 2010) Creote later admits his feelings to Savant, who to his surprise reciprocates. Savant and Creote were offered positions in the Birds of Prey by Oracle yet again, Savant on technical staff, Creote as a bodyguard. Recently, Savant has appeared in a meeting with the Calculator to have faked his breakdown to infiltrate Oracle's operation. However, it is later apparent in a meeting with Oracle and Batman that he is a double agent for the Birds of Prey, to feed Calculator information that would ultimately allow the Birds to successfully fake the death of Oracle. The brief encounter with Batman revealed that neither of them has forgotten their previous hostility towards the other. The New 52 In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a character named Savant is reintroduced as a member of Amanda Waller's new Suicide Squad. As part of an effort to weed out the weak link in the group, the candidates are tortured, with Savant eventually cracking under the pressure and betraying the group. He is dragged away and seemingly killed, but his fate is left uncertain.Suicide Squad Vol.4 #1 (November 2011) He appeared in issues six to eight, as part of the new Squad tasked with tracking down Harley Quinn. In other media Brian Durlin / Savant will appear in the upcoming DC Extended Universe film The Suicide Squad, portrayed by Michael Rooker.

They are also called \\"ittan monme\\" or \\"ittan monmen.\\" Summary According to the ≈åsumi Kimotsukigun H≈çgen Sh≈´ () jointly authored by the locally born educator, Nomura Denshi and the folkloricist Kunio Yanagita, at evening time, a cloth-like object about 1 tan in area (about 10.6 meters in length by 30 centimeters in width) would flutter around attack people. They are said to wrap around people's necks and cover people's faces and suffocate people to death, and in other tales it is said that wrapped cloths would spin around and around and quickly come flying, wrap around people's bodies, and take them away to the skies. There is a story where one man hurrying to his home at night when a white cloth came and wrapped around his neck, and when he cut it with his wakizashi (short sword), the cloth disappeared, and remaining on his hands was some blood. In regions where they are said to appear and disappear, there seemed to be a custom where children were warned that if they play too late, that \\"ittan momen would come.\\" Also, it is said that in Kimotsuki, there is are shrines (the for example) where ittan momen are said to frequently appear, and it was believed that when children pass in front of the shrine, an ittan momen flying above in the skies would attack the very last child in line, so children would go run ahead and cut through. The cloth y≈çkai in the by Tosa Mitsunobu In the classical y≈çkai emaki, the , there is a y≈çkai shaped like a cloth with arms and legs, and the folklorist hypothesizes that this is the origin of ittan momen. Recent sightings According to a report from the y≈çkai researcher , in recent years there have been many eyewitness reports of flying cloth-shaped objects thought to be ittan momen. In Kagoshima Prefecture where this legend is told, white cloth-like objects flying in low altitude have been witnessed. In Fukuoka Prefecture, also in Kyushu, there have been reports of extremely speedy ittan momen flying alongside shinkansen trains witnessed by shinkansen passengers. Outside Kyushu, there have been witness reports in Higashi-K≈çenji Station and Ogikubo, Tokyo. In Higashi-K≈çenji, a woman walking her dog witnessed a cloth flying in the skies and followed it for a while. In Shizuoka Prefecture, elementary school kids were said to have seen a transparent sheet-like object flutter around, and the entire object was like a rectangle, but it became thin on one end, like a tail. In 2004, in Hy≈çgo Prefecture, a UFO filming society captured footage of an unidentified cloth-shaped object flying in the skies above Mount Rokk≈ç and it is said to be extremely large, at 30 meters. While filming Natsuhiko Kyogoku \\"Kai\\", the actor Shir≈ç Sano witnessed an ittan momen flying above, and it is said to have a long white shape. Also, in the eastern Japan earthquake, there have been many reports of something closely resembling an ittan momen, and there have been many videos confirmed to show a white cloth- like object flying in the air. True identity Ittan momen are thought to appear in the evening, but the general view is that this is because in the past, parents needed to do farmwork for the entire day including at this time and therefore could not keep an eye on their children, so the tales of ittan momen were told to children to warn them of the dangers of playing too late. Also, in the lands where the legend is told, there is a custom of raising a cotton flag during burials for the purpose of mourning, so it is inferred that some of these would be blown by the wind and fly in the air and thus be connected to the legends of the momen y≈çkai. In the Japanese television series Tokoro-san no Me ga Ten! there was an experiment performed in which a piece of cloth about 50 centimeters long was set up and moved in the darkness, and the average length reported by the people who saw it was 2.19 meters, with the longest being 6 meters. The program suggested that when a white or bright objects move in the darkness, a positive afterimage optical illusion would leave a trail due to movement, causing soaring things in the forests at night such as musasabi to be seen as longer than they actually are, and thus mistaken as ittan momen. In fiction There are no depictions of ittan momen in classical y≈çkai emaki, so this y≈çkai was once relatively unknown, but ever since their appearance in Mizuki Shigeru's comic GeGeGe no Kitar≈ç, it became more widely known. This comic depicted them to talk in a Kyushu dialect, have good-natured personalities, and have a unique look while flying, which raised their fame and popularity despite their original legend of attacking people. In Shigeru's birthplace, Sakaiminato, Tottori Prefecture, they ranked number 1 in the \\"First Y≈çkai Popularity Poll\\" held by the tourism association. Also, in Shigeru's y≈çkai depictions, like the other characters of Kitar≈ç, they are depicted as a cloth with two eyes and two arms, so now they are commonly perceived to be pieces of cloth with two eyes in y≈çkai depictions, but Mizuki's y≈çkai depictions are original inventions and the ones in actual legend and in the previous witness reports have no eyes or arms and are instead simply flying objects that resembled cloth. In Kamen Rider Hibiki, they appeared as enemy characters and they were based on the original legend with some extra original twists on their appearance and personality. In 2007, the local historian of Kagoshima Prefecture, Takenoi Satoshi, started creating kamishibai of ittan momen so that such legends that are gradually being forgotten can be remembered by the children. In the 2020 anime adaptation of the In/Spectre {\\"Kyok≈ç Suiri\\") novels, an ittan momen drawn in the Mizuki style, flies out from under the skirt of the female protagonist Kotoko. Similar y≈çkai The following are y≈çkai considered to be similar to ittan momen. The musasabi would through the air along forest streets at night and cling to people's faces in surprise, so it is theorized that they are thought to a y≈çkai like this. Fusuma (\\"bedding\\") :A y≈çkai told to frequently appear and disappear on Sado Island in the Edo Period. It was a y≈çkai that looked like a large furoshiki, and they would come flying out of nowhere at roads at night and cover the heads of pedestrians. They cannot be cut with blades of any sharpness, but they can be bit apart with teeth that have been blackened at least once. It is said that because of this, there was a custom for males to blacken their teeth. Futon kabuse (literally, \\"cover with futon\\") :Saku- shima, Aichi Prefecture. In the writings of the folkloricist Kunio Yanagita, it is only written that \\"they'd float along and flying in with a whoosh, covering and suffocating to death,\\" so there are not many legends about it and not much is known, but it is interpreted to be a futon-hsaped object that come flying in and covering people's faces and suffocating them to death. In popular culture * In the anime/manga series Inu x Boku SS, one of the characters, Rensh≈ç Sorinozuka, is an Ittan-momen. * In the tokusatsu franchise Super Sentai, the Ittan-momen was seen as a basis of a monster in series installments themed after Japanese culture: ** In Kakuranger (1994), one of the Youkai Army Corps members the Kakurangers fought was an Ittan-momen. It appeared in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers toyline as \\"Calcifire\\". ** In Shinkenger (2009), one of the Ayakashi, named Urawadachi, served as the basis of the Ittan-momen within the series. He was not adapted into Power Rangers Samurai. ** In Ninninger (2015), one of the Youkai the Ninningers fought was an Ittan-momen, with elements borrowed from a carpet and a magician. It was later adapted into Power Rangers Ninja Steel as Abrakadanger who appears in his self-titled episode. * In Yo-kai Watch, the Ittan-momen appears as a cloth-strip Yo-kai and is called So-Sorree in the English dub. Anyone inspirited by So-Sorree can become mischievous and then give insincere apologies. So-Sorree can evolve into Bowminos (a domino-shaped Yo-kai who makes anyone it inspirits give sincere apologies) and can be fused with Merican Flower to become Ittan-Sorry. * In GeGeGe no Kitar≈ç, a recurring y≈çkai character named Ittan Momen (Rollo Cloth in English translations) appears as an anthropomorphic cloth with the ability to fly.

When he was a child, this ability resulted in him being ostracized by humans. His youkai friends told him that in order to be stronger, he must find the oni-eating tengu. The young Kantarou then vows to find it and name it. By naming one, a human becomes master and the name contract is only broken if the master chooses. As Kantarou grows up, he finds a career as a folklorist and a part-time exorcist, alongside his youkai friend Youko. An assignment leads Kantarou to a mountain where a shrine marks the place where the tengu had been sealed away. Calling upon the tengu by the name Haruka, Kantarou breaks the seal and becomes Haruka's master. As time goes on, Kantarou, Youko, and Haruka develop a close friendship. However, this relationship is threatened by Haruka's returning memories and his yearning to know more about his past. Characters ; : : Kantarou is a young folklorist and part-time exorcist with an ability to see youkai. Kantarou is highly intelligent and is quite sneaky and manipulative. He is able to trick others into doing what he wants and anticipate their reactions. This trait has resulted in him being called a tactician by Haruka, hence the title of the series. Despite this, Kantarou has a good heart and feels deeply for youkai. Although it is customary for an exorcist to kill youkai, Kantarou chooses to reason with them and sees his line of work as a way to help them. His attitude has been criticized by both Haruka and Sugino, as they feel it may endanger him. ; : : Haruka is an oni-eating tengu, the strongest of all youkai. Kantarou, having named him, became his master and friend. Haruka has the ability to control lightning. Occasionally, such as when he is attacking oni, Haruka can transfigure into his true youkai form. His nails grow sharper and longer, his fangs grow longer, and his eyes constrict. Usually, he appears as a tall, dark-haired man with black wings that he can either hide or reveal. Haruka is troubled by his lack of memories, inability to eat youkai, and loss of power, which starts to affect his sense of self. Haruka's name under his previous master, an onmy≈çd≈ç practitioner, was Rin. As Rin, he did not have a good relationship with his master, and it is hinted that she took advantage of his subservient status for sexual purposes. ; : : Youko is a female kitsune youkai whom Kantarou named. At the beginning of Tactics, Youko had already been living with Kantarou. She is loud and impulsive, and often loses her temper towards Kantaoru. Youko has the ability to make her fox ears appear and disappear at will, and can turn into her fox form if she wishes. Youko is shown to be deeply concerned about the household expenses and pesters Kantarou about finishing his book manuscripts. Before joining Kantarou, Youko was initially a lonely youkai who deceived travellers into thinking she was a member of their family. Youko pretends to be Kantarou's wife, but Kantarou soon reveals her to be a youkai, and invites her to join his household. ; : : Suzu is a rich teenage girl who constantly helps Katarou on his cases.

The first pottery was made during the Palaeolithic era. Chinese ceramics range from construction materials such as bricks and tiles, to hand- built pottery vessels fired in bonfires or kilns, to the sophisticated Chinese porcelain wares made for the imperial court and for export. Porcelain was a Chinese invention and is so identified with China that it is still called \\"china\\" in everyday English usage. A Ming-dynasty blue-and-white porcelain dish with a dragon Most later Chinese ceramics, even of the finest quality, were made on an industrial scale, thus few names of individual potters were recorded. Many of the most important kiln workshops were owned by or reserved for the emperor, and large quantities of Chinese export porcelain were exported as diplomatic gifts or for trade from an early date, initially to East Asia and the Islamic world, and then from around the 16th century to Europe. Chinese ceramics have had an enormous influence on other ceramic traditions in these areas. Yaozhou ware celadon bowl, Song dynasty, 10th-11th century. Increasingly over their long history, Chinese ceramics can be classified between those made for the imperial court to use or distribute, those made for a discriminating Chinese market, and those for popular Chinese markets or for export. Some types of wares were also made only or mainly for special uses such as burial in tombs, or for use on altars. Terminology and categories qingbai porcelain vase, bowl, and model of a granary with transparent blue-toned glaze, from the period of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD) The earliest Chinese pottery was earthenware, which continued in production for utilitarian uses throughout Chinese history, but was increasingly less used for fine wares. Stoneware, fired at higher temperatures, and naturally impervious to water, was developed very early and continued to be used for fine pottery in many areas at most periods; the tea bowls in Jian ware and Jizhou ware made during the Song dynasty are examples. Porcelain, on a Western definition, is \\"a collective term comprising all ceramic ware that is white and translucent, no matter what ingredients are used to make it or to what use it is put\\".An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery. 2nd edition.

Terms such as \\"\\" or \\"near-porcelain\\" may be used for stonewares with porcelain-like characteristics.Valenstein, 22, 59‚Äì60, 72 The Erya defined porcelain () as \\"fine, compact pottery ()\\".Bushell, S. W. (1977) Chinese Pottery and Porcelain. Oxford University Press, Kuala Lumpur. . Chinese pottery can also be classified as being either northern or southern. China comprises two separate and geologically different land masses, brought together by continental drift and forming a junction that lies between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, sometimes known as the Nanshan-Qinling divide. The contrasting geology of the north and south led to differences in the raw materials available for making ceramics; in particular the north lacks petunse or \\"porcelain stone\\", needed for porcelain on the strict definition. Ware-types can be from very widespread kiln-sites in either north or south China, but the two can nearly always be distinguished, and influences across this divide may affect shape and decoration, but will be based on very different clay bodies, with fundamental effects. The kiln types were also different, and in the north the fuel was usually coal, as opposed to wood in the south, which often affects the wares. Southern materials have high silica, low alumina and high potassium oxide, the reverse of northern materials in each case. The northern materials are often very suitable for stoneware, while in the south there are also areas highly suitable for porcelain.Korean art from the Gompertz and other collections in the Fitzwilliam Museum, ed.

A black pottery cooking cauldron from the Hemudu culture (c. 5000 ‚Äì c. 3000 BC)  Technical developments  In the context of Chinese ceramics, the term porcelain lacks a universally accepted definition (see above). This in turn has led to confusion about when the first Chinese porcelain was made. Claims have been made for the late Eastern Han dynasty (100‚Äì200 AD), the Three Kingdoms period (220‚Äì280 AD), the Six Dynasties period (220‚Äì589 AD), and the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì906 AD). Kiln technology has always been a key factor in the development of Chinese pottery. The Chinese developed effective kilns capable of firing at around before 2000 BC. These were updraft kilns, often built below ground. Two main types of kiln were developed by about 200 AD and remained in use until modern times. These are the dragon kiln of hilly southern China, usually fuelled by wood, long and thin and running up a slope, and the horseshoe-shaped mantou kiln of the north Chinese plains, smaller and more compact. Both could reliably produce the temperatures of up to or more needed for porcelain. In the late Ming, the egg-shaped kiln (zhenyao) was developed at Jingdezhen, but mainly used there. This was something of a compromise between the other types, and offered locations in the firing chamber with a range of firing conditions.Rawson, 364, 369‚Äì370; Vainker, 222‚Äì223 History Important specific types of pottery, many coming from more than one period, are dealt with individually in sections lower down.

By the Middle and Late Neolithic (about 5000 to 1500 BCE) most of the larger archaeological cultures in China were farmers producing a variety of attractive and often large vessels, often boldly painted, or decorated by cutting or impressing. Decoration is abstract or of stylized animals ‚Äì fish are a speciality at the river settlement of Banpo. The distinctive Majiayao pottery, with orange bodies and black paint, is characterised by fine paste textures, thin walls, and polished surfaces; the almost complete lack of defects in excavated pots suggests a high level of quality control during production. The Majiayao and other phases of the Yangshao culture are well-represented in Western museums; by the Banshan phase purple was used in slip-painting alongside black.Vainker, 15‚Äì20 During the 4th millennium the potter's wheel seems to scholars of Chinese ceramics to have been a Chinese invention,Vainker, 12 though several regions to the West also claim the honour. Previously coil-forming was used for large vessels.Vainker, 19 Finds of vessels are mostly in burials; sometimes they hold the remains. By 4100‚Äì2600 BCE in the Dawenkou culture shapes later familiar from Chinese ritual bronzes begin to appear. One exceptional ritual site, Niuheliang in the far north, produced numerous human figurines, some about half life- size.Vainker, 20‚Äì21 Painted pottery pot with raised reliefs of dragons and phoenixes, Western Han dynasty (202 BC ‚Äì 9 AD) Han dynasty, 206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD On some Chinese definitions, the first porcelain was made in Zhejiang province during the Eastern Han dynasty. Shards recovered from archaeological Eastern Han kiln sites estimated firing temperature ranged from .He Li, (1996). Chinese Ceramics. The New Standard Guide. The Han Dynasty made the first ceramics to survive in appreciable quantities. Thames and Hudson, London. . As far back as 1000 BC, the so-called \\"porcelaneous wares\\" or \\"proto-porcelain wares\\" were made using at least some kaolin fired at high temperatures. The dividing line between the two and true porcelain wares is not a clear one. Archaeological finds have pushed the dates to as early as the Han dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD).Temple, Robert K.G. (2007). The Genius of China: 3,000 Years of Science, Discovery, and Invention (3rd edition). London: Andr√© Deutsch, pp. 103‚Äì6. The late Han years saw the early development of the peculiar art form of hunping, or \\"soul jar\\": a funerary jar whose top was decorated by a sculptural composition. This type of vessel became widespread during the following Jin dynasty (265‚Äì420) and the Six Dynasties. The tomb figures that were to recur in the Tang were popular across society, but with more emphasis than later on model houses and farm animals. Green-glazed pottery, using lead-glazed earthenware in part of the later sancai formula, was used for some of these, though not for wares for use, as the raw lead made the glaze poisonous. Sui and Tang dynasties, 581‚Äì907 AD A sancai glazed offering tray, late 7th or early 8th century, Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) During the Sui and Tang dynasties (581 to 907 AD), a wide range of ceramics, low- fired and high-fired, were produced. These included the last significant fine earthenwares to be produced in China, mostly lead-glazed sancai (three-colour) wares. Many of the well-known lively Tang dynasty tomb figures, which were only made to be placed in elite tombs close to the capital in the north, are in sancai, while others are unpainted or were painted over a slip; the paint has now often fallen off. The sancai vessels too may have been mainly for tombs, which is where they are all found; the glaze was less toxic than in the Han, but perhaps still to be avoided for use at the dining table. In the south, the wares from the Changsha Tongguan Kiln Site in Tongguan are significant for their first regular use of underglaze painting; examples have been found in many places in the Islamic world. However their production tailed off as underglaze painting remained a minor technique for several centuries.Vainker, 82‚Äì84 Yue ware was the leading high-fired, lime-glazed celadon of the period, and was of very sophisticated design, patronized by the court. This was also the case with the northern porcelains of kilns in the provinces of Henan and Hebei, which for the first time met the Western and Eastern definition of porcelain, being both pure white and translucent.Vainker, 64‚Äì72 The white Xing ware and green Yue ware were considered the finest ceramics of north and south China respectively. One of the first mentions of porcelain by a foreigner was in the Chain of Chronicles, written by the Arab traveler and merchant Suleiman in 851 AD during the Tang dynasty who recorded that:Bushell, S. W. (1906). Chinese Art. Victoria and Albert Museum Art Handbook, His Majesty's Stationery Office, London. Liao, Song, Western Xia and Jin dynasties, 907‚Äì1276 Cizhou ware: cloud-shaped pillow with iron-brown tiger design on white slip coating. The pottery of the Song dynasty has retained enormous prestige in Chinese tradition, especially that of what later became known as the \\"Five Great Kilns\\". The artistic emphasis of Song pottery was on subtle glaze effects and graceful shapes; other decoration, where there was any, was mostly in shallow relief. Initially this was carved with a knife, but later moulds were used, with a loss of artistic quality. Painting was mostly used in the popular Cizhou ware. \\"What is clear is that in the Song Dynasty which tended to uphold the esthetics of conventional Confucianism, underglaze blue was not at all popular; Confucian esthetics emphasized simplicity, and the underglaze blue designs were judged to be too ornamental.\\"Zhiyan, Li, et al. (2010) Chinese Ceramics, From the paleolithic period through the Qing dynasty. Yale University Press, New Haven & London; Foreign Language Press, Beijing. . p. 313. Green ware or celadons were popular, both in China and in export markets, which became increasingly important during the period. Yue ware was succeeded by Northern Celadon and then in the south Longquan celadon. White and black wares were also important, especially in Cizhou ware, and there were polychrome types, but the finer types of ceramics, for the court and the literati, remained monochrome, relying on glaze effects and shape. A wide variety of styles evolved in various areas, and those that were successful were imitated in other areas. Important kiln sites and stoneware styles included Ru, Jun, Southern Song Guan or official ware, Jian and Jizhou. Whitish porcelain continued to be improved, and included the continuation of Ding ware and the arrival of the qingbai which would replace it. Ding ware bowl with flower sprays The Liao, Xia and Jin were founded by non-literate, often nomadic people who conquered parts of China. Pottery production continued under their rule, but their own artistic traditions merged to some extent with the Chinese, producing characteristic new styles. The fine pottery of all these regions was mainly high-fired, with some earthenware produced because of its lower cost and more colourful glazes. Some of the clay used was what is called kaolinite in the West. In some cases stoneware was preferred for its darker colour or better working qualities. Potteries used the local clay, and when that was dark or coarse and they wanted a fine white body, they covered the clay with white slip before applying glaze. Yuan dynasty, 1271‚Äì1368 Early blue and white porcelain, c. 1335, the shape from Islamic metalwork The Mongol Yuan dynasty enforced the movement of artists of all sorts around the Mongol Empire, which in ceramics brought a major stylistic and technical influence from the Islamic world in the form of blue and white porcelain, with underglaze painting in cobalt. This has been described as the \\"last great innovation in ceramic technology\\".Medley, 169 Decoration by underglaze painted patterns had long been a feature of Chinese pottery, especially in the popular Cizhou ware (mostly using black over slip), but was perhaps regarded as rather vulgar by the court and the literati class, and the finest ceramics were monochrome, using an understated aesthetic with perfect shapes and subtle glaze effects, often over shallow decoration carved or moulded into the surface.Vainker, 115‚Äì117, 180 This was a great contrast to the bright colours and complicated designs developed under the Yuan, whose organization was mostly based on Islamic art, especially metalwork, although the animal and vegetable motifs remained based on Chinese tradition.Medley, 180‚Äì182 These were initially mainly made for export,Vainker, 139‚Äì140, 180 but became acceptable at court, and to buyers of fine ceramics internally. Export markets readily accepted the style, which has continued to be produced ever since, both in China and around the world. Because of this, improvements in water transportation and the re- unification under Mongol rule, pottery production started to concentrate near deposits of kaolin, such as Jingdezhen, which gradually became the pre-eminent centre for producing porcelain in a variety of styles, a position it has held ever since. The scale of production greatly increased, and the scale and organization of the kilns became industrialized, with ownership by commercial syndicates, much division of labour, and other typical features of mass production.Medley, 171 Some other types of pottery, especially Longquan celadon and Cizhou ware, continued to flourish. Ming dynasty, 1368‚Äì1644 Wucai Goldfish Vase from the Jiajing period (1521‚Äì67) of the Ming dynasty The Ming dynasty saw an extraordinary period of innovation in ceramic manufacture. Kilns investigated new techniques in design and shapes, showing a predilection for colour and painted design, and an openness to foreign forms.Lion- Goldschmidt, 20, 47. The Yongle Emperor (1402‚Äì24) was especially curious about other countries (as evidenced by his support of the eunuch Zheng He's extended exploration of the Indian Ocean), and enjoyed unusual shapes, many inspired by Islamic metalwork.Li He and Michael Knight, Power and Glory: Court Art of China's Ming Dynasty (San Francisco: Asian Art Museum, 2008), p. 130. During the Xuande period (1426‚Äì35), a technical refinement was introduced in the preparation of the cobalt used for underglaze blue decoration. Prior to this the cobalt had been brilliant in colour, but with a tendency to bleed in firing; by adding manganese the colour was duller, but the line crisper. Xuande porcelain is now considered among the finest of all Ming output.Watt, Possessing the Past, pp. 439‚Äì41. Enamelled decoration (such as the one at left) was perfected under the Chenghua Emperor (1464‚Äì87), and greatly prized by later collectors.James C.Y. Watt, \\"Official Art and Commercial Art,\\" in Possessing the Past, p. 441. Indeed, by the late 16th century, Chenghua and Xuande era works ‚Äì especially wine cups ‚Äì had grown so much in popularity, that their prices nearly matched genuine antique wares of the Song dynasty or even older. This esteem for relatively recent ceramics excited much scorn on the part of literati scholars (such as Wen Zhenheng, Tu Long, and Gao Lian, who is cited below); these men fancied themselves arbiters of taste and found the painted aesthetic 'vulgar.'James C.Y. Watt, \\"The Literati Environment,\\" in The Chinese Scholar's Studio, pp. 1‚Äì13.Craig Clunas, Superfluous Things: Material Culture and Social Status in Early Modern China. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1991 and Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2004. In addition to these decorative innovations, the late Ming dynasty underwent a dramatic shift towards a market economy,On the development of a market system and its impact on material culture more generally, see Timothy Brook, The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1998). exporting porcelain around the world on an unprecedented scale. Thus aside from supplying porcelain for domestic use, the kilns at Jingdezhen became the main production centre for large-scale porcelain exports to Europe starting with the reign of the Wanli Emperor (1572‚Äì1620). By this time, kaolin and pottery stone were mixed in about equal proportions. Kaolin produced wares of great strength when added to the paste; it also enhanced the whiteness of the body‚Äîa trait that became a much sought after property, especially when form blue-and-white wares grew in popularity. Pottery stone could be fired at a lower temperature () than paste mixed with kaolin, which required . These sorts of variations were important to keep in mind because the large southern egg-shaped kiln varied greatly in temperature. Near the firebox it was hottest; near the chimney, at the opposite end of the kiln, it was cooler. Qing dynasty, 1644‚Äì1911 Daoguang period, (1821‚Äì50); Shanghai Museum The lengthy civil wars marking the transition from Ming to Qing caused a breakdown in the Imperial kilns system, forcing the managers to find new markets. The Transitional porcelain of about 1620 to the 1680s saw a new style in painting, mostly in blue and white, with new subject-matter of landscapes and figures painted very freely, borrowing from other media. The later part of the period saw Europe joining the existing export markets. The Qing dynasty produced very varied porcelain styles, developing many of the innovations of the Ming. The most notable area of continuing innovation was in the increasing range of colours available, mostly in overglaze enamels. A very significant trade in Chinese export porcelain with the West developed. Court taste was highly eclectic, still favouring monochrome wares, which now used a wide range of bright glaze colours. Special glazing effects were highly regarded; new ones were developed and classic Song wares imitated with great skill. But the court now accepted wares with painted scenes in both blue and white and the new bright polychrome palettes. Technical standards at Jingdezhen were remarkably high, though falling somewhat by the middle of the 19th century. Decoration, and sometimes shapes, became increasingly over-elaborate and fussy, and generally the Ming period is regarded as the greater; indeed in China this was the case at the time. By the 18th century the tradition had ceased to innovate in any radical way, and the vitality of painting declines. Primary source material on Qing dynasty porcelain is available from both foreign residents and domestic authors. Two letters written by P√®re Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles, a Jesuit missionary and industrial spy who lived and worked in Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, described in detail manufacturing of porcelain in the city.see: Two letters written by P√®re Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles at Ceramics Today.com In his first letter dated 1712, d'Entrecolles described the way in which pottery stones were crushed, refined and formed into little white bricks, known in Chinese as petuntse. He then went on to describe the refining of china clay kaolin along with the developmental stages of glazing and firing. He explained his motives: In 1743, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, Tang Ying, the imperial supervisor in the city produced a memoir entitled Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Porcelain. The original illustrations have been lost, but the text is still accessible.  Types of Chinese pottery  Tang dynasty tomb figure of a camel, made with sancai lead- fluxed glazes, here including cobalt blue but no green. Tang burial wares Sancai means \\"three-colours\\": green, yellow and a creamy white, all in lead-based glazes. In fact some other colours could be used, including cobalt blue. In the West, Tang sancai wares were sometimes referred to as egg- and-spinach. Sancai wares were northern wares made using white and buff-firing secondary kaolins and fire clays.Wood, Nigel (1999). Chinese Glazes. A.C. Black, London. At kiln sites located at Tongchuan, Neiqiu County in Hebei and Gongyi in Henan, the clays used for burial wares were similar to those used by Tang potters. The burial wares were fired at a lower temperature than contemporaneous whitewares. Tang dynasty tomb figures, such as the well-known representations of camels and horses, were cast in sections, in moulds with the parts luted together using clay slip. They were either painted in sancai or merely coated in white slip, often with paint added over the glaze, which has now mostly been lost. In some cases, a degree of individuality was imparted to the assembled figurines by hand-carving. Greenwares or celadon wares The major group of celadon wares is named for its glaze, which uses iron oxide to give a broad spectrum of colours centred on a jade or olive green, but covering browns, cream and light blues. This is a similar range to that of jade, always the most prestigious material in Chinese art, and the broad resemblance accounts for much of the attractiveness of celadon to the Chinese. Celadons are plain or decorated in relief, which may be carved, inscribed or moulded. Sometimes taken by the imperial court, celadons had a more regular market with the scholarly and middle classes, and were also exported in enormous quantities. Important types are: Yue ware, Yaozhou ware and the wider Northern Celadons, Ru ware, Guan ware, and finally Longquan celadon.  Jian ware  Jian Zhan blackwares, mainly comprising tea wares, were made at kilns located in Jianyang, Fujian province. They reached the peak of their popularity during the Song dynasty. The wares were made using locally won, iron-rich clays and fired in an oxidising atmosphere at temperatures in the region of . The glaze was made using clay similar to that used for forming the body, except fluxed with wood-ash. At high temperatures the molten glaze separate to produce a pattern called \\"hare's fur\\". When Jian wares were set tilted for firing, drips run down the side, creating evidence of liquid glaze pooling. Jian tea wares of the Song dynasty were also greatly appreciated and copied in Japan, where they were known as tenmoku wares. White Glazed Ding Ware Bowl with Incised Design Northern Song dynasty (11th‚Äì12th Century); Porcelain, Mus√©e Guimet 2418  Jizhou ware  Jizhou ware was stoneware, mostly used for tea drinking. It was famous for glaze effects, including a \\"tortoiseshell\\" glaze, and the use of real leaves as glaze resists; the leaf burnt away during firing, leaving its outlines in the glaze. Ding ware Ding (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Ting) ware was produced in Ding County, Hebei Province. Already in production when the Song emperors came to power in 940, Ding ware was the finest porcelain produced in northern China at the time, and was the first to enter the palace for official imperial use. Its paste is white, generally covered with an almost transparent glaze that dripped and collected in \\"tears\\", (though some Ding ware was glazed a monochrome black or brown, white was the much more common type). Overall, the Ding aesthetic relied more on its elegant shape than ostentatious decoration; designs were understated, either incised or stamped into the clay prior to glazing. Due to the way the dishes were stacked in the kiln, the edged remained unglazed, and had to be rimmed in metal such as gold or silver when used as tableware. Some hundred years later, a Southern Song dynasty writer commented that it was this defect that led to its demise as favoured imperial ware.James C.Y. Watt, \\"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\\" in Possessing the Past, pp. 236‚Äì38. Since the Song government lost access to these northern kilns when they fled south, it has been argued that Qingbai ware (see below) was viewed as a replacement for Ding. Although not as highly ranked as Ru ware, the late Ming dynasty connoisseur Gao Lian awards Ding ware a brief mention in his volume Eight Discourses on the Art of Living. Classified under his sixth discourse, the section on \\"pure enjoyment of cultured idleness\\", Master Gao said: \\"The best sort has marks on it like tear-stains‚Ä¶ Great skill and ingenuity is displayed in selecting the forms of the vessels.\\"Gao Lian, \\"The Tsun Sheng Pa Chien, AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\\" tr. Arthur Waley, Yearbook of Oriental Art and Culture, 1, (1924‚Äì25), p. 86. See also Clunas, Superfluous Things, pp. 13‚Äì20. Ru Ware Bowl Stand, Chinese, Early 12th Century; Buff stoneware, with crackled light bluish green glaze, and a copper edge; London, Victoria and Albert Museum, FE.1‚Äì1970 Ru ware Like Ding ware, Ru ware (Wade‚ÄìGiles: ju) was produced in North China for imperial use. The Ru kilns were near the Northern Song capital at Kaifeng. In similar fashion to Longquan celadons, Ru pieces have small amounts of iron oxide in their glaze that oxidize and turn greenish when fired in a reducing atmosphere. Ru wares range in colour‚Äîfrom nearly white to a deep robin's egg‚Äîand often are covered with reddish-brown crackles. The crackles, or \\"crazing\\", are caused when the glaze cools and contracts faster than the body, thus having to stretch and ultimately to split, (as seen in the detail at right; see also ). The art historian James Watt comments that the Song dynasty was the first period that viewed crazing as a merit rather than a defect. Moreover, as time went on, the bodies got thinner and thinner, while glazes got thicker, until by the end of the Southern Song the 'green- glaze' was thicker than the body, making it extremely 'fleshy' rather than 'bony,' to use the traditional analogy (see section on Guan ware, below). Too, the glaze tends to drip and pool slightly, leaving it thinner at the top, where the clay peeps through. Ru Ware Bowl Stand, detail of crazing; V&A; FE.1‚Äì1970 As with Ding ware, the Song imperial court lost access to the Ru kilns after it fled Kaifeng when the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty conquered northern China, and settled at Lin'an (present-day Hangzhou) in the south. There, the Emperor Gaozong founded the Guan yao ('official kilns') right outside the new capital in order to produce imitations of Ru ware.James C.Y. Watt, \\"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\\" in Possessing the Past, pp. 238‚Äì42. However, posterity has remembered Ru ware as something unmatched by later attempts; Master Gao says, \\"Compared with Guan yao, the above were of finer substance and more brilliant luster.\\"Gao Lian, \\"The Tsun Sheng Pa Chien, AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\\" p. 82. Asian Art Museum, San Francisco, B60P93 Jun ware Jun (Wade‚ÄìGiles: ch√ºn) ware was a third style of porcelain used at the Northern Song court. Characterized by a thicker body than Ding or Ru ware, Jun is covered with a turquoise and purple glaze, so thick and viscous looking that appears to melting off the golden-brown body. Not only are Jun vessels more thickly potted, their shape is much more robust than the fine Jun pieces, yet both types were appreciated at the court of Emperor Huizong. Jun production was centred at Jun-tai in Yuzhou, Henan Province. Guan ware Guan (Wade‚ÄìGiles: kuan) ware, literally means \\"official\\" ware; so certain Ru, Jun, and even Ding are Guan in the broad sense of being produced for the court. Usually the term in English only applies to that produced by an official, imperially run kiln, which did not start until the Southern Song dynasty fled from the advancing Jin dynasty and settled at Lin'an. During this period walls become very thin, with glaze thicker than the wall. The clay in the foothills around Lin'an was a brownish colour, and the glaze very viscous.‚ÄòSheng Pa Chien, AD 1591, by Kao Lien, pp. 82‚Äì4.  Ge ware  Ge- type vase, with \\"gold thread and iron wire\\" double crackle Ge (Wade‚ÄìGiles: ko), literally \\"big-brother\\" ware, due to a legend of two brothers working in Longquan, one made the typical celadon style ceramics, the elder made ge ware, produced in his private kiln. Ming dynasty commentator Gao Lian writes that the ge kiln took its clay from the same site as Guan ware, accounting for the difficulty in distinguishing one from the other (though Gao thinks \\"Ge is distinctly inferior\\" to Guan).Gao Lian, \\"The Tsun Sheng Pa Chien, AD 1591, by Kao Lien,\\" p. 84‚Äì5. Overall, Ge remains somewhat elusive, but basically comprises two types‚Äîone with a 'warm rice-yellow glaze and two sets of crackles, a more prominent set of darker colour interspersed with a finer set of reddish lines' (called chin-ssu t'ieh-hsien or 'golden floss and iron threads', which can just faintly be detected on this bowl). The other Ge ware is much like Guan ware, with grayish glaze and one set of crackles. Once thought to have only been manufactured alongside Longquan celadon, per its legendary founding, Ge is now believed to have also been produced at Jingdezhen.James C.Y. Watt, \\"Antiquarianism and Naturalism,\\" in Possessing the Past, pp. 245‚Äì38. While similar to Guan ware, Ge typically has a grayish-blue glaze that is fully opaque with an almost matte finish. Its crackle pattern is exaggerated, often standing out in bold black. Though still shrouded in mystery, many specialists believe that Ge ware did not develop until the very late Southern Song dynasty or even the Yuan dynasty. In any case, enthusiasm for it persisted throughout the Ming dynasty; Wen Zhenheng preferred it to all other types of porcelain, in particular for brush washers and water droppers (although he preferred jade brush washers to porcelain, Guan and Ge were the best ceramic ones, especially if they have scalloped rims). Differences between later Ming imitations of Song/Yuan Ge include: Ming versions substitute a white porcelain body; they tend to be produced in a range of new shapes, for example those for the scholar's studio; glazes tend to be thinner and more lustrous; and slip is applied to the rim and base to simulate the \\"brown mouth and iron foot\\" of Guan ware.Robert Mowry The Chinese scholar's studio, p. 164  Qingbai wares  Lidded plum vase (meiping) with lotus sprays, Qingbai ware, Southern Song. The glaze has collected in the carved indentations, where the colour is stronger. Qingbai wares (also called 'yingqing')Wood, Nigel, Chinese Glazes were made at Jingdezhen and at many other southern kilns from the time of the Northern Song dynasty until they were eclipsed in the 14th century by underglaze-decorated blue and white wares. Qingbai in Chinese literally means \\"clear blue-white\\". The qingbai glaze is a porcelain glaze, so-called because it was made using pottery stone. The qingbai glaze is clear, but contains iron in small amounts. When applied over a white porcelain body the glaze produces a greenish-blue colour that gives the glaze its name. Some have incised or moulded decorations. The Song dynasty qingbai bowl illustrated was likely made at the Jingdezhen village of Hutian, which was also the site of the imperial kilns established in 1004. The bowl has incised decoration, possibly representing clouds or the reflection of clouds in the water. The body is white, translucent and has the texture of very-fine sugar, indicating that it was made using crushed and refined pottery stone instead of pottery stone and kaolin. The glaze and the body of the bowl would have been fired together, in a saggar in a large wood-burning dragon kiln, typical of southern kilns in the period. Though many Song and Yuan dynasty qingbai bowls were fired upside down in special segmented saggars, a technique first developed at the Ding kilns in Hebei province. The rims of such wares were left unglazed but were often bound with bands of silver, copper or lead. One remarkable example of qingbai porcelain is the so-called Fonthill Vase, described in a guide for Fonthill Abbey published in 1823 as \\"an oriental china bottle, superbly mounted, said to be the earliest known specimen of porcelain introduced into Europe\\". The vase was made at Jingdezhen, probably around 1300 and was probably sent as a present to Pope Benedict XII by one of the last Yuan emperors of China, in 1338. The mounts referred to in the 1823 description were of enamelled silver-gilt and were added to the vase in Europe in 1381. An 18th-century water colour of the vase complete with its mounts exists, but the mounts themselves were removed and lost in the 19th century. The vase is now in the National Museum of Ireland. It is often held that qingbai wares were not subject to the higher standards and regulations of the other porcelain wares, since they were made for everyday use. They were mass-produced, and received little attention from scholars and antiquarians. The Fonthill Vase, given by a Chinese emperor to a pope, might appear to cast at least some doubt on this view.  Blue and white wares  Kangxi period (1661 to 1722) blue and white porcelain tea caddy Following in the tradition of earlier qingbai porcelains, blue and white wares are glazed using a transparent porcelain glaze. The blue decoration is painted onto the body of the porcelain before glazing, using very finely ground cobalt oxide mixed with water. After the decoration has been applied the pieces are glazed and fired. It is believed that underglaze blue and white porcelain was first made in the Tang dynasty. Only three complete pieces of Tang blue and white porcelain are known to exist (in Singapore from the Indonesian Belitung shipwreck), but shards dating to the 8th or 9th century have been unearthed at Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province. It has been suggested that the shards originated from a kiln in the province of Henan. In 1957, excavations at the site of a pagoda in Zhejiang province uncovered a Northern Song bowl decorated with underglaze blue and further fragments have since been discovered at the same site. In 1970 a small fragment of a blue and white bowl, again dated to the 11th century, was also excavated in the province of Zhejiang. In 1975, shards decorated with underglaze blue were excavated at a kiln site in Jiangxi and, in the same year, an underglaze blue and white urn was excavated from a tomb dated to 1319, in the province of Jiangsu. It is of interest to note that a Yuan funerary urn decorated with underglaze blue and underglaze red and dated 1338 is still in the Chinese taste, even though by this time the large-scale production of blue and white porcelain in the Yuan dynasty, Mongol taste had started its influence at Jingdezhen. Starting early in the 14th century, blue and white porcelain rapidly became the main product of Jingdezhen, reaching the height of its technical excellence during the later years of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1661-1722)de Boulay, Anthony (1973). Chinese Porcelain. Octopus Books, London. and continuing in present times to be an important product of the city. The tea caddy illustrated shows many of the characteristics of blue and white porcelain produced during the Kangxi period. The translucent body showing through the clear glaze is of great whiteness and the cobalt decoration, applied in many layers, has a fine blue hue. The decoration, a sage in a landscape of lakes and mountains with blazed rocks is typical of the period. The piece would have been fired in a saggar (a lidded ceramic box intended to protect the piece from kiln debris, smoke and cinders during firing) in a reducing atmosphere in a wood-burning egg-shaped kiln, at a temperature approaching . Distinctive blue-and-white porcelain was exported to Japan, where it is known as Tenkei blue-and-white ware or ko sometsukei. This ware is thought to have been especially ordered by tea masters for Japanese ceremony. Statue of Guanyin, Ming dynasty (Shanghai Museum)  Blanc de Chine  Blanc de Chine is a type of white porcelain made at Dehua in Fujian province. It has been produced from the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) to the present day. Large quantities arrived in Europe as Chinese Export Porcelain in the early 18th century and it was copied at Meissen and elsewhere. The area along the Fujian coast was traditionally one of the main ceramic exporting centres. Over 180 kiln sites have been identified extending in historical range from the Song dynasty to the present. From the Ming dynasty, porcelain objects were manufactured that achieved a fusion of glaze and body traditionally referred to as \\"ivory white\\" and \\"milk white\\". The special characteristic of Dehua porcelain is the very small amount of iron oxide in it, allowing it to be fired in an oxidising atmosphere to a warm white or pale ivory colour. (Wood, 2007) The porcelain body is not very plastic but vessel forms have been made from it. Donnelly, (1969, pp.xi-xii) lists the following types of product: figures, boxes, vases and jars, cups and bowls, fishes, lamps, cup-stands, censers and flowerpots, animals, brush holders, wine and teapots, Buddhist and Taoist figures, secular figures and puppets. There was a large output of figures, especially religious figures, e.g. Guanyin, Maitreya, Lohan and Ta-mo figures. Dehua cup, with dragon The numerous Dehua porcelain factories today make figures and tableware in modern styles. During the Cultural Revolution \\"Dehua artisans applied their very best skills to produce immaculate statuettes of Mao Zedong and the Communist leaders. Portraits of the stars of the new proletarian opera in their most famous roles were produced on a truly massive scale.\\"(Ayers and Bingling, 2002) Mao Zedong figures later fell out of favour but have been revived for foreign collectors. Notable artists in blanc de Chine, such as the late Ming period He Chaozong, signed their creations with their seals. Wares include crisply modeled figures, cups, bowls and joss stick-holders. Many of the best examples of blanc de Chine are found in Japan where the white variety was termed hakugorai or \\"Korean white\\", a term often found in tea ceremony circles. The British Museum in London has a large number of blanc de Chine pieces, having received as a gift in 1980 the entire collection of P.J. Donnelly.(Harrison-Hall, 2001) Painted colours Wucai jar with the Eight Immortals, Ming, Wanli reign, 1573‚Äì1620 Chinese court taste long favoured monochrome wares, and although the Yuan dynasty saw blue and white porcelain accepted by the court, more fully polychrome styles took much longer to be accepted. Initially blue from cobalt was almost the only pigment that could withstand the high temperature of a porcelain firing without discolouring, but gradually (mostly during the Ming period) others were found, or the extra cost of a second firing at a lower temperature to fix overglaze enamels was accepted. Copper-reds could produce highly effective results underglaze, but at the cost of an extremely high proportion of greyish rejects, some of which remain in circulation, and thousands more of which have been found when kiln waste-heaps have been excavated. Eventually underglaze blue and overglaze red became the usual way of achieving the same result. Overglaze painting, usually called \\"enamels\\", was widely used in the popular Cizhou ware stonewares, and was sometimes experimented with by kilns producing for the court, but not until the 15th century, under the Ming, was the doucai technique used for imperial wares. This combined underglaze blue outlines with overglaze enamels in further colours.Valenstein, 153-157 The wucai technique was a similar combination, with underglaze blue used more widely for highlights.Pierson, Stacey, From Object to Concept: Global Consumption and the Transformation of Ming Porcelain, 2013, Hong Kong University Press, , 9789888139835, google books Two-colour wares, using underglaze blue and an overglaze colour, usually red, also produced very fine results. A number of different other methods using coloured glazes were tried, often with images lightly incised into the body. The fahua technique outlined areas of coloured decoration with raised trails of slip, and the subtle \\"secret\\" (an hua) technique decorated using very light incisions that could hardly be seen. As the range of glaze colours expanded, the taste for monochrome wares, now in the new strong colours, returned, and with it a number of special glazing effects were developed, including the return of crackle and spotty effects made by blowing powdered pigment onto the piece.Valenstein, 167, 172-178 =Classification by colour, the groups= The next development saw a group of 'families', or palettes of enamel colours used on Chinese porcelain. These are commonly known by their French names of , based on the dominant element in each colour palette are terms used to classify. A large proportion of these were export wares but some were made for the Imperial court. * Famille verte (, Kangxi wucai, also , susancai, ‚Äòthree colours on a plain [unglazed or thinly glazed] body‚Äô), adopted in the Kangxi period (1661‚Äì1722), uses green and iron red with other overglaze colours. It developed from the wucai (, \\"five colours\\") style. ** 'Famille jaune is a variation using enamels on a yellow ground (), often painted on the biscuit. ** Famille noire (, modi susancai) is another subtype of , but it uses a black ground. Many and pieces were \\"clobbered\\" with the yellow or black added in the 19th century. * Famille rose (known in Chinese as fencai ( or ruancai ( / ), 'soft colours' or 'pale colours'), Yangcai (), lit. 'foreign colours'), and falangcai (, lit. 'enamel colours'), was introduced late in the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (1661‚Äì1722), possibly around 1720. It used mainly pink or purple and remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries, also being widely adopted by European factories. enamel ware allows a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images. Stoneware Yixing teapot, Qing dynasty, c. 1800‚Äì1835, stoneware Pottery classified as stoneware in the West is usually regarded as porcelain in Chinese terms, where a stoneware group is not recognised, and so the definition of porcelain is rather different, covering all vitrified high- fired wares. Terms such as \\"\\" and \\"near-porcelain\\" are often used to reflect this, and cover wares that in Western terms lie on the border of stoneware and porcelain. High-fired stonewares were numerous from very early on, and included many high-prestige wares, including those for imperial use, as well as great quantities of everyday utilitarian pots. Usually they achieved their reputation by their glazes. Most of the celadon group, including Longquan celadons, especially earlier ones, can be classified as stoneware, and all classic Jian wares and Jizhou wares. By contrast, the Yixing clay teapots and cups made from Yixing clay from Jiangsu province are usually left unglazed, and not washed after use, as the clay is believed to improve the taste of the tea, especially after it acquires a patina from long use. There are in fact a number of different clays, giving a range of colours. The pots are unusual in that they are often signed by their potters, which is very rare in China, perhaps because they were associated with the literati culture, of which Jiangsu was a stronghold. The earliest datable example is from a burial of 1533 in Nanjing. Elaborately decorated examples, often with a rectangular body, were exported to Europe from the 18th century, and these and pots for local use often had poems inscribed on them. As well as teaware and desk objects such as brush-rests, fruit and other natural shapes were modelled as ornaments. Production continues today, generally using simpler shapes.Vainker, 173‚Äì175 The ceramics industry under the Ming Xuande mark and period (1426‚Äì35) imperial blue and white vase.  Imperial and private kilns  The very first imperial kiln was established in the thirty-fifth year of Hongwu.Ding, Pengbo, ‰∏ÅÈπèÂãÉ. ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£Âæ°Âô®ÂéÇËÆæÁ´ãÊó∂Èó¥ÁöÑËÆ®ËÆ∫‚Äù (Discussing the Establishing Time in the Imperial Kilns in Ming Period), ÂçóÊñπÊñáÁâ© (Cultural Relics in the Southern China)13.3 (March 2013): 66-69. P. 69. Before that, there were no systematic regulations on the state-demanded porcelain production. The law stated that, if the quantity of ceramics demanded was big, potters would be conscripted and worked in the imperial kilns in Nanjing; if the quantity was small, the ceramics could be produced in private kilns in Raozhou.Yoshiaki Ten≈ç, Â§©ÈÉ®ËâØÊòé, Kong Liuqing, Â≠îÂÖ≠Â∫Ü translator. ‚ÄúÊôØÂæ∑ÈïáÊ∞ëÁ™ëÁöÑÂ±ïÂºÄ(‰∏ä)‚Äù (The establishment of the Private Kilns in Jingdezhen, Volume One), ÊôØÂæ∑ÈïáÈô∂Áì∑ (Jingdezhen Ceramics) 89.1 (January 1989): 52-64. P. 53. In either case, officials from the imperial centre were sent to supervise the production. The officials were responsible for making budgets, ensuring quality, and sending products back to the imperial court. Different rules on styles and sizes of the ceramics were put forward by the imperial court and must be strictly followed in the kilns. After 1403, imperial kilns were built, and carried out the imperial porcelain production on a large scale. During the mid-Ming period, the demand for porcelain increased, the temporarily assigned officials were not able to handle the project. In the Xuande Period, the imperial factory in Jingdezhen was established.Yoshiaki Ten≈ç, Â§©ÈÉ®ËâØÊòé, Kong Liuqing, Â≠îÂÖ≠Â∫Ü translator. ‚ÄúÊôØÂæ∑ÈïáÊ∞ëÁ™ëÁöÑÂ±ïÂºÄ(‰∏ä)‚Äù (The establishment of the Private Kilns in Jingdezhen, Volume One), ÊôØÂæ∑ÈïáÈô∂Áì∑ (Jingdezhen Ceramics) 89.1 (January 1989): 52-64. P. 54. The factory was divided into dormitories and pavilions on the north, official offices, and prisons on the east and workshops on the west. There were wells, wood sheds, temples and lounges for potters. The imperial factory in Jingdezhen was not a mere production site but also included government administrative offices.Jenyns, 14 The imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each taking charge of different aspects of ceramics production.Lan Pu, ËìùÊµ¶, ‚ÄúÊôØÂæ∑ÈïáÈô∂ÂΩï,‚Äù (Pottery in Jingdezhen) in Áª≠‰øÆÂõõÂ∫ìÂÖ®‰π¶ (The Imperial Collection of Four), edited by Zheng Tingui, ÈÉëÂª∑Ê°Ç, (Shanghai: Shanghai gu ji chu ban she, 2002): 343-427, pp.344-345. The work was subdivided by type and assigned to different departments like department of large vessels, small vessels, painting, carving, calligraphy, rope making and general carpentry. This subdividing of the work so that a single piece of a vessel could pass through several hands led to potters not signing pieces as they did in the private kilns. The division of labour also ensured a uniform style and size in the ceramics. The number of imperial kilns varies during the Ming period. There were fewer than ten imperial factories in the fifteenth century, then the number increased to 58, later again to 62 and then decreased to 18. Yongzheng reign (1722‚Äì1735) Imperial orders demanded both individuality in the design of porcelain while also demanding large quantities of it. Understandably, these demands came from different sectors of the court that expected particular designs. For example, yellow and green products decorated with mythical flying creatures were specifically requested by the Directorate for Palace Delicacies.Pierson, Stacey. ‚ÄúProduction, Distribution, and Aesthetics: Abundance and Chinese Porcelain from Jingdezhen, AD 1350‚Äì1800.‚Äù Abundance: The Archaeology of Plenitude, University Press of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 2017, pp. 229‚Äì250, p.236 The need for both individual design and mass production was a recipe for exhausting demands on porcelain kilns. Many were forced to outsource their production to private kilns in order to meet court quotas. Those who managed the production at imperial factories understood the need for outsourcing as an answer to scalability.Pierson, Stacey. ‚ÄúProduction, Distribution, and Aesthetics: Abundance and Chinese Porcelain from Jingdezhen, AD 1350‚Äì1800.‚Äù Abundance: The Archaeology of Plenitude, University Press of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, 2017, pp. 229‚Äì250, p.238 Outsourcing must have required a keen sense in picking private kilns that would deliver quality and quantity. Without cooperation and transparency between colleagues of different kilns, the satisfaction of the imperial court was in jeopardy. In the late Ming period, the corv√©e system in ceramics reformed with the strong influence of commercialization. Under the new system, a person would not be conscripted to work if he paid a certain amount of money.Liu Mingshan, ÂàòÊòéÊùâ, ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£ÂÆòÁ™ëÂà∂Â∫¶‰∏éÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®,‚Äù (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), ÊòéÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. p.223. Many good potterslike Wu Wei () and Zhou Danquan () thus left the imperial kilns and worked in the private ones where the pay was better. The late Ming period witnessed a drastic decline in the quality of pieces from the imperial kilns and a rise of private kilns.Liu Mingshan, ÂàòÊòéÊùâ, ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£ÂÆòÁ™ëÂà∂Â∫¶‰∏éÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®,‚Äù (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), ÊòéÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. p.242 The private kilns existed in the early Ming dynasty and their production constituted a part of the tax income of the government. Apart from making ceramics for people's everyday life, private kilns also accepted orders from the imperial court. However, making and selling imperial style ceramics in private kilns was strictly forbidden. During the late Ming period, private kilns rose as imperial kilns declined. Many famous workers escaped from the overworked and underpaid environment in the imperial kilns to private ones. Private kilns were more involved in commercials than the imperial kilns did. In the late Ming period, several private kilns won great popularity among the literati, who were enthusiastic about the antique style porcelain. Examples were the Cui kiln (), Zhou kiln (), and Hu kiln (). Ceramics in the late Ming dynasty was produced in high quality and quantity, making Jingdezhen one of the earliest commercial centres in the world. Competition in the porcelain industry erupted following the failure of the corv√©e system.Wen-Chin, Hsu. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.‚Äù Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 1, 1988, pp. 135‚Äì159. p.140 With government control at a low, investors could invest in many means of production, especially in handicraft industries. In Jingdezhen, over 70 percent of the 100,000 families occupying the 6.5 square kilometre town were involved in the porcelain industry. The economic resurgence brought on by the porcelain industry carried along its own ramifications. There existed two sides of the porcelain industry which are described as jiating shougongye (, \\"family-run industry\\") and zuofang shougongye (, \\"entrepreneurial industry\\").Wen-Chin, Hsu. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.‚Äù Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 1, 1988, pp. 135‚Äì159. p.142 Family-run industries reveal the ruthless and inhumane side of the porcelain industry as seen in the story of Yang Shi in ‚ÄúAn Injustice Caused by a Slight Dispute Over One Penny‚Äù. The story vividly describes a scene of domestic violence as a result of the wife, Yang Shi, purchasing a drink worth a penny to soothe her aching stomach.Wen- Chin, Hsu. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.‚Äù Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 1, 1988, pp. 135‚Äì159. p.143 This story sums up the drama within family-run industries as a result of the cut-throat approach to profits. Especially within work involving relatives or immediate family, one's own self worth and concept will be diminished in the face of success for the business. The cut-throat mentality served to blur the family hierarchy within family-run industries to some degree. Porcelain production required both the construction of pots as well as the decorations done after. Within a family-run pottery industry, the women took on this decorating role which helped to increase their value to the family. Men and women had to work harmoniously to produce good quality work and ultimately this spread throughout the porcelain industry.  Life as a potter  In the early Ming dynasty, the population could be divided into three categories: military, craftsmen, and peasants. Within the craftsmen system, most of the craftsmen were from the previous dynasty, the Yuan dynasty; others were prisoners or unemployed people. Craftsmen households members had to work throughout their lifetime, and their status was hereditary. There were two subcategories within the craftsmen system: military craftsmen, who were specialized in producing weapon; the ordinary craftsmen, who worked in various other industries. Potters belonged to the latter subcategory.Li Chuanwen, Êùé‰º†Êñá, Êòé‰ª£Âå†‰ΩúÂà∂Â∫¶Á†îÁ©∂(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty). Master‚Äôs Thesis, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁæéÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢(Chinese Academy of Art), 2012. p. 12. In the early Ming period, whenever the court demanded ceramics, labor would be conscripted by the court in different ways. Usually, there were different types of workers in the imperial kilns. Most of the potters were selected from the craftsman households by the local government and served in the imperial kilns for three months in every four years for free; in other cases, workers were recruited from counties near the imperial kilns and paid regularly. Usually the recruited workers were assigned to different departments.Liu Mingshan, ÂàòÊòéÊùâ, ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£ÂÆòÁ™ëÂà∂Â∫¶‰∏éÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®,‚Äù (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), ÊòéÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.221-222. The imperial factory was divided into twenty-three departments, with each department having managers and workers. The number of managers was usually less than five, and the number of workers was usually about ten to twenty.Li Chuanwen, Êùé‰º†Êñá, Êòé‰ª£Âå†‰ΩúÂà∂Â∫¶Á†îÁ©∂(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty). Master‚Äôs Thesis, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁæéÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢(Chinese Academy of Art), 2012. p. 38-39 Decorating porcelain in Jingdezhen today Making porcelain was not easy. More than half the firings of every kiln resulted in spoilt pieces and were thrown away in the neighborhood of Jingdezhen, resulting in a huge dump of porcelain fragments that still exist today. When the kiln was in action, it was important to control the fire, which ideally should produce a constant temperature. The proper choice, preparation, colouring, firing, and the slip should be made on every stage of the production.Jenyns, 16 The regulations on the potters working in the imperial kiln were severe. Potters were punished for delaying, smuggling, producing inferior goods, and other misconducts.Li Chuanwen, Êùé‰º†Êñá, Êòé‰ª£Âå†‰ΩúÂà∂Â∫¶Á†îÁ©∂(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty). Master‚Äôs Thesis, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁæéÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢(Chinese Academy of Art), 2012. p. 12-13 Overworked and underpaid, many potters refused or fled from being conscripted into the imperial kilns. By the time of Xuande period, the number of potters escaping from the corvee was about five thousand; in the first year of Jingtai, the number reached about thirty thousand. There was also a great discrepancy in the number of workers in different departments. Sometimes private kiln workers from the corresponding departments would serve as temporary workers in the imperial kilns. To regulate the potters, the government reformed the policy so that the potters would not have to work in the imperial kilns if they pay certain amount of money per month.Li Chuanwen, Êùé‰º†Êñá, Êòé‰ª£Âå†‰ΩúÂà∂Â∫¶Á†îÁ©∂(Study on the Craftsmen-working System of Ming Dynasty). Master‚Äôs Thesis, ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁæéÊúØÂ≠¶Èô¢(Chinese Academy of Art), 2012. p. 48 The new law implied that the potters were no longer tied to the state government. Unable to stand the hard law and the heavy work, many talented workers found their new positions in the private kilns. The imperial kilns suffered from the lost in talented potters and labors, and the quality of the porcelain declined dramatically.Liu Mingshan, ÂàòÊòéÊùâ, ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£ÂÆòÁ™ëÂà∂Â∫¶‰∏éÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®,‚Äù (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), ÊòéÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.224. Starting from the ninth year of Jiajing, a new policy was carried out. The government prepared their own materials, utilized the private kilns to make porcelain, and paid the private kilns based on the number of porcelain produced. However, the state was usually not able to pay the amount required.Liu Mingshan, ÂàòÊòéÊùâ, ‚ÄúÊòé‰ª£ÂÆòÁ™ëÂà∂Â∫¶‰∏éÂÆûÈôÖÂ∫îÁî®,‚Äù (The Imperial Kilns Institution and Its Application in Ming), ÊòéÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂(Ming Studies Journal) 2013: 221-243. pp.223.  Post-production  Porcelain Jar with cobalt blue under a transparent glaze, Jingdezhen porcelain, mid-15th century. The industrialization of Chinese porcelain during the Ming dynasty was not possible without a post- production system that honored scalability as well as scarcity. Individual retail sales were important to kilns but wholesale orders were of even higher importance.Michael Dillon, ‚ÄúTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.‚Äù Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278‚Äì290. p.286 In reality, wholesale orders were the backbone of porcelain economics. Without these orders that required months to a year of work to complete, demand would have definitely been lacking. Merchants entered provinces with little knowledge of how porcelain trade was conducted. They relied on brokers to introduce them to reliable kilns and ultimately negotiate prices. Once established, merchants took on negotiating matters. In particular, brokers helped alleviate risk for many kilns by analyzing the integrity of buyers. Due to the guild-esque nature between brokers and kiln owners, guilty knowledge of the buyer's secrets was common talk.Michael Dillon, Dillon, Michael. ‚ÄúTransport and Marketing in the Development of the Jingdezhen Porcelain Industry during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.‚Äù Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, vol. 35, no. 3, 1992, pp. 278‚Äì290. p.287 If a buyer was deemed as unreliable, word spread throughout the province of such news. Potters claimed the license to know who the bad buyers were. This dangerous knowledge had the ability to ruin a buyer's reputation but on the contrary contributed to the success of kilns. In observing court orders, porcelain was required for culinary, religious, and display purposes. Since porcelain was often used once and thrown away by the court, imperial orders were at a continuous flow in porcelain factories. Demand was often too high for kilns to meet which hints at the necessity for scalability. From their respective kilns, fine porcelain was distributed over sea and land to Southeast Asia, Japan and the Middle East. The magnitude of foreign trade can be understood in a record showing over sixteen million pieces circulating through a Dutch East India Company.Wen-Chin, Hsu. ‚ÄúSocial and Economic Factors in the Chinese Porcelain Industry in Jingdezhen during the Late Ming and Early Qing Period, Ca. 1620-1683.‚Äù Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, no. 1, 1988, pp. 135‚Äì159. p.151 The land transportation showed the intensity of labor in the porcelain industry. Dozens of carts sent from Mongolia, Manchuria, Persia and Arabic countries were loaded in the Ming capital full of porcelain and other Chinese goods. Some carts reached thirty feet in height which must have required extreme attention to avoid broken porcelain. Due to the hollowness of porcelain vases, they were filled with soil and beans.Wen-Chin, Hsu p. 151 The growth of the bean roots helped porcelain withstand further pressure during transportation. In order to effectively transport large amounts of porcelain, as much space in carts must have been used indicated by the thirty foot high carts. Knowing the risk that came with placing fragile porcelain next to and on top of one another, handlers of the porcelain mitigated that risk through the soil and bean method. probably for export to the Islamic world. Like the silk industry, the porcelain industry claimed merit for its mass-producing capabilities. Potters from lower economic backgrounds stuck true to their repetitive methods mostly due to the high risk in attempting new and not tested methods. Trying new techniques could result in the loss of an entire month's worth of work so for these potters, changing their method was not a luxury they could afford.Finley, Robert ‚ÄúThe Porcelain City: Jingdezhen in the Eighteenth Century.‚Äù The Pilgrim Art: Cultures of Porcelain in World History, 1st ed., University of California Press, 2010, pp. 17‚Äì46. p.24 These potters were found in peasant societies outside of Jingdezhen and highlight the particular code that limited their imaginative potential. For potters within Jingdezhen, the code that governed the way their products were created was greatly influenced by international markets. These markets inspired creativity and innovation as seen in how ‚ÄúJingdezhen and other pottery centres produced ceramic versions of reliquaries, alms bowls, oil lamps, and stem-cups‚Äù The difference in code did not necessarily contribute to a hierarchical division but rather a diversification in the personality behind Chinese porcelain. Foreign trade was not always beneficial for potters because the further away that products had to go from the source (Ex: Jingdezhen) the more vulnerable cargo became. In examining a report of a Spanish voyage, about a fifth of a Chinese ship crew were killed when met by a Spanish voyager of the name Juan de Salcedo.Laura Lee Junker, ‚ÄúThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.‚Äù Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms, University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183‚Äì220. p.196 The two ships that were raided held many Chinese valuables including porcelain and most likely were used to trade off the coast of Midoro. Overall, international markets offered great potential for potters seeking greater wealth but unfortunately came with a vulnerability to crime. Trade on an international scale required organization between chiefs and potters. Throughout the Southeast Asian trading ports, chiefs had the power to set port fees as well as control interactions between elite merchants and foreign traders.Laura Lee Junker, ‚ÄúThe Long-Distance Porcelain Trade.‚Äù Raiding, Trading. and Feasting: The Political Economy of Philippine Chiefdoms, University of Hawai'i Press, 1999, pp. 183‚Äì220. p.206 By possessing the license to impose fees, chiefs were able to profit on almost every transaction within their respective markets and it serves to boost their brilliance in constructing such a diverse market. Potters of luxury porcelain would have to work under the rules set by the chiefs and thus their relationship constructed a hierarchy.  Fakes and reproductions  Kangxi period mark on a piece of late nineteenth century blue and white porcelain. Chinese potters have a long tradition of borrowing design and decorative features from earlier wares. Whilst ceramics with features thus borrowed might sometimes pose problems of provenance, they would not generally be regarded as either reproductions or fakes. However, fakes and reproductions have also been made at many times during the long history of Chinese ceramics and continue to be made today in ever-increasing numbers. In addition, the reign marks of earlier emperors (typically from the Ming) were often put on Qing wares, which scholars are often inclined to treat as a mark of respect or aspiration rather than an attempt to deceive, although they clearly did often mislead centemporaries, and confuse understanding. * Imitations and reproductions of Song dynasty Longquan celadon wares were made at Jingdezhen in the early 18th century, but outright fakes were also made using special clay that were artificially aged by boiling in meat broth, refiring and storage in sewers. P√®re d'Entrecolles records that by this means the wares could be passed off as being hundreds of years old. * In the late 19th century, fakes of Kangxi-period famille noire wares were made that were convincing enough to deceive the experts of the day. Many such pieces may still be seen in museums today, as may pieces of genuine Kangxi porcelain were given additional overglaze decoration in the late nineteenth century with famille noire enamels (a process known as \\"clobbering\\"). A body of modern expert opinion holds that porcelain decorated with famille noire enamels was not made at all during the Kangxi period, though this view is disputed. * A fashion for Kangxi period (1661 to 1722) blue and white wares grew to large proportions in Europe during the later years of the 19th century and triggered the production at Jingdezhen of large quantities of porcelain wares that strike a resemblance to ceramics of earlier periods. Such blue and white wares were not fakes or even convincing reproductions, even though some pieces carried four-character Kangxi reign- marks that continue to cause confusion to this day. Kangxi reign-marks in the form shown in the illustration occur only on wares made towards the end of the 19th century or later, without exception. Authentication The most widely known test is the thermoluminescence test, or TL test, which is used on some types of ceramic to estimate, roughly, the date of last firing. Thermoluminescence dating is carried out on small samples of pottery drilled or cut from the body of a piece, which can be risky and disfiguring. For this reason, the test is rarely used for dating finely potted, high-fired ceramics. TL testing cannot be used at all on some types of ceramics, particularly high- fired porcelain.

Certain foods have become iconic to the city. Invented in Philadelphia in the 1930s, the cheesesteak is the most well known icon of the city, and soft pretzels have become a part of Philadelphia culture. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the creation of two Philadelphia landmarks, the Reading Terminal Market and Italian Market. After a dismal restaurant scene during the post-war era of the 20th century, the 1970s brought a restaurant renaissance that has continued into the 21st century. Many foods and drinks associated with Philadelphia can also commonly be linked with the Pennsylvania Dutch cuisine and Italian-American cuisine. Innovations and icons Philadelphia's large immigrant population has contributed to a large mixture of tastes to mingle and develop. Many types of foods have been created in or near Philadelphia or have strong associations with the city. In the 20th century, Philadelphia's most iconic foods were established as the cheesesteak, stromboli, hoagie, soft pretzel, water ice and soda. The cheesesteak is a sandwich traditionally made with sliced beef and melted cheese on an Italian roll. In the 1930s, the phenomenon as a steak sandwich began when hot dog vendor brothers Pat Olivieri and Harry Olivieri put grilled beef on a hot dog bun and gave it to a taxi driver. Later, after Pat and Harry had started selling the sandwich on Italian rolls, the cheesesteak was affixed in the local culture when one of their cooks put melted cheese on the sandwich. Originally, the cheese was melted in a separate container to accommodate their large clientele who followed kosher rules (thereby not mixing dairy and meat). Today, cheese choices in Philadelphia eateries are virtually limited to American, Provolone, or Cheez Whiz. The latter is especially popular in those places that prominently carry it. Pat's Steaks Geno's Steaks The hoagie is another sandwich that is said to have been invented in Philadelphia, undoubtedly of origin in Italian-American cuisine. It has been asserted that Italians working at the World War I era shipyard in Philadelphia, known as Hog Island where emergency shipping was produced for the war effort, introduced the sandwich, by putting various sliced meats, cheeses, and lettuce between two slices of Italian bread. This became known as the \\"Hog Island\\" sandwich; hence, the \\"hoagie\\".\\"Philly Via Italy\\", thirtyfourthstreetmagazine, April 17, 2007, p. 9. Declared the official sandwich of Philadelphia in 1992, the hoagie is a sandwich made of meat and cheese with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions on an Italian roll. Another Italian roll sandwich popularized in Philadelphia by Italian immigrants is the roast pork Italian, or Italian roast pork sandwich, a variation of the Italian street food dish known as porchetta. The sandwich consists of sliced roast pork with broccoli rabe or spinach and provolone cheese. Philadelphia Pepper Pot, a soup of tripe, meat, vegetables, is claimed to have been created during the American Revolutionary War and named after the home city of its creator. Snapper Soup, a thick brown turtle soup served with sherry, is a Philadelphia delicacy, generally found in area bars and seafood restaurants. In many places, it is served with oyster crackers (such as OTC Crackers, OTC being an abbreviation for \\"Original Trenton Cracker\\") and horseradish. Oyster Crackers, also known as \\"water cracker,\\" \\"Philadelphia cracker,\\" and \\"Trenton cracker\\". Quote: \\"I have had letters from Denver and from Pasadena about oyster crackers those oyster crackers some of us called water crackers some of us Philadelphia crackers some of us Trenton crackers Both of these men said they had oyster stew once a week the Denver man on Saturday night the Pasadena man on an unspecified day The one sent to Philadelphia for the crackers the other insisted on Exton crackers\\" Philly-style soft pretzel The snack item commonly associated with Philadelphia, but not invented there, is the soft pretzel. The soft pretzel dates back to 7th-century France and was brought over to the Philadelphia area by the Pennsylvania Dutch. Pretzels became iconic with Philadelphia by the numerous vendors who would sell them on street corners. Federal Pretzel Baking Company defined the soft pretzel for most Philadelphian's during the 1900s by first applying mass production and distribution to a distinctive baked flavored family recipe. Irish potato candy Another snack associated with Philadelphia is Irish potato candy. The candies have a coconut cream inside (generally made from some blend of coconut, confectioner's sugar, vanilla, and cream or cream cheese) and are rolled in cinnamon on the outside, resulting in an appearance reminiscent of small potatoes.Irish Potato Candy Recipe from Allrecipes.com The treats are about the size of a large marble and are especially popular around St. Patrick's Day. Oh Ryan's of Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, claims to be the largest distributor of Irish Potatoes, shipping about 80,000 pounds to major chains and smaller candy stores, mostly in the Philadelphia area.Erin Zimmer Water ice, known as Italian ice in other Northeastern US cities, is similarly associated with Philadelphia, brought to Philadelphia by Italian immigrants. Water ice likely derives from semi-frozen desserts originating in Italy, specifically granita. The Philadelphia metropolitan area (including Delaware Valley, South Jersey, Southeastern Pennsylvania) is the only region of the United States to refer to the dessert as \\"water ice\\"; in other areas, such as New York City, water ice is called \\"Italian ice\\". However, despite the overlap and near synonymity between the two terms, water ice has been described as a specific type of Italian ice originating in Philadelphia, or a \\"variation on the more broadly- accepted Italian ice.\\"Certain stands like South Philadelphia's \\"Pop's\\" or \\"Italiano's\\" became similar products later franchised into new markets like \\"Rita's Water Ice\\". Hires Root Beer mug, 1930s or earlier Bassett's Ice Cream at Reading Terminal As with New York City and Chicago, Philadelphia has its own regional variant of hot dog known as the Texas Tommy, originating right outside Philadelphia in Pottstown, Pennsylvania before spreading throughout the Delaware Valley region and South Jersey. The Texas Tommy hot dog is defined by its use of cheese (usually cheddar cheese) and bacon as toppings. Some variations of the Texas Tommy use other forms of cheese, replacing the cheddar with the Cheez-Whiz found on cheesesteaks. The bacon and cheese are often wrapped around the hot dog, and the hot dog may be cooked using a variety of methods, such as deep frying, barbecuing, or grilling. Condiments such as mustard, ketchup, or relish may be used in addition to the bacon and cheese. Chili is also sometimes added to the Texas Tommy, making the dish resemble more closely a Texas Wiener or chili dog with bacon and cheese. Although soda is not purely associated with Philadelphia, it was invented in Philadelphia, with brands that rose to popularity as Hires Root Beer, Franks Beverages' unique Black Cherry Wishniak or Vanilla Cream, and Levis Champ Cherry. Restaurants and markets Center Court, Reading Terminal Market In early Philadelphia history the city's eating scene was dominated by taverns. By 1752, Philadelphia had 120 licensed taverns and numerous illegal taverns. The taverns ranged for all types of people and class from illegal grog shops on the waterfront that sailors frequented to the upper class taverns that members of city government enjoyed. Taverns such as the London Coffee House, the Blue Anchor, Tun Tavern and John Biddle's Indian King were regular meeting places for the political and business leaders of the city. The City Tavern is a replica of a historic 18th-century building located at 138 South 2nd Street and is part of Independence National Historical Park. The tavern offers authentic 18th-century recipes, served in seven period dining rooms, three wine cellar rooms and an outdoor garden.Staib, Walter.

City Tavern Baking & Dessert Cookbook: 200 Years of Authentic American Recipes, pp. 9-25, Running Press, Philadelphia, London, 2003. . McGillin's Olde Ale House, located on Drury Street in Center City, is the oldest continuously operated tavern in the city, and has become a well-knownplace for celeb-spotting. City Tavern The Italian Market Popular restaurants during the early 19th century included the United States Hotel and Parkinson's on Chestnut Street and Joseph Head Mansion's House on Spruce Street. One of the most significant restaurateurs and caterers at this time was M. Latouche, an expert in French cuisine, whose restaurant offered expensive food and choice wine. Toward the end of the 19th century, the large number of Italian immigrants in South Philadelphia led to the creation of the Italian Market. The market, which runs along part of south 9th Street, includes numerous types of food vendors along with other shops, although today it is mostly made up of non-Italian merchants. Another market, the Reading Terminal Market, opened in 1892. Created to replace the markets displaced by the construction of the Reading Terminal on Market Street in Center City, Reading Terminal Market has over 80 merchants and is a popular tourist attraction. In 1902, Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart opened the first automat in the U.S. at 818 Chestnut Street, now a retail store. The original Automat is now part of the Smithsonian Institution. McGillin's Olde Ale House The Moshulu, a floating restaurant In the 1950s and 1960s, the restaurant scene was in decline. The city saw a large emigration into the suburbs, and fine dining could be found mainly in private clubs and dinner parties. But as the city started to rebound in the 1970s, Philadelphia saw a restaurant renaissance. For instance, in 1970 Georges Perrier and Peter Von Starck founded French restaurant Le Panetiere. After a year, the two split, with Von Starck taking the Panetiere name to a different location. Perrier opened Le Bec-Fin at 13th & Spruce Street, then later at 1523 Walnut Street, which quickly became one of Philadelphia's most renowned restaurants. Another popular example is H.A Winston & Co., which evolved into a chain of restaurants located throughout the region. The years following saw many new fine dining places open, including Four Seasons' Fountain Restaurant in 1983. Along with the up-scale restaurants, numerous ethnic and fast-food restaurants opened throughout the city. The 1970s also saw the rise of street vendors. The vendors, building off the well-established tradition of chestnut and pretzel vendors, began selling numerous foods, especially hot dogs, cheesesteaks, and breakfast sandwiches. By taking up sidewalk space and possibly business, the vendors annoyed established stores which eventually led to numerous legal battles over ordinances which placed restrictions on vendors. The issue was surrounded by race and class overtones, but vendors have since become commonplace and even nationally renowned for serving quality food. A wide variety of eateries now thrive in Philadelphia. The city has a growing reputation for culinary excellence, and many of the city's chefs have been honored with nominations for James Beard Awards Prolific local restaurateurs like Stephen Starr's STARR Restaurants and Iron Chef Jose Garces's Garces Restaurant Group operate restaurants that coexist with small chef-owned BYOBs. Major dining locations include Rittenhouse Square, Old City, Chinatown, Manayunk, East Passyunk Avenue and Fishtown. A variety of cuisine popular with Philadelphians today include Italian, Mediterranean, Chinese, Japanese, steakhouses, French, gastropub fare, tapas, diners, delis, and pizzerias. In September 2006, a smoking ban went into effect for Philadelphia bars and restaurants. The ban, which exempts private clubs, hotels, specialty smoking shops, and waiver-eligible bars that serve little food, had a troubled start and went unenforced until January 2007. Just a month later Philadelphia City Council passed a ban on trans fat in restaurants, effective September 2, 2007. Other health reforms have been introduced by the Get Healthy Philly Initiative.

Alcoholic beverages Beer was brewed by English colonial inhabitants of Philadelphia since the city's founding in 1682, and later by German immigrants that settled the city's countryside. Because of this, the city is strongly identified with both English-style beer (particularly porter, a variety that was virtually synonymous with Philadelphia during the American Revolutionary period) and German-style beer (such as lager), which eclipsed the English style near the end of the 19th century. In the industry's heyday before Prohibition, more than 90 breweries operated in city limits, with another 100 located in the greater metropolitan area. A neighborhood in the city is still called Brewerytown, owing to the concentration of breweries in the area during this time. The last of the city's most successful brewers, such as the Henry F. Ortlieb Brewing Company and the Christian Schmidt Brewing Company, shut down in the 1980s. The beer most associated with Philadelphia is Yuengling lager, brewed in nearby Pottsville, Pennsylvania and often referred to as simply \\"Lager\\" by Philadelphians and people in the Delaware Valley and South Jersey. Recently, however, a number of highly regarded micro-breweries and brewpubs appeared in and around the city in the 1990s and 2000s, such as Victory, Yards and PBC, reviving the city's dormant brewing industry. (For more information, see Breweries in Philadelphia.) In 2011, Philadelphia was ranked as one of the 14 best beer cities in the world by Frommer's,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - The World's Best Cities for Beer Slideshow at Frommer's and the city's annual beer week is among its most popular food-centric civic events. Other notable Delaware Valley microbreweries and brewpubs include Iron Hill Breweries and the award-winning Sly Fox Brewery. The distillation of spirits in Philadelphia has a long history, but the industry has sat idle for several decades. One of the largest manufacturing complexes in the city, spanning 40 acres, was owned by Publicker Industries, which produced chemicals, industrial alcohols and spirits in South Philadelphia. Its Continental Distilling Company arm produced Old Hickory bourbon, Inver House Scotch and Skol vodka, among many other liquors, before the company abandoned the site in 1986. The oldest producer of cordials and liqueurs in the U.S., Charles Jacquin et Cie, remains in operation in the city's Kensington neighborhood; the company is best known for its Pravda vodka, Jacquin's family of liqueurs and Original Bartenders Cocktails brand, well as its introduction of Chambord (sold to Brown-Forman in 2006), Creme Yvette, St-Germain and Domaine de Canton to the U.S. market. More recently, Philadelphia Distilling opened in 2005 in the city's Fishtown neighborhood; it is the first craft distillery to open in Pennsylvania since before Prohibition, and produces Bluecoat American Dry Gin, Vieux Carr√© Absinthe Sup√©rieure, Penn 1681 vodka, XXX Shine corn whiskey and The Bay, a vodka seasoned with Chesapeake Bay seasoning.

In each case, the terms refer both to the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman and to an individual Ombudsman. Sweden The Riksdag has had an Ombudsman Institution since 1809. At that time Sweden was ruled by the King and therefore the Riksdag of the Estates, which then represented the Four Estates, considered that some institution that was independent of the executive was needed in order to ensure that laws and statutes were observed. For this reason it appointed a Parliamentary Ombudsman and still continues to do so. The first Ombudsman was appointed in 1810, and the Parliamentary Ombudsmen still follow the basic principles that have applied since then. Jurisdiction A complaint to the JO (Justitieombudsmannen) - or Parliamentary Ombudsman (Riksdagens ombudsm√§n), which is the official name of the Institution - can be made by anybody who feels that he or she or someone else has been treated wrongly or unjustly by a public authority or an official employed by the civil service or local government. A person need not be a Swedish citizen or have reached a certain age to be able to lodge a complaint. However, the Institution has no jurisdiction over the actions of members of the Riksdag, the Government or individual cabinet ministers, the Chancellor of Justice or members of county or municipal councils. Nor do newspapers, radio and television broadcasts, trade unions, banks, insurance companies, doctors in private practice, lawyers et al. come within the ambit of the Ombudsmen. Other supervisory agencies exist for these areas, such as the Swedish Press Council (Pressens opinionsn√§mnd), the Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen), the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) and the Swedish Bar Association (Svenska advokatsamfundet). An Ombudsman is an individual elected by the Riksdag to ensure that courts of law and other agencies as well as the public officials they employ (and also anyone else whose work involves the exercise of public authority) comply with laws and statutes and fulfil their obligations in all other respects. An Ombudsman is elected for a four-year period and can be re-elected. Although there is no formal requirement for an Ombudsman to be a jurist, in practice all but the first have had legal training. In 1941 the stipulation that only men could be elected as Ombudsmen was rescinded; since then, five women have been elected to the office. Today there are four Ombudsmen, two women and two men. Each Ombudsman has her or his own area of responsibility (supervisory area). One of the Ombudsmen has the title of Chief Parliamentary Ombudsman and is responsible for administration, deciding, for instance, which areas of responsibility are to be allocated to the other Ombudsmen. However, he cannot intervene in another Ombudsman's inquiry or adjudication in any case within his or her ambit. Each Ombudsman has a direct individual responsibility to the Riksdag for his or her actions. The Annual Reports‚Äîwhich is one of the official publications of the Swedish Riksdag‚Äîis submitted to the Standing Committee on the Constitution, which then draws up its own written report and notifies the Riksdag. The Ombudsmen's inquiries (supervision) are based on complaints from the general public, cases initiated by the Ombudsmen themselves and on observations made during the course of inspections. Every year the Parliamentary Ombudsmen receives almost 5,000 complaints - of widely varying kinds. Most of the Ombudsmen's work consists of dealing with complaints. Powers and sanctions The Parliamentary Ombudsmen have the right to initiate disciplinary procedures against an official for misdemeanours. The most frequent outcome is, however, a critical advisory comment from an Ombudsman or some form of recommendation. An Ombudsman's opinion is never legally binding. The Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman is politically neutral. The most extreme recourse allows an Ombudsman to act as a special prosecutor and bring charges against the official for malfeasance or some other irregularity. This very rarely happens, but the mere awareness of this possibility means a great deal for the Ombudsmen's authority. History Lars Augustin Mannerheim (1749-1835) was the first Swedish justitieombudsman. The Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen was established in connection with the adoption of the Swedish Regeringsform (Instrument of Government) that came into effect after the deposition of the Swedish King in 1809 and which was based to some extent on Montesquieu's ideas about the division of powers. With the autocratic rule of King Gustav III fresh in mind, the legislators introduced into the new constitution a system that would allow the Riksdag some control over the exercise of executive power. The Standing Committee on the Constitution was therefore charged with the task of supervising the actions of ministers and with ensuring the election of a special Parliamentary Ombudsman to monitor the compliance of public authorities with the law. The Riksdag Act of 1810 contained provisions concerning the Auditors elected by the Riksdag to scrutinise the doings of the civil service, the Bank of Sweden and the National Debt Office. The regulations in Chapter 12 of the Instrument of Government of 1974 later incorporated these three supervisory Riksdag agencies (i.e. the Parliamentary Ombudsmen, the Standing Committee on the Constitution and the Parliamentary Auditors) into the current system of parliamentary government. The idea of creating some organ answerable to the Riksdag that could monitor the way in which the authorities complied with the law was not a new one in 1809. In fact, in 1713 the absolute monarch Karl XII had created the office of His Majesty's Supreme Ombudsman. At that time King Karl XII was in Turkey and had been abroad for almost 13 years. In his absence his administration in Sweden had fallen into disarray. He therefore established the Supreme Ombudsman to be his pre-eminent representative in Sweden. The task entrusted to him was to ensure that judges and public official in general acted in accordance with the laws in force and discharged their duties satisfactorily in other respects. If the Ombudsman found that this was not the case, he was empowered to initiate legal proceedings against them for dereliction of their duties. In 1719 the Supreme Ombudsman was given the title of Chancellor of Justice (Justitiekanslern). This office still exists, and today the Chancellor of Justice acts as the government's Ombudsman. After the death of Charles XII in 1718 Sweden enjoyed decades of what was more or less parliamentary rule (the Period of Liberty). In 1766 the Riksdag actually for the first time elected the Chancellor of Justice. In the 1772 Instrument of Government, however, the right to appoint the Chancellor of Justice again became a royal prerogative. After a period of renewed autocratic rule under Gustaf III and his son, Gustaf Adolf IV, the latter was deposed in 1809. According to the 1809 Instrument of Government, power was to be divided between the King and the Riksdag. The King was to appoint the Chancellor of Justice (in other words he was the royal Ombudsman) and the Riksdag was to appoint its own Parliamentary Ombudsman. The main purpose of the establishment of this new post as Ombudsman (Parliamentary Ombudsman) was to safeguard the rights of citizens by establishing a supervisory agency that was completely independent of the executive. However, it seemed quite natural to model this new office on that of the Chancellor of Justice. Like the Chancellor of Justice, therefore, the Ombudsman was to be a prosecutor whose task was to supervise the application of the laws by judges and civil servants. In the words of the 1809 Instrument of Government, the Riksdag was to appoint a man \\"known for his knowledge of the law and exemplary probity\\" as Parliamentary Ombudsman. In other words, his duties were to focus on protection of the rights of citizens. For instance the Parliamentary Ombudsman was to encourage uniform application of the law and indicate legislative obscurities. His work was to take the form of inspections and inquiries into complaints. Complaints played a relatively insignificant role to begin with. During the first century of the existence of the Office, the total number of complaints amounted to around 8,000. Initially, the role of a Parliamentary Ombudsman could be characterised as that of a prosecutor. Cases set in motion by the Ombudsman were either shelved with no action being taken or resulted in prosecution. Eventually, however, routines evolved which meant that prosecution was waived for minor transgressions and an admonition was issued instead. This development was acknowledged by the Riksdag in 1915 by its inclusion of a specific right to waive prosecution in the instructions for the Parliamentary Ombudsman. Until the adoption of the 1975 instructions, these provisions on an Ombudsman's right to waive prosecution in cases involving transgressions that were not of major consequence provided the only formal basis for the expression of criticism. In the cases where an official could not be charged with any punishable error and therefore there were no grounds for a decision to waive prosecution, the expression of criticism or advice on the part of the Ombudsman was based only the usages that had evolved over the years. These practices were appraised and approved by the Riksdag in 1964. The decision in 1975 to abolish the special right to waive prosecution was linked to the simultaneous reform of official accountability, which involved among other things major curtailment of the legal responsibility of public officials for their actions. In this context it was considered that there was no longer any need for the Parliamentary Ombudsmen to have the right to waive prosecution. Instead it was stipulated that in inquiries into cases the Ombudsmen were to be subject to the regulations that already applied to public prosecutors with regard to prosecution and the right to waive prosecution. Today, the 1986 instructions - the Act with Instructions for the Parliamentary Ombudsmen (1986:765) and the amendments added in 1989 - state that when undertaking the role of prosecutor the Ombudsmen are also to comply with the other statutory regulations applying to public prosecutors. (In addition the 1975 instructions also included a special regulation empowering the Ombudsmen to make critical or advisory comments and these have been transferred to the instructions that now apply.) In 1957 the institution of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen was also given the power to monitor local government authorities. Legacy The development of the role of the Ombudsman institution has resulted in a gradual shift in the thrust of these activities from a punitive to an advisory and consultative function. The task of forestalling error and general endeavours to ensure the correct application of the law have taken precedence over the role of prosecutor. The starting point of the work of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen today is based - as it was nearly two centuries ago - on the desire of individuals that any treatment they receive from the authorities should be lawful and correct in every other respect. The institution of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen today is a vital element in the constitutional protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of each individual. The supervision exercised by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen consists mainly of inquiries into complaints submitted by the general public. In addition the four Ombudsmen make inspections and any other investigations they consider necessary. The Ombudsmen are however - unlike normal official agencies - never obliged to consider the circumstances of every case submitted to them. Instead the Ombudsmen make their own assessment of which complaints to investigate and which require no further action. This presupposes, however, an ungrudging attitude on the part of the Ombudsmen to the complaints they receive so that all those that give grounds for suspecting that some error has been committed will be investigated. It can also happen that even though an Ombudsman finds no reason to inquire into a complaint itself, other aspects of the actions of a public authority will be appraised instead. As was the case in 1810 - when Lars Augustin Mannerheim was appointed as the first Ombudsman - the four Parliamentary Ombudsmen are today completely independent of the government and the civil service which they monitor. For this reason the Institution is often said to be of an extraordinary nature. This means, for instance, that the activities of the Ombudsmen are not intended to replace the supervision and application of the law that devolves on other organisations in the community. Even though from a constitutional point of view monitoring the application of law by public authorities is the prerogative of the Riksdag, for reasons of principle it has been considered unacceptable to incorporate any political considerations into this supervision. For this reason the independent attitude adopted by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen has applied to their relationship with the Riksdag as well. For instance the Riksdag is not considered able to issue directives to the Ombudsmen about any individual case, nor can it express opinions retrospectively about how a case was dealt with or the final adjudication. Instead the authority of the Riksdag over the activities of the Ombudsmen finds expression in the instructions issued to the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and in the funds allocated to the Office. It is the Riksdag that decides on the budget for the Parliamentary Ombudsmen - not the government or the Ministry of Finance. Finland Finland has had the institution of parliamentary ombudsman (Finnish: eduskunnan oikeusasiamies, Swedish: riksdagens justitieombudsman) since 1920. The office of the ombudsman has one ombudsman and two assistant ombudsmen (Finnish: apulaisoikeusasiamies, Swedish: bitr√§dande justitieombudsman). The officials are elected for a term of four years and their duties closely resemble the jurisdiction of their Swedish counterparts. The other Finnish official charged with the supervision of public power is the Chancellor of Justice. The jurisdiction of the two offices overlaps, but the parliamentary ombudsman is the authority specially charged with the handling of complaints by military servicemen, conscripts, prisoners and other persons in closed institutions. He also regularly inspects prisons, garrisons and Finnish peacekeeping missions abroad. The other special duty of the parliamentary ombudsman is the supervision of police undercover and wiretapping activities. Denmark The Danish parliamentary ombudsman has existed since 1955. It investigates complaints against public authorities and can also take up cases on its own initiative.Folketingets Ombudsmand website Iceland The Icelandic Parliamentary Ombudsman was established in 1987.

John Young, Bishop of Limerick, in 1796. After many changes, it is established on the site in Corbally by Most Rev. Henry Murphy, Bishop of Limerick, who placed the foundation stone on 28th April, 1960\\" Thus reads, in English translation, the inscription to be seen on the foundation stone of St. Munchin‚Äôs College, Corbally, Limerick. It is an institution of learning with a long and noble history, stretching back over two hundred years. In this time, St. Munchin‚Äôs College has indeed seen many changes, both of organisation and location. The Diocese of Limerick was formally established at the Synod of R√°th Breasail in the year 1111. The boundaries of the diocese as arranged at that time have remained practically unchanged to the present day. The diocese includes most of County Limerick, and two parishes in Co. Clare. The patron saint of the diocese is St Munchin; tradition holds that St. Munchin was the first bishop of Limerick and he founded a cathedral which remained the principal church of the diocese until Donal O'Brien, King of Limerick, built St. Mary‚Äôs Cathedral in the 12th century. For many centuries Irish Theological Schools had been suppressed and the students for the priesthood had to be educated outside Ireland. Many famous Colleges for the education of priests were established on the continent-Lisbon, Salamanca, Paris and Rome to name just a few However, by the end of the 18th century, circumstances had changed. Firstly, the effects of the French Revolution had closed many of the seminaries abroad and secondly, the attitude of the government to the education of the Catholic clergy had changed. A bill to provide for the education of the Catholic clergy received the Royal assent on 5 June 1795. The Duke of Leinster offered a site at Maynooth, his offer was accepted and, on 1 October 1795 St. Patrick's College at Maynooth was formally opened. At this time, in most Irish dioceses, preparatory seminaries were established, among them St. Munchin‚Äôs College, Limerick. The driving force behind the establishment of the new college was Bishop John Young. On 29 September 1796, St. Munchin's College was opened at Palmerstown in Limerick City. The curriculum was made up of Logic and Divinity. It was a major seminary for those pursuing studies for the priesthood. It was some years before St. Munchin's took on the form of a Diocesan College, that is, an educational institution in which both laymen and future priests pursue their secondary studies together. The first of many changes in location was not long coming and, within six months, by March 1797, the College moved from Palmerstown to Newgate Lane where it would remain for only three years. The next site was at Peter's Cell and, by 1809, it was on the move again, this time to Park House in Corbally. In 1825 the College at Park House closed but, its last President, opened an Academy in Mallow Street. The Academy was opened to lay students as well as students for the priesthood. A fully fledged St. Munchin's College was opened again in 1853, under the patronage of Bishop John Ryan. The College, known as 'St. Munchin's Diocesan Seminary' was located at No. 1 Hartstonge Street, and the College authorities were very proud of the facilities that were available: \\"The seminary itself is situated in the most elevated and healthy part of the city, and no expense has been spared to fit it up in the best possible manner, for the reception of day pupils and boarders\\". A wide range of subjects was on offer, including Music, Drawing, Painting, and Dancing. A major change in the running of St. Munchin's took place when Bishop Ryan decided to remove the diocesan clergy from the college. This, it would seem, was because \\"the priests of St. Munchin's had paid too much local attention to a local election\\". (Thomas Begley, Diocesan Historian) Bishop Ryan approached the Society of Jesus with a request to take over the administration of the College. After formal negotiations were successfully concluded between the Bishop and the Society of Jesus, both in Ireland and in Rome, St Munchin's College became a Jesuit-run school on 10 March 1859. This wasn‚Äôt the first venture into education by the Jesuits in Limerick. In fact, their first school in Ireland was set up in St. Mary‚Äôs Parish in 1565. By 1862 the Diocesan College moved to Crescent House where the curriculum included classical and modern languages, mathematics, physics, history, geography, and elocution. The school also had a 'Mercantile Department' in which 'an extensive and accurate knowledge is imparted of arithmetic, book-keeping, abstracts and other requirements of the actuary's office'. Young men were prepared there for 'the university and the ecclesiastical colleges, the learned professions, the public service, civil and military'. In 1867 Bishop George Butler decided to re-establish his own seminary at Hartstonge Street and the Jesuits maintained their own school at the Crescent which was renamed the Crescent College. The two schools quickly developed a rivalry on the rugby field which survives to this day. In the 1870s the Jesuits were again asked to administer St. Munchins, which this time moved to Mungret. This arrangement, however, was not to last and the College was again transferred to the clergy of the Diocese and moved to the former town house of Lord Limerick at Henry Street where it remained until a new school was built in the 1960s at Corbally. Torch Magazine Every year, transition year students in the school produce the end of year magazine called 'The Torch'. The magazine began in 1977 and has been produced every year since. The Torch features profiles of all the 6th year students (which are written by their classmates), articles about everything that goes on in the school during the year, interviews with new teachers and students who deserve special recognition (such as captains of rugby teams) and photos from the school year. The Torch is regarded by many as one of the best student magazines in the Limerick area. Sport The school won the Munster Schools Junior Cup in 2018. Winning its first title in the Munster Schools Senior Cup in 1968, it has since won the cup four times. It also has 6 titles at Junior Cup level. A number of former pupils have gone on to play at international level, including Bill O'Connell, Bill Mulcahy, Larry Moloney, Colm Tucker (also a Lion), John Fitzgerald, Paul Hogan, Phil Danaher (also Irish captain), Anthony Foley (also Irish captain), Keith Wood (also a Lion and Irish captain), Jerry Flannery (also a Lion), Barry Murphy, Jeremy Staunton, Marcus Horan, Denis Hurley and Damien Varley and current Irish internationals Keith Earls (also a Lion), Donnacha Ryan and Conor Murray (also a Lion).

Owned by Jonathan Palmer's MotorSport Vision organisation, it is situated on the A11 road north-east of the town of Thetford and south-west of the city of Norwich. The circuit is named after the nearby village of Snetterton to the north-west of the circuit, although much of the circuit lies in the adjoining civil parish of Quidenham.Ordnance Survey (1999). OS Explorer Map 237 - Norwich. . The circuit hosts races from series including the British Touring Car Championship, British Formula Three Championship and British Superbike Championship. From 1980 to 1994, the track hosted the UK's first 24-hour race, the Willhire 24 Hour. From 2003 to 2013 the Citroen 2CV 24 Hour Race was held at Snetterton on the 200 Circuit.24hr ‚Äì Getting Involved Retrieved 15 June 2016 Pre-racing history photograph of WW2 Airfield Snetterton was originally an RAF airfield, RAF Snetterton Heath, later used by the United States Army Air Force. The airfield opened in May 1943 and closed in November 1948. Racing history The original Snetterton Circuit (shown in green) was laid out on the runways and taxiways of the former RAF Snetterton Heath air base (in light brown) After its use as a USAF base, Snetterton was first used for motorcycle racing in 1953, organised by the Snetterton Combine, an association of clubs in Norfolk and Suffolk.Britain's Top Circuits, race circuit guide, 1966 hard copy (free supplement with Motor Cycle), Accessed 2015-05-02 The track was used by both Team Lotus (Formula One) and Norfolk Racing Co (Le Mans) to test their racing cars. In the 1960s and early 1970s the circuit was 2.7 miles in length. Sear corner was 80 m further from Riches corner and led onto the \\"Norwich Straight\\" clearly visible in satellite maps and currently used by a Sunday market. The straight ended in a hairpin bend leading to Home Straight which joined the existing track at the Esses but is now a main access road for the circuit. Russell bend was added in the 1960s and named after Jim Russell who ran a racing drivers school at the circuit. Initially added to improve safety by slowing vehicles as they approached the pits, Russell bend was the scene of many accidents and was later altered to its present configuration. Circuit developments Snetterton layout in 2010, prior to redevelopment In October 2005, Jonathan Palmer of MotorSport Vision, the owners of Snetterton Circuit, announced that the circuit would undergo extensive rebuilding work, in order to lengthen the circuit and improve its facilities. On 23 September 2010, MSV announced that construction of the new infield section and track improvements would be finished in time for the 2011 motorsport season. The main development was the addition of a new one mile infield section, after Sear Corner, which was replaced and renamed Montreal, in deference to it being modelled on the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve hairpin. The final chicane before Senna Straight was also removed and replaced by an extension to Coram curve coupled with a new, tight, left-hand corner named Murrays. In addition to the track work, the redevelopment also improved spectator viewing and increased safety. Snetterton 300 Circuit Snetterton 300 Circuit as of 2015. The Montreal Hairpin has since been renamed Justin Wilson. The 300 Circuit is long, Snetterton's longest layout and the second longest racing track in the country. The track incorporates much of the previous circuit with the infield section that was completed in 2011. The 300 track has been designed to bring international levels of racing to the circuit by gaining an FIA Grade 2 Licence. The layout also hosts major British motorsport championships. The British Formula 3 Championship and British GT Championship were the first of these to visit the new layout on 14 and 15 May 2011. The British Touring Car Championship with its ToCA support package also uses this layout, as does the British Superbike Championship. In 2016, ahead of Justin Wilson's 38th birthday, the Montreal hairpin was renamed Wilson, in memory of the Yorkshire IndyCar driver killed at the 2015 Pocono 500. Snetterton 200 This layout is closest to the pre-2011 layout. The main differences between the original layout and the 200 layout are the re-profiled Justin Wilson, Coram, and Murray's corners, which have been designed to provide better opportunities for overtaking. This layout is mainly used for club and local racing. Snetterton 100 The 100 layout is made up solely of the new 1 mile infield section and is mainly used for testing and as a race school. Both the 100 layout and the 200 layout can be used simultaneously. The first event which both events were used simultaneously was the BRSCC meeting held on the 29 and 30 May 2011. There was club racing on the outer circuit (VW Fun Cup, Saker Challenge, TVRs and Mighty Minis) and two rounds of the British Sprint Championship on the inner circuit. Lap Records Cars The current 300 circuit lap record was set by Felipe Nasr from Brazil driving a Carlin prepared Dallara F308-Volkswagen in the 2nd race of the 2011 British F3 meeting. The lap was 1m 39.933s at an average speed of 106.95 mph. Prior to the introduction of the 300 circuit in 2011, the lap record stood at 56.095 (125.27 mph) set by Klaas Zwart, during a BRSCC meeting in August 2007. During qualifying he set an unofficial lap record of 54.687 (128.50 mph).

It peaked at #45 on the Billboard 200. Its initial release was on vinyl, cassette tape, reel-to-reel tape, and 8-track tape cartridge. Although its follow-up Time Fades Away was finally released on CD in August 2017, Journey Through The Past has yet to see an official CD reissue. Content Journey Through The Past features music derived mainly from four sources: television broadcasts with Buffalo Springfield; live recordings with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; rehearsal outtakes from the Harvest sessions with The Stray Gators; and recordings by The Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation Orchestra and Chorus. It functions in part as a retrospective of Young's work, the first of his career. Side one, tracks one and two are performed by Buffalo Springfield. The medley on track one are studio recordings, including a rare alternative version of \\"Mr. Soul\\", mimed to by the group for the television program The Hollywood Palace on January 20, 1967. The group was introduced by host Tony Martin. The second selection derives from the group's appearance in 1967 on the television special Popendipity, recorded at the Warwick Musical Theater, Warwick, RI, on November 16, 1967. The group was introduced by Flip Wilson. Side one, tracks three and four, and side two, track one, are live recordings by CSNY from an appearance at the Fillmore East in New York City on June 5, 1970. The Harvest album outtakes on side two, tracks two and four, and side three derive from sessions on September 26 and 27, 1971 at Young's ranch in La Honda, California. Interspersed are conversations with Young, David Crosby, and Stephen Stills from the vocal overdub sessions done later in New York. Side four, tracks two and three, respectively an excerpt from Messiah by George Frederic Handel and the musical theme composed by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa for the film King of Kings, are performed by the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation Orchestra and Chorus, recorded on February 10, 1972. The album contains only one new song by Young, \\"Soldier\\", recorded in a sawmill to the accompaniment of a roaring fire from a sawdust burner. It would later reappear in edited form on Young's Decade compilation. The record closes on side four with a track from the 1966 classic album Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys, the instrumental \\"Let's Go Away for Awhile\\".

Their traditional date of death is 120. They are patron saints of Brescia. \\"Jovita\\" in modern times is a woman's name. In some accounts the saints were instead Jovinus and Faustinus, brothers. Traditional vita Tradition states that they were members of a noble family of Brescia in Lombardy (northern Italy). Jovinus, the older brother, was a preacher; Faustinus, a deacon. For their fearless preaching of the Gospel, they were arraigned before the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who at Brescia, Rome and Naples, subjected them to frightful torments, after which they were beheaded at Brescia in the year 120, according to the Bollandists, though Allard (Histoire des Pers√©cutions pendant les Deux Premiers Si√®cles, Paris, 1885) places the date as early as 118. Saint Faustinus of Brescia, a bishop of Brescia and an alleged descendant, compiled their Acts. Doubts and veneration The many \\"Acts\\" of these saints are chiefly of a legendary character. The Jesuit Fedele Savio questioned nearly every fact related of them except their existence of the martyrdom, which are too well attested by their inclusion in so many of the early martyrologies and their extraordinary cult in their native city, of which from time immemorial they have been the chief patrons. Their common feast day on 15 February, the traditional date of their martyrdom, was inserted into the General Roman Calendar . It was removed in 1969, because their \\"Acts are completely fabulous, treating Jovita as a preacher, although she was a woman and a man was Faustinus.\\"Calendarium Romanum, Libreria Editrice Vaticana (1969), p. 117 However modern minds tend to forget that the name Jovita or Giovita was a man's name in the pre-Christian and early Christian era. Savio highlights that the saints are not to be identified with the fabulous figures in the Acts. The two saints remain listed in the Roman Martyrology, the official, through professedly incomplete, list of the saints recognized by the Catholic Church.Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ), p. 142 The cities of Rome, Bologna and Verona share with Brescia possession of their relics. A lake partially in the town of St. Leo, Florida has been called Lake Jovita since its discovery by Judge Edmund F. Dunne on February 15, 1882.

Since it disbanded almost all of its members have continued acting on theatre and in film. History The group was originally designed by screenwriter Mitani K≈çki, a young writer who at that time had aspirations of becoming a comedian. Although he starred in a number of the troupe's plays, he was primarily the resident playwright (Â∫ß‰ªò‰ΩúÂÆ∂). The main three actors were Nishimura Masahiko (who went on to win a number of Japanese Academy Awards and the Blue Ribbon award), Aijima Kazuyuki and Kajiwara Zen. All of the primary actors being about the same age, the existence of the group proved to be a milestone in the then-developing Japanese theatre field of Sho-Gekijo, or 'Little Theatre.' Sho-Gekijo mainly focused on making theatre accessible to the proletariat as opposed to a then-popular philosophical art which arguably required a degree of education to appreciate. The troupe finally hit it big in 1991 with their remake of the Reginald Rose work Twelve Angry Men. It was rewritten into a comedy (since there is no such jury system in Japan) called 12 Gentle Japanese (Japanese title: Juuni-nin no Yasashii Nihonjin). The success of this play eventually encouraged the production of a movie directed by Nakahara Shun. However, since the play was registered as created by Mitani Koki as opposed to \\"The Sunshine Boys\\", the producers took over and held auditions for the cast. Only three of the then 13 Tokyo Sunshine Boys made it onto the cast: Aijima Kazuyuki, Kajiwara Zen, and Kondo Yoshimasa. From that point on, Mitani K≈çki as the writer for the Tokyo Sunshine Boys as well as the actors themselves, got flooded with offers to work on other TV dramas, plays and movies. As a result of an increasingly busy schedule for the individual member, the group finally disbanded in 1994 with a final performance called Tokyo Sunshine Boys no Min. The group promises to get together again for a 30-year reunion in the year 2024 with a specialised performance of King Lear which will star Kajiwara Zen. Unique Characteristics The Tokyo Sunshine Boys, named after the play The Sunshine Boys by director Neil Simon, specialised in situation comedy, a form of theatre originating in radio that got its laughs from the awkward situations their characters were placed in as opposed to the more traditional protagonist vs. antagonist plots. Mitani K≈çki had a special admiration for Neil Simon and Woody Allen, both writers who also specialised in situation comedy. The Tokyo Sunshine Boys grew in popularity due to their un-intrusive, lighthearted and easy-to-understand style. The topics of their plays never covered anything taboo or political in nature, and so were unoffensive to everyone. Their stories specialised in the creation of a work - be it a play, a radio drama, or a house - of people cooperating, a multitude of opinions being brought into consideration, and the pros and cons thereof. The plays always had a happy ending. Members The writer and director of most of the plays was Mitani K≈çki. He also acted occasionally under the pseudonym of Hitotsubashi S≈çtaro.

When it was first conceived it was planned to circle the whole of Bristol, and is commonly referred to as the \\"Avon Ring Road\\", or less accurately the \\"Bristol Ring Road\\", on road signs. The road does not circle the whole city, instead covering roughly half of the route. It is broken in part where it is concurrent with the A4. Part of the dual carriageway north of Mangotsfield occupies the alignment of the former Midland railway line which closed in 1966. Route The road was conceived in the 1980s by Avon County Council, and the route of the initial section, east of Bristol, was selected by 1986. The road was built progressively in a number of sections, over an extended period of time. The completed section of the northern and eastern route runs from the A38 at Filton, under the M32 motorway, through to Frenchay, Bromley Heath, Emersons Green, Kingswood, Warmley, and Longwell Green before joining the A4 at Hicks Gate junction near Keynsham. This section of the road is entirely dual carriageway and runs through several roundabouts with local routes. Many of these roundabouts formerly experienced long queues, but since 2005, most have been signalised, resulting in reduced congestion. The junction with the M32 motorway still experiences long delays despite the introduction of traffic lights. The road reappears along the A4 at Brislington, where it follows a valley, crosses the A37, and reaches a large roundabout in Hengrove Park some south of the city centre. Here the road turns north, terminating at the A38 in Bedminster. A further section of the southern ring, the South Bristol Link Road, was opened in January 2017 and connects Hartcliffe (west of Hengrove Park) with the A370 near Long Ashton. Future plans There have been several proposals to extend the ring road from the junction with the A4 at Hicks Gate, Keynsham, along the southern edge of Bristol as far as the A370 at Long Ashton. From there a complete loop could be achieved by following the A4 then the M5 and M4. The 2005 Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study, commissioned by the regional government office, recommended construction of the new southern route to tackle congestion. The proposals follow the route set aside west from Hengrove Park roundabout to the A38 at Castle Farm (phase 1), and from there to the A370 near Long Ashton Park and Ride (phase 2). There are additional recommendations (phase 3) for a new Whitchurch bypass from Hengrove Park roundabout, along the base of Dundry Hill, around Stockwood and joining the existing A4174 at Hicks Gate roundabout on the A4. Phase one and two of the ring road are the only major road building schemes adopted by the Joint Local Transport Plan, which claimed they would reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use.B&NES;, Bristol City, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire councils, 2006. \\"Joint Local Transport Plan .\\" Chapter 6. Bristol City Council has endorsed all three phases, and was hoping to begin construction of the first two phases in 2010 and 2011, and the third phase some time after 2016. In December 2015, construction began on widening sections of the ring road between the junction with the M32 and Wick Wick Roundabout, to create new bus lanes for MetroBus as part of its North Fringe to Hengrove route package. The works included replacement of the Church Lane foot/horse bridge. In July 2016, outline plans to build a direct road from the A4 Hicks Gate roundabout to the large roundabout in Hengrove Park, obviating the use of the A4 to bridge this \\"missing link\\", were scrapped. This outline plan had blighted homes on the possible route for a number of years.

In functional programming, catamorphisms provide generalizations of folds of lists to arbitrary algebraic data types, which can be described as initial algebras. The dual concept is that of anamorphism that generalize unfolds. A hylomorphism is the composition of an anamorphism followed by a catamorphism.  Definition  Consider an initial F-algebra (A, in) for some endofunctor F of some category into itself. Here in is a morphism from FA to A. Since it is initial, we know that whenever (X, f) is another F-algebra, i.e. a morphism f from FX to X, there is a unique homomorphism h from (A, in) to (X, f). By the definition of the category of F-algebras, this h corresponds to a morphism from A to X, conventionally also denoted h, such that h \\\\circ in = f \\\\circ Fh. In the context of F-algebras, the uniquely specified morphism from the initial object is denoted by cata f and hence characterized by the following relationship: *h = \\\\mathrm{cata}\\\\ f *h \\\\circ in = f \\\\circ Fh  Terminology and history  Another notation found in the literature is (\\\\\\\\!f\\\\\\\\!). The open brackets used are known as banana brackets, after which catamorphisms are sometimes referred to as bananas, as mentioned in Erik Meijer et al. One of the first publications to introduce the notion of a catamorphism in the context of programming was the paper ‚ÄúFunctional Programming with Bananas, Lenses, Envelopes and Barbed Wire‚Äù, by Erik Meijer et al., which was in the context of the Squiggol formalism. The general categorical definition was given by Grant Malcolm. ..  Examples  We give a series of examples, and then a more global approach to catamorphisms, in the Haskell programming language.  Iteration  Iteration-step prescriptions lead to natural numbers as initial object. Consider the functor \`fmaybe\` mapping a data type \`b\` to a data type \`fmaybe b\`, which contains a copy of each term from \`b\` as well as one additional term \`Nothing\` (in Haskell, this is what \`Maybe\` does). This can be encoded using one term and one function. So let an instance of a StepAlgebra also include a function from \`fmaybe b\` to \`b\`, which maps \`Nothing\` to a fixed term \`nil\` of \`b\`, and where the actions on the copied terms will be called \`next\`. type StepAlgebra b = (b, b->b) -- the algebras, which we encode as pairs (nil, next) data Nat = Zero  Succ Nat -- which is the initial algebra for the functor described above foldSteps :: StepAlgebra b -> (Nat -> b) -- the catamorphisms map from Nat to b foldSteps (nil, next) Zero = nil foldSteps (nil, next) (Succ nat) = next $ foldSteps (nil, next) nat As a silly example, consider the algebra on strings encoded as \`(\\"go!\\", \\\\s -> \\"wait.. \\" ++ s)\`, for which \`Nothing\` is mapped to \`\\"go!\\"\` and otherwise \`\\"wait.. \\"\` is prepended. As \`(Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero)\` denotes the number four in \`Nat\`, the following will evaluate to \\"wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!\\": foldSteps (\\"go!\\", \\\\s -> \\"wait.. \\" ++ s) (Succ . Succ . Succ . Succ $ Zero). We can easily change the code to a more useful operation, say repeated operation of an algebraic operation on numbers, just by changing the F-algebra \`(nil, next)\`, which is passed to \`foldSteps\`  List fold  For a fixed type \`a\`, consider the functor mapping types \`b\` to the product type of those two types. We moreover also add a term \`Nil\` to this resulting type. An f-algebra shall now map \`Nil\` to some special term \`nil\` of \`b\` or \\"merge\\" a pair (any other term of the constructed type) into a term of \`b\`. This merging of a pair can be encoded as a function of type \`a -> b -> b\`. type ContainerAlgebra a b = (b, a -> b -> b) -- f-algebra encoded as (nil, merge) data List a = Nil  Cons a (List a) -- which turns out to be the initial algebra foldrList :: ContainerAlgebra a b -> (List a -> b) -- catamorphisms map from (List a) to b foldrList (nil, merge) Nil = nil foldrList (nil, merge) (Cons x xs) = merge x $ foldrList (nil, merge) xs As an example, consider the algebra on numbers types encoded as \`(3, \\\\x-> \\\\y-> x*y)\`, for which the number from \`a\` acts on the number from \`b\` by plain multiplication. Then the following will evaluate to 3.000.000: foldrList (3, \\\\x-> \\\\y-> x*y) (Cons 10 $ Cons 100 $ Cons 1000 Nil)  Tree fold  For a fixed type \`a\`, consider the functor mapping types \`b\` to a type that contains a copy of each term of \`a\` as well as all pairs of \`b\`'s (terms of the product type of two instances of the type \`b\`). An algebra consists of a function to \`b\`, which either acts on an \`a\` term or two \`b\` terms. This merging of a pair can be encoded as two functions of type \`a -> b\` resp. \`b -> b -> b\`. type TreeAlgebra a b = (a -> b, b -> b -> b) -- the \\"two cases\\" function is encoded as (f, g) data Tree a = Leaf a  Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) -- which turns out to be the initial algebra foldTree :: TreeAlgebra a b -> (Tree a -> b) -- catamorphisms map from (Tree a) to b foldTree (f, g) (Leaf x) = f x foldTree (f, g) (Branch left right) = g (foldTree (f, g) left) (foldTree (f, g) right) treeDepth :: TreeAlgebra a Integer -- an f-algebra to numbers, which works for any input type treeDepth = (const 1, \\\\i j -> 1 + max i j) treeSum :: (Num a) => TreeAlgebra a a -- an f-algebra, which works for any number type treeSum = (id, (+))  General case  Deeper category theoretical studies of initial algebras reveal that the F-algebra obtained from applying the functor to its own initial algebra is isomorphic to it. Strong type systems enable us to abstractly specify the initial algebra of a functor \`f\` as its fixed point a = f a. The recursively defined catamorphisms can now be coded in single line, where the case analysis (like in the different examples above) is encapsulated by the fmap. Since the domain of the latter are objects in the image of \`f\`, the evaluation of the catamorphisms jumps back and forth between \`a\` and \`f a\`. type Algebra f a = f a -> a -- the generic f-algebras newtype Fix f = Iso { invIso :: f (Fix f) } -- gives us the initial algebra for the functor f cata :: Functor f => Algebra f a -> (Fix f -> a) -- catamorphism from Fix f to a cata alg = alg . fmap (cata alg) . invIso -- note that invIso and alg map in opposite directions Now again the first example, but now via passing the Maybe functor to Fix. Repeated application of the Maybe functor generates a chain of types, which, however, can be united by the isomorphism from the fixed point theorem. We introduce the term \`zero\`, which arises from Maybes's \`Nothing\` and identify a successor function with repeated application of the \`Just\`. This way the natural numbers arise. type Nat = Fix Maybe zero :: Nat zero = Iso Nothing -- every 'Maybe a' has a term Nothing, and Iso maps it into a successor :: Nat -> Nat successor = Iso . Just -- Just maps a to 'Maybe a' and Iso maps back to a new term pleaseWait :: Algebra Maybe String -- again the silly f-algebra example from above pleaseWait (Just string) = \\"wait.. \\" ++ string pleaseWait Nothing = \\"go!\\" Again, the following will evaluate to \\"wait.. wait.. wait.. wait.. go!\\": \`cata pleaseWait (successor.successor.successor.successor $ zero)\` And now again the tree example. For this we must provide the tree container data type so that we can set up the \`fmap\` (we didn't have to do it for the \`Maybe\` functor, as it's part of the standard prelude). data Tcon a b = TconL a  TconR b b instance Functor (Tcon a) where fmap f (TconL x) = TconL x fmap f (TconR y z) = TconR (f y) (f z) type Tree a = Fix (Tcon a) -- the initial algebra end :: a -> Tree a end = Iso . TconL meet :: Tree a -> Tree a -> Tree a meet l r = Iso $ TconR l r treeDepth :: Algebra (Tcon a) Integer -- again, the treeDepth f-algebra example treeDepth (TconL x) = 1 treeDepth (TconR y z) = 1 + max y z The following will evaluate to 4: \`cata treeDepth $ meet (end \\"X\\") (meet (meet (end \\"YXX\\") (end \\"YXY\\")) (end \\"YY\\"))\`  See also  *Morphism * Morphisms of F-algebras ** From a coalgebra to a final coalgebra: Anamorphism ** An anamorphism followed by an catamorphism: Hylomorphism ** Extension of the idea of catamorphisms: Paramorphism ** Extension of the idea of anamorphisms: Apomorphism  References   Further reading  *  External links  * Catamorphisms at HaskellWiki * Catamorphisms by Edward Kmett * Catamorphisms in F# (Part 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) by Brian McNamara * Catamorphisms in Haskell Category:Category theory Category:Recursion schemes Category:Functional programming Category:Morphisms Category:Iteration in programming ","title":"Catamorphism"},{"id":"4237153","text":"Thomas Murray may refer to: Politicians *Thomas Murray (Australian politician) (1885‚Äì1969), member of the New South Wales Legislative Council *Thomas Murray (Canadian politician) (1836‚Äì1915), former member of the Canadian House of Commons and Legislative Assembly of Ontario *Thomas B.

The company is a co-operative of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC). The group has 100 supermarkets across the island, with over 160 outlets of Cheers convenience stores island-wide. NTUC FairPrice has partnered with ExxonMobil to run several stations with a FairPrice branding at the minimarts at their stations. The supermarket has the slogan \\"Singapore's very own\\". History The Toa Payoh Hub branch NTUC Fairprice Supermarket before the makeover. NTUC FairPrice was first established on 22 July 1973 as NTUC Welcome Supermarket in Toa Payoh, to solve the rising oil and daily prices then due to inflation. Then prime minister Lee Kuan Yew opened the first supermarket at Block 192, Toa Payoh Lorong 4, and it was the first of its kind.Shapudin, Naqiyah 2013 'Back at the first store after 35 years', The New Paper 27 July. p.6 Around the same time, other unions such as the Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation and Pioneer Industries Employees Union also set up co-operatives to run supermarkets. The two organisations later merged in the early 1980s to form the Singapore Employees Co-operative (SEC). In May 1983, due to competition, NTUC Welcome and SEC merged to form a larger co-operative which was known as NTUC FairPrice Co-Operative Limited. The company started a central-distribution system to change the way goods were delivered to stores, to enhance efficiency. This was owned by another company, but in 1998, FairPrice took full ownership of the warehouse and distribution company. It was renamed Grocery Logistics of Singapore (GLS). On 21 January 2003, FairPrice opened a new 13,000-square-metre Fresh Food Distribution Centre. The refrigerated-distribution facility centralises the distributions of fresh and chilled products to all the outlets in the chain. It is the first supermarket retailer in Singapore to build, own and operate its own fresh-food distribution centre.An Esso petrol station run by NTUC FairPrice. It is operated by the company with a FairPrice Xpress store, the station was the first to be converted to the new format. That same year, FairPrice tied up with oil company ExxonMobil to open FairPrice Xpress and Cheers convenience outlets at seven Esso and Mobil stations as a pilot project. The station will be run by NTUC FairPrice Co-operative, which sets the fuel prices and run the station's minimart. ExxonMobil will supply the fuel, and will sell its oil products inside the FairPrice-run stations. If this pilot project proves successful, all stations will be converted to either FairPrice Xpress or Cheers with the co-operative taking over the management of each station. ExxonMobil also announced that all the stations will be renamed \\"Esso\\" by year-end.FairPrice's largest branch in Singapore, the FairPrice Xtra hypermarket, at Ang Mo Kio Hub. On 28 December 2006, FairPrice opened its largest branch in Singapore, the 7,150-square metre (77,000 square feet) FairPrice Xtra hypermarket, at Ang Mo Kio Hub. The new S$12 million outlet offers a wider range of goods than the typical FairPrice supermarket, and includes new lines like electronic products and fashion wear.\\"FairPrice hypermarket opens its doors\\", The Business Times, 28 December 2006 In August 2007, FairPrice opened its upmarket outlet at Bukit Timah Plaza named FairPrice Finest, after five months of refurbishment. The move was to cater to the changing tastes of Singaporeans who are increasingly well-travelled. The 4,000 m¬≤ (43,100 ft¬≤), two-storey outlet has an offering of products different from other FairPrice stores, and also features a Swiss-style delicatessen, a wine cellar and a European bakery. FairPrice has plans to open more Finest outlets. FairPrice has attempted to expand into other countries. In 2003, it entered a joint venture with DBS Private Equity, New Hope Group, Silver Tie and Taiwan's Apex Group, known as Nextmall. The venture provided merchandising, management and logistics for a fee to Nextmart which is a China incorporated hypermarket. Seven hypermarkets were opened in China, with its first in Shaoxing, Zhejiang. Nextmall closed in 2005 after incurring a total of $80 million in debts and over $40 million in losses. A supermarket in Vietnam was opened in 2013 under a joint venture with Saigon Union of Trading Co-operatives, known as Co.opXtra Plus. FairPrice also operated Cheers convenience stores in Vietnam as of 2018. Retail formats *Cheers by FairPrice ‚Äì This 24-hour convenience store chain run by NTUC FairPrice was introduced in 1999. It offers similar facilities to rival 7-Eleven. Cheers can also be found at selected ExxonMobil stations around the island, in which NTUC FairPrice co-operative runs the station, instead of ExxonMobil itself. *FairPrice Shop ‚Äì FairPrice Shop is a one-stop heartland store similar to minimarts for everyday basic needs at great value. *FairPrice Xpress ‚Äì A concept which can be found only at ExxonMobil stations, it is larger than Cheers and sells things like fresh produce, meat and seafood. It also sells more products meeting daily needs than a Cheers convenience store. *FairPrice Finest ‚Äì This is a separate store offering up-market food supplies. It was officially opened in September 2007, and also it merged the former Liberty Market. Stores include Bedok Mall, Waterway Point, Century Square, Jurong Point and Seletar Mall. *FairPrice Xtra ‚Äì A hypermarket chain which combines a normal supermarket and the FairPrice Homemart in one store. It sells items such as electronics, clothing and household merchandise in addition to the regular supermarket items, and also it merged the former FairPrice Homemart, together with former Carrefour stuffs. Stores include AMK Hub, Jurong Point, UE BizHub East, Kallang Wave, Jem and Nex. *Warehouse Club - It is a concept that is modelled through Costco, and it is only available through membership. It has a lot of bulk purchases and also distributes former Carrefour stuff. It is also made in packs of even numbers. *Unity Pharmacy - Unity Pharmacy moderates the cost of healthcare in Singapore through quality products and services at affordable prices. Offering a wide range of health and wellness products, as well as pharmacist counselling services within the heartlands, similar to competitors such as Guardian and Watsons. Every year, FairPrice offers NTUC Union Members (NTUC cardholders) and FairPrice shareholders dividends, along with cash-back rebates for all purchases made at FairPrice supermarkets island-wide, including FairPrice Xtra, FairPrice Homemart, FairPrice Finest and FairPrice Xpress ‚Äì excluding Cheers outlets. Such payout rates are subject to approval at Annual General Meetings (typically in the month of August). In 2007, FairPrice declared rebates amounting to 4% of purchases of up to S$6,000 made in the last financial year, as well as a dividend of 5% and special dividend of 3%. NTUC Plus!

Cardholders (non-union) are entitled to 2 LinkPoints for every S$1 spent (for a minimum spending of S$20 in receipts issued on the same day) under the Plus! programme by NTUC Link. In collaboration with OCBC Bank, FairPrice launched its FairPrice Plus membership programme in April 2007, offering banking solutions and promotions at all FairPrice supermarkets islandwide for all supermarket customers. For a minimum transaction of S$10, VISA payment is now accepted at all FairPrice supermarkets for the FairPrice Plus Card and the NTUC Plus Card (previously known as the NTUC-OCBC Visa Card) for NTUC Union Members.

The palace, and its surrounding seven hectare park, is located on the lake Leopoldskroner Weiher. The palace has been home to Salzburg Global Seminar since 1947. In 2014, the palace and the neighboring Meierhof building were opened as a privately owned hotel, Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron.http://www.schloss-leopoldskron.com/en.html History Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg Count Leopold Anton Eleutherius von Firmian (1679-1744) commissioned the palace in 1736 on the shores of an existing pond after he had enriched himself in the process of expelling over 22,000 Protestants from Salzburg. He acquired the area between the palace and the Untersberg as a family estate, which he passed on in May 1744 to his nephew Count Laktanz Firmian, who used it to house his large collection of paintings. This included works of Titian, D√ºrer, Poussin, Rubens and Rembrandt. Archbishop Firmian of Salzburg gives Schloss Leopoldskron to his nephew Count Laktanz After the death of the Archbishop in 1744, his heart was buried in the chapel of the palace, while the rest of his body was placed in the cathedral of Salzburg. The palace was owned by the Firmian family until 1837, even after the death of Count Laktanz in 1786. George Zierer, the owner of a local shooting gallery, bought the palace and stripped it of most of the valuable interior decorations, including paintings, etchings, and sculptures. The palace had several owners during the 19th century (including a banker and two waiters who wanted to use it as a hotel, King Ludwig I. of Bavaria). In 1918 it was bought by Max Reinhardt, the noted theatre director and co-founder of the Salzburg Festival. By this time the palace was in urgent need of repair. With the work of local artisans, Reinhardt spent twenty years renovating the palace. Besides restoring the staircase, the Great Hall, and the Marble Hall, he created the Library, the Venetian Room, and a garden theatre. He used the whole building for his theatre productions (the audiences had to move from room to room). He also used it as a gathering place for writers, actors, composers, and designers from across the globe. Reinhardt escaped to the United States as actions increased against the Jews, hoping the Germans would be defeated in the war. He worked in Hollywood during World War II and died in New York in 1943, before the Allied victory. In 1939 the German government confiscated the palace as a national treasure during the taking of \\"Jewish property\\" throughout Austria. During the same year, Hermann G√∂ring assigned the palace to Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, an Austrian who had been spying for the Nazis in Britain and Europe and who had many influential contacts. She was charged with transforming it into a guest house for prominent artists of the Reich, and to serve as a reception facility to Hitler's Berghof home. Von Hohenlohe, who knew Reinhardt before the annexation of Austria, was able to secure from the Nazi's sixteen crates of Reinhardt's books, porcelain, silver, and furniture and had them shipped to California, though the consolation of his tangible possessions were little comfort against the loss of the Leopoldskron. Once it came to light that Stephanie von Hohenlohe may have been a double agent, she fled to England, then America, returning the palace to Nazi hands until the end of the war. By the end of the war, a bomb had exploded in the garden. It shattered the windows, destroyed a chandelier in the library on the ground floor, and sent shrapnel fragments into the wall murals in the Chinese room. It also damaged the stucco work in the south facade. Traces of the damage can still be seen today. After the war, the property was returned to the Reinhardt estate. In 1946 Helene Thimig, the widow of Max Reinhardt, offered use of the palace to Clemens Heller, who founded the Salzburg Seminar in American Studies, a \\"Marshall Plan of the Mind,\\" together with Scott Elledge and Richard Campbell, all Harvard graduate students. The Salzburg Seminar brought together young people from the countries that had been in conflict during World War 2 and originally offered education on American history, art, literature, and culture, in a period when United States armed forces occupied parts of Germany and Austria. This was later transformed into a \\"global forum\\". Since 1947, more than 500 sessions of the Seminars have been held on a wide variety of issues. In 1959 the Salzburg Global Seminar purchased the palace, and in 1973 the adjacent Meierhof, which was part of the original Firmian estate. They have made extensive renovations and restorations to enable the palace to be used as a conference center and venue for events other than the Salzburg Seminar. In early 2014, 50 rooms in the Meierhoft, the Meierhof Caf√©, and the reception area underwent a substantial two-month renovation. The renovation included 3 \\"The Sound of Music\\" themed rooms. In February 2014, the property reopened under its new name, Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron. Hotel Schloss Leopoldskron is a member of Castle Hotels & Mansions, Historic Hotels of Europe, and partner of Climate Alliance Austria, Europe's biggest climate-protection network. In 2015, the Historic Hotels of Europe awarded the Schloss the \\"Best Historic Hotel of Europe\\" award. In the same year, the Schloss achieved a Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor. In 2016, the Schloss placed second in the Historic Hotels of Europe's award for a \\"Best Historic Hotel with 'A Story to Tell'\\". Notable hotel guests have included, Prince Charles, Bill Gates, Kofi Annan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and many more. { Spiegelsaal  Library  Stucco ceiling  Schloss Leopoldskron in 1829 by Johann Michael Sattler (1786-1847) } The Sound of Music In 1964, the film The Sound of Music, directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews, was produced in Salzburg with the grounds adjacent to those of Schloss Leopoldskron as one of the main exterior locations. In fact, 10 outdoor scenes were filmed there portraying the von Trapp home. The interior palace was never used as the Von Trapp villa. Scenes were actually filmed on an adjacent property (known as Bertelsmann, at the time), including the family drinking pink lemonade (\\"not too sweet, not too sour, just too... pink!\\") on the terrace, Maria and the Captain arguing on the terrace and the children and Maria falling off the boat into the lake. Also, only shots showing the lake were filmed at Bertelsmann, using a replica of Leopoldskron's terrace and \\"horse-gates\\" that lead to the lake. Shots of the building itself were filmed at Schloss Frohnburg and the decor of the ballroom used for the interior scenes is identical to that in Leopoldskron's Venetian Room (the Venetian Room is much smaller than the ballroom). The setting for the two main love scenes, one between Liesl and Rolf (featuring the song Sixteen Going on Seventeen) and the other between Maria and the Captain (Something Good) was the glass gazebo originally situated in the gardens of the palace. The gazebo interiors were shot on a Hollywood sound stage and only long shots of the Austrian gazebo are seen in the film. The gazebo was later moved to the other side of the lake to allow tourists to visit it, but after their numbers became too big, it was again relocated, to the Hellbrunn Palace outside of the city. The 1987 special production of the \\"Sound of Christmas\\" starring Julie Andrews, John Denver, and Pl√°cido Domingo was also filmed at the Schloss Leopoldskron.

He is known for his longtime friendship with Friedrich Nietzsche, who gave him the pseudonym Peter Gast.  Life  K√∂selitz was born in Annaberg, Saxony to Gustav Hermann K√∂selitz (1822‚Äì1910), the vice mayor (Vizeb√ºrgermeister), and his wife Caroline (1819‚Äì1900), a native of Vienna. His younger brother was the painter Rudolf K√∂selitz. From 1872, K√∂selitz studied music with Ernst Friedrich Richter at the University of Leipzig. He transferred in 1875 to the University of Basel, where he attended the lectures of Jacob Burckhardt, Franz Overbeck, and Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1877, K√∂selitz sharply criticized the Basel music instructor Selmar Bagge in a newspaper article, which led to a minor scandal. In Basel, a friendship developed between K√∂selitz and Nietzsche. K√∂selitz read for Nietzsche during the latter's intermittent spells of near blindness, and also took dictation. K√∂selitz was instrumental in the preparation of all of Nietzsche's works after 1876, reviewing the printer's manuscript and sometimes intervening to finalize the text formatting. Nietzsche's break with Wagner and his search for a 'southern' aesthetic with which he could immunize himself from the gloomy German north led him to over-appreciate K√∂selitz as a musician: 'I should not know how to get along without Rossini; even less, without my own south in music, the music of my Venetian ma√´stro Pietro Gast.Nietzsche, Friedrich, Ecce Homo, tr. W. Kaufmann, p. 251 As an amanuensis, however, K√∂selitz really was invaluable; writing apropos Human, All Too Human, Nietzsche claimed that Gast 'wrote and also corrected: fundamentally, he was really the writer whereas I was merely the author'.Nietzsche, Friedrich, Ecce Homo, tr. W. Kaufmann, p. 288 All the while, K√∂selitz worshipped his teacher, assisting him to the point of self-denial. K√∂selitz would \\"correct\\" Nietzsche's writings even after the philosopher's breakdown and did so without his approval - something heavily criticized by today's Nietzsche scholarship. In the spring of 1881, while staying together in Recoaro, Nietzsche created the pseudonym 'Peter Gast' for K√∂selitz. This was the name he was known by among the Nietzsche circle, as well as being the name under which he published all his operas. The name itself is possibly a reference to Mozart's opera Don Giovanni, with its stone guest (Petrus \\"stone\\" in Latin, Gast \\"guest\\" in German). Peter Gast's most ambitious musical work is the comic opera in three acts The Lion of Venice (Der L√∂we von Venedig). Throughout the 1880s, Gast and Nietzsche attempted without success to bring it to performance. It premiered in February 1891 in Danzig under the direction of Carl Fuchs, who exchanged letters with Nietzsche, but under its original title The Secret Wedding (Die heimliche Ehe or Il matrimonio segreto). In the 1930s, it would be shown once again under the title Nietzsche suggested, The Lion of Venice. From 1899 to 1909, K√∂selitz worked in Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche's \\"Nietzsche-Archiv\\" in Weimar. There, he was partly responsible for the selective and misleading editions of Nietzsche's work, most prominently, the so-called The Will to Power. Also, as Mazzino Montinari has pointed out, he consciously lied in his articles defending the \\"Archiv\\" against criticism. In 1909, K√∂selitz left the Archiv and never again spoke publicly about it. In private letters, he condemned Nietzsche's sister, as he had done prior to his working for her. K√∂selitz was financed by his father, and also intermittently supported by Nietzsche's friend Paul R√©e. In addition to being a musician and the editor of Nietzsche's writings and letters, he worked as a writer under various pseudonyms, including: Ludwig M√ºrner, Peter Schlemihl, Petrus Eremitus. He sent articles to many newspapers, and also wrote several short stories and fables.  Notes   References  * Friedrich G√∂tz. Peter Gast ‚Äì der Mensch, der K√ºnstler, der Gelehrte.

Founded by Marett's older colleague, Edward Burnett Tylor, it asserted that modern primitive societies provide evidence for phases in the evolution of culture, which it attempted to recapture via comparative and historical methods. Marett focused primarily on the anthropology of religion. Studying the evolutionary origin of religions, he modified Tylor's animistic theory to include the concept of mana. Marett's anthropological teaching and writing career at Oxford University spanned the early 20th century before World War Two. He trained many notable anthropologists. He was a colleague of John Myres, and through him, studied Aegean archaeology.  Family background  Marett was the only son of Sir Robert Pipon Marett and Julia Anne Marett. He was born in Saint Br√©lade. He belonged to a family, originally named Maret, that settled on Jersey from Normandy in the 13th century. The Saint Br√©lade branch built a manor house for themselves, La Haule Manor (today a hotel).Marett births on Jersey were mostly at the same place, La Haule, in the village of Saint Aubin, Jersey, part of the parish of Saint Br√©lade. St. Aubin is on the southwest side, on the west of St. Aubin‚Äôs Bay. Eastward along the beach, is a projection, La Haule Slip, which originally joined the estate. The coastal road, originally running around the north side of the estate, has been made to run between the estate and the beach. The location is informally called ‚Äò‚Äôblanc pignon‚Äô‚Äô, ‚ÄúWhite Gable,‚Äù from the sailing directions for entering the port of St. Aubin, a fishing village. The bay is shallow. The fishermen were to take a bearing on the ‚Äúwhite house‚Äù located on what became ‚Äúupper blanc pignon‚Äù on the slopes. La Haule is in ‚ÄúLower Blanc Pignon,‚Äù of interest mainly for the meteorological station there. The location of the original white house is obscure; the directions indicate there was more than one. La Haule also is said to be ‚Äúthe village of La Haule,‚Äù but if there ever was such a village in Jersey (there are some in France), perhaps before the manor, it has been lost. They had substantial wealth and position, contributing high-level magistrates to the government of Jersey. Robert's father had been Bailiff of Jersey. He was one of the founders of La Patrie, a patriotic newspaper. Earlier, Philip Maret, third son of the second Seigneur of La Haule, born in 1701, had emigrated to Boston, where he became a merchant captain. His subsequent family participated in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. Robert's mother, Julia Anne, also bore the name of Marett before marriage. She was one of the eight children of the Janvrin sisters, Esther Elizabeth and Maria Eliza, by one Philip Marett, who was not in Robert Pipon's immediate line. Philip was a name often used by the Maretts. Thus, Julia Anne was only a distant cousin of her husband. The house, however, came into Robert Ranulph's possession through his mother. Her mother was Maria Eliza Janvrin. She and Robert Pipon had four children, Robert Ranulph, Mabel Elizabeth, Philippa Laetitia, and Julia Mary. Robert Ranulph was an only son but had three sisters and a large number of cousins. The family was Anglican. Cyril Norwood said of him, in a review of his autobiography in 1941: > Born of good family, reaching back through many generations of service in > Jersey, he was brought up in a good home with wise and cultured parents in a > beautiful place set fair in the freedom of sky and sea. Nature in her > kindness endowed him with good brains, good memory, lively imagination, and > abounding physical vigour.  Education   Primary and secondary education  St. Aubin in 1890. The railway is visible just above the beach. La Haule Slip is the first one, just before the clearing. Beach from St. Aubin's Bay. La Haule is the large building on the left. For his initial educational years, the young Robert was taught in a Dame school of the area.The term went out of use in the United States in the 20th century, being replaced by day care. He was then placed in St. Aubin's School, a private grammar school founded in Maison Martel. This was the former home of the Martel family, merchants, in Saint Aubin, Jersey, which was not far from La Haule Manor. It had been founded in 1813 by Esther Brine and her husband, Philip le Maistre, a schoolteacher. The Brines had purchased the mansion from the Martels. In 1867, they reported a student population of about 50 boys, half of whom were boarders. For the wealthy in Jersey, this school was the only path to secondary school.Parish schools were of poor quality, and the Elementary Education Act 1870 in Britain, appropriating and funding them for public education, was not to be realised on Jersey for many years. The current roster of primary schools is entirely later 20th century. St. Aubin's had an international reputation. Robert attended between ages nine through 14, 1875‚Äì1880. On the death of Le Maistre in 1873, the new headmaster and owner was John Este Vibert, who had a military frame of mind. Many future military officers came from St. Aubin's. Vibert was also a scientist and a member of the Royal Meteorological Society. He manned a weather station in the building. The school and the station came to an end with his early death in 1886. The house was sold, to become later the Hotel La Tour, renamed from a modification that added a mediaeval tower. Since 2013, its destruction has been planned to make way for luxury housing. Marett went on to secondary school at Victoria College, Jersey. It was founded in 1850 on the recommendation of Queen Victoria. Marett was there from the age of 14 to 18, 1880‚Äì1884. He commuted daily by the train line which existed for several decades across the south of the island.With the advent of the automobile, the train fell into disuse. The Germans restored it during World War II. Today most of the rail-bed is a pedestrian path, while there are no traces of the stations. In secondary school, and then in university, Marett was gregarious, popular, and athletic. Later, he spent his time golfing and shooting. For fun, he loved to party and prank as he had a sense of humor. He joined the Jersey Militia, which was a social club, and he was made a lieutenant at age 17. He also read avidly in La Haule's extensive library. He took a great interest in natural history. After finishing school in 1884, he planned to start at Balliol College, Oxford University in autumn, but his father's lingering illness delayed him. His father died on November 10th. According to the British law of primogeniture, he inherited the entire estate, but for the time being, he was not interested. There were no practical changes in the management of the estate. His mother and three sisters continued living in the home. However, his mother died in 1901, and the three sisters never married. They were still in the house, all over 70, when the Germans occupied it in 1940. Leaving for Oxford, Robert never returned on a permanent basis. His own family did eventually move there, but for him, it was only a part-time home which he occupied mainly in the summer. It was an ideal summer home as it was sparsely populated, located on the shore, spacious, luxurious, but without such amenities as electricity.  College education  Oxford University Though well-to-do, Marett applied for financial assistance, the award of which was based on excellence and typically demonstrated in an examination. In British English, he won an \\"exhibition\\" from the Council of Legal Education (today's Inns of Court School of Law). In this case, this was a modest financial award for the study of law. The award made him an ‚Äúexhibitioner.‚ÄùAmerican English does not have the word. There were no exhibitions of any sort as Americans understand them. Etymologically the word means ‚Äúshowing.‚Äù He had to join the Inner Temple, one of the four groups of a professional association of barristers called the Inns of Court. It was (and is) primarily an educational institution qualifying lawyers to argue at the bar; that is, professionally in court. There was an overlap with Marett's interest: Roman Law. Marett majored in classics, the study of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Anthropology as an academic subject did not exist at the time; in fact, Marett was to be one of its first professors, the first at Oxford. As required by membership in the Inner Temple, he had finally to pass a ‚Äúbar examination‚Äù in Roman Law, which he did in 1891. This success did not qualify him in any way to practice law. He was never a lawyer, and he was never interested in the government of Jersey, as his father had been.The results of the Bar Exam are given in Many of the cursory sources in American English, confused by the language, draw the wrong conclusions. Marett did not major in law at Oxford. He was never qualified to argue at any bar, let alone the bar in Jersey. Although Jersey‚Äôs government consisted mainly of barristers working in London, Marett had no interest in being one of them. By an accident of culture, the Council of Legal Education was willing to support the history of law, Roman in this case. Proof of excellence was expressed as ‚Äúa bar exam.‚Äù Marett received notice of his grant in November. It was too late to begin in autumn. He, therefore, petitioned to begin with the Hilary term. He had enrolled in a classics curriculum called Literae Humaniores (Lit. Hum.). It is divided into two sequential parts, Honour Moderations, or ‚ÄúMods,‚Äù a study of the Ancient Greek and Latin languages. He then enrolled in courses selected from a variety of classical topics, with the requirement that eight papers be written. This part is called ‚ÄúGreats.‚ÄùClassics in British English is verbally and conceptually different from the American version. There is a certain commonality of subject material, but ideas about what should be included vary somewhat. Marett was finished with his Mods by 1886, with a First. Going on to the Greats, he won the Chancellor's Prize for Latin verse in 1887, which was a modest sum contingent on submission of some New Latin verse composed by the recipient. He had nearly completed the Greats by 1888, concentrating on philosophy. British degrees at the time were designed for three years.American English sources are apt to describe Marett‚Äôs progress as though he had a double major, or earned two degrees. There are many differences in the educational system, but the British division into the two levels is based on the fact that some mastery of Greek and Latin is a prerequisite for reading authors who wrote in Greek and Latin. There was one major, one degree, and both levels were required to obtain it. However, this specific curriculum was designed for four years. He still had more work to do when, in early 1889, he was struck by meningitis walking home from class. Knowing he was in a possibly life-threatening condition, he intruded on the first doctor's office he saw, and he was lucky enough to be diagnosed immediately by an experienced physician. He was then unable to attend Oxford for the rest of the term. When he had recovered sufficiently, he was sent to Switzerland for final treatment. In July he was granted the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA) in absentia with a First anyway, but he still needed to pass the Bar in Roman Law. In Switzerland, he had the best of academic intentions. He was learning French and German. He enrolled at the University of Berlin in philosophy, which he studied for a year. However, being a young man of wealth whose father had been known internationally, he had an informal access to the upper echelons of society. He associated with Junkers and had lunch with the Kaiser. Among the Americans abroad, he met Buffalo Bill. His planned educational experiences were rapidly developing into a Grand Tour. At the end of the year (1890), he refused to go home. Touring on to Rome, he fell in with the society of Lord and Lady Dufferin, inveterate party-goers. Socialising was their stock-in- trade. Lord Dufferin was then the British ambassador to Italy. The 24-year-old Marett was dazzled, and he described the year as ‚Äúrapturous‚Äù. He toured Italy, Greece, and France in the company of notables, making friendships that would last a lifetime. Finally, the time came to go home, but in 1890 he still had the Bar Exam to take. He found some tutoring work at Ballio, and became a secretary to Toynbee Hall while he was studying for the exam that he eventually passed.Toynbee Hall was a charitable institution in the East End of London dedicated to supplying services to the poor and ideologically reforming society in the direction of removing barriers between rich and poor. In college, Marret was a liberal. He belonged to the Russell Club, an organization of obscure origin supporting liberalism in Britain. That meant support of the Liberal Party (UK) under William Gladstone, who was generally for social reform and against the empire. At Oxford, the club later merged with another to form the Oxford University Liberal Democrats. When the results were announced in early 1891, he was free to begin his professional career. He was awarded the Master of Arts (M.A.) later that year without additional work or examination, as is the custom at Oxford.A British custom, now rare, practised by some universities. The degree was awarded automatically to B.A. holders who had some further association with, or ‚Äîmore commonly‚Äî donated to, the university. The prevailing sentiment today is that the M.A. should be a degree earned by study and examination. Proposed legislation to that effect failed of being passed, and the practice remains extant today at both Oxford and Cambridge with graduates receiving a written invitation to pay a fee to receive the M.A. approximately one year after graduating.  Career   Philosophy  Marett's first professional position was in philosophy as a Fellow at Exeter College, starting in the fall of 1891. Depending on the definitions of the institution, ‚ÄúFellow‚Äù in the British system has a broad range of meanings ranging from graduate student to a senior research associate. In Marett's time at Oxford, fellow meant in essence a member of the faculty with the same basic privileges as any. Today it is necessary to ask exactly what Marett did to be paid as a fellow. Exeter College, which was a small one in population, was undoubtedly being governed by the statutes of 1882. It provided for a Governing Body consisting of a Rector and two types of Fellows: Ordinary and Tutorial. Some in addition had special duties, such as the Bursar. Hiring was by vote of the Governing Body. There is a brief memo in the ‚Äò‚ÄôRegister for Exeter College‚Äô‚Äô for 1890 that he was a ‚ÄúTutorial fellow Ex. Coll.,‚Äù presumably ‚ÄúExeter College.‚Äù He was a tutor of philosophy in the Oxford Tutorial System. He met with students regularly, individually or in small groups, to suggest reading for them and check their previous readings. Americans have never had this system.Drawing the wrong conclusions from British English, some commentators postulate a fellowship in 1891 followed by some sort of tutorship in 1893. The evidence is that Marett was never in the ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù position, but started as a Tutor. As to how he may have obtained the position, he says in his autobiography that all he asks of the historian is that he be classified as ‚Äúeven the least of ‚ÄòJowett‚Äôs men,' referring to the long-standing Master of Balliol College. He was referred to as the influential philosopher, classicist and Gladstonian partisan, named Benjamin Jowett. The aforesaid men dotted the Houses of Parliament and British society in general like stars in the sky, all promoting British liberalism. A word or two from Jowett might easily have influenced the Governing Body. However, he got the position, and Marett resolved to set himself on the path to success. He applied for the T.H. Green Moral Philosophy Prize in 1893, a monetary award offered once every three years by Balliol College for the best paper on moral philosophy.The prize was created under a bequest of Thomas Hill Green, White‚Äôs Professor of Moral Philosophy at Balliol. He died in 1882. It was Green who created the fund in his will, not his wife in memoriam, as some assert. The candidates must submit and be examined on a paper on moral philosophy. The M.A. was a prerequisite; that is, the candidate must be associated with Oxford. Although some notable persons won the prize initially, it fell into disuse and became a source of financial aid for graduate students. Ultimately so few applied that the university turned it into a scholarship fund Marett won it with The Ethics of Savage Races, which was never published. However. Edward Burnett Tylor,founder of Cultural Anthropology, was on his examining committee for the paper. The relationship between the two men continued. Jones speculates that Tylor already had Alzheimer's disease, but Tylor was only 34. He did not die until 1917, some 24 years later. Such a view reduces the entire relationship, which began in 1893, to an intellectual caretaker capacity on the part of the younger man, apparently unnoticed by anyone else, an unlikely view. Marett claimed in his autobiography that Tylor‚Äôs memory was already troubling him: Merely not being as skillful at 34 as you were at 24 does not imply Alzheimer‚Äôs. A critic of Tylor, Marett may have been over-competitive. Marett now had demonstrated the ability to think creatively. He obviously had a career in philosophy and religion ahead of him and was made sub-rector.A second-in-command-to the rector, who was in charge of the school. The terminology for the heads of colleges varied somewhat according to tradition. Jowett was the Master of Balliol, but Exeter had a Rector. There was only one sub-rector at a time, but he might change, and the sub-rector did not necessarily lead to Rector. Rectorships were originally for life. Jowett died that year, but Tylor‚Äôs opinion would have been crucial.  Anthropology  He succeeded E.B. Tylor as Reader in Anthropology at Oxford in 1910, teaching the Diploma in Anthropology at the Pitt Rivers Museum. He worked on the palaeolithic site of La Cotte de St Brelade from 1910‚Äì1914, recovering some hominid teeth and other remains of habitation by Neanderthal man. In 1914 he established a Department of Social Anthropology, and in 1916 he published \\"The Site, Fauna, and Industry of La Cotte de St. Brelade, Jersey\\" (Archaeologia LXVII, 1916). He became Rector of Exeter College, Oxford. His students included Maria Czaplicka, Marius Barbeau, Dorothy Garrod, Earnest Albert Hooten, Henry FieldField 1952. p. 35 and Rosalind Moss  Phases of religion  E.B. Tylor had considered animism to be the earliest form of religion, but he had not had access to Robert Codrington's linguistic data on the concept of mana in Melanesia. Codrington wrote after Tylor. Consideration of mana led Marett to retheorize Tylor's history of religion, adding an initial phase, pre-animistic religion, called pre-animism by others. A new common thread must be found to unite the three phases. Marett suggested the supernatural, or \\"power of awfulness\\" (in the original sense of the word). Marett's analysis of the history of religion was presented in The Threshold of Religion (1909) and was refined in Anthropology (1912), and Psychology and Folklore (1920).

In 1896 he was already 30. Personal biology was on his mind. A new women's college had entered the Oxford system, Somerville College. It was of great interest to the unmarried dons of Oxford, such as R. R. Marett. He managed to meet one of its students, the youngest daughter, Nora, of the British explorer of Africa and subsequent Vice Consul to Zanzibar, John Kirk (1832‚Äì1922). A Scottish physician, he had been with David Livingstone when Henry Morton Stanley asked, or at least is said to have asked, \\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\\" Livingstone and Kirk were both dedicated to the suppression of the slave trade in Africa, a cause championed by British liberals. It presented a political paradox. Slavery could only be stopped by military opposition to the slavers. If British forces did intervene, the government was accused of building a colonial empire. This contradiction brought down the second premiership of William Gladstone in 1885, when he did not go to the assistance of Charles George Gordon at Khartoum. The latter was attempting to defend the city against Muhammad Ahmad, slaver, and new Islamic messiah. Gordon was killed. The tide turned in Britain in favor of the empire. After the Battle of Omdurman, 1896, the region was brought into the empire as the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Earlier Kirk had come home from Africa to recover from exhaustion. He accepted a medical position in Zanzibar in 1868. That same year the government offered him the post of Vice-Consul there. On the strength of his new income and importance, he married his fianc√©e, Helen Cooke (1843‚Äì1914), and together they had a son and five daughters, one of which was Nora (1873‚Äì1954). A liberated woman for the times, she attended the new college that would bring women to Oxford, where she met Marett. Alike in political views and sentiments, they loved each other dearly, but Marett's contract with Oxford stipulated that he must not marry for a certain number of years. Those were up in 1898. He was 32, she 25. In the first decade of the 20th century, they had four children: John Ranulph (1900‚Äì1940), Philippa Suzanne (1904‚Äì1991), Joya Elizabeth (1905‚Äì1979), and Robert Hugh Kirk (1907‚Äì1981).

The station opened in 1921 and is located on the Nowa Wie≈õ Wielka‚ÄìGdynia Port railway, Gda≈Ñsk‚ÄìStargard railway and the parallel Gda≈Ñsk ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie‚ÄìRumia railway. Trains are operated by PKP, Przewozy Regionalne and SKM Tricity. History The first railway station in the centre of Gdynia opened on 1 January 1894. Initially, it held only a small wooden waiting room, several lamps and a board identifying name of the stop. In 1920, Gdynia began to grow very quickly as a city and a port under the Second Polish Republic, and this resulted in a significant increase in passenger rail traffic. Therefore, between 1923-1926, a new imposing art-deco (with regional Pomeranian accents) main building was constructed, designed by Romuald Miller and opening on 15 July 1926. Its interior featured a large waiting room, ticket windows, toilets, luggage storage, a restaurant, bookstore, money exchange, and hairdresser. The railway station building was destroyed in World War II. In the 1950s a new station was built, designed by prof. Waclaw Tomaszewski. The building is a unique combination of social realism and pre- war art-moderne modernism. In the station's main waiting room several notable wall and ceiling frescoes of sea landscapes were re-discovered during the 2008 renovation after having been covered over in the intervening years. In the dining hall, the wall paintings depict the celestial bodies and signs of the zodiac, and a mosaic illustrates Pegasus. The station under Nazi German occupation was known as Gotenhafen. Until 11 March 2004, the station was officially called Gdynia Osobowa. Currently, all the markings changed to \\"Gdynia Glowna\\". Among others, a large inscription \\"Osobowa\\" on the station building was dismantled. Modernisation In August 2008, the station building was entered in the register of monuments. In the same year, a modernisation program of the station was initiated, which included reconstruction of the station concourse, new canopies on the platforms, and changes in the rail traffic control system. During this work, in 2011, an original 5-meter long brick wall from the 1926 station was discovered. It has been preserved and integrated into the newly renovated interior. On 6 June 2012 the modernised station was officially opened. The investment cost 40.7 million euro and was financed in part with EU funds.

It is situated on the northern edge of the Palatinate forest, approx. 10 km north-east of Kaiserslautern. Enkenbach- Alsenborn is also the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\"), also named Enkenbach-Alsenborn. Geography The municipality consists of the local villages of Enkenbach and Alsenborn. Before officially combining on 7 June 1969, the two villages worked very closely throughout their history to include a common coat of arms until 1795, a common mayor until 1825 and a common forest area until 1832. Neighbouring municipalities are - in a clockwise direction - Neuhemsbach, Sippersfeld, Kerzenheim, Ramsen (Pfalz), Wattenheim, Fischbach (Kaiserslautern district), Kaiserslautern and Mehlingen. History Findings from the young stone age and mounds from the Iron Age indicate that the area was already populated in early-historical time. Expansion With favorable traffic levels and the connection to the railway in the year 1871 with the opening of Enkenbach station on the Alsenz Valley Railway, as well as the establishment of industry in the Kaiserslautern area, led to the total population of the municipality increasing despite strong emigration out of present-day Germany. Due to this population increase, Enkenbach-Alsenborn evolved from a farming community to the municipality it is today.

She was the second wife of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. Life After her father and eldest brother were murdered by √ñz Beg Khan in 1339, Uliana was placed in care of Simeon of Moscow, who married Uliana's elder sister Maria in 1347. In 1349, Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, sent an embassy to the Golden Horde, proposing to khan Jani Beg to form an alliance against Prince Simeon of Moscow; this proposal was not accepted and the envoys, including Algirdas' brother Karijotas, were imprisoned and held for ransom. In 1350, Algirdas then concluded peace with Simeon and married Simeon's sister-in-law Uliana. Simeon first asked an opinion of Metropolitan Theognostus whether a Christian lady could be married off to a pagan ruler. The same year, Algirdas' brother Liubartas married Olga, daughter of Konstantin Vasilyevich of Rostov and niece of Simeon. According to research of Polish historian Jan Tƒôgowski, Uliana and Algirdas had eight sons and eight daughters (though other sources provide different data). It seems that the children, unlike children from Algirdas' first marriage with Maria of Vitebsk, were brought up in pagan culture. Uliana's son Jogaila (and not Algirdas' eldest son Andrei of Polotsk) inherited the throne and became Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1377. Uliana, as dowager grand duchess, appeared in national politics and was involved in the Lithuanian Civil War (1381‚Äì84) as well as an unsuccessful attempt to wed Jogaila with Sophia, daughter of Dmitri Donskoi, and convert him to Eastern Orthodoxy. The plans failed when Jogaila converted to Roman Catholicism, married Jadwiga of Poland, and was crowned King of Poland (jure uxoris) in 1386. Death and burial There are conflicting claims about Uliana's last years and her burial place. One account claims that Uliana became a nun under the name Marina in the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Vitebsk and was buried there. Another claim, based on a silver plaque discovered during an 1810 construction, has it that she was buried in the Cathedral of the Theotokos in Vilnius. The Nikon Chronicle recorded that she was an nun at the Kiev Pechersk Lavra and was buried there. The newest discovery was made during a restoration of the Transfiguration Church in Polotsk in March 2012. An inscription was found that recorded Uliana's death on the feast of Saint Alexius, which is March 17 in Eastern Orthodoxy. On December 5, 2018, Uliana of Tver was canonized by the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church.

So I went into the city a lot, and I saw a lot of music,\\" Barbero recalled. \\"I liked music that was probably not as acceptable to a lot of ears as it was to mine. In high school, I loved David Bowie and I loved Queen. I remember going to the city and seeing a lot of punk stuff, [like] the Tubes and Patti Smith, and the New York Dolls. I was pretty lucky because it was just part of my life.\\" After high school, Barbero moved to Key West, Florida before returning to Minneapolis, where she attended the University of Minnesota before dropping out and working as a waitress.

Rowntree developed the Kit Kat (introduced in 1935), Aero (introduced in 1935), Fruit Pastilles (introduced in 1881), Smarties (introduced in 1937) brands, and the Rolo and Quality Street brands when it merged with Mackintosh's in 1969 to form Rowntree Mackintosh Confectionery. Rowntree's also launched After Eight thin mint chocolates in 1962. The Yorkie and Lion bars were introduced in 1976. Founded in 1862, the company developed strong associations with Quaker philanthropy. Throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries, it was one of the big three confectionery manufacturers in the United Kingdom, alongside Cadbury and Fry.Richardson, Tim (2002). \\"Sweets: A History of Temptation\\". p. 255. Bantam Press In 1981, it received the Queen's Award for Enterprise for outstanding contribution to international trade. In 1988, when the company was acquired by Nestl√©, it was the fourth-largest confectionery manufacturer in the world. The Rowntree brand continues to be used to market Nestl√©'s jelly sweet brands, such as Fruit Pastilles and Fruit Gums. History Victorian era In 1862, Rowntree's was founded at Castlegate, in York, by Henry Isaac Rowntree, a Quaker, as the company manager bought out the Tuke family. In 1864, Rowntree acquired an old iron foundry at Tanners Moat for ¬£1,000, and moved production there. In 1869, the factory was staffed by 12 men. By 1869, Rowntree was in financial difficulties and his brother, Joseph Rowntree, joined him in full partnership, and H.I. Rowntree & Co was formally established. In 1881, Rowntree introduced Fruit Pastilles, competing against French imports of the time, and the product proved to be a great success, accounting for about 25% of the company's tonnage by 1887. This success allowed the company to invest in a Van Houten press, which enabled it to produce chocolate with the cocoa butter removed, to compete with Cadbury's successful Cocoa Essence. In the 1890s, Rowntree transformed from a small family business into a large-scale manufacturer, as sales more than quadrupled due to an increased demand among the public for confectionery. In 1889, Seebohm Rowntree established a small research and testing laboratory for analysing ingredients and rival company products. In 1890, to cater for this increased demand, Rowntree acquired a 20-acre site at Haxby Road on the outskirts of York. The Tanners Moat site had become too small for Rowntree's needs, and the company had noted the success of Cadbury's purpose-built factory in Bournville. In 1893, the company introduced Rowntree's Fruit Gums. By 1897, the unlimited partnership needed external funding for its expansion, and became a public limited liability company called Rowntree & Co. Robert Fitzgerald has accused the company of being slow in new product development and marketing compared to its major competitor of the period, Cadbury. Fitzgerald suggests that Joseph Rowntree imitated the successes of competitors, (Cadbury's Cocoa Essence, French fruit pastilles) and that under his leadership, the company did not introduce any innovations of its own. Around 1898, the company acquired its own cocoa plantations in the West Indies. In 1899, Rowntree introduced its first milk chocolate block. 1900 to 1945 Rowntree's Cocoa tin manufactured between 1914 and 1918 Rowntree had struggled to make a milk chocolate product of comparable quality or value to Cadbury's Dairy Milk. Joseph Rowntree even described the growing market for milk chocolate as a fad. Rowntree's poor performance in the category became a major problem from 1914 onwards, as British public preference continued to move towards milk chocolate, and away from the more bitter cocoa essence products. Rowntree's two major rivals, Cadbury and Fry, merged in 1918, and although Rowntree was invited to partake in the merger, the company declined to do so. Meanwhile, the Rowntree board was torn as to whether it should become a low-turnover, high-quality product company or a mass producer of cheaper lines. Seebohm Rowntree inherited a struggling company when he succeeded his father as chairman in 1923. By 1930, as a result of all its problems, Rowntree was approaching bankruptcy. In 1926, Cowan Company of Toronto Limited (founded in 1890 as Cowan Cocoa and Chocolate), in Toronto, Canada, was acquired for $1 million. From 1931, Rowntree of Canada began to manufacture Mackintosh toffees under licence. In 1927, the company began to market its fruit gums, and its pastilles from 1928, in the now familiar tube packaging. George Harris was appointed marketing manager for chocolate bars in January 1931. Harris had learned the latest marketing techniques while he was in the United States. According to Robert Fitzgerald, \\"It was Harris's drive and insight which inspired his firm's renaissance in the 1930s.\\" In 1932, Rowntree appointed a new advertising agency, the London branch of J. Walter Thompson. Thompson undertook extensive market research to discover what consumers wanted. As a result of this research, the Black Magic assorted chocolate box was launched in 1934. In January 1935, Rowntree decided to abandon its attempt to compete with Cadbury Dairy Milk. In May 1935, Rowntree launched the Aero, an aerated milk chocolate. The Chocolate Crisp, a wafer- and-chocolate bar later known as the Kit Kat, was also launched in 1935. In 1937, the Dairy Box of assorted chocolates was launched, using the market research that had been undertaken for Black Magic. Chocolate beans were first sold loose in 1938, but were later packaged in a cardboard tube and branded as Smarties. Polo, the distinctive mint with a hole in the centre, was developed in 1939, but its introduction was delayed by the onset of war. Harris was made company chairman in 1941. 1945 to 1988 Exhibit of British foods during World War II, including Rowntree's Kit Kat and Fruit Pastilles. The Kit Kat adopted its familiar red packaging after the war. Rowntree entered the continental Europe market in the 1960s, establishing production facilities in Hamburg, Dijon, Elst, and Noisiel. After Eight thin mint chocolates were launched in 1962. In 1969, the Rowntree board rejected a ¬£37 million takeover bid from General Foods. In 1969, Rowntree entered into a long-term agreement with Hershey whereby Hershey would produce Rowntree products under license in the US. Rowntree merged with John Mackintosh and Co in 1969, to become Rowntree Mackintosh. Mackintosh produced Rolo, Munchies, Caramac, and Quality Street. Hershey's began U.S. distribution of Kit Kat in 1970 and followed in 1971 with Rolo. In 1971, Rowntree Mackintosh acquired Menier Chocolate of France. In the same year, the board attempted to diversify the business, and made a bid for Bovril, but lost out to James Goldsmith's Cavenham Foods. In 1972, Hoadley's Chocolates of Australia was acquired by Rowntree's. This company had invented such products as the Violet Crumble and Polly Waffle. A view of the Nestle production facility in York, England in 2009 The Yorkie and Lion chocolate bars were introduced in 1976. In 1978, the Hershey contract was renegotiated, giving Hershey the rights to the Kit Kat and Rolo brands in the US in perpetuity. Kenneth Dixon was appointed as chairman and chief executive in 1981. Between 1981 and 1987, Rowntree invested nearly ¬£400 million in upgrading its manufacturing facilities and developing high-volume, product- dedicated equipment for several of the company's leading global brands, including Kit Kat, After Eights, and Smarties. Between 1983 and 1987, Rowntree spent nearly ¬£400 million on acquisitions, including Tom's Foods for ¬£138 million (1983), Laura Secord Chocolates for ¬£19 million (1983), Hot Sam Pretzels for ¬£14 million (1986), the Sunmark confectionery business in the US for ¬£156 million (1986), and Gale's honey for ¬£11 million (1986). Between 1982 and 1987, the number of UK staff was reduced from 19,700 to 15,600. In 1987, Rowntree operated 25 factories in nine countries and employed 33,000 people, including close to 16,000 in its eight UK operations. Group turnover was ¬£1.4 billion, with the UK and Ireland accounting for 40% of the total. Takeover by Nestl√© On 13 April 1988, the Swiss confectioner Jacobs Suchard began a dawn raid on Rowntree's shares, which had been under-performing the market, although they were beginning to improve, taking a 14.9% stake in the company by 9:15 am. As a result, the managing director of Nestl√©, Helmut Maucher, contacted Kenneth Dixon, the chairman of Rowntree, offering to act as a white knight. Nestl√© was the largest food company in the world, and had been interested in Rowntree previously, but the Rowntree board would aggressively contest any attempted takeover, and Nestl√© had never undertaken a hostile takeover before. However, Nestl√© was worried about the potential of Rowntree falling into the hands of one of its major competitors. Rowntree was the fourth-largest chocolate manufacturer in the world, after Mars, Hershey, and Cadbury, with a 7% global market share. Nestl√© eventually won control with an offer valuing Rowntree at ¬£2.55 billion. Strategically, Nestl√© had always seen Rowntree as a perfect fit for its own operations. Nestl√© had strength in the block chocolate bar business, and Rowntree had strength in the countline branded chocolate business. Rowntree's strong global brands were the key reason for Nestl√©'s interest. Due to potential synergies between the two companies, Nestl√© believed that savings between 5 and 15% of Rowntree's operating costs could be made if the companies were to combine. The takeover was controversial, as Nestl√© was effectively protected from similar takeover attempts under Swiss law. After the Nestl√© takeover, the Rowntree chocolate ranges began to use the branding \\"Nestl√© Rowntree\\", before eventually the Rowntree name was dropped from the packaging altogether, except on Rowntree's Cocoa and the Fruit Pastilles and Fruit Gums lines. The Mackintosh branding was dropped from all former Rowntree Mackintosh products except for Mackintosh's Toffee.Here's looking at chew The Grocer, 31 May 1997 Between 1988 and 1994, the Nestl√© Rowntree workforce was reduced by 2,000. The Nestl√© Rowntree factory in Norwich closed in 1994, and Rolo, Yorkie, and Easter-egg production was moved to York. In September 2006, it was announced that the manufacture of Smarties would be relocated to Hamburg, resulting in 645 job losses at the York factory. Production of Dairy Box was relocated to Spain, and Black Magic to the Czech Republic. In May 2009, Nestl√© launched a new jelly sweet, Rowntree's Randoms, and in April 2012, another new jelly sweet, Fruit Bottles, both under the Rowntree's brand. Nestl√© has invested more than ¬£200 million in the Rowntree business since 1988, making the York site one of the world's largest confectionery factories. Nestl√©'s global research centre for confectionery is also based in York, and recently doubled in size following a ¬£7 million investment. Current branded products Jelly Tots The best known products that are still branded under the Rowntree name are Rowntree's Fruit Gums, Rowntree's Fruit Pastilles and Jelly Tots. Jelly Tots are soft, chewy fruit-flavoured sweets. They are round, sugar-coated gumdrop- like confections about 13mm in diameter, and contain 25% fruit juices and no artificial colours or flavours. Jelly Tots were invented by Dr Brian Boffey of Horsforth, Leeds when he was working for Rowntree's. Jelly Tots were launched in 1965 and quickly became established as a popular children's brand. Rowntree's Randoms were introduced in 2009. The Rowntree brand is also used on a number of ice lollies (made by R&R; Ice Cream) for Nestl√©. The brand has a similar marketplace to that of the Trebor Bassett division of Cadbury's, and competes head-to-head with this company in a number of fruit-gum categories. Advertising The company largely eschewed advertising before its establishment as a public company in 1897, when it employed S. H. Benson as its agency. Before 1930, the company considered that quality products would speak for themselves, and did not need advertising to sell their benefits. In 1932, Rowntree changed their agency to the London branch of J. Walter Thompson.

He fled via Cuba and settled in the United States to escape Nazi persecution of Jews. Neumann's starling (Onychognathus neumanni) and several other species are named after him. Neumann's travels in Ethiopia and Sudan Neumann was born in wealthy Jewish family, the son of Maximilian and Anna n√©e Meyer. A younger sister of his was Elsa Neumann (1872-1902) who became one of the first physics doctorates from Berlin University. Another sister Alice was a sculptor. He travelled to German East Africa across Tanganyika, Uganda and Kenya in 1892 and collected for the Berlin Museum publishing descriptions. In 1899 he accompanied Baron Carlo von Erlanger through Somaliland and southern Ethiopia, collecting birds that went to Lord Walter Rothschild's bird collection in Tring. In 1915 he went to New Guinea and also made an expedition to Sulawesi in 1938 sponsored by the specimen collector and dealer J. J. Menden. In 1908 he lost much of his money and was hoping to work for Rothschild in Tring but this did not materialize as Rothschild himself ran into financial problems. Neumann then took to stock- broking in Berlin. In 1941, with the help of his friend Julius Riemer he fled Nazi Germany, traveling from Berlin to Cuba, then to Chicago, where he worked the final years of his life as a curator in the Field Museum of Natural History. He was elected to the British Ornithologists' Union in 1897 but resigned in 1910 due to financial reasons. He never married.

It was first published in 1942. Plot summary The newly sensible Pat and Isabel O'Sullivan depart for their second term at St Clare's, with their Cousin Alison joining them. Alison's character is airheaded and ditzy, but also a decent and kind-hearted person. Other new characters include Lucy Oriell and Margery Fenworthy. Lucy is the archetypal school story girl ‚Äî bright, kind and popular ‚Äî although she is portrayed well, without the one-dimensional flatness this type of character can often have. Her father is a painter and Lucy herself is a talented artist. Margery is sulky, sullen, rude, antisocial and the other girls suspect she is older than them, nearer to sixteen years old. Events include a midnight tea party for second former Tessie, which is discovered by Mamzelle through the machinations of another second former, Erica. Erica causes trouble for the first and second formers throughout the year, and is finally trapped in a fire which results in a thrilling rescue by Margery, who becomes a heroine. Lucy's father is involved in an accident rendering him unable to paint, and therefore unable to pay St Clare's school fees, but she is helped by the twins and her new friend, Margery. There is also excitement when Janet puts beetles into Mamzelle's spectacle case and then the girls pretend they can't see them, leaving Mamzelle to believe she is going mad.

In the 1960s, he was co-owner of the Indica Gallery and helped start the independent newspaper International Times. Biography In the 1960s, Miles worked at Better Books, which was managed by Tony Godwin. Godwin was friends with Lawrence Ferlinghetti, with whom he would exchange Penguin books for City Lights publications. In 1965 Allen Ginsberg gave a reading at Better Books that led to the International Poetry Incarnation, a seminal event co-organised by Miles.

In 2016 she became distinguished professor and in 2017, associate provost. Life and career Marcia Langton was born in 1951 to Kathleen (n√©e Waddy) and grew up in south-central Queensland and Brisbane as a descendant of the Yiman and Bidjara nations, both Aboriginal Australian peoples. Her father had no presence in her life. Her mother married Scots-born, ex-Korean War veteran Douglas Langton when Marcia was a year old. She enrolled at the University of Queensland, becoming an activist for Indigenous rights. While in Japan, Langton learnt about Buddhism, and later became a self-described \\"lazy Buddhist\\". Wiradjuri artist Brook Andrew painted Langton in a Buddhist pose. On her return to Australia, Langton studied anthropology at the Australian National University in the 1980s, becoming the first Indigenous honours graduate in anthropology. She then worked with several organisations dealing with Indigenous social and cultural issues and land claims. These included the Australian Film Commission, the Central Land Council (where she was a land claims anthropologist), the Queensland Government and, in the early 1990s, the Cape York Land Council. As a member of the Northern Territory Aboriginal Issues Unit she worked for the 1989 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In 1995 she moved full-time into university research and teaching. She spent five years as Ranger Professor of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies at Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University) in Darwin before moving to Melbourne. In 2012 she became the patron of the Indigenous Reading Project, a charitable organisation that uses digital technology to improve the reading ability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. Langton has been on the judging panel for the annual Horne Prize since its inception in 2016. On 30 October 2019, Langton was announced as a co-chair on the Senior Advisory Group of the Indigenous voice to government, convened by Ken Wyatt, along with by Professor Tom Calma . The group consists of 20 leaders and experts from across the country. Academic interests Langton is known for her work in several academic fields, linked by a concern for Indigenous rights, justice, and artistic expression. Langton conducts anthropological work to support land claims by Aboriginal peoples and their negotiations with mining companies and the state. Her 2005 PhD thesis in geography at Macquarie University applies phenomenological theory to the study of Aboriginal peoples of the eastern Cape York Peninsula.http://www.humgeog.mq.edu.au/postgraduate%20thesis.html Activism She is a frequent media commentator, and serves on various high- level committees on Indigenous issues. These have included the Centre for Aboriginal Reconciliation, the directorship of the Centre for Indigenous Natural and Cultural Resource Management, chair of the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council, and chair of the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. In 2000 she was one of five Indigenous leaders who were granted an audience with the Queen to discuss an apology and Indigenous recognition in the Australian Constitution. In May 2008, the federal government appointed her to the Native Title Payments Working Group looking into reform of the Australian native title process. She has argued that settlement with mining companies on Aboriginal land often benefits local interests more than the Australian government, and that the proposed 2010 resource tax on mining in Australia needed a redesign to support Indigenous rights and employment.Langton, Marcia (2010) \\"Who benefits from the resources boom?\\" ABC Radio National, Big Ideas, 13 May 2010 In 2017 she campaigned against \\"environmentalists\\" thwarting native title reform as part of their case against the Adani Carmichael coal mine.Indigenous people victims of green fight against Adani, says Marcia Langton Her criticisms of Indigenous litigants have been rebuffed by another Indigenous lawyer.\\"Leading Indigenous lawyer hits back at Marcia Langton over Adani\\" by Joshua Robertson, The Guardian, 9 June 2017  Awards  Langton was made a member of the Order of Australia in the 1993 Queen's Birthday Honours for \\"service as an anthropologist and advocate of Aboriginal issues\\".

It serves as the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of San Marcos. The town currently has about 12 000 inhabitants. Culturally and ethnically, the town and the municipality belong to what is known in Mexico as the Costa Chica (small coast) of Guerrero and Oaxaca. This is a 125 km long region along the Pacific coast; it begins south of Acapulco and ends near the town of Puerto √Ångel in the neighbouring state of Oaxaca. Geographically, the town is located approximately 59 km south of Acapulco. It is located 18 km inland and along Federal Highway 200 which is better known locally as the Acapulco-Pinotepa Nacional highway. It is only about one hour‚Äôs drive from Acapulco and takes about 3 hours (157 km) from Pinotepa Nacional. History Officially, the town and municipality were established on 28 September 1885 and were named in honour of Saint Mark, a Catholic saint considered the patron saint of the region. However, the town already existed, firstly under the name of Xolutla and later La Estancia.

The pair does not provide dial tone or battery (continuous electric potential), as opposed to a wet pair, a line usually without dial tone but with battery. A dry pair was originally used with a security system but more recently may also be used with digital subscriber line (DSL) service or an Ethernet extender to connect two locations, as opposed to a costlier means such as a Frame Relay. The pair in many cases goes through the local telephone exchange. Wet pair naming comes from the battery used to sustain the loop, which was made from wet cells. Many carriers market dry loops to independent DSL providers as a BANA for basic analog loop or in some locales PANA for plain analog loop, OPX (off-premises extension) line, paging circuit, or finally LADS (local area data service). Local availability In the United States, these circuits typically incur a monthly recurring charge of $3.00 per ¬º mile (approximately), plus an additional handling fee of around ($5‚Äì10). In Canada, a CRTC ruling of 21 July 2003 requires telcos (such as Bell Canada) permit dry loop and some companies do provide this service. Naked DSL is currently provided by third-party DSL (digital subscriber line) vendors in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, but incurs an additional dry loop fee (often $5 or more monthly, depending on the distance from the exchange). There is not yet widespread adoption, as this extra fee often renders dry-loop DSL more costly than comparable cable modem service in most locations.

The estuary starts near Shotton after a five-mile (8 km) 'canalised' section and the river soon swells to be several miles wide forming the boundary between the Wirral Peninsula in north-west England and Flintshire in north-east Wales. Geology The estuary is unusual in that comparatively little water occupies so large a basin. One theory is that larger rivers such as the Severn and/or Mersey once flowed into the Dee. The current view is that the estuary owes its origin to the passage of glacial ice southeastwards from the Irish Sea during successive ice ages, eroding a broad and shallow iceway through the relatively soft Triassic sandstones and Coal Measures mudstones underlying the area. The inner parts of this channel were filled by glacially derived sands and gravels long ago, and infilling by mud and silt has continued since. It is also thought that prior to the ice ages, the estuary received larger river flows as the upper Severn flowed into the Dee near Chirk. For a period, the Mersey may also have flowed into the Dee by means of a channel which it cut through the base of the Wirral Peninsula.Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory ‚Äì Dee Estuary Davies et al 2004, Geology of the Country around Flint. memoir of the British Geological Survey, sheet 108 (E&W;) Conservation The estuary is a major wildlife area and one of the most important estuaries in Britain, amongst the most important in Europe for its populations of waders and wildfowl. The Environment Agency is the Conservation Authority, and the estuary is protected or listed under several schemes: * Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) * Special Protection Area (SPA) * Sensitive Marine Area (SMA) * Natura 2000 site * Ramsar site Large parts of the area are within the RSPB's Dee Estuary Nature Reserve. Fishery Parkgate, Wirral The estuary supports some important natural fisheries, including salmon and trout on their way to and from the freshwater river, as well as sea-fisheries and shell-fisheries, especially cockles. Trade and industry From earliest times, the Dee estuary was a major trading and military route, to and from Chester. From about the 14th century, Chester provided facilities for trade with Ireland, Spain, and Germany, and seagoing vessels would \\"lay to\\" in the Dee awaiting favourable winds and tides. As the Dee started to silt up, harbouring facilities developed on the Wirral bank at Shotwick, Burton, Neston, Parkgate, Dawpool, and \\"Hoyle Lake\\" or Hoylake.Stephen J. Roberts, A History of Wirral, 2002, The excavation of the New Cut in 1737, to improve access to Chester, diverted the river's course to the Welsh side of the estuary, but failed to stem the silting up of the river, and Chester's trading function declined as that of Liverpool on the River Mersey grew. However, Chester was still a major port of passenger embarkation for Ireland until the early 19th century. The Dee Estuary was industrialised from quite early on in the Industrial Revolution, and some industry remains today. Notable among these are Shotton Steel, formerly owned by John Summers & Sons, and now owned by Tata Steel; the gas-fired power station at Connah's Quay; three separate paper mills; a chemical manufacturing plant; and numerous smaller manufacturing industries. The estuary also receives the treated sewage effluent from Queensferry works and from Chester sewage treatment works. At the mouth of the estuary is the natural gas sweetening plant at Point of Ayr on the site of the former colliery. There are also commercial docks at Mostyn although their use is limited by the tide. Signs of past industry are visible along the whole length of the estuary especially on the Welsh side. Large stretches of what now appear as flood embankments are long abandoned industrial waste heaps, some still containing highly reactive and caustic materials, including large heaps of Galligu, a by- product of the LeBlanc process used at the James Muspratt alkali works at Flint. The Dee estuary also supported industries concerned with the synthesis of PCBs and some pharmaceuticals and was also home to several industrial waste oil-reclamation industries. As a consequence of its industrial heritage, there are extensive areas of contaminated ground along the shores of the estuary. The estuary also plays a part in the most modern of industries as it provides the first stage of transport of Airbus A380 wings on their way to Toulouse via barge to Mostyn docks.

Villiers was particularly memorable for his plummy voice and ripe articulation. He was a great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Clarendon. Background Villiers was born in London, the son of Eric Hyde Villiers and Joan Ankaret Talbot; he was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, graduating in 1953. 'Gentleman Jim' Villiers (pronounced Villers) was from an upper class background, the grandson of Sir Francis Hyde Villiers and great grandson of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon; his mother was descended from Earl Talbot. His aristocratic ancestry was often reflected in the types of role he played, such as King Charles II in the BBC series The First Churchills (1969), the Earl of Warwick in Saint Joan (1974), and on stage as Lord Thurlow in The Madness of George III. Through his father, Villiers was a relative of Thomas Hyde Villiers, Charles Pelham Villiers, Henry Montagu Villiers and the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers. Through his mother, he was distantly related to Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 22nd Earl of Shrewsbury. Career Villiers made his film d√©but in 1958 and appeared in many British films over the years, including Joseph Losey's The Damned (also known as These Are the Damned), shot in 1961 but not released until 1963; Seth Holt's The Nanny (1965), Joseph Andrews (1977), For Your Eyes Only (1981), The Scarlet Pimpernel (1982), Mountains of the Moon (1990) and The Tichborne Claimant (1998), along with numerous other projects. He often specialised in playing cold, somewhat effete villains. He played the role of Colonel Hensman in the television adaptation of Brendon Chase and was heard on BBC Radio 4 as the voice of Roderick Spode in The Code of the Woosters and several other adaptations of the Jeeves stories of P. G. Wodehouse, which starred Michael Hordern and Richard Briers. In the 1978 television adaption of The Famous Five Villiers played the part of the antagonist Johnson. Personal life Nicholas Whittaker, author of Platform Souls and Blue Period, worked in the Belsize Tavern in 1979 and 1980 and claims to recall Villiers' visits to the pub in the company of local actor Ronald Fraser. After closing time, the pair would often be found in the beer & curry restaurant opposite. Rupert Everett also claims to have encountered him in an Indian restaurant, some time in 1985, \\"leglessly drunk, booming orders and insults to the poor long-suffering waiter in a strange breathy vibrato that was pitched for the upper circle\\". Elsewhere, Villiers is described as a \\"big drinker\\" who entered into drinking competitions with his friend Peter O'Toole. Villiers was married twice: in 1966 to Patricia Donovan (marriage dissolved 1984), and in 1994 to Lucy Jex; his second marriage lasted until his death. He and his first wife adopted a son, Alan Michael Hyde Villiers (born Alan Donovan). James Villiers died on 18 January 1998 at Arundel, Sussex, of cancer.

It is part of the Bodensee district, which is part of the Land Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Geography Daisendorf is situated on a hill about 2 km north of Meersburg. It lies above Lake Constance. It is largely surrounded by the commune of Meersburg, with a short border with Uhldingen-M√ºhlhofen to the north. History Daisendorf was first settled in the 8th Century. Given its isolation through marshy terrain and hills, it was only first documented in 1222 when the Abbot of Salem purchased the tithes of the village from the Lords of Vaz. The sovereignty over the village, however, always belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Constance. The conflict of rights between the abbot and the prince-bishop led to a series of disputes that were mediated by town jurors; the first of which occurred in 1295. Plague, crop failures, and a decrease in the price of grain devastated the community in the 14th Century, and slowly the prince-bishopric lost influence in the region. These difficulties induced the prince-bishop to transfer Daisendorf to the Free City of √úberlingen in 1334. The prince-bishop reclaimed Daisendorf for 400 guilders in 1507. In the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1803, in which the principalities of the ecclesiastic rulers were dispersed to the counts and princes of the empire, Daisendorf was given to the Electorate of Baden. Economy Daisendorf is a popular tourist destination in the Lake of Constance region, featuring nice views of the Swiss Alps (S√§ntisregion) and the lake, as well as the charming flair of a diverse rural community.  Culture and sights   Edifices  Saint Martin Chapel in Daisendorf. The village has an ancient chapel St. Martin, which was built in 1508 and holds unique fresques of the renaissance age.  Regular events  This is the fools tree (in allemannic: \\"Narrebom\\") with a green wreath and a child climbing the tree Daisendorf features several yearly happenings. * Carnival season. In South Germany: \\"Fastnacht\\", in allemanic idiom \\"Fasnet\\" when a tree is planted in the middle of the village (\\"Narrenbaum\\") * Village festivities in July * Well festivities of carpenter's guild * Wine festivities at the third weekend of August: this popular Weinfest takes place as a celebration and tasting of harvest of the regional wineries.  Beauty of nature  The little pond \\"Neuweiher\\" in springtime In the east of the village lies pond Neuweiher. This is a hidden water supply in the middle of a lonely wood. According to an old document in the archives of the town of Meersburg (\\"Meersburger Stadtarchiv\\") this water storage was built in 1445. In medieval times it was used to flood the town moat of Meersburg. The pond has a surface of about 570 m¬≤ and a maximal depth of 4,1 m. The pond contents are about 101 Mio. liter water. Nowadays the pond and its surroundings are used for recreation purposes. It is also used as static water storage for fire extinction in case of forest fire. It is not allowed to swim in the pond or go boating on it.

Having been first appointed to work at the College in 1962, he rose to the office of Garter Principal King of Arms in 1992, a position he held until 1995. He was the first Canadian ever to be appointed to the College of Arms. Early life Conrad Swan was born in 1924 in British Columbia, Canada. His father was descended from the Polish noble family of ≈öwiƒôcicki (Coat of arms of Jastrzƒôbiec). After emigrating to Canada in 1884 the family surname became Swan. Swan devoted much of his life to travelling. Having decided to make a lifetime career in the Indian Army, Swan was sent by the India Office (the UK governmental office responsible for India at the time) to the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London. Having completed the course there, he proceeded to India and received an emergency commission on 19 November 1944 as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the Madras Regiment, the oldest in the country. Promoted to war-substantive lieutenant on 10 May 1945, Indian Independence in 1947 caused him to make other decisions \\"it being the end of a chapter\\". He left the Indian Army with the rank of captain. Following his retirement from the Indian Army, he went directly back to Canada to take a BA and MA at the University of Western Ontario (Assumption College). During this time, he developed a keen interest in Commonwealth affairs, which brought him back to Britain, where he acquired his doctorate from Cambridge University in 1955. Swan spent six years (1955‚Äì1961) lecturing in history at the Assumption University of Windsor, Ontario, of which he was also University Beadle. As guest lecturer he visited many universities, not only in North America but in every continent except Antarctica, \\"the penguins haven't invited me yet\\". Heraldic career In addition to his educational achievements, Swan developed an exceptional heraldic career. He was first appointed Rouge Dragon Pursuivant of Arms in Ordinary in 1962 and six years later became York Herald of Arms in Ordinary. In these capacities, he was among the Earl Marshal's staff for the State Funeral of Sir Winston Churchill in 1965, the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, and was Gentleman Usher-in-Waiting to Pope John Paul II during his visit to the United Kingdom in 1982. Swan was appointed Garter Principal King of Arms in 1992 on the retirement of Sir Alexander Colin Cole. His own retirement came in 1995, after having been diagnosed with cancer. At the time, some allegations were made in a newspaper article concerning his decision, in his capacity as Genealogist of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, with regard to the grade in which one of his sons-in-law should enter the Order. He denied these allegations, noting that he had never been interviewed by any reporter on this subject. Sir Conrad Swan was the first herald to execute official duties in-tabard across the Atlantic Ocean and in the Southern Hemisphere. He did so in Bermuda in 1969 and in Brisbane in 1977. He was instrumental in the creation of the Honours System of Antigua and Barbuda, and between 1964 and 1967, Swan was an adviser to the Prime Minister of Canada on the establishment of the National Flag of Canada and the Order of Canada. Swan also took a special interest in Saskatchewan, helping the province to obtain a full coat of arms from the Queen in 1986 and a new Great Seal in 1991. He advised the province on the establishment of the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 1985 and the Saskatchewan Volunteer Medal in 1995 and the recent expansion of the provincial honours system (notably the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan). He was also responsible for the design and granting of badges (crests) for each of the colleges of the University of Saskatchewan. A keen scholar and publicist, Swan wrote a number of books and articles on heraldic, sigillographic and related subjects. He was a member of several international societies and organisations and was a founder of the Royal Heraldry Society of Canada and the Heraldic Garden in Britain. Honours and appointments Swan was appointed an Officer of the Order of St. John (OStJ) on 8 August 1972, with promotions to Commander (CStJ) on 11 December 1975 and to Knight (KStJ) on 6 April 1976. He was appointed a Member (fourth class) of the Royal Victorian Order in the 1978 Birthday Honours list; he and all other living Members (fourth class) were regraded as Lieutenants (LVO) in 1984. He was promoted to Commander (CVO) in the 1986 New Year Honours list and was knighted by the Queen as a Knight Commander (KCVO) in the 1994 Birthday Honours. As Swan was a dual Canadian-British national, his knighthood was theoretically subject to being blocked by the Canadian government due to the 1919 Nickle Resolution, although, in the event, the Liberal Canadian ministry did not oppose the grant. He was also a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Nation of Antigua and Barbuda (KGCN), Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Order of Malta, Cross of Commander of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland, Knight's Cross of the Order of the Grand Duke Gediminas (Lithuania), Knight Grand Cross of Justice of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Francis I (GCFO) and Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of the Lion of Rwanda. He was also a Knight of the Most Venerable Order of St. John of Jerusalem and Knight Principal of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor (1995‚Äì2000); Commander (with Star) of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit; Grand Cross with Grand Collar of the Imperial Order of the Holy Trinity (Ethiopia); Coronation Medal of the King of Tonga. He received the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan in 2005. Family In 1957, Swan married Lady Hilda Susan Mary Northcote (born 23 July 1937 ‚Äì died 4 December 1995), Serving Sister Most Venerable Order of St. John, Dame of Honour and Devotion Sovereign Military Order of Malta; Dame of Justice (SMO) of Constantine St. George; and President, St. John's Ambulance Society Suffolk. Lady Hilda was the younger daughter of Henry Stafford Northcote, the 3rd Earl of Iddesleigh, and granddaughter of author Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes. She died in Boxford, Suffolk, when she was hit by a car, which did not stop. She was 58 years old.

Otterbach was the seat of the former Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Otterbach, which merged into the new Verbandsgemeinde Otterbach-Otterberg in 2014.  Geography  State Otterbach lies in the northwest of Kaiserslautern in the so-called Kaiserslautern Senke. To the north is the Nordpf√§lzer Bergland and to the east the Otterberger Wald, which belongs to the Palatinate Forest. The community consists of the two districts Otterbach and Sambach. The residential areas Falltal and Sambacher Ziegelh√ºtte also belong to the Otterbach district. Neighbouring municipalities are the local municipality of Katzweiler in the northwest, the town of Otterberg in the northeast and the independent town of Kaiserslautern with the districts of , Morlautern, Wiesenthalerhof and Erfenbach in the south.  Surveys and waters  The Schlossberg rises in the south and the Galgenberg in the north. The core town lies at the mouth of the stream into the Lauter. The Ziegelbach flows into the Lauter from the right between the core village and the Sambach district. The latter also forms the western boundary with Kaiserslautern.  History  South of the village on the Schlossberg was the disappeared Sterrenberg Castle. Until the end of the 18th century, the community belonged to the Otterbach estate, which belonged to the von der Leyen family. From 28 to 30 November 1793, the municipal area was partly the scene of the Battle of Kaiserslautern. From 1798 to 1814, when the Palatinate was part of the French Republic (until 1804) and then part of the Napoleonic Empire, Otterbach was incorporated into the canton of Otterberg. In 1815 the village initially belonged to Austria. One year later he moved to the Kingdom of Bavaria. From 1818 to 1862 he belonged to the Landkommissariat Kaiserslautern, from which the Bezirksamt Kaiserslautern emerged. From 1939 the town was part of the district of Kaiserslautern. After the Second World War, Otterbach became part of the newly formed state of Rhineland-Palatinate within the French occupation zone. In the course of the first administrative reform in Rhineland-Palatinate, the previously independent municipality of Sambach was incorporated into Otterbach on 7 June 1969. Two years later, the municipality became the seat of the newly formed association municipality of the same name, to which six further local municipalities belonged. Since 1 July 2014, Otterbach has been part of the Otterbach-Otterberg association of municipalities.  Politics   Emblem  Blasonation: \\"A blue shield divided by a silver wave bar. Above a silver otter with an equally coloured fish in its mouth. Below, a golden squirrel holding a golden acorn in its front paws.\\" Reason for the coat of arms: The coat of arms is a combination of the two old coats of arms of the municipalities of Sambach and Otterbach. The Otter is the name giver of the place Otterbach, more exactly for the brook \\"Otterbach\\". The squirrel is the heraldic animal of the abbey in neighbouring Otterberg, which had a mill in Sambach. The silver waveband stands for the Otterbach. The colours blue and silver are reminiscent of the former reign of the Counts of Leyen.

Biography  Aleksandr Gauk was born in Odessa in 1893. He recalled his first experience as hearing army bands and his mother singing and accompanying herself at the piano. When he was seven he began piano studies and at 17 travelled to St Petersburg and managed to gain entrance to the class of Daugover, later moving over to Felix Blumenfeld. He saw Arthur Nikisch, Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss conduct and was particularly taken by the former.Tassie G. Papa Gauk ‚Äì the father of Russian conductors.

Career  Gauk‚Äôs first conducting experience was in 1912 with a student orchestra, and professionally on 1 October 1917 for a production of Tchaikovsky's Cherevichki at the Petrograd Musical Drama Theatre. He spent much of the 1920s as conductor for the Mariinsky Ballet. He married the ballerina Elena Gerdt. From 1930 to 1934, he was chief conductor of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra. On 6 November 1931, he conducted that orchestra and the Academy Capella Choir in the world premiere of Shostakovich's Symphony No. 3 in E flat major, Op. 20 \\"First of May\\". From 1932 he worked in Moscow and became chief conductor of a new radio orchestra in 1936, which evolved into the USSR State Symphony Orchestra. During the Second World War, after escaping from Riga, he taught in Moscow, before spending two years at the Tbilisi Conservatory and reviving the Georgian State Symphony Orchestra. He restored Rachmaninoff's discarded First Symphony from the orchestral parts found in the archives of the Moscow Conservatory after the composer's death in 1943. He conducted the world premiere of Khachaturian's Cello Concerto in Moscow in 1946. Gauk's own compositions include a symphony, chamber works for strings and works for piano. He left an unfinished autobiography.

They overlap in distribution in some areas with the rufous treepie but are easily to tell apart both from appearance and call.  Description  The white of the head and body makes it easy to distinguish from the sympatric rufous treepie. This tends to be found in more dense forest and is less associated with human habitation than the rufous treepie. The white-bellied treepie is long. The back of the neck is white, and the throat and breast are black. The thighs are black, and the undertail coverts are chestnut. The rest of the underparts is white. The back is chestnut-brown. The wings are black and have a white patch. The rump is white. Two-thirds of the two central tail feathers are silver-grey, and the terminal third is black. The other tail feathers are black. The beak is black, and the legs are greyish-black.  Distribution  It is found in the forests of the Western Ghats mainly south of Goa. A record from Erimalai near Dharmapuri and reports from the Surat Dangs and the southeastern Ghats of Andhra Pradesh stand outside its main distribution range. A record from central India (Chikalda, Gawilgarh) has been questioned. Behaviour and ecology The white-bellied treepie eats fruits, seeds, nectar, invertebrates, reptiles, rodents, nestlings and eggs. When calling, the bird bows and droops its wings. Several birds may arrive at one tree and call repeatedly during the pre-monsoon breeding season (mainly April‚ÄìMay but some nests from February). The nest is a platform of twigs on a medium-sized tree. Three eggs are laid, ashy grey with green and grey blotches. It is associated with mixed-species foraging flocks and is often found along with greater racket-tailed drongos.

Known in North America as Penny Racers, they were introduced in late 1978 and have seen multiple revisions and successors since. Choro-Qs are stylized after real- world automobiles, with real rubber wheels and a pullback motor that makes them move. Each car has a coin slot at the back, where inserting a penny will make it perform a wheelie when the car is released. Takara created the Choro-Q line after noticing the popularity of miniature car toys in Japan. They are based on an earlier Takara toy line called \\"Mame Dash\\", which only lasted a few years before being discontinued in 1980. A wide variety of car models was chosen to make the Choro-Q series appeal to everybody, ranging from sports cars to formula racers. The name comes from the Japanese term \\"choro-choro\\", meaning \\"dash around\\", as well as an abbreviation of the Japanese word for \\"cute\\", which connotes their petite size. Features Most Choro-Q feature real rubber tires (usually with larger ones on the rear) and the characteristic coil-spring pullback motor. Also, each Choro-Q is a \\"cute\\" squeezed design caricature of the actual vehicle it represents. This type of caricature is also known as \\"deformed scale\\" as it gives the car a foreshortened or deformed appearance. What is also distinct about the cars is the slot at the rear, where a small coin can be inserted for the wheelie effect. The toy line is highly popular and has become collectible, even outside Japan, due to its low price and its merchandising line which includes JGTC and various licensed car editions and has also spawned a series of videogames bearing the same name. The toy line has also lent its moulding to the Micro-Change and Transformers line of toys. In addition to \\"Penny Racers\\", Choro-Q pullback cars were also marketed under the Tonka branding in the late 1980s as \\"Tonka Turbo Tricksters\\". \\"Penny Racers\\" in the US are still marketed by Funrise, but are less popular for collectors compared with their true-to- life counterparts marketed elsewhere, and versus the ones formerly sold by Tonka. \\"Penny Racers\\" tend to be garishly colored and given silly names, ignoring the actual names of the makes and models, and marketed for US children, whereas the Choro Q in the far East are made to a much higher quality standard and many are specifically designed for the adult collector, with high detail and/or tiny, incredibly detailed racing graphics and occasionally other realistic gimmicks such as fold-out headlights. Originally produced in Japan, the manufacture subsequently has occurred variously in Taiwan, Macau and China. The models represent various makes and models of all kinds of actual cars, trucks, trains, and even planes and military and construction vehicles. There are even versions representing just about every bus and train line in Japan. Choro-Q are also produced in limited special runs for promotional purposes. Models are licensed and produced for automotive manufacturers and dealers, or as tchotchkes for marketing of other products and services. They even released a Major League Baseball line. The first Choro-Q cars were more geared toward children, with primary colors and low detail. They have grown more sophisticated over time and now are for the most part cast in a uniform clear, colored or smoked resin plastic which is then painted, thus leaving the windshields and headlights, etc. transparent for added realism. From early on, Takara offered accessories and various spare parts and modification parts, including different motors to give a higher speed. Recently the newer Choro-Q are sold from the factory with various styles of spring-wound motors, including slow (for trucks and machinery), normal (for normal cars), and fast (for sports cars). There is even a 2-speed motor that starts out slow and then shifts to a higher gear. History The Choro-Q toy line was produced by Takara, a Japanese toy manufacturer best known for producing Transformers and B-Daman. Noticing an increase in popularity of miniature car toys across the country, Takara began work on a similar toy line to capitalize on their success. The Choro-Q cars were given small, pullback motors that launched them when released; few car lines had such a feature, which Takara felt would make them stand out among similar lines and give them their own unique finish. The miniature, super-deformed style of the cars is believed to be based on artwork by cartoonist Dave Deal, who in the late 1970s had supplied his art style to a line of cartoonish- looking stunt racer toys called \\"Glitter Bugs\\". The Choro-Q line is also based on an earlier Takara product called \\"Mame Dash\\", which had only lasted a few years before being discontinued in 1980. To make the toys appeal to a wide audience, Takara chose to make several varieties of models, ranging from formula racers, to buggies, to stunt cars, to sports cars. The idea for the coin-operated wheelie function came from an employee suggesting the cars could bend in other directions, rather than simply moving forward when pulled back. The name \\"Choro-Q\\" comes from the Japanese term \\"choro-choro\\", meaning \\"dash around\\", as well as an abbreviation of the Japanese word for \\"cute\\", which connotes their petite size. Specialty models Unusual Choro-Q which have the wheels and pull-back motor but are not modelled after vehicles are also common, often sold as special collectibles. This includes Choro-Q in the shape of common regional symbols such as carved wood bears of Hokkaido and popular symbols from other regions such monkeys, salmon eggs, sea urchin, etc. sold only in certain regions and marketed at local domestic tourists. In 2013, following the example of the Tomica line with its Limited Vintage models, Takara Tomy unveiled Choro-Q Zero, a premium series of classical Japanese cars aimed at the collectors market. The Choro-Q brand has been extended, often with a small name change which is a pun on the original name, to cover other small toys or novelties, both with and without the wheels and motor, including *Digi-Q: Electronic remote control versions of Choro-Q cars which used infrared technology instead of radio control. These products were developed in conjunction with Konami. *Choco-Q: Chocolate egg with a small capsule toy inside *Puka-Q: Bath salts compressed into an egg shape, which, when dissolved in the bath, reveals a small toy inside *Choro-Juu: (\\"Ju\\" [Áç£], meaning beast or monster, from ÊÄ™Áç£) Small monster toys which moved with a friction motor and had other gimmicks such as sparks shooting from the mouth. *Choro-Chuu (\\"Chu\\" [Ëô´], insect or bug, from ÊòÜËô´): Realistic plastic and rubber figures of various beetles, with wheels and a pull-back motor for movement. *Jumbo Choro-Q: This is a large-scale version of the small toys but approximately 30 cm in length. They have the same pull-back motor gimmick and the hood also opened to reveal a storage space for standard sized Choro-Q toys. *Q-steer: A more inexpensive infra-red remote control version of Choro-Q cars than the earlier Digi-Q, this line was first released in 2006 after the merger with TOMY and for several years became one of the best selling toy lines in Japan. They come in Normal, Tamiya Dune Buggies, Mario Kart Wii and Doraemon versions. *CQ Motors: The most ambitious brand extension of all, this wholly owned subsidiary of Takara, founded in 2002, manufactured and sold actual single-passenger, electric automobiles modelled after the toy cars. The cars are street-legal (though not permitted on highways), require a standard driver's license for operation and have a top speed of about 50 km/h and a range of about 80 km on a single charge. Several models were sold, including one designed by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, priced in the 1-1.9 million yen range. Although sales have been discontinued, as many as 500 were sold in all. In a country known for the prowess of its automobile industry it is remarkable that at one point, Takara, a toy company, had the highest share of electric cars on the road in Japan. *Choro-Q Deck System (CDS): A system of special customizable Choro-Q cars and track designed for head-on crash \\"battle\\" competitions. The innovative \\"deck system\\" allows the easy swapping of the principle car components by putting each component in a card-like frame. Swappable components include the chassis- engine, front-end battering ram, outer body and special deflecting side wings. After stacking a unique combination of component cards like a deck of cards, a unique vehicle comes together which can be easily detached from the deck and put into battle on the track. The object of the competition is to design a vehicle which will knock the opponent off the track in a head-to-head crash battle. *Choro-Q Hybrid: A newer version of the Digi-Q and Q-Steer, the Choro-Q Hybrid is available in two chassis types, Remote Type and Spring Type. The car bodies can be removed easily with a screwdriver so they can be swapped onto other chassis types or traded. They also include additional pieces that are fitted to the tyres or underside to perform special tricks, and slot car tracks to race on. The speed of the Remote Type's Dash button has vastly increased, and the Mario Kart Wii cars come with an Item Randomiser on the remote. The remote sizes have increased and the cars are charged via remote. Video games Dozens of Choro Q video games using the Choro-Q brand and themes have been released. These games, which have been released on many platforms, are racing genre with varying customization and RPG elements. Many of the games have been ported and translated with moderate success internationally, sometimes under the Choro-Q name, but also under other names such as Penny Racers, Gadget Racers and Road Trip.

She was laid down in 1884 and launched in 1887 with build number 67. Tyr was one of a class of two gunboats - the other ship in her class being HNoMS Gor. Gor and Tyr can be seen as improved Vale-class gunboats, of 290 tons instead of the 250 tons standard for that class. Captured during the German invasion of Norway, she was pressed into service in an attempt to mine Sognefjord. After attacks by Norwegian aircraft and ships she took no further part in the conflict. After the war she was returned briefly to the Royal Norwegian Navy then entered civilian service in a number of roles over the years. Characteristics The main gun of the ship was 7.8m meters long,Naval History on the GR 10.2in 26cm 30cal Krupp gun or about a quarter of the length of the whole vessel. In addition she was armed with three revolving guns for closer ranges. Shortly before the First World War, Tyr was rebuilt as a minelayer. During this rebuild, the heavy gun was replaced with a more modern 12 cm breech-loader, and one of the 37 mm guns was replaced with a more potent 76 mm gun. After the heavy gun and ammunition were removed, she could carry 55 mines. By 1940, two Madsen machine guns had been added for anti-aircraft purposes.Daatland 1993: 54 Service German invasion of Norway =Mining the Bergen approaches= On 9 April 1940, the day of the German invasion of Norway, the commander of Ler√∏y guard district, Captain F. Ulstrup, received a message informing him that German warships had forced their way past the small Ler√∏y Fort on their way towards Bergen. Captain Ulstrup immediately boarded Tyr and sailed out to mine the Ler√∏yosen approaches to the south-western Norwegian city. At 0130hrs the Norwegian minelayer began mining the stretch of water between Ler√∏y island and Sotra, putting out seven mines right before the German invasion flotilla arrived at Ler√∏yosen. Making good her escape Tyr placed another sixteen mines in the Vatlestraumen approaches north of Bergen.Berg 1995: 27Abelsen 1986: 135 Due to a built-in time delay the Ler√∏yosen mines were not active when the German warships passed over them. However by the time the supply fleet of the German forces in the Bergen area started coming into Ler√∏yosen late in the evening the mines were ready. The first ship to hit the mines was the 4,297 ton supply ship Sao Paulo, which sank with a great loss of both lives and materiel at 2300hrs, 9 April. As the mine barrier had now been discovered the Kriegsmarine needed to sweep the Ler√∏yosen but had no dedicated minesweepers in the area. In an improvised reaction to the mines the invaders sent out the naval trawlers Schiff 9 and Cremon, together with two launches from the depot ship Karl Peters. The improvised minesweeper force entered the mine barrier in the evening of 10 April and began clearing the mines. At 1925hrs Schiff 9 struck a mine and went down in between one and two minutes. At 19.30 hours as Cremon tried to rescue survivors she too blew up together with one of the two launches. Later on 27 April the 8,500 ton German merchant ship Liege was sunk by one of the mines. The 4,601 ton German steamer Johann Wessels was damaged by one of the mines on 5 May 1940. Three days later, on 8 May 1940, the 1,151 ton German-controlled Danish steamer Gerda hit a mine and sank. All in all the Germans lost three supply ships, two naval trawlers and a launch sunk by mines laid by Tyr.Abelsen 1986: 136 =Guarding the southern sea lane= After laying her mines Tyr resumed guarding the southern sea lane to Bergen and soon met up with German naval forces. Off the island of Skorpo she had a clash with an E-boat, neither vessel being hit. Tyr then withdrew behind the cover of Forstr√∏no island, but was chased down by a further three German E-boats. After a brief fight Tyr drove the enemy ships off, damaging one of the German vessels severely with a 37 mm shell. Norwegian Campaign =To the Hardangerfjord, change of command= Later in the Norwegian Campaign, on 16 April, Tyr moved to Uskedal in Ytre Hardangerfjord, where her captain became the commander of the newly created Hardangerfjord naval district. The second- in-command, Sub-Lieutenant K. Sandn√¶s, took over the minelayer. While in the Hardangerfjord she took part in the Battle of Uskedal in the early hours of 20 April. =Battle of Uskedal= From her anchorage south of Uskedal Tyr first damaged an E-boat and then, with her 12 cm main gun, put a large hole below the waterline of the armed trawler Schiff 18 forcing her to be beached to avoid sinking. At 05.30 a.m. the battle turned against the Norwegians as another trawler, Schiff 221 landed more troops at Trones which advanced on Uskedal from a new direction. All the while during the battle Tyr was providing naval gunfire support from her position in the Storsund midway between Uskedal and Her√∏ysund, bombarding the Germans with high explosive shells. Even though she came under heavy machine gun fire from German troops, Tyr helped the Norwegian land forces hold their ground until taken by surprise by the sudden arrival of the German artillery training ship Bremse. Fire from the larger enemy ship forced Tyr to back out the fight and go to the docks in Uskedal. After a short while at anchor Tyr was ordered back into the fight to help the torpedo boat Stegg that was fighting Bremse. Once Tyr returned to the battle she again gained the attention of the German warship and was forced to take cover in a small bay at Skorpo. As Sub-Lieutenant Sandn√¶s now considered the battle as hopeless he ordered his crew ashore to rest, also sending small arms and ammunition on land. Sandn√¶s started preparations to scuttle his ship with explosives, but before he could carry out his intentions two E-boats entered the bay and boarded Tyr. Before long Schiff 221 arrived and took Tyr in tow. By afternoon Tyr was on her way back to Bergen with a German crew. German service =Sognefjord with Uller= In German hands Tyr was first used together with fellow captured Norwegian minelayer Uller in a plan by Admiral Otto von Schrader to mine the entrance to the Sognefjord on 30 April. Together the two ships could carry 80 mines and quite effectively block in the Norwegian naval forces in the country's longest fjord. However, the Norwegian forces in the fjord had a very effective system of look-outs and guard ships. Before the two minelayers even had entered Sognefjord they were attacked by two of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's M.F.11 biplane patrol aircraft. The seaplanes dropped nine bombs at the two minelayers, failing to damage either of the ships but wounding three sailors on Uller with shrapnel. Having escaped damage in this attack the minelayers continued north and started laying mines at the entrance to the Sognefjord. In the early hours of 1 May the Norwegians threw another seaplane attack against the German mining operation. A single Norwegian Heinkel He 115 made two dive bombing attacks on Tyr and Uller, dropping one 250 kg bomb and four 50 kg bombs on the fiercely resisting ships. None of the bombs were direct hits, but one near miss damaged the side of Uller, causing sea water to flood into her. Uller had to be beached on Losne√∏y island and thereafter scuttled by the only slightly damaged Tyr. =Ambush= After scuttling Uller, Tyr abandoned her mining mission and retreated southwards to Bergen, carrying the crew of Uller with her. Norwegian scouts were however still following her. Before the minelayer got back to base she was ambushed in the F√•lefotsundet narrows between His√∏ya and the mainland by the crew of a Norwegian guard boat that had been stalking her since leaving the Sognefjord. The crew had taken up positions on both sides of the narrows and opened a harrowing fire on the minelayer as she passed through. As Tyr was shot up with intense machine gun fire the German crew replied with her 12 cm main gun and automatic weapons without hitting any in the ambush force. The fire fight continued until Tyr had passed through the narrows and got out of range of the Norwegians' light weaponry, making it back to Bergen. Tyr saw no further service during the Norwegian Campaign. After the F√•lefotsundet ambush Tyr took no further part in the Norwegian Campaign. What the Germans used the minelayer for after that is unknown. Post war After the Second World War, Tyr was returned to the Royal Norwegian Navy, and sold into civilian service. Her first rebuild was in 1946 when she converted to a heavy lift steamship. In 1949 she was sold to Br. Wilhelmsen A/S and rebuilt as a car ferry, being renamed Bj√∏rn West in 1951 and was used as such by different companies for many years. In May 1986 she was rebuilt at Karm√∏y, this time as a heavy-transport ship. Later she was sold to a salmon farm company and as of 2006 was still in existence as a floating storage vessel, at last report entering Eidsvik shipyard in May 2014 for restoration.

Philip William Otterbein and Martin Boehm, the founders of the U.B. Church, had not established a succession in the U.B. ministry by any rite of ordination. The Miami Annual Conference, therefore, in August 1813 addressed a letter to Otterbein asking him to ordain by the laying on of hands \\"one or more ministers who afterwards may perform the same for others.\\" The letter reached Otterbein in late September 1813, with Newcomer visiting him soon thereafter. It was decided that Otterbein should ordain Newcomer, Joseph Hoffman and Frederick Shaffer (two other U.B. ministers). Accordingly, on 2 October 1813, after a solemn period of worship and meditation, with the assistance of an elder of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Rev. William Ryland, Otterbein ordained by the laying on of hands these three men, the first to be ordained in the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. This taking place just a few weeks before Otterbein's death. Early life Christian Newcomer was the son of Wolfgang and Elizabeth (Weller/Weber) Newcomer, the second of three sons born into this family, which included five daughters as well. Christian's grandfather, Peter Newcomer, brought his family to America from Switzerland some time between 1719 and 1727. They settled in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. They were of distinctly Mennonite heritage. Christian was baptized in and became a member of the Mennonite Church. On 31 March 1772, he married Elizabeth Baer. He seems to have had little romantic feeling toward her, writing in his Journal \\"I had to seek a housekeeper, which I found in Miss Elizabeth Baer, and entered with her into a state of matrimony.\\" When she died thirty-nine years later, however, he showed his affection had matured, as he wrote \\"This evening at 6 o'clock my dear companion departed this life, and resigned her immortal spirit into the arms of Jesus her Savior. Peace be to thy ashes: for many years thou has been a staff and comfort unto me; soon we shall be reunited where parting will be no more.\\" Christian and Elizabeth Newcomer had four children: Andrew, Jacob, David, and Elizabeth. After his wife's death Christian made his home with Andrew. As a young man, Christian Newcomer learned the carpenter's trade. In time, he inherited the family farm, so took up farming instead. Throughout these early years, his friends continually urged him to preach. This troubled him greatly. In 1775, to escape the issue, he sold his farm in Lancaster County and moved to another he had bought at Beaver Creek, Maryland, seven miles south of Hagerstown in Washington County. Shortly after moving he became seriously ill. He believed he was dying and cried out for divine help. The illness subsided, he was left with a determination no longer to fight the call to preach. Shortly after his recovery he came under the itinerant preaching of Otterbein and Boehm and resolved to throw aside his inhibitions and go forth to preach. Newcomer was also influenced in ministry by a close associate of Otterbein's, George Adam Geeting. Indeed, as Koontz states \\"Ere long the growing group known as Otterbein's People came to recognize not three great spiritual leaders (i.e., Otterbein, Boehm and Geeting), but four, and Newcomer was the fourth.\\" The probable date for the beginning of Newcomer's itinerant ministry is 1777. His Journal More is known of Newcomer's life and ministry than of any of the other United Brethren leaders because of the extensive journal he kept, in which he recorded his own activities, contemporary activities in the U.B. Church, and many public events, as well. Not long before his death, Newcomer and a long-time friend and co-worker, (the Rev.) John Hildt (who was a member of the Baltimore Church) began work on Newcomer's journal in preparation for publishing. Shortly after his death, the U.B. Conference appointed a committee to examine the original manuscripts, also with a view toward publication. Hildt was asked to undertake the task of transcribing, translating into English, and editing the personally written biography and journal of his close friend. In 1834, four years after Newcomer's death, The Life and Journal of the Rev'd Christian Newcomer, Late Bishop of the Church of the United Brethren in Christ was first published. In covers primarily the period of 27 October 1795 to 4 March 1830. A copy of this Journal resides in the Library of Congress, where it has even served to establish definite dates and events of early U.S. history. Although there is scant record of Newcomer's first eighteen years of ministry, his name does appear in the lists of the U.B. conferences of 1789 (at Otterbein's parsonage in Baltimore) and 1791 (at John Spangler's in York County, Pennsylvania).

The American College of Zoological Medicine (ACZM) is an international organization composed of 152 members (as of May 2014), which recognizes, establishes and regulates standards and criteria necessary for veterinarians to be true specialists in zoological medicine. The board certification in zoological medicine encompasses expertise in general captive zoo medicine, aquatic animal medicine, avian medicine, reptile and amphibian medicine, and free-ranging wildlife medicine. A specialist in zoological medicine recognized by the College of Zoological Medicine is called a diplomate. Board certified diplomates of the ACZM serve as clinical veterinarians, zoo managers, wildlife veterinarians, wildlife conservation agents, researchers, teachers, government officials, and other similar leadership roles.

Small, nimble vessels, they were armed with a single large-caliber gun for offensive purposes and several small, quick-firing guns for self-defense. The main gun was large for such a small craft, roughly a quarter of the length of the whole vessel, and of the same caliber as heavy battleship guns of the same era. The Gor class was likely built in the belief that the ships would be able to inflict serious damage to an opposing battleship. Service history and fate Shortly before the First World War, both vessels were rebuilt as minelayers. During this reconstruction, the heavy, large-caliber gun was replaced with a more modern 12 cm breech-loader, and one of the 37 mm guns was replaced with a more potent 57 mm (Tyr) or 76 mm (Gor) gun. With the heavy gun and ammunition removed, these diminutive vessels could carry a useful number of mines. Both vessels were kept in service until the German invasion in 1940, and both fell into German hands for the remainder of the war. After the Second World War, the vessels were returned to the Royal Norwegian Navy, and subsequently decommissioned.

His younger brother Elmer Working made a major contribution on the identification problem for demand curves in econometrics, with which Holbrook Working was also involved. Working disagreed with Keynes's backwardation theory of futures prices, which argued that short hedgers (farmers) drive down futures prices because of their demand for price insurance. Working argued that there could be hedgers on both sides of the market and that hedging was essentially not a risk reduction technique, but \\"speculation in the basis\\" which allows informed traders and commodity dealers to profit from their knowledge of future changes in the difference between futures and spot prices.

Located on the Ohio River just above the mouth of Green River, it was a city for barely 100 years but is legendary in the area because of the activities there during the American Civil War and its rough reputation. Geography Scuffletown Bottoms, as it is called now, is on the Kentucky-Indiana border almost directly across the Ohio River from Newburgh. It is situated in the northeastern portion of Henderson County, Kentucky. History Scuffletown got its start in 1800 when Jonathan Thomas Scott, aka Scott Fox, third son of the Great Chief Cornstalk and full-blood Shawnee, married Mary Polly Cooper, a full blood Cherokee. They had two sons Jonathan Scott and Thomas Scott. Around the time of the Cherokee removal, their father was shot to death in Shawneetown, Illinois in 1838. He ran a tavern in the area that passing river traffic could easily access. Scuffletown got its name from the flatboat people coming down the Ohio River. The Cherokee played stick ball and had wrestling matches right outside the tavern/trading post. The white people saw this as scuffling. According to the Annals and Scandals of Henderson County by Maralea Arnett, since he kept a good supply of liquor, it became a rendezvous for flatboatmen and others on the river. Often a general fight developed after several hours of drinking and the place received the name of Scuffletown, his great great grandson, Michael \\"Manfox\\" Buley still lives in Henderson County. A school was built there sometime around 1817. The first church was built in 1830 at the Vanada farm. A tobacco stemmery was built in 1860 and shipped 400 to 450 hogsheads per year to Europe. A steam gristmill and blacksmith shop soon followed. In addition to crops of tobacco and corn, Scuffletown was noted for its large number of pecan trees. Old Southern Cherokee of Scuffletown & Henderson, KY The site witnessed numerous Civil War-era activities. It may have been the intended target of a raid by a handful of Confederate cavalrymen from Tennessee led by Captain Jake Bennett. It was Colonel's Johnson set up his cannon a few miles below Scuffletown to take Newburgh. The Silver Lake No. 2, a sternwheel packet (steamboat) weighing some 129 tons and outfitted with six cannons capable of firing 24 pound shot, stopped at Scuffletown during its patrols of the Ohio. In 1863, eight Union companies of infantry and one company of artillery were stationed at Scuffletown to protect the area of Confederate raiders. Scuffletown is mentioned in the Civil War account \\"Operations of the Mississippi Squadron during Morgan's Raid\\". Sometime in the late 1800s, James Martin led a group of Cherokee refugees to the area from Fort Smith, Arkansas to join kinsman living in the Scuffletown area. On December 26, 1893 the group was officially welcomed as an Indian tribe by Governor John Y. Brown. Through the years since, the descendants of these Cherokee have maintained ties to the culture and traditions of their people. At least twice each year, Tribal Members meet in various locations around the area to perform their sacred ceremonies. According to an atlas originally printed and copy written in 1895 by the Rand McNally Corporation, downtown Scuffletown had a population of 71. By 1868, Scuffletown had grown enough to get a post office. However, a 1913 flood greatly devastated the city, causing a mass exodus that it never recovered from. Its post office closed permanently in January 1914. Then an even larger flood in 1937 decimated what little remained, and it has sat mostly deserted ever since. The area is now simply referred to Scuffletown Bottoms, though it often goes unnamed. Current Events & Future  On January 18, 2001, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed the establishment of a national wildlife refuge in the Scuffletown Bottoms. The purpose of the proposed refuge is to protect, restore and manage a valuable complex of wetland habitats for the benefit of migrating and wintering waterfowl, non-game land birds, and other native fish and wildlife. The Kentucky Oral History Sound Recordings project, produced in conjunction with the Kentucky Historical Society and the Downtown Henderson Project, has recorded conversations with former residents of Scuffletown.

Outside Chicago, Archer Avenue/Road passes through the villages of Summit, Justice, Willow Springs, and the southern edge of Lemont before terminating on the north side of Lockport. Between Summit and Lockport, Archer Avenue is designated as a part of Illinois Route 171. Historically, this section of Archer was a part of Illinois Route 4, the original 1924 highway connecting St. Louis and Chicago. In 1926, Route 4 was rerouted to the north side of the Des Plaines River on an alignment that subsequently became U.S. Route 66, and its former route on Archer was redesignated as Illinois Route 4A. By 1939, Route 4A had been extended along most of Archer Avenue into Downtown Chicago. In 1967, Route 4A was truncated back to Summit and merged into Illinois Route 171.

Founding and members The Helsinki Additional Meeting of the CSCE Council on 24 March 1992, requested the Chairman-in-Office to convene as soon as possible a conference on Nagorno-Karabakh under the auspices of the CSCE to provide an ongoing forum for negotiations towards a peaceful settlement of the crisis on the basis of the principles, commitments and provisions of the CSCE. The Conference is to take place in Minsk. Although it has not to this date been possible to hold the conference, the so-called Minsk Group spearheads the OSCE effort to find a political solution to this conflict. On 6 December 1994, the Budapest Summit of Heads of State or Government decided to establish a co-chairmanship for the process. The Summit participants also expressed their political will to deploy multinational peacekeeping forces as an essential part of the overall settlement of the conflict. Implementing the Budapest decision, the Hungarian Chairman-in-Office Marton Krasznai issued on 23 March 1995, the mandate for the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk Process. The main objectives of the Minsk Process are as follows: *Providing an appropriate framework for conflict resolution in the way of assuring the negotiation process supported by the Minsk Group; *Obtaining conclusion by the Parties of an agreement on the cessation of the armed conflict in order to permit the convening of the Minsk Conference; *Promoting the peace process by deploying OSCE multinational peacekeeping forces. The Minsk Process can be considered to be successfully concluded if the objectives referred to above are fully met. The Minsk Group is headed by a co-chairmanship consisting of France, Russia and the United States. Furthermore, the Minsk Group also includes the following participating states: Belarus, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Turkey as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan. The co-chairmen of the Minsk Group are: Ambassador St√©phane Visconti of France, Ambassador Igor Popov of the Russian Federation, and Ambassador Andrew Schofer of the United States. The Minsk Conference on Nagorno-Karabakh would be attended by the same participating States that are members of the Minsk Group.

Azerbaijani criticism of OSCE Minsk Group Azerbaijanis have long distrusted the OSCE's Minsk group, co- chaired by Russia, France, and the United States. All three countries have large Armenian diasporas, while Russia and Armenia are strategic allies, something Azerbaijan argues is grounds for them to consider it as favouring the Armenians in the conflict.

Possible candidates for co-chairmanship Some argue that the failure of the Minsk Group has caused the belligerent parties, especially Azerbaijan, to search for more effective mechanisms and new approaches. The replacement of certain co-chairs or the addition of new ones are the most commonly voiced ideas. As the present mediators would probably not withdraw or terminate the mediation efforts, since their national interests are at stake and they do not want another mediator to undertake initiation, the most feasible proposal is to include new co-chairs in the Minsk Group. In 2015, Azay Guliyev, an Azerbaijani member of parliament, proposed inclusion of Turkey and Germany to the co-chairmanship institute. However, according to Matthew Bryza, former U.S. Ambassador to Azerbaijan, the EU would make more sense because it would represent all of Europe and has experience mediating similar conflicts in the Balkans. Azerbaijani foreign affairs expert Rusif Huseynov proposed Kazakhstan as an additional co-chair in the Minsk Group. According to him, Kazakhstan, which has turned into a big actor in the post-Soviet area, has titular population that is culturally similar to the Azerbaijanis, but is a member of several Kremlin-led organizations together with Armenia. Therefore, Kazakhstan could be equally close or distant to either warring side. Kazakhstan's previous experience in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict also makes it a good candidate for the mediation process.

History The party grew from student movements in the late 1980s in Java, Bali and Lombok established to protest against aspects of President Suharto's authoritarian New Order regime. One of these, the Yogyakarta Students Solidarity (SMY) was led by future party leader Budiman Sudjatmiko. The SMY was particularly active and established branches in other cities in Java and beyond. On 23 May 1994, a number of these groups and other activists declared the formation of the People's Democratic Association (also PRD), chaired by Sugeng Bahagijo. A split the following year led to Sugeng's leaving the PRD to establish the Indonesian People's Democratic Movement (PADI). The PRD was temporarily led by a presidium, headed by Budiman. It then joined with a number of students, farmers, artists and workers groups.AJI et al. (1997) pp121-124 From 14‚Äì16 April 1996, the PRD held an extraordinary conference, at which it changed its name to the People's Democratic Party. Budimnan was elected chairman and Petrus Hariyanto the secretary general. The party established offices at the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute Foundation in Jakarta on 22 July at a ceremony attended by Megawati Sukarnoputri, who had been recently deposed as leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) in a congress supported by the government and the military.AJI et al. (1997) p. 125 In an act of defiance, PRD presented awards to jailed East Timor opposition leader Xanana Gusm√£o and banned author Pramoedya Ananta Toer. Meanwhile, protests against the ouster of Megawati as PDI leader continued with a march by 5,000 of her supporters in Jakarta on 20 June. This led to clashes with riot police. Megawati's supporters then occupied the PDI head office in Central Jakarta. On 27 July they were forcibly removed after the building was attacked by security forces and hired thugs. This sparked stone-throwing and large scale clashes between crowds of demonstrators and police and soldiers and ended with the largest riots in Jakarta for 12 years, with buildings and cars being burned. The government and the military blamed the PRD for the disturbances, accusing it of being a communist organization with links to the banned Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) and Amnesty International. However the report into the incident by the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) made no mention of the PRD.Friend (2003) pp226-230AJI et al. (1997) pp 94-102 The Indonesian Military made a number of statements to convince the public that PRD leader Budiman was a communist. One spokesman said that Budiman used the word \\"comrade\\" to address his associates. Another stated that the party was deliberately declared on 22 July 1996 as that was the same date as Communist Party of Indonesia chairman D.N. Aidit issued the party manifesto on 22 April 1951. A third military spokesman claimed the PRD manifesto used PKI jargon, while the head of the Armed forces, General Faisal Tanjung said the PRD had the same organizational structure as the PKI. The PRD denied all these accusations, declaring on 30 September that \\"communism is dead\\". However, after being declared fugitives, Budiman, Peterus and other PRD officials were arrested in August and September. The 60-year-old mother of activist Garda Sembiring was arrested to force her son to give himself up. Budiman was sentenced to 13 years in jail for subversion, but was freed in December 1999 after the fall of Suharto by President Abdurrahman Wahid.AJI et al. (1997) pp 103-117 Political philosophy The party has a democratic socialist platform. It opposes the capitalist system, which it believes exploits workers. It wants to see a 21st-century socialism with control over natural and economic resources passing to the people through a democratic revolution. This way, the state would manage these resources, but control would be in the hands of the people through independent organizations such as trade unions, with workers having a decision-making role in factories.

They take place in a post-holocaust world that is hinted to be a colony of earth on another planet where magic works. The German literature agent Uwe Luserke in 1989 devised the concept of three fantasy authors coming together to collaborate to produce a novel: this would describe three different life stories bound together by a single A-Plot of a story of three princesses, who were robbed of their kingdom and try to survive in a hostile world. Norton, Bradley and May agreed to join in the project. May wrote her vision of the story, which Bantam Books agreed to publish and bought the rights for it. The three collaborated on the first novel, Black Trillium: Bradley wrote Haramis' chapters, May authored Anigel's, and Norton contributed Kadiya's. May wrote two sequels, Blood Trillium and Sky Trillium, and Norton and Bradley wrote one each - Golden Trillium and Lady of the Trillium, respectively. Lady of the Trillium takes place many years after the first three novels in the series, and tells of the efforts of the only living sister to find and train a successor to lead the world. A review of Black Trillium in The Rotarian criticized, among other things, \\"the deadly dull characters, and a boring landscape\\"; ascribing the issues to the fact that there were \\"too many cooks\\". The series is described as having \\"shallow\\" characterization, but \\"intense imagery\\".

It involved a combination of armor and horses.  Organization  A cavalry-mechanized group normally consisted of a cavalry corps (a unit smaller than a standard infantry division despite its name) and a mechanized corps, and was slightly stronger than a German Panzergrenadier division. The main force element providing combat power was the armoured and motorized formations of the mechanized corps, while the horse-mounted elements of the cavalry corps provided increased flexibility in infiltration and fighting in difficult terrain such as large forests, or swamps, and the ability to continue mobile operations when cut off from supply lines. Cavalry-mechanized groups were often named after their commander, for example Cavalry-Mechanized Group Pliyev. As an example, during the 1945 Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the Soviet-Mongolian Cavalry-Mechanized Group under the command of Colonel General I.A.Pliyev consisted of the following units: *85th Rifle Corps Headquarters **59th Cavalry Division **25th Mechanized Brigade **27th Motorized Rifle Brigade **43d Tank Brigade **30th Motorcycle Regiment **Aviation-Mixed Division (Mongolian) **5th Mongolian Cavalry Division **6th Mongolian Cavalry Division **7th Mongolian Cavalry Division **8th Mongolian Cavalry Division **7th Motorized Armored Brigade (Mongolian) **3d Separate Tank Regiment (Mongolian) **35th Tank Destroyer Artillery Brigade **1914th Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment **1917th Antiaircraft Artillery Regiment **60th Guards Mortar Regiment (Rocket Launchers) **3d Artillery Regiment (Mongolian) The formation operated in two march columns during the first stage of the battle, advancing rapidly against light opposition, preceded by forward detachments: Column 1: *25th Mechanized Brigade *43d Tank Bde *267th Tank Regt Column 2: *27th Mechanized Rifle Brigade *7th Armored Car Bde *30th Motorcycle Regt  Tactics  Cavalry-mechanized groups were used during the second half of the Soviet-German War, following the successful breaching of a German defense. They would then be inserted to penetrate deep into the rear of the German lines and interrupt supply and reinforcement movements there. This was a risky task, shown for example by the destruction of Cavalry-Mechanized Group Pliyev during the Battle of Debrecen in Hungary, in autumn 1944. Cavalry units in the Red Army usually fought as dismounted infantry. Only when they faced a completely disorganised enemy, for example during the battle of the Korsun Pocket in 1944, or when they were themselves in a desperate situation, such as during Operation Mars in 1942, would they undertake a traditional cavalry charge.  After the Second World War  Cavalry was widely seen as anachronistic by the start of World War II. The Red Army was the only army to make use of cavalry formations in full-scale combat during the war, and despite the successful use of cavalry formations by the Red Army during the war, the last cavalry division, 4th Guards Cavalry Division, was disbanded in 1955.

Typically as a matter of engendering school spirit, the institution either officially or unofficially uses this moniker of the institution's athletic teams also as a nickname to refer to people associated with the institution, especially its current students, but also often its alumni, its faculty, and its administration as well. This practice at the university and college tertiary higher-education level has proven so popular that it extended to the high school secondary-education level in the United States and in recent years even to the primary-education level as well. Themes In the United States, multiple recurring themes have appeared over time for choosing a school's athletic nickname. In almost all cases, the institution chooses an athletic nickname with an overtly positive goal in mind, where that goal reflects the character of the institution‚Äîeither a previously established characteristic or a characteristic hoped for as a goal henceforth. Abstract concept Often by choosing an abstract concept as its athletic moniker, the institution wants to inspire its student-athletes on and off the field to achieve success that the abstract concept represents. Examples: Cornell Big Red, Stanford Cardinal, UIC Flames, Tulane Green Wave. Animal Often by choosing an animal, the school wants to emphasize the instillation of fear of losing athletic competitions to the institution's teams, such as through an especially fierce or stealthy animal. When the school chooses an animal as its athletic nickname, usually in the plural or as a collective noun for a group of that animal, then typically, the school has that animal (in the singular) as its mascot, either specifically named with a proper noun or generically referred to without a proper noun. Examples: Michigan Wolverines, Oregon Ducks, Princeton Tigers, Iowa Hawkeyes, California Golden Bears, Minnesota Golden Gophers, Texas Longhorns. Collection Often by choosing a collection that represents a summary of the institution's students or of its history. Such a collection may refer to an ethnicity; a profession; religious designation, such as saints; or other groupings of people. A portion of athletic monikers that fall into this collection category started originally as derogatory epithets from others, but as an act of defiance, the school embraced the term as a rallying cry to overcome the term's negative origin. Because a collection is hard to represent or iconify, when a school chooses a collection as its athletic nickname, the school typically chooses a related but different mascot that symbolizes that collection. Examples: Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Oklahoma Sooners, Purdue Boilermakers, Illinois Fighting Illini, Texas A&M; Aggies Hero or archetype A small number of schools choose an archetypical heroic person as their official athletic nickname. This person may be a graduate of the school who is viewed as embodying the school's mission or an archetypal person who is symbolic of the school's area, such as the West Virginia University Mountaineer. In religiously affiliated schools, this person may be a historical person in the religion who has been bestowed an official designation in that religion, such as a saint in Roman Catholic or Orthodox Christianity. Native American likeness Likenesses to Native Americans were at one time widely popular athletic monikers, especially for schools that adopted them in the 19th or early 20th century. In recent years, some Native American organizations have protested the unlicensed use of likenesses of Native Americans related to team names, team logos, athletic monikers, cheerleaders, and cheering techniques. The granting of overtly expressed written licenses by Native American organizations to use likenesses of Native Americans in these ways is rare, although not unheard of. In one notable example, two major groups of the Seminole nation, the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Seminole Nation of Oklahoma, have expressly given Florida State University permission to use the nickname \\"Seminoles\\" and certain Seminole imagery. Central Michigan University has a similar arrangement with the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe to use the name \\"Chippewas\\". Because of protests from some Native American organizations, some schools have changed their athletic moniker and mascot and cheering practices without significant objection once the issue was raised, especially if such offense toward a group of people was viewed as incompatible with that school's stated mission or if the threat of legal action was too burdensome. Other schools or their student bodies have defended their use of Native American likenesses, especially if the institution views the use of Native American likenesses as respectful or so intimately tied with history to be inseparable from the institution, such as if the name of institution derives from the name of a tribe. Still other schools have embarked on a series of failed attempts to find a replacement. Common and uncommon names Often, certain nicknames (animals and some abstract concepts, such as Giants, Broncos, or Wildcats) become very common. However, some nicknames are unique to that school/team such as Illini, Demon Deacons or Fords.

The original company was founded in 1867 but went bankrupt and was bought out by Friedrich Krupp. Krupp was very interested in building warships and in the time before the First World War built a number of battleships for the Kaiserliche Marine, including , , , and . A total of 84 U-boats were built in the shipyard during the war. After the war it returned to the normal production of yachts and transports. History The company was founded in 1867 by Lloyd Foster, as the Norddeutsche Schiffbau-Gesellschaft, in the town of Gaarden, near Kiel. The idea of the company was to construct war and merchant ships. In 1876 the company built the personal yacht of Kaiser Wilhelm II, the . The company went bankrupt in 1879 and had to be sold and became property of the M√§rkisch-Schlesischen Maschinenbau und H√ºtten- Aktiengesellschaft. They had constructed steam engines in Berlin since 1822. A few years later this company also got in trouble and in late 1882 a new company was founded, the Schiff- und Maschinenbau-Actien-Gesellschaft Germania. A few more warships were constructed and the company also had a very good reputation concerning the construction of torpedo boats. However the financial problems were never far away and by the end of August 1896 Krupp took over, as they were very interested in building warships themselves. Between 1898 and 1902 the company doubled its surface and new and large slips were constructed. In 1902 the company changed name and became the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft. In 1908, Germaniawerft built the schooner Germania for Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, based on a design from Max Oertz. It was the first yacht of its size built in Germany. In the period preceding World War I, it also built a number of battleships for the Kaiserliche Marine, including , , and . During the First World War, the company turned to building U-boats. A total of 84 U-boats were delivered to the Kaiserliche Marine. Afterwards, it returned to its original vocation, including building the steel-hulled barque Magdalene Vinnen II, now and the largest traditional sailing ship still afloat. During World War II, the Germaniawerft was one of the most important suppliers of the Kriegsmarine, because of its proximity to German naval facilities in Kiel. Over the course of the war, the company completed 131 U-boats (types II, VII, XB, XIV, XVII, and XXIII). The Kriegsmarine had in total ordered 240 U-boats. In 1944, the shipyard had over 10,000 employees, of which roughly 11% were forced labourers. On 26 April 1945, the last U-boat built in the Germaniawerft was launched, . The war ended before it could enter into service. The most famous U-boats built at the Germaniawerft are probably , which was commanded by G√ºnther Prien during his sinking of in 1940, and , which formed the basis of Lothar-G√ºnther Buchheim's novel Das Boot. After the war, the partially ruined shipyard was one of the first facilities dismantled by the victorious Allies. The population of heavily bombed Kiel protested furiously this decision, but to no avail. The site was broken up and not rebuilt. In the late 1960s, the grounds were purchased by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft as a submarine-building shipyard. As of 2015, submarines are being built at the site.

The plot follows two teenage girls who find themselves in serious danger after making a prank phone call to a man who just murdered his wife. The screenplay by William P. McGivern was based upon the 1964 novel Out of the Dark by Ursula Curtiss. The film was produced and directed by William Castle. Plot When teenage friends Libby Mannering (Andi Garrett) and Kit Austin (Sara Lane) are home alone with Libby's younger sister Tess (Sharyl Locke), they amuse themselves by randomly dialing telephone numbers asking prank questions, telling whomever answers: \\"I saw what you did, and I know who you are.\\" Libby places a call to Steve Marak (John Ireland), a man who had just murdered his wife Judith (Joyce Meadows) and disposed of her body in the woods. Believing he has been found out, Marak wants to track down the caller in order to silence her. Marak's neighbor Amy (Joan Crawford), who is in love with him and had been trying to woo him away from his wife, listens in on the line while Marak is speaking with Libby. Intrigued by Marak's voice, Libby takes Tess and a frightened Kit along on a drive to Marak's address. Amy discovers Libby and chases her off, thinking that Libby is Marak's younger, inadvertently saving Libby from being murdered by Marak, who has seen her and grabbed a knife. Amy snatches the registration card from the car before Libby drives away and gives it to Marak, telling him to keep it as a souvenir of his last fling. Amy tries to blackmail him into marrying her, telling him she knows about the murder, but he stabs her to death after they have a drink. With Libby's address and phone number from the car registration, Marak calls to ask if her parents are home and then sets out to the Mannering home. Libby's mother, 90 miles away in Santa Barbara with her husband, is frantic with worry when no one answers the home phone and has her husband call the police to check the house. A patrolman visits and finds that the three girls are safe. Libby, afraid of losing her driving privileges, swears Kit to secrecy over their misadventure. While Kit's father is driving her home, a news report over the car's radio announces that a woman's body has been found in the woods and provides a description of a man who was seen leaving the burial site. Marak arrives at enters the Mannering home and questions Libby and Tess about the call. Libby convinces him that it was just a prank. He returns her mother's identification and leaves, but waits outside. When Kit calls, she tells Libby that Marak matches the description of the killer about whom she had heard on the radio. Marak overhears and enters to silence Libby and Tess, but they evade him. Libby tries to escape but cannot start her parents' car. Marak emerges from the back seat and starts to strangle Libby, but he is shot by a police officer who had come back to the Mannering house after Kit revealed the secret to her father, who phoned the police.

The announcer in the film's trailer says repeatedly: \\"DON'T ANSWER IT!!!\\" Critical reviews Howard Thompson called I Saw What You Did a \\"generally broad and belabored expansion of a nifty idea\\"; he considered redundant the \\"middle chapter\\" of the film, \\"involving the aroused, snarling killer\\" and thought the film should have \\"held to the impressionable viewpoint of the youngsters.\\" Saturday Review noted \\"Unfortunately, there is little for the eye, ear, or mind in William Castle's egregiously low-budgeted I Saw What You Did, an attempt at terror starring Joan Crawford and John Ireland.\\" Variety wrote \\"[The film] is a well-produced, well-acted entry in the suspense-terror field....[Crawford's] slightest gesture or expression...conveys vivid emotion.\\" Home video releases I Saw What You Did was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment on VHS and Region 1 DVD on August 24, 1999; both releases are out of print. On May 23, 2014, it was re-released as an exclusive DVD-R by Universal as part of its Universal Vault Series, but in a full-frame presentation. On May 17, 2016, Shout!

Raising nearly $0.24 for charity and another $0.19 in sales tax per attendee over twenty years, the ‚ÄúLargest US Charity Rally‚Äù was suspended in 2020. The festival had a good safety record. In 2011, there were no reported fatalities. Repeatedly, citizens of Fayetteville \\"have argued whether the event is right for Fayetteville's small business community.\\" Paradoxically many local business owners reported steep declines in revenue during the event. With an aging ridership and declining attendance, Executive Director Tommy Sisemore said \\"We have definitely tried to evolve the rally to attract new usership.\\", having stated \\"I wouldn't have taken the job if I didn't think the rally was sustainable.\\" \\"We call it 'playing dress-up' around here... we don't expect the Hells Angels,\\" says Sisemore. In 2017, the rally organizers banned Confederate flag and Nazi merchandise from being sold by official vendors, inspected each day for any \\"lewd or offensive\\" material by an off duty police officer. However white supremacist merchandise remained on sale in 2019. With fewer attendees, organizers tried to incorporate programming suitable for families.

The event was billed as the \\"Largest US Charity Rally\\", although there have long been questions about the overall scale of this support: In 2006 and 2007, the event raised $100,000 (an estimated $0.25-$0.30 per attendee); in 2008 charitable contributions were suspended despite record attendance. In 2009 contributions totalled $48,500, or approximately $0.15 per attendee. In the 2010 press release announcing the organization had raised a total of $80,000 from 400,000 attendees, its director Nelson Driver was quoted as saying \\"This is what it‚Äôs all about.\\" In 2016, Bikes Blues & BBQ contributed the most money to date, $230,000 generated from an estimated 350,000 participants, or about 65 cents per attendee. In 2016, the Fayetteville City Council considered an ordinance that would force discussion of the impact of large festivals such as Bikes Blues and BBQ on local businesses. However, despite BBBBQ's negative impact on most small business owners, no public reason was given for this ordinance being tabled indefinitely, and to date there has never been a public forum to discuss the impact of the festival on small business owners and downtown residents.\\\\ The City of Fayetteville has not tracked sales-tax revenue but estimated the rally brought in approximately $80,000 in sales taxes in recent years; some have questioned why this amounted to just $10 in taxed sales ‚Äî $0.20 in taxes ‚Äî per attendee. A sister festival, Bikes Babes and Bling, was first held July 1‚Äì3, 2010, also in Fayetteville. The City of Fayetteville provided subsidies to both the 2010 and 2011 Bikes Babes and Bling festivals. In 2010 the sister festival drew approximately 5000 participants; the Northwest Arkansas Times reported that \\"only a few dozen people\\" were at the site midday on the main day of the 2011 festival. In addition to the rally, there were many bands, a parade, a bike show, a bike giveaway, barbecues, the Bikes, Blues, and BBQ Babes contest, and many other official and unofficial events.

With its prominent hilltop location, Vomero is noted for the medieval fortress, Castel Sant'Elmo; its three funiculars connecting to adjacent historic districts ‚Äî and its vantage, overlooking greater Naples, Mount Vesuvius, the Bay of Naples and the Tyrrhenian Sea. The quarter borders Arenella, Soccavo, Fuorigrotta, Chiaia, Montecalvario and Avvocata. Streets are named after noted Neopolitan painters, sculptors, composers and architects ‚Äî prominent at the time of the quarter's initial development. Once primarily agricultural, Vomero is now heavily urbanized. Residents go by the demonym Vomeresi. The highest point of the neighborhood is the Certosa di San Martino with an altitude of 251 metres. Aerial photo of Vomero. Aerial photo from Sant'Elmo fortress. St. Martin's cloisters, 14th century. Etymology During the very earliest period, when Greek settlements were established in the Naples area in the second millennium BC, the Vomerese hill was called Bom√≤s (Œ≤œâŒºœåœÇ, or \\"high ground\\"). By the sixteenth century the name Vomero was used, possibly a corruption of the Greek Bom√≤s. In Roman times, the hilltop area was called Paturcium, from Patulcius, a name related to Giano, the god to whom the hill was dedicated. In the early Middle Ages, via linguistic corruption, this became Patruscolo or Patruscio. The name Vomero took hold at the end of the sixteenth century, deriving from the area's agricultural history ‚Äî and initially referring to a historic farmhouse located on the hill, rather than the hill itself. The word vomere, refers to a ploughshare (the blade of a plough); and also a contemporaneous agricultural game that would award the plowman who could trace the straightest furrow. The hilltop's agricultural activity earned it various nicknames, including Broccoli Hill, il Quartiere dei Broccoli and Collina dei Broccoli.  History  Tavola Strozzi, 1474) Until the end of the nineteenth century, Vomero constituted an almost uninhabited periphery, far from the city of Naples. Its most ancient parts, e.g., the Antignano district, were rural dwellings and villages remaining from Roman times, near the \\"Via Puteolis Neapolim per colles\\" road ‚Äî that before the excavation of the tunnel connecting Fuorigrotta and Mergellina was the only land connection between the Phlegraean area and the city. Around the 2nd century AD the street was rearranged and called via Antiniana, hence the name of the district. Precisely in the ancient village that today is the district of Antignano, tradition has it that the miracle of San Gennaro took place for the first time, between 413 and 431. Geographically, Vomero is noted for its hilltop location, originally connected to the Naples downtown by a series of Petraio, ancient alluvial deposits descending the hillside, ultimately becoming a series of stairs and ramps which remain today. Later, after the Norman and Swabian domination, with the Angevins Naples became the capital in 1266 (it remained so until the Unification of Italy in 1860). Thus the need to rise up the slopes of the Vomerese hill began to arise, above all for strategic reasons. Thus the area began to populate especially since the construction of the Carthusian Cloister in 1325 and almost simultaneously the Angevins replaced the ancient watchtower (of the Norman period) near which the Cloister was built, with the Castle of Belforte, the starting point of the Castel Sant'Elmo. However, the structure of the remaining vomerese territory remained unchanged. OttoUnder the Aragonese and then under the Spaniards, Naples experienced a dizzying demographic increase, due to the strong immigration from the Iberian peninsula and the rest of the kingdom. The need to widen the city territory led the Viceroy Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo to direct the development of the city (then only flat) towards the slopes of the hills, which until then had been devoid of significant residential settlements. However, in 1556 a law forbade the construction of new buildings around Sant'Elmo and, in 1583, even on the slopes of the hill. Giorgio Sommer of 1860-70 circa In the period of the viceroys following Don Pedro, the building expansion followed, causing the merger of innumerable villages; even on the hill more homogeneous agglomerations began to form, villages and hamlets. In the seventeenth century in the cartography of the city the first hilly constructions began to be represented.¬´Questa contrada detta il Vomere √® ricca di monasteri e di bellissime casine per essere l'aria salutifera avendo un aspetto al mare¬ª. Cos√¨ nel 1692 Carlo Celano descrive la collina in \\"Notizie del bello, dell'antico, e del curioso della citt√† di Napoli\\". During the plague of 1656, the hill was used as a refuge by the nobility and clergy: in fact the tendency in the aristocracy residing in the historic center to establish a second home at the Vomero, a tendency that will be accentuated during the eighteenth century, was affirmed especially thanks to the opening of the new \\"Infrascata street\\" (Via Salvator Rosa). Among the many noble families who settled in Vomero, the Carafa, the Counts of Acerra, the Ruffo di Sicilia, the Cacciottoli, the Cangiani. In 1817, the Vomero was promoted to the rank of residence not only noble, but also royal, with the acquisition of a villa by Ferdinand I of Bourbon: the future Floridiana. In 1809, in the new administrative division of the city operated by Joachim Murat, all the villages of the Vomero became part of the city proper, in the district of the Avvocata. Finally, towards the middle of the 19th century, the opening of Corso Maria Teresa (renamed Corso Vittorio Emanuele after 1860), commissioned by Ferdinando II, delimited the lower border of the future Vomero district.  The foundation of the new Rione and the urbanization of the Vomero  Piazza Vanvitelli in the fifties The actual housing development of Vomero began towards the end of the nineteenth century, more precisely in 1885, with the foundation (under the law \\"for the Restoration of Naples\\") of the New District and the design of a road layout to reticular mesh and radial pattern that applied the rationalistic dictates in vogue throughout the European urbanism of the end of the century, according to the example of Baron Haussmann's Paris (similar experiences in Italian urbanism are found in the Roman quarters of Esquilino and Testaccio). from the first moment the Vomero was conceived as a residential neighborhood destined for the upper-middle classes: the splendid villas and buildings in late Liberty style that were built in large numbers at the beginning of the century around the Villa Floridiana and towards the area of Castel Sant'Elmo and San Martino's constituted the distinctive feature of the new district until the mid-20th century. Upper station of the Central Funicular, in Piazza Fuga In addition, before the law on recovery, a Piedmontese bank, the Tiberina bank, had purchased land at the Vomero between San Martino, via Belvedere and Antignano, with the intention of building a new neighborhood (Garibaldi had already thought of this to the hilly areas as potential new wards, where, however, he believed the proletariat should be hosted) The laying of the foundation stone by the sovereigns took place on 11 May 1885 and, on 20 October 1889, the New Rione was inaugurated, with the opening of the Funicular of Chiaia, followed by the Funicolare di Montesanto in 1891. Until that date, but still for several decades later, life and therefore the history of the Vomerese hill and that of the city of Naples evolved separately. \\"I go to Naples\\", \\"I go down to Naples\\" were the sentences of the vomeresi to indicate the journey to the center of the city. But, after 11 May 1885, the Vomero slowly began to settle territorially with the city. The first example of \\"urban\\" buildings was the \\"Four Palaces\\" in Piazza Vanvitelli, built at the beginning of the 20th century by Banca Tiberina. After the beginning of the works, however, the scarce reactivity of the market (due to the economic difficulties of the time and the still difficult connections between the city and the hill) pushed the bank (owner of the built-up areas and of the two funiculars) to yield in the 1899 its rights to the Bank of Italy. This caused the suspension for several years of the works envisaged by the urbanization plan (the result of the agreement signed between the Municipality and Banca Tiberina). At the beginning of the twentieth century, only a part of the buildings in the center of the Vomero (between Piazza Vanvitelli, along Via Scarlatti and Via Morghen) were made (in addition to the layout of the subdivision). All the new buildings were in neo-Renaissance style, which in Naples will last until the first three decades of the twentieth century, dragging the projects of the late nineteenth century through the years. The Bank of Italy, in order to recover the capital invested, decided to sell the buildings already built and the land, and split the blocks into smaller lots that could be more easily sold. Consequently, in the early years of the twentieth century there was no impetuous urban development, but less intensive construction of small, two- storey and small-scale villas was built, surrounded by pretty gardens; which, moreover, had the ability to better enhance the landscape aspects of the places, compared to the large Umbertine buildings. The architectural taste that characterized the period, up until the mid-twenties, was that defined liberty together with the so-called neo-eclectic. Villa La Santarella by Eduardo Scarpetta The opening of the new Central Funicular (Funiculare Centrale), in 1928, facilitating the movement between the Vomero and the center, led to a significant increase in urbanization, which again turned towards the large buildings, also built according to the various styles then in fashion (from the liberty to neo-eclecticism, to the first rationalism). The new inhabited center expanded to reach the ancient villages (Vomero Vecchio, Antignano), incorporating them.  From the second post-war period to today  In the second post-war period, the ever more consistent housing demand and the consequent building speculation of the sixties replaced the sober and elegant architecture of the Vomer area with huge buildings in reinforced concrete. With the disappearance of most of the gardens and the destruction of most of the Art Nouveau villas and some Umbertine buildings, the Vomero has become a middle-class neighborhood, going as far as to incorporate the Arenella and pushing itself to the slopes of Camaldoli hill, not without some authentic building havoc (like the infamous Chinese Wall of Mario Ottieri on Via Aniello Falcone, or the buildings on Via Caldieri).¬´In 1966, faced with the landslides and landslides that ravaged the city, especially the hilly areas, the Municipality appointed a Commission of high- profile local technicians to study the subsoil of Naples and make technical recommendations. The report of the commission, written in October 1967, begins, literally, as follows: \\"A lava of houses has submerged Naples, incredibly. The hills have been attacked, the green destroyed, the places upset by building speculation. [...] La city now looks like a grotesque concrete crib, clinging to a bare tufaceous ridge ... The nefarious authentic tampering of Naples belongs indeed to a very recent age and is a consequence of the profound cultural and moral depression that intervened in this post-war period. of time that starts from the fifties, serious and irreversible alterations of one of the most beautiful landscapes in the world have been allowed, and the ordered and civil urban development of the city has been compromised, it has even blindly attacked the safety and life of the citizens, Neapolitans: the reason, the sense of civilization, the love for Naples have failed at all levels of responsibility, and they have no cost it was a valid barrier against the rampant violence of building speculation.¬ª (Antonio La Gala, \\"Il Vomero e l'Arenella\\", Ed. Guida). Currently the Vomero is a residential area with a high population and commercial density, which preserves the image of a pleasant, rich and wealthy neighborhood. The district still retains many examples of the original architecture, which constitute a heritage for all Italian architecture. Furthermore it is still possible to observe, in addition to the monuments already mentioned, historical buildings, such as, for example, some of the oldest noble villas (Villa del Pontano, Villa Belvedere, Villa Regina, Villa Lucia, Villa Haas, Villa Presenzano or Diaz, Villa Ricciardi , Villa Leonetti, Villa Salve) is an ancient Bourbon duty building, in the Antignano district. Between the Corso Vittorio Emanuele and the gardens of the Certosa di San Martino there is the Vigna San Martino which has been present for about six centuries. Transit The oldest means of transit in the neighborhood, built between 1800 and 1900, are three funiculars (Funicolare di Chiaia, Funicolare di Montesanto and Funicolare Centrale) that connect Vomero to the city downtown. The district is also connected to the metropolitan system of the city, via Line 1 of the Naples Metro (with the Quattro Giornate and Vanvitelli stops). Line 1 of the Naples subway has helped to streamline vehicular traffic that clogged the access roads to the Vomerese hill, quickly connecting the Vomero to the historic center and the neighborhoods of the northern suburbs of Naples. Vomero, like other densely populated areas of the city, is one of the busiest neighborhoods in the city. It features an active pedestrian zone formed in 1994, connecting to Piazza Vanvitelli, via Cimarosa and via Alessandro Scarlatti. Since 11 November 2008 the zone has also incorporated via Luca Giordano, a link between upper and lower Vomero, the San Martino area, via Cilea, via Belvedere and the oldest area of Vomero, the Antignano district. One of the exits of the Naples Tangenziale highway (Vomero, exit 9) leads to two of the main streets of the neighborhood: via Cilea and via Caldieri. The via Pigna junction from the same exit, leads to the neighboring districts of Soccavo and Arenella. Recently, three urban escalators opened to connect the area of Piazza Fuga and Piazza Vanvitelli more easily to the upper area of Via Scarlatti, in front of the upper station of the Montesanto Funicular, a few hundred meters from Castel S.Elmo and the Certosa di S.Martino. Numerous bus lines connect Vomero to the rest of the city.

Napoli Film Festival is one of the most significant film festivals in Campania which takes place in June at Castel Sant'Elmo. Italian film industry  In the early twentieth century, some of the first Italian film production houses were born at Vomero. The first in the city was the Partenope Film (originally Fratelli Troncone & C.), of Guglielmo, Vincenzo and Roberto Troncone, who, born in 1906, was active for about twenty years, with headquarters and theaters in via Solimena. In 1915 the Polifilms of Giuseppe Di Luggo was officially founded. The company, founded in 1912 as a film distribution company with the name De Luggo & C., was transformed in 1914 into a film factory, originally called Napoli Film, with headquarters and theater in via Cimarosa. In 1919 the Polifilms in economic difficulties ceded its installations and theaters of installation to Gustavo Lombardo, already owner of the distribution company SIGLA (Italian Society Gustavo Lombardo Anonima), which gave life to Lombardo Film, the future Titanus.  The Vomero during the Four days  The contribution of the Vomero to the Four Days of Naples (27-30 September 1943) was remarkable. It was in fact at the Vomero that the first clashes were recorded, first near the Pagliarone farm (where a group of armed people stopped a German car killing the marshal who was driving), then at the crossroads between Via Scarlatti and Via Cimarosa, where the Germanic motocarrozzetta was overturned causing the death of the two occupants and the German retaliation, therefore in various squares of the district, in particular in Piazza Vanvitelli (where a dozen young vomeresi left a bar attacked three German soldiers, after it had arrived at the Vomero news of the death of a sailor, shot with a pistol by a Nazi) and in the square of the then Littorio Stadium, called \\"Piazza Mascagni\\" and today renamed Piazza Quattro Giornate. The Germans had in fact decided to use the stadium as a concentration camp for the insurgents; the partisans surrounded the camp and, armed only with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a few pistols and guns, managed to free the prisoners. The previous night the armory of Castel Sant'Elmo had fallen, not without bloodshed; the Germans in fact, barricaded even inside the Villa Floridiana, intervened in force to give battle. The Sannazaro High School became a meeting and coordination place for the Resistance, here Professor Antonio Tarsia in the Curia declared himself head of the insurgents on September 30, 1943, assuming full civil and military powers. Four days were transported for the commemoration. Today in the district three memorial stones are placed in memory of the events: on the facade of the Liceo Sannazaro, next to the entrance of the Carabinieri barracks in Piazza Quattro Giornate, and the third, probably the most important, in Via Belvedere in front to the ancient main entrance of the Pagliarone farm where the first revolt was born.  Culture and sport  Internapoli Camaldoli S.S.D. is the area's main football team. The neighborhood also hosts the sports complex that grew up around the Stadio Arturo Collana in Naples, where rugby, judo, athletics, swimming, volleyball, artistic gymnastics, skating, tennis, fencing, American football and soccer are practiced. The stadium, built during the Fascist era with the name \\"Stadio dei martiri fascisti\\" or \\"Stadio Littorio\\", has long been the home field of Naples before the completion of the San Paolo Stadium in 1959, and is still that of the A.P. Partenope Rugby. It was also the scene of dramatic events during the Four Days of Naples, and therefore the adjacent square took on the name of Piazza Quattro Giornate. The Vomero was also the seat of the women's basketball team Vomero Basket, champion of Italy in the 2006-07 season, even though she played for a long time at PalaBarbuto due to the impracticability of the necklace gym. Finally from the 2012-13 season the Stadio Arturo Collana hosts the women's soccer team of Naples. In this district there is also the seat of the Vomero Tennis Club, which hosts every national and international tennis event.

After the Norman Conquest, the whole area became part of the Hundred of Wirral.Stephen J. Roberts, A History of Wirral, 2002, In the 1800s the land on which Brotherton Park resides was part of an estate called 'Woodslee', this estate was bought in 1866 by a Liverpool Merchant called Robert Rankin who built 'Woodslee' house on the site as a wedding present for his daughter. The estate comprised Woodslee, servants cottages, a lake, stables, coach house, a walled garden and formal gardens with a rockery. At some stage it was sold William_Johnston_of_Liverpool who is listed as living there in the 1901 Census.http://dibbinsdale.co.uk/park/History%20of%20Dibbinsdale.pdf In 1919 the estate was bought by Lord Brotherton, an industrialist and member of parliament who donated the estate to the council in the 1930s, by the 1940s the house had become dilapidated and was demolished. In 1978 Brotherton Park and Dibbinsdale was designated a local nature reserve owing to the ancient woodland and became a single entity with much of Dibbinsdale donated by the Lancelyn Green family. Brotherton Park Brotherton Park is an urban park with an informal grassed area for recreation, dog walking and picnicking.

In silos, material is fed through the top and removed from the bottom. Typical silo applications include animal feed, industrial powders, cement, and pharmaceuticals. Free movement of stored materials, on a first-in, first-out basis, is essential in maximizing silo efficiency. The goal of silo efficiency is to ensure that the oldest material is used first and does not contaminate newer, fresher material. There are two major complications in silo efficiency: rat holing and bridging. Rat holing occurs when powders adhere to the sides of silos. Bridging occurs when material blocks at the silo base. Manual cleaning is the simplest way to clean silos. This entails lowering a worker on a rope to free material inside the silo. Manual cleaning is dangerous due to the release of material and the possible presence of gases. In cases of bridging, an additional danger exists as the exit hole needs to be rodded from underneath, exposing the worker to falling powder. Alternative cleaning methods include: *Air blasters are a well-established cleaning method. Air cannons are expensive, however, as limited coverage requires purchase of multiple units. Air cannons are also noise intrusive and require high consumption of compressed air. *Vibrators are easy to fit into empty silos, but can cause structural damage and contribute to powder compaction. *Low friction linings are quiet, but expensive to install and prone to erosion which can then contaminate the environment or product. *Inflatable pads and liners are easy to install in empty silos and can help side-wall buildup but have no effect on bridging. Inflatable pads and liners are also hard to maintain and can cause compaction. *Fluidisation through a one-way membrane can help compacted material, but are expensive and difficult to install and maintain. These systems can also contribute to mechanical interlocking and bridging. *Acoustic cleaners are the latest and possibly safest way to clean silos as these systems are non-invasive and do not require silos to be emptied. Acoustic cleaning is also a preventative solution. *Pneumatic or hydraulic whip machines are portable machines used to \\"cut\\" build up on the walls of silos while being remotely operated from outside of the vessel. *Silo cleaning companies provide turn key silo cleaning services using several different kinds of methods (depending on the company). * Category:Cleaning ","title":"Silo cleaning"},{"id":"4237784","text":"Deborah Adair (born Deborah Adair Miller on May 23, 1952 in Lynchburg, Virginia) is an American television actress, primarily known for her roles in soap operas.

R. Banerjee, The Iron Age in India, 1965). Note that the use of \\"Iron Age\\" for the Kali Yuga is earlier but unrelated, referencing references the mythological \\"Ages of Man\\" of Hesiod. The main Iron Age archaeological cultures of present-day northern India are the Painted Grey Ware culture (1300 to 300 BCE)Uesugi, Akinori, (2018). \\"An Overview on the Iron Age in South Asia\\", in (ed.) Akinori Uesugi, Iron Age in South Asia, Kansai University, Fig. 6, pp. 9-12. and the Northern Black Polished Ware (700 to 200 BCE). This corresponds to the transition of the Janapadas or principalities of the Vedic period to the sixteen Mahajanapadas or region-states of the early historic period, culminating in the emergence of the Maurya Empire towards the end of the period. The earliest evidence of iron smelting predates the emergence of the Iron Age proper by several centuries. \\"the date of the beginning of iron smelting in India may well be placed as early as the sixteenth century BC [...] by about the early decade of thirteenth century BCE iron smelting was definitely known in India on a bigger scale\\" Rakesh Tewari (2003), The origins of Iron-working in India: New evidence from the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas. Archaeology Online Researches A team of archaeologists discovered several iron artefacts, including small knives, in Telangana in 2015, dating back to 1,800 BCE to 2,400 BCE. These iron artefacts were tested at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI). R. Tewari (2003) radiocarbon dated iron artefacts in Uttar Pradesh, including furnaces, tuyeres and slag between c. 1800 and 1000 BCE. Iron using and iron working was prevalent in the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas from the early second millennium BCE.Rakesh Tewari (2003).

The beginning of the use of iron has been traditionally associated with the eastward migration of the later Vedic people, who are also considered as an agency which revolutionised material culture particularly in eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Scholar Rakesh Tewari states that new finds and their dates suggest the need for a fresh review. According to him, the evidence corroborates the early use of iron in other areas of the country, and attests that India was indeed an independent centre for the development of the working of iron.Rakesh Tewari (2003), The origins of Iron-working in India: New evidence from the Central Ganga Plain and the Eastern Vindhyas.

Early life McAloon was born and grew up in Witton Gilbert in County Durham, England. He trained as a Catholic priest before deciding to commit to a career in music. Career Prefab Sprout enjoyed considerable success in the 1980s and early 1990s. They peaked commercially with \\"The King of Rock 'N' Roll\\", which was a top ten single in the UK Singles Chart. Songs written by McAloon have also been recorded by Kylie Minogue (\\"If You Don't Love Me\\"), Cher (\\"The Gunman\\"), Wendy Matthews (\\"God Watch Over You\\" and \\"Ride\\"), Sondre Lerche (\\"Nightingales\\" ‚Äì the song appeared in \\"From Langley Park to Memphis\\" and Lerche sang it with the Faces Down Quartet as a tribute to Prefab Sprout), Danny Seward (\\"Home (Where The Heart Is)\\"), Momus (\\"Green Isaac Pt. 2\\"), and various songs for Jimmy Nail. \\"God Watch Over You\\" has also been covered by Frances Ruffelle, and \\"When Love Breaks Down\\" has been covered by The Zombies, Lisa Stansfield, and Snow Patrol. In 2008, the covers album Independents Day 08 included a version of \\"Bonny\\" performed by McAloon's label-mate Tom Smith of Editors. McAloon released the spoken word/instrumental album I Trawl the Megahertz (UK No. 167), under his own name, in 2003 on the EMI subsidiary company Liberty Records. After losing his eyesight, now somewhat restored, he listened to CB radio and call-in talk shows and found inspiration for the album. In a 2013 interview, McAloon stated: > That record [I Trawl The Megahertz] was so important to me. I was > disappointed‚Äîextremely‚Äîthat the Guardian never even reviewed it. That stayed > with me. I kept waiting week after week: \\"Come on, if you're thinking they > don't make records like they used to, if you're looking for personal vision, > something unusual‚ÄîI'm your guy!\\" But it never came. A remastered ‚ÄòI Trawl The Megahertz‚Äô was reissued by Sony in February 2019, credited to Prefab Sprout. In 2006 Prefab Sprout's Steve McQueen album was remastered by Thomas Dolby, and was then released in 2007 as a double-CD package. The second CD featured acoustic versions of songs from the original album that were recorded in 2006. On 7 September 2009, Prefab Sprout released the album Let's Change the World with Music, based on a demo recording from 1992. A Prefab Sprout album entitled Crimson/Red was released by Icebreaker Records in October 2013. McAloon is responsible for playing all of the instruments on the album. On 3 March 2017, McAloon, under the Prefab Sprout name, was shown singing a new song, America, on the Instagram and YouTube channels of Keith Armstrong, his manager and the former boss of Kitchenware Records. Seeming to be a protest song about the administration of Donald Trump, and released with no accompanying publicity the song was the subject of discussion and speculation. Personal life As of September 2013, McAloon resides in his native County Durham with his wife and three daughters: Georgia, Cecilia and Grace. He suffers from a detached retina and tinnitus.

In a racing career which lasted from 1972 until 1981 he competed in eighty-five races, and won thirty- seven times. He was best known for his performances in hurdle races when he won the Champion Hurdle on two occasions. He was also one of the best flat stayers of his era winning major handicap races under weights of up to 140 pounds. As a gelding, he was ineligible to compete in the most prestigious flat staying races, such as the Ascot Gold Cup. On his retirement he was described as Britain's \\"best known horse after Arkle and Red Rum. Background Sea Pigeon was a dark-brown horse bred by his owner, Jock Whitney at the Greentree Stud in the United States. He was sired by the great Derby winner Sea Bird. Sea Pigeon's dam, Around the Roses, ran second in the Acorn Stakes and went on to produce the American turf champion Bowl Game. As a yearling Sea Pigeon was sent into training with Jeremy Tree in England. Racing career Sea Pigeon won once as a two-year-old in October 1972, when he was ridden to victory by Lester Piggott in the Duke of Edinburgh Stakes at Ascot. In early 1973, he was considered a serious contender for the Classics. He ran in the 1973 Epsom Derby and finished seventh behind Morston. By the end of 1973, Sea Pigeon's indifferent form led to him being thought \\"ungenuine, highly-strung and difficult to handle.\\" He was subsequently gelded and was sold for ¬£8,000 to Pat Muldoon, who sent the horse to National Hunt trainer Gordon W. Richards. After showing modest form on the flat in 1974, Sea Pigeon was switched to hurdles. In his first two seasons as a hurdler, he showed steadily improving form, winning several races and finishing placed behind notable hurdlers including Lanzarote and Birds Nest. In late 1976, after a defeat at Kempton, Sea Pigeon joined Peter (M.H.) Easterby's stable at Habton Grange near Malton, North Yorkshire. In the second half of the 1976‚Äì77 National Hunt season, he became a top-class performer in hurdle races, finishing fourth to his stable companion Night Nurse in the Champion Hurdle and winning the Scottish Champion Hurdle at Ayr. His flat career also started to blossom with a succession of wins in top handicaps - he won the Chester Cup in 1977 and 1978, and the Ebor Handicap carrying 10 stone, which is still a record, in 1979. Sea Pigeon was ridden to his Ebor win by his regular hurdles partner Jonjo O'Neill ‚Äì due to the long ITV strike of that year, only those who were present at York that day saw it. He missed the early part of the 1977‚Äì78 jumps season after being injured in the Colonial Cup but returned in spring to finish runner-up to Monksfield in the Champion Hurdle. He won a second Scottish Champion Hurdle, taking advantage of the fatal fall of Golden Cygnet at the final flight. In the following season, his best performances came when beating Birds Nest in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle and finishing second again to Monksfield in the Champion Hurdle. Sea Pigeon suffered from injury problems in the autumn of 1979 but returned to form in spring 1980. He won the Champion Hurdle at his fourth attempt, beating Monksfield by seven lengths. Before the end of the season, he added a victory in the Welsh Champion Hurdle. A year later, he won a second Fighting Fifth Hurdle and a second Champion Hurdle in March, becoming the oldest-ever winner of the race. In the Champion Hurdle, the performance of his jockey, John Francome, who replaced the injured O'Neill, has been described as one of the best in Cheltenham history. Having contracted a virus, shortly before the 1981 Aintree Festival, Sea Pigeon never recovered fully and ran poorly in two races in the autumn of 1981. He was retired just before the 1982 Cheltenham Festival. He had won 21 races from 40 starts over jumps and 16 races from 45 starts on the flat. Retirement During his retirement Sea Pigeon was housed with trainer Pat Rohan for some time and could often be seen having a stroll round the streets of Norton much to the joy of the locals. Later he spent twelve years under the care of Polly Teirney/Perkins at her yard in Sherriff Hutton, near Malton. When Jonjo turned his hand to training across the Pennines in Skelton his bond with Sea Pigeon was far from over and would often turn up unannounced just to spend some time with his old friend. This bond continued until Sea Pigeon was found to have irreparable damage to one of his pedal bones and was put to sleep on Tuesday 20 October 2000. He was buried at Easterby's Habton Grange stable, next to his stable companion and racecourse rival Night Nurse. Assessment Sea Pigeon was rated at 175 by Timeform for five consecutive seasons from 1976‚Äì77 to 1980‚Äì81. He was the highest rated hurdler in both his championship seasons and at the time of his retirement was the fifth highest rated hurdler in the organisation's history, after Night Nurse, Monksfield, Birds Nest and Golden Cygnet. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randal and Tony Morris ranked Sea Pigeon the tenth best British or Irish hurdler of the 20th century.

Ancient Egypt  In ancient Egypt, the symbol is attested from the Old Kingdom (Sneferu, 26th century BC ), often flanked on either side with a uraeus. In early Egyptian religion, the symbol Behedeti represented Horus of Edfu, later identified with Ra-Harachte. It is sometimes depicted on the neck of Apis, the bull of Ptah. As time passed (according to interpretation) all of the subordinated gods of Egypt were considered to be aspects of the sun god, including Khepri.  Mesopotamia and the Levant  Stele to Assurnasiripal II at Nimrud (9th century BC), detail showing the winged sun. From roughly 2000 BC, the symbol also appears in the Levant and Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. It appears in reliefs with Assyrian rulers and in Hieroglyphic Anatolian as a symbol for royalty, transcribed into Latin as SOL SUUS (literally, \\"his own self, the Sun\\", i.e., \\"His Majesty\\").  Hebrew  From ca. the 8th century BC, the winged solar disk appears on Hebrew seals connected to the royal house of the Kingdom of Judah. Many of these are seals and jar handles from Hezekiah's reign, together with the inscription l'melekh (\\"belonging to the king\\"). Typically, Hezekiah's royal seals feature two downward-pointing wings and six rays emanating from the central sun disk, and some are flanked on either side with the Egyptian ankh (\\"key of life\\") symbol. Prior to this, there are examples from the seals of servants of king Ahaz and of king Uzziah. Compare also Malachi 4:2, referring to a winged \\"Sun of righteousness\\", :But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings... (KJV) The Faravahar in the Persepolis. Also a small winged sun is below of it, click on the image to see.  Zoroastrianism  The symbol evolved into the Faravahar (the symbol of the divine power and royal glory in Persian culture) in Zoroastrian Persia. Greece The winged sun is conventionally depicted as the knob of the Staff of Hermes. As an alchemical symbol: a winged sun hovers over a sepulchre filled with water (from Rosary of the Philosophers). Modern use The symbol was used on the cover of Charles Taze Russell's textbook series Studies in the Scriptures beginning with the 1911 editions. Various groups such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Thelema, Theosophy and Unity Church have also used it. Variations of the symbol are used as a trademark logo on vehicles produced by the Chrysler Corporation, Mini, Bentley Motors, Lagonda (Aston Martin) and Harley Davidson. Since WW2, military aircraft of the United States have carried the insignia of a circle with stripes extending from each side like wings. Whether this is coincidental or some symbolic resemblance was intended is unknown. A five-pointed star is inscribed within the circle. The winged sun symbol is also cited by proponents of the pseudoscientific Nibiru cataclysm.https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2017/06/16/a-winged- star-the-nibiru-conspiracy-and-lazy-pseudoscience/ Heraldic use A winged sun is used in the heraldry of the North America Trade Directory.Heraldic information of the North America Trade Directory (retrieved November 28, 2014) See also * Winged genie References Literature * R.

Until September 2009, she was a government minister jointly for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Cabinet Office. She has been chairwoman of Santander UK since March 2015, becoming the first woman to head a major British bank. Early life She was born in Uganda in 1962 to Indian Gujarati parents. She is from a family who owned a small tea plantation but fled to India in 1972 following the Ugandan government's expulsion of Ugandan Asians, and then later to the UK. She was educated at Northwood College before taking a degree in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at Somerville College, Oxford. Private sector career For over 14 years Vadera was employed at investment bank UBS Warburg, where her work included advising governments of developing countries, and debt relief and restructuring. She also played a role in the partial privatisation of South African Telecom. Government adviser and minister Following his appointment as Prime Minister in June 2007, Gordon Brown appointed her as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Department for International Development. As she was not a member of either of the Houses of Parliament, she was created a life peer on 11 July 2007 as Baroness Vadera, of Holland Park in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The Sunday Times reported that the Cabinet Secretary \\"flatly refus[ed] to allow her to cross the threshold of No 10 as policy enforcer\\" and \\"no Permanent Secretary could stand her\\" ‚Äì although the Cabinet Secretary denied making these comments. Following criticism of her working style, Stephen Alambritis, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ‚ÄúIf the Civil Service is complaining about her, then probably more ministers should be like her; she gets things done.‚Äù After six months as a Minister in International Development, she was moved to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (now the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills). In October 2008, she also became a Parliamentary Secretary in the Cabinet Office. On 14 January 2009 she gave an interview on ITV's Lunchtime News, which concluded: :Alastair Stewart: \\"Final and briefest thought possible ‚Äì you're a former banker and business person yourself and now a minister ‚Äì when will we see the green shoots of recovery? :Baroness Vadera: \\"Well, it's a very uncertain world right now globally but I wouldn't want to be the one predicting it. I am seeing a few green shoots but it's a little bit too early to say exactly how they'll grow.\\" Her reply generated commentary from a number of sources, including shadow chancellor George Osborne and former chancellor Norman Lamont, who first used the phrase \\"green shoots\\" in 1991. Lamont said: \\"It is extremely premature to use a phrase like that.\\" Later that year London's Evening Standard reported that Vadera was instrumental in the creation of an unprecedented banking rescue package. On 24 September 2009, it was announced that she would be stepping down as minister to take up a new role advising the G20. As of September 2019, she has been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since December 2011. Post-government career  In April 2010, the Financial Times reported that Vadera had taken up a consultancy to give strategic advice in restructuring Dubai World's US$26 billion debt. In July, the Daily Telegraph reported Vadera had become consultant to Singaporean investment company Temasek. :\\"The reason people like Shriti are getting these offers is because there are very few people who understand the international finance world and the geopolitical world at a time when the financial world clearly has some issues with the political world.\\" said Martin Armstrong of recruitment consultants Somerton Partners.

History  Plans for the pier first appeared in late 1866 in The London Gazette and construction was ordered in 1867. The pier was built by Head Wrightson at a cost of ¬£8,000 () and financed by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, who later took on an annual ¬£450 lease in 1884 followed by full acquisition 20 years later for ¬£11,250 (). The original pavilion was destroyed by fire in 1903 but in 1905 a new one was built, halfway along the pier, and also a cafeteria and shops at the entry from the promenade. The pavilion offered a venue for dances and concerts. Cleethorpes Borough Council assumed ownership of the pier in 1936, the year that the resort gained borough status. The pier as pictured in July 1983 A ¬£50,000 () investment in 1968 added a 600-seat concern call, cafe and bar. As well as traditional summer shows, it housed wrestling, coin & stamp fairs and dance festivals. However, after a series of losses on the summer show, the council sold the pier in 1981 to Funworld of Skegness, who later themselves put the pier up for sale. The council declined an offer to buy back the pier, saying it would need a ¬£200,000 reconstruction. Following this, nightclub owner Mark Mayer purchased the pier for ¬£10,000 and, after an investment of ¬£300,000, it reopened as 'Pier 39' (a modern nightclub) on 4 September 1985, he later sold it for ¬£1.2m Subsequent developments included a shelter for those awaiting access to the night-club, and pier widening with new underneath piles distinct from the originals. Recent problems Cleethorpes Pier's owners from 2005 were those responsible for a management buyout from Luminar Leisure. In 2006 they rebuilt the former Paradise Club, with the new Waterfront Bar officially opened by Tim Mickleburgh, Hon Vice President of the National Piers Society. The pier closed in 2010 but, in May 2010, a local businessman, Bryn Ilsey, bought the venue and leased it out. The Pier nightclub reopened to the public on 27 November 2010, after undergoing a ¬£200,000 refurbishment, with day and night opening. It closed again on 2 September 2011 when owners surrendered their licence to the authorities pending an investigation into a series of violent incidents and serious disorder. Frontage of the pier, pictured in July 2010 Present It was re- opened on 1 December 2011 under the ownership of local businessman Alistair Clugston, with the front section being renamed the Tides Bar & Restaurant. The large hall continues as a nightclub, but with a 21-year age restriction. The London Evening Standard for 12 December 2012 carried a half-page advertisement offering Cleethorpes Pier for sale by auction on 2 February 2013.London Evening Standard 12 December 2012 At auction on the pier, it failed to reach its guide price of ¬£400,000. However, a \\"venture partnership\\" had since purchased the pier for above the guide price and would take possession on 30 April 2013. In late May 2013 the pier was again on the market after the purchaser failed to meet the conditions of the sale. The owner says he is also willing to rent the pier to anyone interested. In July 2013, local businessman Bryan Huxford purchased the pier for Community use and it has since re-opened to the public. Future plans for developing the structure were unveiled that November. The pier closed in late 2014 so that refurbishment could begin, but did not start until March 2015 with an expected re-opening date of July 2015. The Pier reopened in August 2015, the venue then held the 1873 restaurant offering fine dining, The Promenade, a public house serving traditional pub food and The Victoria Tea room for afternoon tea and dishes from a bistro menu. The historic venue also hosts live entertainment and holds many functions and conferences ranging from weddings and birthday parties to corporate events. In September 2016, the pier was again put up for sale, and was purchased by Papa's Fish and Chip chain for an undisclosed fee in December 2016. It then re-opened in time for the 2017 season, when it claimed to be the largest fish and chip restaurant in the country.

The company was formerly known as Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN; Nusantara Aircraft Industry).http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/indonesia/iptn.htmhttp://en.voi.co.id/voi- editorial/12211-indonesian-aircraft-industry-penetrates-foreign-markets It was expanded from a research and industrial facility under the auspices of the Indonesian Air Force, namely Lembaga Industri Penerbangan Nurtanio (LIPNUR) or Nurtanio Aviation Industry Institute.https://www.indonesian- aerospace.com/aboutus.php?m=aboutus&t;=aboutus8 Established in 1976 as a state owned company, it has developed its capability as an aircraft manufacturer and diversified into other areas, such as telecommunication, automotive, maritime, information technology, oil & gas, control & automation, military, simulation technology, industrial turbine, and engineering services.  History   Pioneering  Though aircraft production in Indonesia existed before independence in 1945, the National Aviation Industry was pioneered in 1946 at Yogyakarta by the formation of Planning and Construction Bureau () within the Indonesian Air Force. Wiweko Soepono, Nurtanio Pringgoadisurjo, and J. Sumarsono, opened a simple workshop at Magetan, near Madiun. With basic materials, gliders were designed and built ‚Äì Zogling, NWG-1 (Nurtanio Wiweko Glider) among others. In 1948, a motorised aircraft, WEL-X was built by Wiweko Soepono using a Harley Davidson engine. The small craft was registered as RI-X. This era marked the rise of several aeromodelling clubs. The war for independence, however, halted all progress until 1953. In that year, The Experimental Section (Seksi Percobaan) was organised. Consisting of only 15 personnel, led by Nurtanio Pringgoadisurjo, The team built and tested three prototypes of a single-seat all metal aircraft at Andir Airport (Later renamed Husein Sastranegara International Airport) in Bandung. On 24 April 1957, The Experimental Section graduated into The Inspection, Trial, and Production Sub- Depot () based on Decision Letter of Indonesian Air Force Chief of Staff number 68. In 1958, a light training aircraft prototype named Belalang 89, or Grasshopper 89, was flown. The design was later produced as Belalang 90. Five Belalang 90 were built and used for military training. Within the same year, a sport plane, \\"Kunang 25\\", was also built and flown.  Preparation  On 1 August 1960, by the order of the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Air Force (order #488), The Aviation Industry Preparation Agency was to be formed to establish the Indonesian aviation industry as part of national strategies on national industrial production. By 16 December 1961, the new body, known as LAPIP (Lembaga Persiapan Industri Penerbangan), was actively negotiating for technological transfers and contracts. LAPIP was able to secure a joint licensing and production contract with Poland. Within the same year, Indonesia was producing the PZL-104 Wilga, locally named the Gelatik. 44 were manufactured for agriculture, transport, and aero club purposes. In 1965, the Aircraft Industry Project Implementation Command (Komando Pelaksana Proyek Industri Pesawat Terbang (KOPELAPIP)) and the Independent Aircraft Industry National Company (PN. Industri Pesawat Terbang Berdikari) were formed to expand and formulate specific uses of the young aviation industry. Within the same timeline, Aviation Studies were promoted in the country's top universities. One of the first schools was founded within the machine department of the engineering faculty of the Bandung Institute of Technology by Oetarjo Diran and Liem Keng Kie. In September 1974, Pertamina's Advanced Technology Division signed a license contract with MBB and CASA for producing B√∂lkow Bo 105 and CASA C.212 Aviocar.  Nurtanio Aircraft Industry  On 26 April 1976, mandated by Government Act No. 15, in Jakarta, PT. Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio was officially established with Dr. BJ. Habibie as the President and CEO. The infrastructure was completed and inaugurated on 23 August 1976 by President Suharto. The new body was a merger between Nurtanio Aviation Industry Institution (Lembaga Industri Penerbangan Nurtanio/LIPNUR) and Pertamina's Advanced Technology Division. The name Nurtanio is a tribute to Nurtanio Pringgoadisuryo, one of the first aviation pioneers in Indonesia, who designed the Sikumbang, an indigenous all metal aircraft (maiden flight: 1 August 1954). As a result of his death caused by a flight training accident on 1 March 1966, the Aviation Industry Preparation Agency was then renamed Nurtanio Aviation Industry Institution LLC (). Initially, IPTN manufactured the NBO 105 (MBB Bo 105), under license by MBB ‚Äì followed by the NC 212 (CASA C-212 Aviocar), under license by CASA.  Nusantara Aircraft Industry  On 11 October 1985, the name PT. Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio was changed to the PT. Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara or IPTN. Nusantara signifies the Indonesian 17,000 island archipelago. The exclusion of \\"Nurtanio\\" from IPTN was due to some highly questionable accusations. One of the allegations was a personal use of company's letterhead by Nurtanio's family to appropriate some IPTN stocks. None was proven true.  Dirgantara Indonesia / Indonesian Aerospace  Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, a major restructuring program was implemented. At its peak, in 2004, the Indonesian Aerospace reduced its payroll from 9670 to 3720. Furthermore, the 18 business divisions were reorganised into the following: * Aircraft * Aircraft Services * Aerostructure * Defence * Engineering Services The restructuring focused on new business goals, downsizing and adaptation of man-power according to available workloads, and a pinpoint market targeting along with a concentrated business mission. The IPTN was re-introduced as PT. Dirgantara Indonesia (abbreviated DI) or Indonesian Aerospace (abbreviated IAe). IAe was officially inaugurated by the President of Indonesia, Abdurrahman Wahid, in Bandung on 24 August 2000. On 4 July 2011 Indonesia's government said it will inject Rp.2 trillion ($234 million) to Indonesian Aerospace to keep the debt-ridden firm afloat with a view to making a joint venture with EADS. Before injection the unpaid debt to government was Rp.1.1 trillion ($129 million).

He won the Champion Hurdle on three occasions. He was trained by Aidan O'Brien and owned by John Patrick McManus. Jockey Charlie Swan rode him in all of his 29 races over jumps.  Early life  Istabraq was bred for the flat, being by the outstanding champion sire Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas over 1 mile and also being three parts brother to an Epsom Derby winner, Secreto. Istabraq was tried unsuccessfully over a mile and failed to please his handlers and owner Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Shadwell Racing and a partner in his family's Godolphin Stables.  Jumps racing  The horse was sold to John Durkan who had been an assistant to John Gosden with the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle as the target for the Cheltenham Festival. Durkan started training the horse but was diagnosed with leukemia and suggested that Aidan O'Brien train Istabraq while he was ill. The agreement was that when Durkan recovered, he would take over the training. However, he died just before Istabraq won the 1998 Irish Champion Hurdle. O'Brien continued to train the horse afterwards, and Durkan remained in the thoughts of the horse's connections. When riding the horse back after his 1998 Champion Hurdle win, jockey Charlie Swan said, 'This one's for John,' in an interview with Channel 4's Lesley Graham. 1996/1997: Novice hurdler On 16 November 1996 Istabraq made his hurdling debut and lost by a head to Noble Thyne at Punchestown. Before his next race Istabraq was gelded. He won his next three races prior to the Cheltenham Festival. There he won the Royal & Sun Alliance Novice Hurdle from Mighty Moss. 1997/1998 Istabraq won the first four races of the season. In his fifth race of the season he started as favourite for the 1998 Champion Hurdle. Last years winner Make A Stand was a notable absence but the runner up Theatreworld returned as one of the 18 runners. Istabraq moved to the front three out before he accelerated rounding the home turn. The Champion Hurdle then became a procession in the home straight, as Istabraq won by 12 lengths from Theatreworld. The conditions for the Aintree Hurdle were soft, heavy in places with Istabraq the favourite. However Istabraq came second to Pridwell to end Istabraq's 10 race winning streak. This was Istabraq's last race of the season. 1998/1999 Like last season, Istabraq won his first four races. In his fifth race of the season he started the 1999 Champion Hurdle as favourite. He won by lengths from Theatreworld to win his second Champion Hurdle. In the next race he beat French Holly at the Aintree Hurdle. He won his last race of the season at the Punchestown festival.  1999/2000  Istabraq had his first start of the season in October at Tipperary in the John James McManus Memorial Hurdle. He beat Limestone Lad by 7 lengths. There was a rematch for Istabraq's second start of the season in the Hattons Grace Hurdle at Fairyhouse. This time Istabraq came second losing by lengths to Limestone Lad also in soft conditions. Despite the loss Istabraq started the 2000 Champion Hurdle as favourite. He won by 4 lengths from Hors La Loi III. This victory was Istabraq's fourth straight win at the Cheltenham Festival. This was his last race of the season.  2000/2001  He made his reappearance at Leopardstown for the December Festival Hurdle. He battled with Moscow Flyer before he fell at the last. This was the first time Istabraq fell. The race was won by Moscow Flyer. After the race winning jockey Barry Geraghty said \\"I thought I had Istabraq beat going to the last, I was the only one going in the right direction.\\" Istabraq's jockey Charlie Swan however said \\"He was tired but he always finds something, however, he's always been vulnerable in those sort of conditions. He felt well and as good as ever during the race.\\" On his next start, Istabraq won but this time Moscow Flyer fell. In Istabraq's next start, Istabraq again fell at the final flight, with Moscow Flyer the winner. After Istabraq won the AIG Europe Champion Hurdle near the end of January he was the odds on ante post favourite for the 2001 Champion Hurdle. However before the 2001 Cheltenham Festival, cases of foot-and-mouth disease started to appear in Britain. The festival was therefore abandoned.  2001/2002  Istabraq reappeared the following season to defeat Bust Out by a head in the December Festival Hurdle. In the 2002 Champion Hurdle Istabraq was the favourite of the 15 runners. However Swan pulled him up after 2 hurdles. The race was won by Hors La Loi III. After the race Swan said \\"I jumped the first and his action went. I jumped the second and thought he might get a bit better but he didn't and I just thought, for the good of the horse, to pull him up\\". Istabraq was later found to have pulled muscles in his back. Istabraq was retired after the race.  Retirement  After retirement Istabraq was moved to Martinstown home of owner J. P. McManus.

The screenplay was written by Herman Cohen and Aben Kandel, and the film directed by Jim O'Connolly. Berserk! marks Crawford's second-to-last big-screen appearance. Plot Monica Rivers (Joan Crawford) and Dorando (Michael Gough) co-own a travelling English circus. Monica acts as ringmistress and Dorando her business manager. When tightrope walker Gaspar the Great is strangled when his tightrope breaks, it appears that his rope might have been purposely weakened and police initiate an investigation, discovering no perpetrator. Monica's unemotional reaction to the tragedy alarms Dorando. When she suggests Gaspar's death will be good publicity, he asks her to buy him out, which she is unable to do. Monica hires a new tightrope walker, Frank Hawkins (Ty Hardin). Not only is he handsome, he is daring, performing his act over a carpet of sharp bayonets. Monica is impressed, especially by his physique. Meanwhile, Monica's business partner, Dorando, is found gruesomely murdered. Suspicion of Monica's guilt grows among members of the circus troupe. Hawkins in particular suspects her, having seen her leaving Dorando's trailer shortly before the body was discovered. He confronts Monica, demanding a share in the circus for his silence. After a series of successful performances by the circus throughout the UK, Monica's daughter, Angela (Judy Geeson), having been expelled from school, shows up at the circus. Not knowing what to do with her unruly daughter, Monica pairs her with Gustavo the knife thrower (Peter Burton). Another member of the circus company, Matilda (Diana Dors), unsuccessfully attempts to seduce Hawkins, which Monica discovers. During Matilda's act, a magician's trick involving the illusion of being sawn in half, there is a malfunction in the equipment and she is killed. A few evenings later, during his high-wire performance, Frank is hit in the back with a knife, falls from his tightrope onto the bayonets and is killed. Angela is spotted throwing a knife into him before his fatal fall. She confesses, and she also reveals her motive. She has inwardly resented her mother's ignoring her, being absent from her life. Thus, the murders were acts of \\"removing\\" those who took up her mother's time and attention. She then tries to kill her mother but is stopped. Then, while trying to escape capture, she is electrocuted by an exposed wire outside the circus tent during a rainstorm. The film ends as Monica sobs inconsolably over her daughter's body.

Critical reception Howard Thompson gave the film a mostly negative review in The New York Times, comparing it unfavorably to Circus of Horrors, but also commented, \\"It's also hard to make a hopeless movie with a circus background and sawdust aroma. This is the one solid thing the picture has going for it‚Äîthe intriguing workaday routine of circus folk and some good, spangly ring acts, all handsomely conveyed in excellent color photography. And under the reasonable direction of Jim O'Connolly, the film does project a kind of defiant suspense that dares you not to sit there, see who gets it next and, finally, why.\\" He goes on to state that Crawford \\"...is professional as usual and certainly the shapeliest ringmaster ever to handle a ring microphone.\\" Frank Leyendecker in Greater Amusements wrote, \\"Joan Crawford gives authority and extreme conviction to the colorful role of a circus owner and ringmaster...she consistently rises above the highly melodramatic, yet exploitable, material.\\" Lawrence Quirk wrote in Hollywood Screen Parade, \\"[Crawford] is all over the picture, radiant, forceful, authoritative, a genuine movie star whose appeal never diminishes.\\"Quirk, Lawrence J..

From May 1992 until May 2018, it was served by only one Parliamentary service per week, the minimum statutory service level required to avoid starting formal closure proceedings. Despite the low passenger numbers, the line itself is used regularly for freight traffic and empty stock transfers. History Reddish South was opened when the line between and was completed by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway in October 1845. It was taken over by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR), following a merger of the two companies in 1846. The 19th century civil engineering firm John Brogden and Sons was the contractor.Directors‚Äô Minutes: Manchester and Birmingham Railway Co, Public Record Office, RAIL 454/3 and the contract 454/11 The station, which consisted of two island platforms, also had a signal box, goods sidings and engine shed. For more than fifty years, it catered for the LNWR mainline services between Manchester and . All regular Monday to Saturday hourly services would stop at the station. However, express traffic was drastically reduced when services were redirected to Manchester London Road station (now ) in May 1899. With the redirection of the long-distance express services, the station became a scheduled stop for local traffic. Although the Stockport‚ÄìStalybridge Line escaped the 1960s Beeching cuts, when large numbers of cross-country branch lines were closed for being uneconomical, the station and line were gradually rundown by British Rail over the next couple of decades. The remaining original station building on one of the island platforms was demolished and the sidings and engine shed removed. After the line was eventually reduced to a single track, the second island platform was abandoned. One of the track beds was sold off and the other was filled in. The station became a request stop. For many years, the only service was the 0922 Fridays-only parliamentary train from Stockport to Stalybridge. It stopped at Reddish South at 0926, before continuing to Stalybridge via and . In September 2006, open-access operator Grand Central proposed to run services from via and the West Coast Main Line to London Euston. This service would have travelled via Stalybridge, Guide Bridge and Reddish South to Stockport. However, the proposal was dropped after Virgin Trains cited its protection clause preventing any other operators from using the West Coast Main Line. In May 2007, Network Rail proposed in its North West Route Utilisation Strategy that both Reddish South and Denton stations should be closed while the line remain open for freight and diverted passenger workings. This prompted a campaign to start asking for a regular service from Stockport to via Reddish South and Denton. On 20 May 2018, Northern replaced the Friday service with one return service on Saturday mornings. The train stops here at 9:00 going to Stockport and 9:50 going to Stalybridge. Quietest station in the UK Local campaigners have installed artwork, a flower-bed and a fence alongside the platform. Between April 2013 and March 2014, Reddish South was the third-least-used station in Great Britain, after Teesside Airport railway station and Shippea Hill railway station with only 26 recorded passengers. In 2015, passenger figures from the Office for Rail and Road showed that Reddish South had become Britain's fourth-quietest railway station. As of 2018/19, Reddish South became the third least used station in the UK, with just 60 entries and exits. In January 2020, the station was named as the UK's third quietest with just 60 entries and exits between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019. In comparison, neighbouring stations of , and all have regular services.

He was well known as a cattle thief, lover (and thief) of horses, dealer in illegal diamonds, smuggler and friend of the poor. Early life A book was written by F. C. Metrowich, Scotty Smith, which was published in 1962 and went through at least three editions. By Scotty's own account, according to Metrowich, he was not willing to marry the girl that his father had chosen for him in Scotland, and therefore did not receive his inheritance. George, or Scotty as he was often called, trained as a veterinarian, before being shipped to the colonies. It is thought that he first went to Australia where it is believed he participated in the Kalgoorlie gold rush. Apparently he did not have much success though, because he it also rumored to have ended up first as a prize fighter in New York, and later as Veterinary Officer of an Army regiment in India. Scotty got this post on recommendation of an uncle who was Commander in Chief of the Indian Army. The officer in charge of his cavalry squadron was killed in one of the Hill campaigns, so Scotty is believed to have taken over, ordered to charge and caused heavy casualties for his troops. After a court martial, he was believed to have been discharged. South Africa Scotty arrived in South Africa in 1877 to join the Frontier Armed and Mounted Police. He saw action in the Gaika War. It is not known exactly when his military career ended, or when he got his nickname \\"Scotty Smith\\", although he claimed that he took the papers of a fallen comrade by that name. Due to lack of more evidence, it is concluded that he may have used stolen papers in the name of \\"Scotty Smith\\" to escape military life at some point, but there is no actual proof of this. After his early attempts at a military lifestyle, both in Australia and in South Africa, Scotty's life took a more exciting turn. Stories When in South Africa he got involved in gun-running, general theft, elephant hunting and other hunting activities in the then Bechuanaland (Botswana). He was also involved in legal and illegal diamond buying in the diamond fields, horse theft and highway robberies. He was caught and sentenced several times for these crimes, but always managed to escape somehow and claimed that no prison cell could hold him. It appears that a lot of these activities were on behalf of the British government and he was released without blowing his cover. Scotty Smith was a genius when it came to fooling people into believing that he was someone else by changing his character, as it was never claimed that he actually used a disguise. It is said that one police detective who had arrested Scotty, ended up being the captive, and \\"Sergeant Scotty\\" handed him over to the police in Kimberley, claiming that the captive (who was the policeman) was Scotty Smith. After being jailed, the man had a difficult time in convincing the authorities that Scotty Smith had played a trick on them. Many times, living up to his nickname of Robin Hood of the Kalahari, he robbed the rich to give to the poor. There is a story about a farmer or boer who once met Scotty but did not recognise him. The farmer related to this man (Scotty) that he would like to capture Scotty Smith and claim the large reward at the Kenhard police station. Scotty then immediately identified himself and told the now hesitant farmer to take him to Kenhardt Police station at gunpoint, where the reluctant farmer received the reward. However, the farmer did not have to feel remorse for very long, because early that evening, Scotty broke out of jail and rode off again. It is thought that he would have been released by the authorities Another story about Scotty Smith claims that he calmly hid the illegal diamonds that he had smuggled, which the police came looking for, in the kettle which was simmering on the camp-fire. He then apparently went ahead and poured coffee for the policemen and himself from the boiling kettle. There is evidence that he acted for the British during the various wars in South Africa s an intelligence field officer providing both information about opposition troop movements in the Kalahari and providing provisions. He arranged horses, foddder and the like to the British troops Languages Besides English and probably Scots or Scots Gaelic, Scotty was fluent in German, Afrikaans and an unknown number of Bushmen languages, and possibly also in a few of the other native Southern African languages. Yet another story told about him is that when an unexpected police patrol paid him a visit, he would ask to be allowed to hold \\"huisgodsdiens\\" (Afrikaans for home religious service) for his servants. He conducted these services in Bushmen language, and in full view of the policemen, who could not understand a word, he gave detailed instructions to his servants on how to hide anything that he did not want the policemen to see or find. It is said that the policemen never suspected a thing. Jail In 1892 Scotty Smith met 19-year-old Miss van Niekerk and married. Together they raised a family of two sons and five daughters. After a short time in the Military, Scotty finally left them to do his own thing. After a long career involved in horse and cattle stealing, he was involved in numerous illegal diamond operations again in the wider Kimberley area. In most of the stories about him, Scotty is victorious against all odds and always get away with it. Although there is a story that took place at a little place near Kimberley, in the Boshof district, named Olifantsfontein where one of Scotty's plans went wrong. A merchant, Thomas Welford and his partner Gustav Herman and Gustav's brother Max, approached Scotty Smith to help them steal a packet of diamonds from Sam Kemp (a supposed diamond merchant) but who was apparently an illegal runner for a man known as Sam Weil. The plan was as follows; the group would ambush Sam Kemp and steal the diamonds. If he resisted, they would shoot him. The plan was carried out, Sam Kemp resisted and was shot and the diamonds were stolen. Kemp recovered though, and rode back to Kimberley to report the theft at the police station. Police officers soon uncovered the whole plan and arrested Scotty and the others. This time, for once, Scotty did not attempt escape. He was sentenced to four years imprisonment and 25 lashes in the Boshof circuit court. He never received the lashes though and after a year, his sentence was dropped and he was once again free. During his imprisonment in Bloemfontein, it is claimed that Scotty Smith was permitted to visit the town bar daily. One day, he apparently came across a parade including the Official State President's coach, after successfully masquerading as the president, he took a ride in high style, before returning to prison later on. Again, it is not known how accurate these stories are. After his year in jail, Scotty left for a more rural area, and from the early 1880s he was a bandit in the area of the Goshen and Stellaland Republics. He stayed in that area until shortly before the Anglo-Boer War. Amongst the strange things Scotty did was a trek of several months by ox-wagon, accompanied by Dorothea Bleek (niece of Lucy Lloyd), to enable her to study Bushmen languages in the Kalahari. Bushmen skeletons The story of the Bushmen skeletons is unusual and suspicious. It started with a visit from Dr. Borcherds of Upington, to London. Dr. Borcherds noticed that the Bushmen skeletons in the Royal College of Surgeons were not of good quality, so he authorized Scotty to find better specimens. Shortly after that Scotty arrived at the doctor's house with 10 complete skeletons. He claimed that the skeletons belonged to Bushmen who had previously raided his farm and who he had shot and buried. Scotty ended up supplying hundreds of Bushmen skeletons to many European museums. There were rumours that Scotty had deliberately killed these Bushmen, but this has never been proven. Death Scotty died a respected elderly townsmen of Upington during the 1919 flu epidemic. He is buried in the Upington cemetery. The grave is protected by an iron trellis, on his grave stone is written \\"Never will his memory fade ‚Äì Jessie\\". Shortly after his death in 1919 the late Dr. Homer L. Shantz, botanist, professor, and president of the University of Arizona visited the home of Scotty Smith. A photo is held in the University of Arizona Shantz collections. References Further reading * In particular chapter 7. * *  External links  * * * by Homer L. Shantz taken 18 September 1919.

My bill seeks to preserve that standard. Many women say: 'We came to this country to escape these practices only to find the situation is worse here.'\\" It had its second reading and debate on 19 October 2012, but went no further. Cox aims to prevent discrimination against Muslim women and 'jurisdiction creep' in Islamic tribunals, which would be forced to acknowledge the primacy of English law under her Bill, which would have introduced an offence carrying a five-year jail sentence for anyone falsely claiming or implying that sharia courts or councils have legal jurisdiction over family or criminal law. The bill, which would apply to all arbitration tribunals if passed, aimed to tackle discrimination, which its supporters said is inherent in the courts, by banning the sharia practice of giving woman's testimony only half the weight of men's. In a similar way to Jewish Beth Din courts, sharia tribunals can make verdicts in cases involving financial and property issues which, under the Arbitration Act 1996, are enforceable by the County Court or the High Court.\\"Bill limiting sharia law is motivated by 'concern for Muslim women'\\".

An Australian branch of HART was established in 2009. Christian Solidarity International and Worldwide Cox was active in Christian Solidarity International (CSI) before leading the breakaway Christian Solidarity Worldwide in 1997. She was president of the latter until 2006, when she was replaced by Jonathan Aitken, thereafter remaining as its patron. During the 1992‚Äì93 Armenia-Azerbaijan war, CSI broke Azerbaijan‚Äôs blockade of the contested Nagorno-Karabakh territory numerous times to deliver humanitarian aid and document acts of violence against the Christian Armenian inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh. CSI also partnered with the Andrei Sakharov foundation to send aid to refugees from Nagorno-Karabakh. Witnessing the war on the ground, CSI published a detailed account of the Nagorno-Karabakh War titled Ethnic Cleansing in Progress: War in Nagorno Karabakh co-authored by Cox with John Eibner. CSI‚Äôs involvement with Sudan began in 1992, when two of CSI‚Äôs leaders, Cox and Eibner, traveled to southern Sudan at the invitation of local churches to observe the effects of civil war on the Christian populations there. CSI became especially involved in \\"redeeming\\" (buying and freeing) slaves in 1995. Between 1997 and 2000, Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) directly intervened to buy the freedom of alleged slaves, and in a letter to The Independent on Sunday Cox claimed and redeemed 2,281 slaves on eight visits to Sudan.\\"This is no scam.

She was widely condemned. Labour MP John Woodcock, vice-president of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Syria, said: \\"It is shocking to see a British parliamentarian giving international pariah al-Assad a photo opportunity to distract from the brutal and ongoing slaughter he is perpetrating on Syrian families. Whatever good intentions this British delegation has will fail; their presence at this man's side can only strengthen him as his campaign of terror continues.\\" Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Hussein-Ece said it was \\"shameful\\" for members of the House of Lords to \\"sit down for a chat with a mass murderer and a war criminal\\".British peers and priests accused of 'chatting with mass murderer' after meeting Assad in Syria, Daily Telegraph, 5 September 2016 Russian state media claimed Cox said that Assad had an ‚Äúopenness for the development of civil society, democracy and change‚Äù.Former British archbishop meets top Assad adviser in Damascus, Middle East Eye, 28 November 2017 After her visit, in early 2017, she went to the US to lobby for president Assad's government.A British Baroness Wants To Rekindle Donald Trump's Affection For Bashar Assad, Huffington Post, May 2017 While there, she expressed doubt that Syrian government forces were responsible for Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.

The area is roughly-speaking, a square bounded by Wellington Road to the north, Manchester Road to the west, Gigg Lane to the south and Market Street to the east. History The neighbourhood grew up in the late 19th century and became known as 'Piano Town', as many of the lower middle class households had a piano in the parlour. Its development was carried out by three contemporaries: Alderman Charles Brierley, who built Fishpool's first street and named it after himself. He resided at Heaton Cottage on Brierley Street. Alderman Brierley was mayor of Bury in 1889. The second and most prolific builder was John Inman. He built most of the streets as far as Nelson Street, from Wellington Road through to Parkhills Road and as far as to Gigg Lane. Inman Street, at the end of Manchester Old Road is named after him. Finally John Ward from Leigh, who was at one time landlord of the Church Inn on Spring Street. He built the Pack Horse Hotel and the shops alongside. Housing The streets still mostly consist of garden terraced housing, set in a grid pattern. The main streets are Nelson Street, Devon Street, Horne Street and Brierley Street, with Handley Street, Woodley Street, Carlton Street, Sultan Street, Morley Street, Richmond Street, Walker Street, Grosvenor Street and Grafton Street being either later additions or horizontal link thoroughfares. Landmarks The district was the home of Fishpool Infants School and St Chad's Junior School. Fishpool Infants School was demolished in 2006. Both schools closed in July 2003 and a new school was built on the site and utilising the old building of St Chad's. The new school was named St. Luke's C of E Primary School by popular vote in the community, and is a Voluntary Controlled school linked to the nearby Anglican church, St. Peter's. (OFSTED Number 133944). Redvales Children's Centre, built on the Springs Estate, was the first Children's Centre in the Metropolitan Borough of Bury, and served the whole of the 6 townships, originally operating from a suite of small rooms above a shop on Heywood Street. Opposite the row of shops is the church building formerly Bethesda Church, now known as Metro Christian Centre. The church is a place of worship for evangelical Christians and also serves the community in many other ways, such as hosting a private day nursery, Little Acorns, and regular blood donor sessions. There is a row of shops on Parkhills Road, including a post office, a Co-op. (Now as MCalls store since 2017) store and several takeaway establishments. There is a public houses on the fringe of the district, namely The Staff of Life. There were originally many corner shops on the minor streets, but these have long since disappeared. The district is home to Bury F.C. who play at Gigg Lane. Gigg Lane also has an entrance to the town's main cemetery.

The operations were run from the Kelly Butte Bunker, which was the emergency operations center at that time. It was filmed in September 1957 and aired December 8 of that year. Apart from presenter/narrator Glenn Ford, none of the people shown are actors. They are locals of Portland shown in their real jobs, including Mayor Terry Schrunk. Its local re-broadcast in 2004pdxradio Message Board and appearance in the on-line Prelinger Archives attracted interest among local history buffs due to its extensive outside shots of the city, and the use of non-actor participants (local officials and broadcasters). Whenever one of these individuals is heard uttering warnings or statements regarding attack, the words \\"AN ATTACK IS NOT TAKING PLACE\\" are superimposed over the picture. On September 27, 1955, Portland actually conducted an exercise evacuation of downtown called \\"Operation Greenlight\\", and the film is often misattributed to that year.

Before the kneeling crowd, Viscovich delivered an emotional speech, the Discorso de Perasto, still well known to Venetians.

The Nova Project, also simply known as Nova, is a small public alternative high school in Seattle, Washington, in the Seattle Public School District. Nova is a social justice oriented school that embraces differences and self-expression. Its aim is to be a \\"democratically governed learning community of broadly educated, creative, and independent thinkers who work collaboratively and demonstrate a high degree of individual responsibility.\\"\\"School History - The Nova Project\\", http://www.novafolios.com/school-history There are no grades or tests. Students receive credit based on the effort and competencies the student demonstrates. There is no formal attendance at Nova however students are strongly encouraged to contact their coordinator if you will be absent. The Nova community wants students and staff to attend classes and events because they want to be there and feel as though what they are learning and contributing is worth while. About Nova was founded by a group of students, parents and teachers in 1970.Loveless, Douglas, Sullivan, Pamela, Dredger, Katie, Burns, Jim. Deconstructing the Education-Industrial Complex in the Digital Age, p. 16-17. https://books.google.com/books?id=O5vgDQAAQBAJ&pg;=PA16 The curriculum is multidisciplinary and project-oriented, with an emphasis on individualized learning contracts,Weinstock, Chuck, Learning Contracts: Facilitating Academic Change, p. 7. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED080107 internships and community service.Nathan, Joe; Febey, Karen. Smaller, Safer, Saner, Successful Schools, p. 53-54. https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED455680. Nova functions through student- run, teacher-supported committees that decide school budgeting, the hiring and review process of staff, discussion forums, orientation of new students, and cultural affairs. The credit system is competency-based which means students receive either full, partial or no credit. Each student picks a teacher to be their coordinator to design a personal learning plan and graduate time. At Nova you do not need to graduate after the traditional amount of years of high school in the united states which is four years. Some students graduate in as little as two years and other students take five or six. Nova classes include every grade (9-12). Class size varies but they tend to be quite small ranging from ten to twenty students however some classes can be smaller for instance classes for students with special needs or lab based science classes. Nova students have the option of creating \\"independent contracts\\" with their teachers to earn credit for extracurricular projects and activities. It is common for Nova students to co-teach classes with their teachers, generating curriculum and building facilitation skills in line with Nova's student-led philosophy. Like other Seattle Public Schools students, Nova students may participate in the Running Start program and take classes at a local community college. Nova is a safe space for students of all identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, religions, backgrounds and is an advocate for mental health awareness. Nova also has the lowest rate of bullying, sexual assault and harassment in the school district. There are many days dedicated for speakers and social justice work. Nova has Consent Day, Racial Justice Day, Gender Tea and much more.

Stilwell has appeared as a pet behavior expert in and/or served as a producer on several international TV series including Dogs Might Fly (Sky TV), Dogs With Extraordinary Jobs (Smithsonian Channel), and Greatest American Dog (CBS), and is best known as the star and creator of the dog training TV show It's Me or the Dog. She is a leading proponent of positive reinforcement-based dog training tools and methods to provide pet behavior advice instead of traditional methods which typically employ multiple approaches including the use of pain, fear and intimidation. She is the Editor-In-Chief of the Positively.com website, the founder and president of the Victoria Stilwell Academy for Dog Training & Behavior, the CEO of the Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training (VSPDT) network of dog trainers, and other dog behavior institutions. In 2017, she received an OBE for her charity work. Early background Stilwell originally trained as an actress, playing roles in Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992, ITV1's The Bill in 1994, and onstage in London's West End theatre, as well as several commercials and voiceovers. She received a BA honours degree in Theatre from Middlesex University.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:-I8v1k53hPQJ:www.playbill.com/news/article/107375-Its- Me-or-the-Dog-Featuring-Actress-Dog-Trainer-Stilwell-Makes-US-TV- Debut+Victoria+Stilwell+%22middlesex+university%22&cd;=3&hl;=ru&ct;=clnk‚â∑=ua In order to supplement her income as an actress, Stilwell's veterinary nurse sister suggested that she start a dog walking agency. Within a month she was walking 20 dogs per day: 10 in the morning, 10 in the afternoon, and immediately recognized the need for qualified professionals to help her clients with the training process. She then expanded her focus to dog training and after moving to the United States with her husband in 1999, Stilwell co- founded several dog training companies up and down the East Coast. Dog trainer Stilwell has become an advocate of positive dog training. Stilwell rejects dominance-based, traditional training techniques, instead, promoting positive reinforcement techniques. In 2010, she created Victoria Stilwell Positively Dog Training, a global network of positive reinforcement dog trainers dedicated to positive reinforcement techniques and behaviourists. Stilwell is currently certified by the Animal Behaviour and Training Associates, and is a longtime member of the US Association of Pet Dog Trainers (APDT). Charitable Work Stilwell created the Victoria Stilwell Foundation, whose mission is \\"to provide financial support and canine behaviour expertise to assistance dog organisations and small animal rescue shelters while promoting the concept of reward-based, positive reinforcement dog training philosophies in organisations and households throughout the United States.\\" With a particular fondness for rescue animals in need of behavior rehabilitation, Stilwell devotes much of her time and energy to a number of animal rescue organizations around the world, serving as a behavior adviser for shelters in Atlanta, New York, the UK and Hong Kong while giving regular seminars on the subject of dog rescue, training and rehabilitation. She has been involved in animal welfare and protection organizations on the international stage, including serving as an Advisory Board Member of RedRover and a National Ambassador for American Humane. She also worked as a volunteer adoption counselor for the ASPCA. Media It's Me or the Dog From 2005 to 2012, Stilwell worked with unruly dogs on her TV show, It's Me or the Dog, which has aired in over 125 countries and is also available on YouTube. The show features Stilwell as she counsels families with problem pets and uses positive reinforcement training techniques to help them learn how to correct their dogs' behaviour. Originally produced for Channel 4 in the UK, the show premiered in the US on Animal Planet in April 2007, and over 110 episodes have been aired worldwide. A typical episode involves a family struggling to cope with their misbehaving dog(s). Stilwell initially observes the problems on site, and then presents the family with her opinion regarding the causes of the issues. She then works with the family and their dogs to restore balance.  Dogs With Extraordinary Jobs  Dogs With Extraordinary Jobs is a series, created, co-produced and narrated by Stilwell for Blue Ant Media (syndicated worldwide including the Smithsonian Channel in the US) in 2018 and 2019. Each episode highlights the extraordinary work of dogs around the world as they assist humans.  Dogs Might Fly  Stilwell served as one of three judges and behaviour experts on the 2016 SkyTV series Dogs Might Fly. The series tracked several rescue dogs from UK animal shelters as they worked with dog trainers to determine if one of them could learn to co-pilot a small airplane. Greatest American Dog Stilwell was one of three judges on the CBS show Greatest American Dog, in which 12 dog-owner teams compete for the title 'Greatest American Dog' and a $250,000 prize. The series debuted on CBS 10 July 2008.

Awards Stilwell was honored with the \\"Excellence in Journalism and Outstanding Contributions to the Pet Industry\\" award at the 2011 Global Pet Expo and was named 'Dog Trainer of the Year' by DogWorld Magazine at the 55th Annual Purina Pro Plan Show Dogs of the Year Awards. She was named among 2009's '100 Best & Brightest' in the dog world in The Bark magazine. Stilwell won a 2009 CableFax award as Best Host in the Animals & Nature category. In 2009, It's Me or the Dog was nominated for a People's Choice Award in the US, and after its first season in the UK, It's Me or the Dog was nominated in the 'Best Factual Entertainment' category in the UK's TV Quick Awards. Her first book, It's Me or the Dog: How to Have the Perfect Pet was voted one of the 50 greatest dog books ever written by Dogs Today magazine. Campaigns Stilwell serves on the boards of several animal- related institutions including Canine Assistants, RedRover, DogTV, Greyhound Rescue of West England, Grey Muzzle, the Soi Dog Foundation, and the W-Underdogs. She advocates animal rescue and has supported Paws Atlanta, Atlanta Pet Rescue, Stray from the Heart (NYC), Hong Kong Dog Rescue, Wisconsin Puppy Mill Project, the Waterside Action Group, Deed Not Breed (campaigning to re-write the UK's Dangerous Dogs Act to remove breed-specific legislation) as well as Vets Get Scanning, promoting mandatory pet micro- chipping and scanning by vets. Stilwell is a critic of fox hunting and was among more than 20 high-profile people who signed a letter to Members of Parliament in 2015 to oppose Conservative prime minister David Cameron's plan to amend the Hunting Act 2004. Personal life Stilwell met her actor husband, Van Zeiler, while starring opposite him in the West End theatre production of Buddy - The Buddy Holly Story. The couple and their daughter live in Atlanta, Georgia. After many years without a pet dog of her own (due to the international travel schedule required for her various TV shows), Stilwell adopted a rescued chocolate Labrador named Sadie. In early 2011, Stilwell fostered a Chihuahua/Miniature Pinscher mix named Jasmine and decided to adopt her. Following Sadie's death at the age of 15 in 2018, Stilwell adopted an elderly mixed breed dog named Bella. Prior to that, she had spent her time since 2000 fostering dogs due to be euthanised by local municipal shelters. Stilwell and her husband then gave the dogs a home while rehabilitating them and eventually finding suitable homes for the animals. She has explained that until her international travel requirements were reduced, owning a dog would have been irresponsible and unfair to the dog, considering how much the whole family travels. The family has re-homed over 50 dogs and cats.

He won 16 caps for his country, scoring three goals. Having started his career at Morton, Robertson moved to Everton of the English Football League in 1895, and then Southampton in 1898, with whom he won the Southern Football League in his only season. He then returned to his homeland with Rangers, where he won three consecutive league titles in his first three seasons. Robertson was the first player signed to Chelsea in 1905, and served as their player-manager in their first-ever season, in addition to scoring their first competitive goal. He finished his career in the same role at Glossop North End. Playing career Club Robertson began his career at Morton, and moved to Everton in 1896. He spent a single season at Southampton in 1898‚Äì99, winning the Southern League. Following that, he returned to Scotland and won three consecutive Scottish Football League championships at Rangers in his first three seasons, plus a Scottish Cup in the fourth; his last of 178 appearances for the club in all competitions was a play-off for the 1904‚Äì05 Scottish Division One title, lost to Celtic.(Rangers player) Robertson, Jacky, FitbaStats In April 1905, Robertson was the first player to be signed by the newly-formed Chelsea Football Club for the role of manager, but continued to play as well (he was 28 years old at the time).The Chelsea Club 1905-06, Penny Illustrated Paper, 9 September 1905, via Play Up Liverpool It was Robertson who scored Chelsea's first competitive goal, in a 1‚Äì0 win at Blackpool on 9 September 1905. In his first season, he led the club to a third-place finish in the Second Division, one place off promotion. Robertson then surprisingly resigned from the club (third in the table at the time) on 27 November 1906. Chelsea were promoted to the top flight at the end of that season under caretaker secretary-manager William Lewis. Soon afterwards Robertson became player-manager of Glossop, where he remained until summer 1909, when he became reserve-team manager at Manchester United. International Robertson made his debut for Scotland on 2 April 1898 while at Everton, in a 3‚Äì1 home defeat to England in the Home Nations Championship. His second cap came on 8 April of the following year, while at Southampton. All of his 14 remaining caps came during his spell at Rangers. He captained the Scots in his fourth match, as they beat England 4‚Äì1 at home on 7 April 1900. His first goal came in his sixth match, on 2 March 1901, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Wales, again as captain. Robertson was Scotland's captain in five matches, and scored two more goals, both against Wales. The last was in his last international on 6 March 1905, in a 3‚Äì1 away defeat in Wrexham.

A reference card or reference sheet (or quick reference card) or crib sheet is a concise bundling of condensed notes about a specific topic, such as mathematical formulas to calculate area/volume, or common syntactic rules and idioms of a particular computer platform, application program, or formal language. It serves as an ad hoc memory aid for an experienced user. In spite of what the name reference card may suggest, such as a 3x5 index card (), the term also applies to sheets of paper or online pages, as in the context of programming languages or markup languages. However, this concept is now being adopted to portray concise information in many other fields. Appearance As in the examples below, reference cards are typically one to a few pages in length. Pages are organized into one or more columns. Across the columns, the reference is split into sections and organized by topic. Each section contains a list of entries, with each entry containing a term and its description and usage information. Terms might include keywords, syntactic constructs, functions, methods, or macros in a computer language. In a reference card for a program with a graphical user interface, terms may include menu entries, icons or key combinations representing program actions. Due to its logical structure and conciseness, finding information in a reference card is trivial for humans and requires no computer interaction. It is therefore convenient for a user to print out a reference card. While reference cards can be printed on card stock, it is common to print them on ordinary printer paper. With the advent of portable electronic devices that can display documents, digital reference cards stored in PDF or HTML formats have become more common. This is in contrast to user guides, which tend to be rather long and verbose and which have (in comparison to reference cards) a lower information density Examples * Wikimedia wiki syntax ref card meta:Help:Reference card * A LaTeX reference sheet: PDF * An AMS LaTeX reference card: PDF * An R reference card: PDF * An R reference card for data mining: www.rdatamining.com See also * Cheat sheet * User guide * Crib sheet References External links * Collection of reference cards Category:Technical communication pl:≈öciƒÖga#Inne rodzaje ≈õciƒÖg ","title":"Reference card"},{"id":"4238173","text":"Fronteira () is a municipality in Portalegre District in Portugal.

It holds the claim of being the first video game to simulate amusement rides. Roller Coaster was released in 1985 by British video game developer Elite Systems, to overwhelmingly positive reviews. It was, for a time, one of the most popular games for the ZX Spectrum. Gameplay The game takes place in and around an amusement park after closing-time. The player takes control of the park's owner, Colonel G. Bogey. A disgruntled employee has scattered the takings all over the fairground in the form of money bags. The goal is to collect the money. Start of the game In order to complete the game, the player must collect every money bag which is strewn around the city- sized amusement park; even the money bags placed on precarious perches and in the middle of rides. In order to do this, gambles and risks will have to be taken. The player can also be killed instantaneously by some dangers. This can be caused by numerous careless acts such as jumping from a great height, getting skewered by an erratic turnstile. The player has ten lives. Once the protagonist has died ten times, the player loses and the game is over. Reception A 1985 review in CRASH gave Roller Coaster a 94%. Four years later, in a review of the budget re-release of Roller Coaster, CRASH magazine wrote, \\"The emphasis in Roller Coaster is to have vast amounts of fun, and, boy, do you! Each screen is deviously devised, but not difficult to master once you get to grips with the gameplay. And the gameplay--it's so addictive! Don't hesitate to buy Roller Coaster!\\" Legacy Start of Dragon's Lair: The Legend Roller Coaster was reworked into the 1991 Game Boy title Dragon's Lair: The Legend, with the game's plot and graphics amended in order to closer resemble those of the original Dragon's Lair coin-op. As less of the playing area was visible in the Game Boy port than in the Spectrum version, the display was effectively a window on each of the original version's screens, scrolling within each one and flicking to the next when the edge of the screen was reached.

Biography Eckhart was born at Duingen in the Principality of Calenberg. After preparatory training at Schulpforta, he went to Leipzig, where at first, at the desire of his mother, he studied theology, but soon turned his attention to philology and history. On completing his course he became secretary to Field-Marshal Count Flemming, chief minister to the Elector of Saxony; after a short time, however, he went to Hannover to find a permanent position. Owing to his extensive learning he was soon useful to Gottfried Leibniz, who in 1694 took Eckhart as assistant, and was, until death, his large-hearted patron and generous friend. Through the efforts of Leibniz, Eckhart was appointed professor of history at Helmstedt in 1706, and in 1714 councillor at Hannover. After the death of Leibniz 1716 he was made librarian and historiographer to the House of Hanover, in 1719 he outlined the Protogaea by the geological formation he had noticed in 1718 at the Ernst-August-Canal of the Herrenhausen Gardens.J. G. Eckhart, Beschreibung desjenigen, was bey Grabung des Herrenh√§user‚ÄêCanals am Lein‚ÄêStrome her Curi√∂ses in der Erde gefunden worden, Neue Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen auf das Jahr 1719 Nr. 24, 185‚Äì192, see Cornelius Steckner: L√ºgenstein und Weltarch√§ologie. Later he was ennobled by Emperor Charles VI, to whom he had dedicated his work Origines Austriacae (Lipsia 1721 ). For reasons which have never been clearly explained he gave up his position, in 1723, and fled from Hanover, perhaps on account of debt, to the Benedictine monastery at Corvey, and thence to the Jesuits at Cologne, where he became a Catholic. Not long after this, Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, Bishop of W√ºrzburg appointed Eckhart his librarian and historiographer. In his work Eckhart was influenced by the new school of French historians, and gave careful attention to the so-called auxiliary sciences, above all to diplomatics; he also strove earnestly to follow a strictly scientific method in his treatment of historical materials. Together with Leibniz he is considered a founder of modern historiography in Germany. Besides the help he rendered Leibniz, of whom he edited the Collectanea Etymologica (1717) and prepared an affectionately respectful obituary (in Christoph Gottlieb von Murr, Journal f√ºr Kunstgeschichte, VII), he issued a number of independent works. His chief work, while professor at Helmsted, is his Historia studii etymologici linguae germanicae haetenus impensi Hanover, 1711), a literary and historical study of all works bearing on the investigation of the Germanic languages. At Hanover he compiled a Corpus historicum medii aevi (Leipzig, 1723), in two volumes; at W√ºrzburg he published the Commentarii de rebus Franciae Orientalis et episcopatus Wirceburgensis (1729), also in two volumes. In 1725, Eckhart, along with Ignatz Roderick, in order of the Prince-Bishop of W√ºrzburg Christoph Franz von Hutten, reproduced the hoax of their fellow academic Johann Beringer, at the University of W√ºrzburg, in the \\"Lying Stones\\" affair. It is likeley, that Beringer himself acted as the front-end of the local Jesuits, to aim Eckhart as the follower of the model of natural history, pronounced in the Protogaea.Cornelius Steckner, L√úGENSTEIN UND WELTARCH√ÑOLOGIE Zum 300j√§hrigen Ged√§chtnis der Approbation der Leibnizschen Protogaea, in: Irrt√ºmer & F√§lschungen der Arch√§ologie (Herne 2018; ) S. 86 - 93.

Kathina is a Buddhist festival which comes at the end of Vassa, the three-month rainy season retreat for Theravada Buddhists in Bangladesh (known as Ka·π≠hina Cƒ´bar DƒÅn), Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.Kathina at BBC The season during which a monastery may hold Kathina is one month long, beginning after the full moon of the eleventh month in the Lunar calendar (usually October). It is a time of giving, for the laity to express gratitude to bhikkhus (Buddhist monks).Vassa (Rains Retreat) and Kathina (Robe Offering) CeremonyVassa, The Rains Retreat Lay Buddhists bring donations to temples, especially new robes for the monks. Also the gift of the attha parikara (in Sri Lanka it is known as Atapirikara ‡∂Ö‡∂ß‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂ö‡∂ª ) - the Eight Requisites - is part of the offerings. Origins Kathina is a Pali word referring to the wooden frame used to measure the length and width by which the robes of Buddhist monks are cut. As the legend goes, thirty bhikkhus were journeying with the intention of spending Vassa with Gautama Buddha. However, the rains began before they reached their destination and they had to stop at Saketa.Buddhist Festivals: Kathina According to Buddha's guidelines for Vassa, mendicant monks shouldn't travel during the rainy season as they may unintentionally harm crops and/or insects during their journey.Lay Buddhist Practice - The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence As such, the monks had to stop. The bhikkhus passed their time together without conflict and practicing Dhamma so afterwards, the Buddha rewarded the monks by demonstrating a way to practice sharing and generosity. A lay disciple had previously donated pieces of cloth to the Buddha, so the Buddha now gave the pieces to the group of monks and told them to make it into a robe and then offer it as a gift to one of them. A frame, called a Kathina, was used to hold the pieces while they were being made into one robe. Practices Myanmar Kahtein trees from Myanmar Kathein (, from Pali ) refers to the ceremony during which yellow robes called matho thingan () are offered to the sangha between the first waning day of Thadingyut (, approximately October) and the full moon day of Tazaungmon (, approximately November)Kahtein Festival of Tazaungmon in the Burmese calendar. During this period, certain rules of the Vinaya are relaxed for monks. Kahtein trees called badaytha bin (), on which offerings like money are hung, are also offered. Thailand and Laos Kathin () in Thailand (there is also the transcription \\"gathin\\" in use) is the name for the robes of an ordained monk.On-line Royal Institute Dictionary (ORID - 1999) The ceremony of kathina is called Thod Kathin (). The Thai lunar calendar reckons the day after the 11th full moon as Waning 1, Evening, Moon 11 (). The presentation of kathin by the King of Thailand's representative is called The Royal Kathin Ceremony and often has been an occasion for one of Thailand's Royal Barge Processions. The Kathin Festival is a traditional Buddhist festival celebrated by villagers in Isan and Laos. Colourful parades and offering ceremonies at the end of monks' retreat at local temples. On Ok Phansa day of the full moon, villagers and city dwellers will go to their local temple for prayers and paying respect to the sacred. Ok Phansa is also the beginning of a 30-day period of merit-making which affords a special opportunity for prayers to Buddha and for the presentation of gifts to the monks for preserving the faith. This 30-day span of merit making and religious gift giving is referred to as Thord Pha Gathin. Thord Gathin takes its name from the \\"laying down\\" of new robes to the monks. The offering of new, saffron robes to the monks is particularly meritorious and important. Other gifts to the monks may include basic utensils, toiletries, writing materials, and food. Gift-giving is an act of appreciation and gratitude to the monks. Individuals or community groups (such as a village) may perform them. Many villagers combine efforts by collecting cash donations for the maintenance of their local temple. Such donations are vividly arranged on a \\"money tree\\" which looks rather like a colourful Christmas tree bedecked with banknotes as the \\"foliage\\". The money tree is ceremoniously paraded to the temple, led by a team of drummers and musicians, with the villagers carrying their own individual gifts on trays bringing up the rear. In this way at Thord Gathin, the lay-people of Thailand reaffirm their faith and, in a joyous fashion, bring gifts to Buddha and his servants.  Malaysia  Kathina has been held in Malaysia since 2009, across many temples. Although 19.4% of those practicing Buddhism in Malaysia are predominantly of the Mahayana tradition, a recent emergence of the Theravada tradition from Thailand in the North and Sri Lanka in the South has started the tradition of the observance of Vassa across Buddhist temples in Malaysia. Vassa is observed starting on the fifteenth day of the sixth month of the Chinese lunar calendar, and the choice of the date of the Kathina celebration, as well as the end of Vassa observance for each respective temple can range from the first day of the ninth lunar month to the fifteenth day of the tenth lunar month.

It takes place over the course of a few weeks in October, spread on more than 20 stages across several neighborhoods in downtown Manhattan, notably the Lower East Side, the East Village, and Greenwich Village. Most of the venues are centered around the FringeHUB. Attendance in 2009 topped 75,000 people. Festival Unlike most Fringe festivals, FringeNYC uses a jury-based selection process. Around 200 shows, out of a much larger pool of applicants, are selected for inclusion each year. However, from 2018 the Festival reduced the number of shows. The festival was founded in 1997 by Aaron Beall, John Clancy, Jonathan Harris (also known as Ezra Buzzington), and (current Artistic Director) Elena K. Holy, and is produced by The Present Company. Notable shows that premiered at FringeNYC include Urinetown, Dog Sees God, the musical adaptation of Debbie Does Dallas, and the American English-language premiere of The Black Rider. Other feature shows included Charlie Victor Romeo, which premiered at New York Lower East Side theatre Collective:Unconscious. FringeNYC includes many component events, such as FringeU (educational events), FringeART (art events), FringeAL FRESCO (free outdoor performances), and FringeJR (children's events). At the conclusion of the festival around 20 shows are selected to participate in the FringeNYC Encore Series which runs for an additional two weeks in September. The festival went on hiatus in 2017 to revise its format and develop ambitious long-term plans. It ran in the fall of 2018 and 2019 with fewer performances and smaller venues, and included performances in the outer boroughs. As of June 2020, its website was unavailable.

He wrote extensively on issues in this field, and was professor of constitutional and public law at Padua University, and subsequently at the University of Bologna and Rome (\\"La Sapienza\\").

Life Nothing is known of John's early life; of aristocratic birth, he possibly was of Lorraine descendance from the area of Metz. Having received a thorough spiritual education, he was elected abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Viktring in Carinthia on 15 February 1312. His high-mindedness and distinction opened him the doors to the Carinthian nobility and administration. John served as a chaplain and confidential secretary to the Meinhardiner duke Henry of Carinthia; in 1330, he accompanied King John of Bohemia on his campaign from Tyrolean Innsbruck across the Brenner Pass to Trent, presumably at the behest of the Carinthian duke. Upon the Henry's death in 1335, John journeyed to the Austrian city of Linz at the request of Henry's daughter, Countess Margaret of Tyrol, in order to defend her claims to her father's estates before the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV. Though Margaret could rely on her marriage with Prince John Henry of Luxembourg, the mission ultimately failed when the two Habsburg dukes, Albert II of Austria and his brother Otto the Merry, took possession of the contested Carinthian lands in her stead. The Austrian dukes thereby also became the lords of Viktring Abbey, they too learned to value the abbot's abilities and consulted him in all important government matters. John frequently stayed at their residence in Vienna as a confidential secretary until 1341, when he withdrew to the quiet of his Carinthian monastery to write a history of his own time. He also appeared as chaplain of Patriarch Bertram of Aquileia. Work His chronicle, which he titled Liber certarum historiarum (\\"Book of certain histories\\"), has come down to us in various forms. In its original form, as preserved in a manuscript at the Bavarian State Library in Munich, it is a history of the Austrian and Carinthian lands from the accession of the last Babenberg duke Frederick II the Warlike in 1230 until 1341, dedicated to the Habsburg duke Albert II. The information on the earlier period was based on the rhyming chronicle of the medieval historian Ottokar from Gaal and the works by Martin of Opava, while the rest was written from data which he himself had collected during his many travels. In 1342, he enlarged the book into a chronicle of the Holy Roman Empire, which began with the year 1217. He rewrote it again in 1343, this time beginning with the Carolingian period. This revised work has only reached us through a later compilation, the so-called Chronicon Anonymi Leobiensis. John ranks among the most important chroniclers of the late Middle Ages. He was a very learned man and well acquainted with the Latin and Greek poets. His narrative is lucid, and his judgments on the events of his own time show great impartiality. He is influenced by Otto of Freising (d. 1158), and condemns in his chronicle the anti-Roman policy of Emperor Louis.

Originally established on 11 October 1948 it was disestablished on 1 October 1993. It was the second U.S. Navy squadron to be designated VF-33.  VF-33 History  Korean War The VF-33 Tarsiers patch featuring \\"Minky\\", a Tarsier monkey. The squadron was originally equipped with the Chance-Vought F4U-4 Corsair. It was assigned to Carrier Air Group Three (CVG-3) and made two deployments on the aircraft carrier . The first was to the Mediterranean Sea in mid-1950 quickly followed by a combat deployment to Korea from September 1950 to February 1951. For its action in the Korean War VF-33 earned the Navy Unit Citation. The squadron called themselves the \\"Tarsiers\\", which was a fierce monkey. The squadron affectionately called their Tarsier \\"Minky\\". Jet transition Following its deployment to Korea VF-33 returned to the U.S. East Coast and transitioned to the F9F-6 Cougar. The squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Group Six (CVG-6) and deployed to the Mediterranean Sea aboard the in 1954. After this tour the Tarsiers again transitioned to the FJ-3 Fury and made three deployments in 1956 and 1957 to the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, this time aboard the carriers , USS Leyte, and . Aboard Intrepid VF-33 took part in the NATO exercise Operation Strikeback. In 1958 VF-33 transitioned to the supersonic F-11 Tiger and was renamed Astronauts. As part of CVG-6 VF-33 made two tours to the Mediterranean Sea aboard the Intrepid. In early 1961 the squadron changed already to its fourth jet fighter in seven years, the F8U-1E Crusader, and changed its name back to Tarsiers. VF-33 took its F8U-1E (F-8B) again aboard Intrepid to the Mediterranean in 1961-62 and was then equipped with the F8U-2NE (F-8E) version. The squadron was then deployed aboard the , to the Mediterranean Sea in August 1962. However, Enterprise was recalled in October to reinforce the naval blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1963 Enterprise and CVW-6 were again deployed to the United States Sixth Fleet, before taking part in Operation Sea Orbit in 1964. This was the around-the-world cruise of the United States Navy's Task Force One, consisting of USS Enterprise, , and . This all-nuclear- powered unit steamed 56,606 km (30,565 nm) unrefuelled around the world for sixty-five days. In 1964 the unit transitioned to the F-4 Phantom II and would fly the Phantom for the next seventeen years alongside its sister squadron VF-102. The first VF-33 Phantom was the F-4B, which they flew until 1967 at which time they moved up to the F-4J which featured better radar, higher thrust engines, slatted tailplanes, extra fuel cells and a larger main wheels to handle the increased weight. Between 1965 and 1968 Carrier Air Wing Six made the shakedown cruise and three deployments aboard the . Vietnam operations VF-33 deployed to the Vietnam War on board USS America from 10 April to 16 December 1968. During their time in the theatre VF-33 would drop over three million pounds of ordnance, flying 4000 combat hours over a period of 5 months. On 4 June F-4J #155554 was hit by antiaircraft fire, the pilot LT Eric Brice was killed in action, body not recovered, while the Radar Intercept Officer ejected successfully and was rescued. On 18 June F-4J #155546 was hit by a SAM-2, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. On 10 July a squadron aircraft downed a Vietnam People's Air Force MiG-21, the first air- to-air kill by an East Coast Fighter Squadron over North Vietnam. On 24 July F-4J #155551 was hit by anti-aircraft fire, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. Middle East crises After their return, VF-33 was reassigned to Carrier Air Wing Seven, and made eight deployments aboard the to the Mediterranean between 1969 and 1981. In September 1970 Independence, , and were deployed to the Middle East in case of any crisis evolving after the death of the Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser. A real crisis finally evolved in 1973 when Israel took heavy losses during the Yom Kippur War. To support Israel the U.S. initiated Operation Nickel Grass, which was an overt strategic airlift operation conducted by the United States to deliver weapons and supplies to Israel. Military Airlift Command shipped 22,325 tons of tanks, artillery, ammunition, and supplies in C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft between 12 October and 14 November 1973. The USAF planes only flew over international waters and were escorted by U.S. Navy fighters over the Mediterranean, provided by CVW-1 (on John F. Kennedy), CVW-6 (on ) and CVW-7. The carriers operated about every 500 km, Independence operating as the easternmost carrier off Crete. The carriers also served as refueling stops for A-4E Skyhawk fighters, which were taken from U.S. Navy stocks to replace the losses of the Israeli Air Force.http://aupress.maxwell.af.mil/saas_Theses/colella/colella.pdf S. 45-52 VF-33 won several awards including the CNO Safety Award in 1969 and 1970 and during the 1975‚Äì1976 cruise they won the Golden Tailhook Award as the Navy recognised their skill at carrier landing. In February 1979 VF-33 had flown three years without accident. In early 1979 VF-33 also operated from the during that carrier's shakedown cruise. Tomcat transition In 1981 VF-33 transitioned to the F-14A Tomcat along with VF-102 and joined Carrier Air Wing One assigned to USS America. Until 1992 VF-33 made twelve deployments with CVW-1 aboard the America to the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their first deployment was a grueling North Atlantic NATO deployment (Northern Wedding) between August and October 1982. VF-33 has used stars as part of their tail markings since the Crusader days and settled on a large star for their latter F-4 tenure and as the main symbol on the Tomcat. In 1987, they abandoned \\"Minky\\" and changed their name from Tarsiers to Starfighters, which was their radio callsign. The new patch featured a large star with a head-on view of a Tomcat. On 20 August 1985 VF-33 was the first squadron to complete 50 missile firings without a single failure. Gulf of Sidra operations In March 1986 VF-33 would bring their F-14s into a combat environment for the first time on board USS America with Carrier Air Wing 1 as they took part in Operation Attain Document in the Mediterranean Sea alongside the Saratoga and . VF-33 engaged two Libyan MiG-25s with intent on shooting down the F-14s, but the Tomcats outmaneuvered the Libyans and ended behind the Libyan fighters, but the pilots did not have permission to open fire. Along with VF-102 they provided air cover during the operation as the carrier group moved into the Gulf of Sidra, which was claimed by Libya to be the Line of Death. Libya claimed its territorial waters extended across the entire Gulf of Sidra as opposed to the internationally recognised limit of 12 miles, and because of this claim, any airplane or ship within these waters was alleged to be in Libyan territory and liable to attack. US carriers occasionally challenged this assertion resulting in the first VF-41 Tomcat engagements with Libyan fighters in August 1981. On 15 April 1986, after a terrorist attack on disco hall La Belle in Berlin, killing two American servicemen and a Turkish woman, President Ronald Reagan ordered airstrikes, called Operation El Dorado Canyon, against targets in Libya. F-111 bombers based at RAF Lakenheath and RAF Upper Heyford in the United Kingdom attacked targets in Tripoli while U.S. Navy A-6 Intruders from America and Coral Sea attacked targets in Benghazi. Navy and United States Marine Corps F/A-18 Hornets and Navy A-7‚Äôs attacked surface-to-air missile sites with AGM-88 HARM missiles. F-14 squadrons deployed in the Mediterranean, including VF-33, flew cover for the strike force. In 1986, VF-33 flew 895 continuous sorties without an abort. In 1987 VF-33 made a short cruise on board the Navy‚Äôs newest carrier, the . After workups in 1988, VF-33 deployed on board America to the North Atlantic in February 1989, and again for a six-month Med-IO cruise from May through November. In February 1990 VF-33 made a two and a half month transit from San Diego to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard aboard USS Constellation (CV-64) providing fighter protection as the carrier made the journey around the southern tip of South America. VF-33 took part in several joint \\"Gringo- Gaucho\\" Exercises with South American nations during the transit. Desert Storm operations When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, four aircraft carriers were deployed to the region to provide carrier based air support for Operation Desert Shield. As the deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait approached in January 1991, Theodore Roosevelt and America deployed to the region via the Suez Canal. VF-33 deployed with USS America arriving just as Operation Desert Storm commenced. America flew sorties alongside John F. Kennedy and Saratoga in the Red Sea before moving to the Persian Gulf to join USS Midway, and Theodore Roosevelt. VF-33 and VF-102 were the only Tomcat squadrons to fly missions from both the Red Sea and Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm. Disestablishment In 1993 a VF-33 airframe became the first F-14 to log 5,000 flight hours. When the Navy decided to assign only a single TARPS Tomcat squadron per carrier air wing after the end of the Cold War, VF-33 was not TARPS capable and despite the squadron's success in Desert Storm, it was disestablished on 1 October 1993. However, the tradition of VF-33 lives on through a very active alumni group that hosts a website and periodic reunions.

The ghetto, set up in the second half of 1941 was liquidated in June 1943; all its inhabitants who survived prior killings were deported to the Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp and the Janowska concentration camp. Background Lviv (Polish: Lw√≥w) was a multicultural city just before World War II, with a population of 312,231. The city's 157,490 ethnic Poles constituted just over 50 per cent, with Jews at 32 per cent (99,595) and Ukrainians at 16 per cent (49,747). On 28 September 1939, after the joint Soviet-German invasion, the USSR and Germany signed the German‚ÄìSoviet Frontier Treaty, which assigned about 200,000 km2 (77,000 sq mi) of Polish territory inhabited by 13.5 million people of all nationalities to the Soviet Union. Lviv was then annexed to the Soviet Union. At the time of the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, about 160,000 Jews lived in the city; the number had swelled by tens of thousands due to the arrival of Jewish refugees from German-occupied Poland in late 1939. All along the German-Soviet front, the Soviet secret police (the NKVD) engaged in mass murder of prisoners, in what later became known as the NKVD prisoner massacres. According to estimates by contemporary historians, the number of victims in Western Ukraine was probably between 10,000 and 40,000, at least two-thirds of them were ethnic Ukrainians. German invasion and pogroms Lviv was occupied by the German Wehrmacht in the early hours of 30 June 1941. That day, Jews were press-ganged by the Germans to remove bodies of the NKVD's victims from the three local jails. During the morning of 30 June, an ad hoc Ukrainian People's Militia was formed in the city. It included OUN activists who had moved in from Krakow with the Germans, OUN members who lived in Lviv, and former Soviet policemen‚Äîwho had either decided to switch sides or who were OUN members that had infiltrated the Soviet police. A full- blown pogrom began on the next day, 1 July. Jews were taken from their apartments, made to clean streets on their hands and knees, or perform rituals that identified them with Communism. Jews continued to be brought to the three prisons, first to exhume the bodies and then to be killed. Sub-units of Einsatzgruppe C arrived on 2 July, at which point violence escalated further. The SS death squad conducted a series of mass-murder operations which continued for the next few days. A second pogrom took place in the last days of July 1941 and was named the \\"Petlura Days\\" after the assassinated Ukrainian leader and pogromist Symon Petliura. This pogrom was organized by the Nazis, but carried out by the Ukrainians, as a prologue to the total annihilation of the Jewish population of Lw√≥w. Somewhere in the neighborhood of between 5,000‚Äì7,000 Jews were brutally beaten and more than 2,000 murdered in this massacre.Richard Breitman. Himmler and the 'Terrible Secret' among the Executioners. Journal of Contemporary History, Vol. 26, No. 3/4, The Impact of Western Nationalisms: Essays Dedicated to Walter Z. Laqueur on the Occasion of His 70th Birthday (Sep., 1991), pp. 431-451 In addition, some 3,000 persons, mostly Jews, were executed in the municipal stadium by the German military. The Ghetto Following the Nazi takeover, one of the most prolific mass murderers in the SS, Gruppenf√ºhrer Fritz Katzmann, became the Higher SS and Police Leader (SSPF) of Lw√≥w. On his orders the Ghetto called J√ºdischer Wohnbezirk was established on November 8, 1941 in the northern part of the city. Some 80,000 Jews were ordered to move there by December 15, 1941 and all Poles and Ukrainians to move out. The neighborhood which was designated to form the Jewish quarter was Zamarstyn√≥w (now Zamarstyniv). Before the war it was one of the poorest suburbs of Lw√≥w. German police also began a series of \\"selections\\" in an operation called \\"Action under the bridge\\" - 5,000 elderly and sick Jews were shot as they crossed under the rail bridge on Pe≈Çtewna Street (called bridge of death by the Jews) moving slowly toward the gate. Eventually, between 110,000 and 120,000 Jews were forced into the new ghetto. The living conditions there were extremely poor, coupled with severe overcrowding. For example, food rations allocated to the Jews were estimated to equal only 10% of the German and 50% of the Ukrainian or Polish rations.Filip Friedman, Zag≈Çada ≈ªyd√≥w lwowskich (Extermination of the Jews of Lw√≥w) . The Germans established a Jewish police force called the J√ºdischer Ordnungsdienst Lemberg wearing dark blue Polish police uniforms from before World War II, but with the Polish insignia replaced by a Magen David and the new letters J.O.L. in various positions on their uniform. They were given rubber truncheons. Their ranks numbered from 500 to 750 policemen. The Jewish police force answered to the Jewish National city council known as the Judenrat, which in turn answered to the Gestapo. Deportations Hanging of the Lw√≥w Ghetto Judenrat, 1942 The Lemberg Ghetto was one of the first to have Jews transported to the death camps as part of Aktion Reinhard. Between March 16 and April 1, 1942, approximately 15,000 Jews were taken to the Klepar√≥w railway station and deported to the Belzec extermination camp. Following these initial deportations, and death by disease and random shootings, around 86,000 Jews officially remained in the ghetto, though there were many more not recorded. During this period, many Jews were also forced to work for the Wehrmacht and the ghetto's German administration, especially in the nearby Janowska labor camp. On June 24‚Äì25, 1942, 2,000 Jews were taken to the labor camp; only 120 were used for forced labor, and all of the others were shot. Between August 10‚Äì31, 1942, the \\"Great Aktion\\" was carried out, where between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews were rounded up, gathered at transit point placed in Janowska camp and then deported to Belzec. Many who were not deported, including local orphans and hospital inpatients, were shot. On September 1, 1942, the Gestapo hanged the head of Lw√≥w‚Äôs Judenrat and members of the ghetto's Jewish police force on balconies of Judenrat's building at ≈Åokietka street and Hermana street corner. Around 65,000 Jews remained while winter approached with no heating or sanitation, leading to an outbreak of typhus. Between January 5‚Äì7, 1943, another 15,000-20,000 Jews, including the last members of the Judenrat, were shot outside of the town on the orders of Fritz Katzmann. After this aktion in January 1943 Judenrat was dissolved, that what remained of the ghetto was renamed Judenlager Lemberg (Jewish Camp Lw√≥w), thus formally redesigned as labor camp with about 12,000 legal Jews, able to work in German war industry and several thousands illegal Jews (mainly women, children and elderly) hiding in it. In the beginning of June 1943 Germans decided to finally end the existence of the Jewish quarter and its inhabitants. As Nazis entered the Ghetto they met some sporadic acts of armed resistance, but most of the Jews were trying to hide themselves in earlier prepared hideouts (so called bunkers). In effect many buildings were suffused with gasoline and burned in order to \\"flush out\\" Jews from their hiding places. Some Jews managed to escape or to conceal themselves in the sewer system. By the time that the Soviet Red Army entered Lw√≥w on July 26, 1944, only a few hundred Jews remained in the city. Number varies from 200 to 900 (823 according to data of Jewish Provisional Committee in Lw√≥w, from 1945). Among its notable inhabitants was Chaim Widawski, who disseminated news about the war picked up with an illegal radio. Polish Olympic football player Leon Sperling was shot to death by the Nazis in the ghetto in December 1941. Nazi- hunter Simon Wiesenthal was one of the best-known Jewish inhabitants of Lemberg Ghetto to survive the war (as his memoirs (The Executioners Among Us) indicate, he was saved from execution by a Ukrainian policeman), though he was later transported to a concentration camp, rather than remaining in the ghetto. Rescue Some local gentiles attempted to aid and shelter the Jews. Kazimiera Nazarewicz, a Polish nanny hired by a Jewish family, sheltered their daughter throughout the war, and delivered aid to her parents who were imprisoned in the ghetto. After the war, Nazarewicz became one of the recipients of the Righteous Among the Nations title. Leopold Socha and Stefan Wr√≥blewski, laborers maintaining the municipal sewage system, organized in them shelters for 21 one Jews who survived the ghetto's liquidation; 10 of them survived the war. Socha, Wr√≥blewski and their wives received the Righteous titles after the war. Another Righteous, Miroslav Kravchuk, with the help of some acquaintances, shelter his Jewish ex-wife, and some of their other family members and acquaintances. Kravchuk survived a 6-month imprisonment by Gestapo following their arrest of him under the suspicion of him helping Jews. See also *In Darkness 2011 historical drama by David F.

Most members reside in 16 countries across Europe, primarily Germany and France, with the Grail Movement reporting hundreds of members in Britain and in the USA. It can also be found in Canada, Brazil and currently established in 22 African countries such as Nigeria, Zaire (DR Congo) and C√¥te d'Ivoire, as well as in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Ecuador amongst others. Worldwide, there are approximately 10,000 members of the Grail Movement. A declaration of the personal commitment to adhere to the principles of the Grail Message can be made by a request for the \\"Sealing\\", a Grail Act (ceremony) that takes place during one of three annual Grail Festivals. This, however, is a personal decision on the part of the individual and leads neither to commitment to an organization nor to formal links with other adherents. Background The Grail Movement had its beginnings when Oskar Ernst Bernhardt took up residence in Vomperberg, Tyrol (Austria) in 1928, in order to focus on the writing of his major work \\"In the Light of Truth\\" - The Grail Message (as Abd Ru Shin), which was then followed by other works. The establishment of the Grail Settlement on Vomperberg came about when groups of readers of The Grail Message, wishing to live and work in his immediate vicinity, took up residence there. The Settlement developed gradually; adding residences, work and administration buildings and then a small hall with seating for about 300 people. This hall was used by Abd-ru- shin for Sunday Hours of Worship and for the three annual Grail Festivals, Easter Festival etc., to which adherents of the Grail Message also journeyed. This development was interrupted in 1938 when the Nazi regime annexed Austria and expropriated the Grail Settlement. Abd-ru-shin was arrested on the first day of the annexation and taken to Innsbruck prison. All residents were expelled so that the Settlement could be used as a Nazi training camp. Abd-ru- shin was eventually released but kept under house arrest and surveillance until he died in 1941 in Kipsdorf, Germany. It was not until late in 1945 when the Allies returned the Settlement to his widow Maria Bernhardt that, under her direction, new development began. During this time the term \\"Grail Movement\\" was in common use, as a group designation for adherents of the Grail Message. Over the years national Grail Movements have formed in many countries, some of which, (e.g., Canada, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands, Congo (Zaire) and Nigeria) have built their own Halls of Worship although Abd-ru-shin had explicitly stated in his writings that he had not come to establish a new religion.https://grail-message.com/for-your- guidance-100/ Publications Grail Movement books * In the Light of Truth: The Grail Message, Vol. 1 (Paperback).

The sphenoid sinuses vary in size and shape, and owing to the lateral displacement of the intervening septum, which may insert on the carotid canal, they are rarely symmetrical. They cannot be palpated during an extraoral examination.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 64 The following are their average measurements: vertical height, 2.2 cm; transverse breadth, 2 cm; antero-posterior depth, 2.2 cm. Structure Paranasal sinuses When exceptionally large the sphenoid sinuses may extend into the roots of the pterygoid processes or great wings, and may invade the basilar part of the occipital bone. Each sinus opens into the roof of the nasal cavity via apertures on the posterior wall of the sphenoethmoidal recess directly above the choana. The apertures are located high on the anterior walls of the sinuses themselves. Development They are present as very small cavities at birth, and slowly develop with the growth of the skull. Just after puberty the sinuses finish development.Human Anatomy, Jacob, Elsevier, 2008, page 211 Nerve supply The mucous membrane receives sensory innervation by the posterior ethmoidal nerves (branch of the ophthalmic nerve), and postganglionic parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve that synapsed at the pterygopalatine ganglion which controls secretion of mucus. Clinical significance * A potential complication of sphenoidal sinusitis is cavernous sinus thrombosis. * If a fast-growing tumor erodes the floor of the sinus, the vidian nerve could be in danger. If the tumor spreads laterally, the cavernous sinus and all its constituent nerves could be in danger. An endonasal surgical procedure called a sphenoidotomy may be carried out to enlarge the sphenoid sinus, usually in order to drain it. Use in neurosurgery Because only thin shelves of bone separate the sphenoidal sinuses from the nasal cavities below and hypophyseal fossa above, the pituitary gland can be surgically approached through the roof of the nasal cavities by first passing through the anterioinferior aspect of the sphenoid bone and into the sinuses, followed by entry through the top of the sphenoid bone into the hypophyseal fossa.

He was the son of Steve Howe, guitarist and long-time member of Yes. Career Born in London, Virgil Howe was the second son of guitarist Steve Howe. He played on several of his father's projects: he performed on keys, alongside his brother Dylan Howe on drums, for the Steve Howe solo albums The Grand Scheme of Things (1993) and Spectrum (2005). He was in Steve Howe's Remedy band, who released an album Elements (2003), toured the UK and then released a live DVD. He wrote and performed on a piece on his father's 2011 release Time. He also plays drums on 11 tracks of Steve Howe's Anthology 2: Groups and Collaborations that were largely recorded in the 1980s. Under the name The Verge, Virgil Howe produced the Yes Remixes album, released 2003. Howe was in The Dirty Feel, with Kerim 'Kez' Gunes (bass, vocals) and Nick Hirsch (guitar, vocals; died 2012). A debut single, \\"Get Down and Love In\\", had a limited UK release in 2004. They were signed to DirtE. In 2005, the band took part in MTV's A-Cut amateur band competition. In 2005, Howe formed a related band The Killer Meters with again Gunes on bass and Hirsch on guitar, with Karime Kendra (vocals), Henry Broadbent (keyboards) and Stephen Wilcock (saxophone). They released a tribute album to The Meters and then signed to Breaking Bread records in 2008, releasing an original album. Howe also worked for a period with psychedelic group Amorphous Androgynous, fronted by Garry Cobain of The Future Sound of London. Howe produced under his own name, having previously produced under the name \\"Sparo\\", under which he released the album Sparo Worlds. He also played DJ sets in London, and a regular radio show for Soho Radio. In 2008, Howe joined band Little Barrie as a drummer. Between 2009 and October 2010 the band wrote and recorded their third album King of the Waves, working again with Edwyn Collins, Seb Lewsley at the controls and Shawn Lee mixing. Chris Potter mastered the album. The first single off King of the Waves was \\"Surf Hell\\". This track was featured as the theme tune to the 2011 Channel 4 series Sirens and an advert for Rimmel \\"scandal eyes\\" mascara; it was also playable on the multi-platform video game \\"Rocksmith\\". The album was released in the UK on 27 June 2011 and in the US on 28 February 2012. After touring with Charles Bradley in Spain, Little Barrie was invited onto his North American Tour in early 2012. The band went on to do the theme music for the TV series Better Call Saul. Howe worked as a session musician on the Pet Shop Boys album Fundamental and for Demis Roussos. Nexus, released 17 November 2017 on InsideOut, is a joint album by Virgil & Steve Howe. Father Steve described the album: \\"Most of the credit goes to Virgil on this; it's Virgil's bed and melodies but I've come in to add a little bit more.\\"\\"The Howes' Otherworldly Delights\\", by Natasha Scharf, Prog issue 80, September 2017, pp. 12‚Äì3  Personal life  Howe married fashion model Jen Dawson in 2007 and they had a daughter, Zuni, in September 2012. They separated in 2015. Howe died unexpectedly of a heart attack in September 2017 at the age of 41, shortly before Little Barrie were scheduled to embark on a tour for their fourth album, Death Express.

Left: a G-tetrad. Right: an intramolecular G4 complex. In molecular biology, G-quadruplex secondary structures (G4) are formed in nucleic acids by sequences that are rich in guanine. They are helical in shape and contain guanine tetrads that can form from one, two or four strands. The unimolecular forms often occur naturally near the ends of the chromosomes, better known as the telomeric regions, and in transcriptional regulatory regions of multiple genes, both in microbes and across vertebrates including oncogenes in humans. Four guanine bases can associate through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form a square planar structure called a guanine tetrad (G-tetrad or G-quartet), and two or more guanine tetrads (from G-tracts, continuous runs of guanine) can stack on top of each other to form a G-quadruplex. The placement and bonding to form G-quadruplexes is not random and serve very unusual functional purposes. The quadruplex structure is further stabilized by the presence of a cation, especially potassium, which sits in a central channel between each pair of tetrads. They can be formed of DNA, RNA, LNA, and PNA, and may be intramolecular, bimolecular, or tetramolecular. Depending on the direction of the strands or parts of a strand that form the tetrads, structures may be described as parallel or antiparallel. G-quadruplex structures can be computationally predicted from DNA or RNA sequence motifs, but their actual structures can be quite varied within and between the motifs, which can number over 100,000 per genome. Their activities in basic genetic processes are an active area of research in telomere, gene regulation, and functional genomics research.  History  The identification of structures with a high guanine association became apparent in the early 1960s, through the identification of gel-like substances associated with guanines. More specifically, this research detailed the four- stranded DNA structures with a high association of guanines, which was later identified in eukaryotic telomeric regions of DNA in the 1980s. The importance of discovering G-quadruplex structure was described through the statement, ‚ÄúIf G-quadruplexes form so readily in vitro, Nature will have found a way of using them in vivo‚Äù - Aaron Klug, Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry (1982). Interest in in vivo function of G-quadruplexes surged after large scale genome-wide analysis showed the prevalence of potential G-quadruplex (pG4)-forming sequences within gene promoters of human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat - presented in the First International G-quadruplex Meeting held in April 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky. In 2006, the prevalence of G-quadruplexes within gene promoters of several bacterial genomes was reported predicting G-quadruplex- mediated gene regulation. With the abundance of G-quadruplexes in vivo, these structures hold a biologically relevant role through interactions with the promoter regions of oncogenes and the telomeric regions of DNA strands. Current research consists of identifying the biological function of these G-Quadruplex structures for specific oncogenes and discovering effective therapeutic treatments for cancer based on interactions with G-quadruplexes.3D Structure of the intramolecular human telomeric G-quadruplex in potassium solution. The backbone is represented by a tube. The center of this structure contains three layers of G-tetrads. The hydrogen bonds in these layers are represented by blue dashed lines. ()  Topology  The length of the nucleic acid sequences involved in tetrad formation determines how the quadruplex folds. Short sequences, consisting of only a single contiguous run of three or more guanine bases, require four individual strands to form a quadruplex. Such a quadruplex is described as tetramolecular, reflecting the requirement of four separate strands. The term G4 DNA was originally reserved for these tetramolecular structures that might play a role in meiosis. However, as currently used in molecular biology, the term G4 can mean G-quadruplexes of any molecularity. Longer sequences, which contain two contiguous runs of three or more guanine bases, where the guanine regions are separated by one or more bases, only require two such sequences to provide enough guanine bases to form a quadruplex. These structures, formed from two separate G-rich strands, are termed bimolecular quadruplexes. Finally, sequences which contain four distinct runs of guanine bases can form stable quadruplex structures by themselves, and a quadruplex formed entirely from a single strand is called an intramolecular quadruplex. Depending on how the individual runs of guanine bases are arranged in a bimolecular or intramolecular quadruplex, a quadruplex can adopt one of a number of topologies with varying loop configurations. If all strands of DNA proceed in the same direction, the quadruplex is termed parallel. For intramolecular quadruplexes, this means that any loop regions present must be of the propeller type, positioned to the sides of the quadruplex. If one or more of the runs of guanine bases has a 5‚Äô-3‚Äô direction opposite to the other runs of guanine bases, the quadruplex is said to have adopted an antiparallel topology. The loops joining runs of guanine bases in intramolecular antiparallel quadruplexes are either diagonal, joining two diagonally opposite runs of guanine bases, or lateral (edgewise) type loops, joining two adjacent runs of guanine base pairs. In quadruplexes formed from double-stranded DNA, possible interstrand topologies have also been discussed . Interstrand quadruplexes contain guanines that originate from both strands of dsDNA. Structure and functional role in genome Following sequencing of the human genome, many guanine-rich sequences that had the potential to form quadruplexes were discovered. Depending on cell type and cell cycle, mediating factors such as DNA-binding proteins on chromatin, composed of DNA tightly wound around histone proteins, and other environmental conditions and stresses affect the dynamic formation of quadruplexes. For instance, quantitative assessments of the thermodynamics of molecular crowding indicate that the antiparallel g-quadruplex is stabilized by molecular crowding. This effect seems to be mediated by alteration of the hydration of the DNA and its effect on Hoogsteen base pair bonding. These quadruplexes seemed to readily occur at the ends of chromosome. In addition, the propensity of g-quadruplex formation during transcription in RNA sequences with the potential to form mutually exclusive hairpin or G-quadruplex structures depends heavily on the position of the hairpin-forming sequence. Because repair enzymes would naturally recognize ends of linear chromosomes as damaged DNA and would process them as such to harmful effect for the cell, clear signaling and tight regulation is needed at the ends of linear chromosomes. Telomeres function to provide this signaling. Telomeres, rich in guanine and with a propensity to form g-quadruplexes, are located at the terminal ends of chromosomes and help maintain genome integrity by protecting these vulnerable terminal ends from instability. These telomeric regions are characterized by long regions of double-stranded CCCTAA:TTAGGG repeats. The repeats end with a 3‚Äô protrusion of between 10 and 50 single-stranded TTAGGG repeats. The heterodimeric complex ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase adds TTAGGG repeats at the 3‚Äô end of DNA strands. At these 3‚Äô end protrusions, the G-rich overhang can form secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes if the overhang is longer than four TTAGGG repeats. The presence of these structures prevent telomere elongation by the telomerase complex.  Telomeric quadruplexes  Telomeric repeats in a variety of organisms have been shown to form these quadruplex structures in vitro, and subsequently they have also been shown to form in vivo. The human telomeric repeat (which is the same for all vertebrates) consists of many repeats of the sequenced (GGTTAG), and the quadruplexes formed by this structure can be in bead-like structures of 5 nm to 8 nm in size and have been well studied by NMR, TEM and X-ray crystal structure determination. The formation of these quadruplexes in telomeres has been shown to decrease the activity of the enzyme telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining length of telomeres and is involved in around 85% of all cancers. This is an active target of drug discovery, including telomestatin.  Non-telomeric quadruplexes  Quadruplexes are present in locations other than at the telomere. Analysis of human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat genomes showed enormous number of potential G-quadruplex (pG4)-forming sequences in non-telomeric regions. A large number of the non-telomeric G-quadruplexes were found within gene promoters, and were conserved across the species. Similarly, large number of G-quadruplexes were found in the E. coli and hundreds of other microbial genomes. Here also, like vertebrates G-quadruplexes were enriched within gene promoters. Although these studies predicted G-quadruplex-mediated gene regulation, it is unlikely that all pG4s would form in vivo. The proto- oncogene c-myc forms a quadruplex in a nuclease hypersensitive region critical for gene activity. Other genes shown to form G-quadruplexes in their promoter regions include the chicken Œ≤-globin gene, human ubiquitin-ligase RFP2, and the proto-oncogenes c-kit, bcl-2, VEGF, H-ras and N-ras. Genome-wide surveys based on a quadruplex folding rule have been performed, which have identified 376,000 Putative Quadruplex Sequences (PQS) in the human genome, although not all of these probably form in vivo. A similar studies have identified putative G-quadruplexes in prokaryotes. There are several possible models for how quadruplexes could influence gene activity, either by upregulation or downregulation. One model is shown below, with G-quadruplex formation in or near a promoter blocking transcription of the gene, and hence de-activating it. In another model, quadruplex formed at the non-coding DNA strand helps to maintain an open conformation of the coding DNA strand and enhance an expression of the respective gene.  Function  It has been suggested that quadruplex formation plays a role in immunoglobulin heavy chain switching. As cells have evolved mechanisms for resolving (i.e., unwinding) quadruplexes that form. Quadruplex formation may be potentially damaging for a cell; the helicases WRN and Bloom syndrome protein have a high affinity for resolving DNA G-quadruplexes. The DEAH/RHA helicase, DHX36, has also been identified as a key G-quadruplex resolvase. In 2009, a metastasis suppressor protein NM23H2 (also known as NME2) was found to directly interact with G-quadruplex in the promoter of the c-myc gene, and transcriptionally regulate c-myc. More recently, NM23H2 was reported to interact with G-quadruplex in the promoter of the human telomerase (hTERT) gene and regulate hTERT expression In 2019, the telomere-binding-factor-2 (TRF2 or TERF2) was shown to bind to thousands of non-telomeric G-quadruplexes in the human genome by TRF2 ChIP-seq. There are many studies that implicate quadruplexes in both positive and negative transcriptional regulation, including epigenetic regulation of genes like hTERT. Function of G-quadruplexes have also been reported in allowing programmed recombination of immunologlobin heavy genes and the pilin antigenic variation system of the pathogenic Neisseria. The roles of quadruplex structure in translation control are not as well explored. The direct visualization of G-quadruplex structures in human cells as well as the co- crystal structure of an RNA helicase bound to a G-quadruplex have provided important confirmations of their relevance to cell biology. The potential positive and negative roles of quadruplexes in telomere replication and function remains controversial. T-loops and G-quadruplexes are described as the two tertiary DNA structures that protect telomere ends and regulate telomere length.  Cancer   Telomeres  G-quadruplex forming sequences are prevalent in eukaryotic cells, especially in telomeres, 5\` untranslated strands, and translocation hot spots. G-quadruplexes can inhibit normal cell function, and in healthy cells, are easily and readily unwound by helicase. However, in cancer cells that have mutated helicase these complexes cannot be unwound and leads to potential damage of the cell. This causes replication of damaged and cancerous cells. For therapeutic advances, stabilizing the G-quadruplexes of cancerous cells can inhibit cell growth and replication leading to the cell's death.  Promoter Regions  Along with the association of G-quadruplexes in telomeric regions of DNA, G-quadruplex structures have been identified in various human proto-oncogene promoter regions. The structures most present in the promoter regions of these oncogenes tend to be parallel-stranded G-quadruplex DNA structures. Some of these oncogenes include c-KIT, PDGF-A, c-Myc and VEGF, showing the importance of this secondary structure in cancer growth and development. While the formation of G-quadruplex structure vary to some extent for the different promoter regions of oncogenes, the consistent stabilization of these structures have been found in cancer development. Current therapeutic research actively focuses on targeting this stabilization of G-quadruplex structures to arrest unregulated cell growth and division. One particular gene region, the c-myc pathway, plays an integral role in the regulation of a protein product, c-Myc. With this product, the c-Myc protein functions in the processes of apoptosis and cell growth or development and as a transcriptional control on human telomerase reverse transcriptase. Interaction of c-Myc promoter G-quadruplex with NM23H2 was shown to regulate c-Myc in cancer cells in 2009 Regulation of c-myc through Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is also directly regulated through promoter G-quadruplex by interaction with the transcription factor NM23H2 where epigenetic modifications were dependent on NM23H2-G-quadruplex association. Recently, hTERT epigenetic regulation reported to be mediated through interaction of hTERT promoter G-quadruplex with the telomeric factor TRF2. Another gene pathway deals with the VEGF gene, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, which remains involved in the process of angiogenesis or the formation of new blood vessels. The formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure has been shown through studies on the polypurine tract of the promoter region of the VEGF gene. Through recent research on the role of G-quadruplex function in vivo, the stabilization of G-quadruplex structures was shown to regulate VEGF gene transcription, with inhibition of transcription factors in this pathway. The intramolecular G-quadruplex structures are formed mostly through the abundant guanine sequence in the promoter region of this specific pathway. The cyclin-dependent cell cycle checkpoint kinase inhibitor-1 CDKN1A (also known as p21) gene harbours promoter G-quadruplex. Interaction of this G-quadruplex with TRF2 (also known as TERF2) resulted in epigenetic regulation of p21, which was tested using the G-quadruplex-binding ligand 360A. Hypoxia inducible factor 1…ë, HIF-1…ë, remains involved in cancer signaling through its binding to Hypoxia Response Element, HRE, in the presence of hypoxia to begin the process of angiogenesis. Through recent research into this specific gene pathway, the polypurine and polypyrimidine region allows for the transcription of this specific gene and the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure. However, more research is necessary to determine whether the formation of G-quadruplex regulates the expression of this gene in a positive or negative manner. The c-kit oncogene deals with a pathway that encodes an RTK, which was shown to have elevated expression levels in certain types of cancer. The rich guanine sequence of this promoter region has shown the ability to form a variety of quadruplexes. Current research on this pathway is focusing on discovering the biological function of this specific quadruplex formation on the c-kit pathway, while this quadruplex sequence has been noticed in various species. The RET oncogene functions in the transcription of kinase which has been abundant in certain types of cancer. The guanine rich sequence in the promoter region for this pathway exudes a necessity for baseline transcription of this receptor tyrosine kinase. In certain types of cancers, the RET protein has shown increased expression levels. The research on this pathway suggested the formation of a G-quadruplex in the promoter region and an applicable target for therapeutic treatments. Another oncogene pathway involving PDGF-A, platelet-derived growth factor, involves the process of wound healing and function as mitogenic growth factors for cells. High levels of expression of PDGF have been associated with increased cell growth and cancer. The presence of a guanine-rich sequence in the promoter region of PDGF-A has exhibited the ability to form intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures and remains suggested to play a role in transcriptional regulation of PDGF-A. However, research has also identified the presence of G-quadruplex structures within this region due to the interaction of TMPyP4 with this promoter sequence.  Therapeutics  Telomeres are generally made up of G-quadruplexes and remain important targets for therapeutic research and discoveries. These complexes have a high affinity for porphyrin rings which makes them effective anticancer agents. However, TMPyP4 has been limited for used due to its non-selectivity toward cancer cell telomeres and normal double stranded DNA (dsDNA). To address this issue analog of TMPyP4, it was synthesized known as 5Me which targets only G quadruplex DNA which inhibits cancer growth more effectively than TMPyP4. Ligand design and development remains an important field of research into therapeutic reagents due to the abundance of G-quadruplexes and their multiple conformational differences. One type of ligand involving a Quindoline derivative, SYUIQ-05, utilizes the stabilization of G-quadruplexes in promoter regions to inhibit the production of both the c-Myc protein product and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). This main pathway of targeting this region results in the lack of telomerase elongation, leading to arrested cell development. Further research remains necessary for the discovery of a single gene target to minimize unwanted reactivity with more efficient antitumor activity.  Ligands which bind quadruplexes  One way of inducing or stabilizing G-quadruplex formation is to introduce a molecule which can bind to the G-quadruplex structure. A number of ligands, which can be both small molecules and proteins, can bind to the G-quadruplex. These ligands can be naturally occurring or synthetic. This has become an increasingly large field of research in genetics, biochemistry, and pharmacology. Cationic porphyrins have been shown to bind intercalatively with G-quadruplexes, as well as the molecule telomestatin. The binding of ligands to G-quadruplexes is vital for anti-cancer pursuits because G-quadruplexes are found typically at translocation hot spots. MM41, a ligand that binds selectively for a quadruplex on the BCL-2 promoter, is shaped with a central core and 4 side chains branching sterically out. The shape of the ligand is vital because it closely matches the quadruplex which has stacked quartets and the loops of nucleic acids holding it together. When bound, MM41's central chromophore is situated on top of the 3‚Äô terminal G-quartet and the side chains of the ligand associate to the loops of the quadruplex. The quartet and the chromophore are bound with a œÄ-œÄ bond while the side chains and loops are not bound but are in close proximity. What makes this binding strong is the fluidity in the position of the loops to better associate with the ligand side chains. TMPyP4, a cationic porphyrin, is a more well known G4 binding ligand that helps to repress c-Myc. The way in which TMPyP4 binds to G4's is similar to MM41, with the ring stacking onto the external G-quartet and side chains associating to the loops of G4's. When designing ligands to be bound to G-quadruplexes, the ligands have a higher affinity for parallel folded G-quadruplexes. It has been found that ligands with smaller side chains bind better to the quadruplex because smaller ligands have more concentrated electron density. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds of ligands with smaller side chains are shorter and therefore stronger. Ligands with mobile side chains, ones that are able to rotate around its center chromophore, associate more strongly to G-quadruplexes because conformation of the G4 loops and the ligand side chains can align.  Quadruplex prediction techniques  Identifying and predicting sequences which have the capacity to form quadruplexes is an important tool in further understanding their role. Generally, a simple pattern match is used for searching for possible intrastrand quadruplex forming sequences: d(G3+N1-7G3+N1-7G3+N1-7G3+), where N is any nucleotide base (including guanine). This rule has been widely used in on-line algorithms. Although the rule effectively identifies sites of G-quadruplex formation, it also identifies a subset of the imperfect homopurine mirror repeats capable of triplex formation and C-strand i-motif formation. Moreover, these sequences also have the capacity to form slipped and foldback structures that are implicit intermediates in the formation of both quadruplex and triplex DNA structures. In one study, it was found that the observed number per base pair (i.e. the frequency) of these motifs has increased rapidly in the eumetazoa for which complete genomic sequences are available. This suggests that the sequences may be under positive selection enabled by the evolution of systems capable of suppressing non-B structure formation.  Methods for studying G-quadruplexes  A number of experimental methods have been developed to support the computational prediction of G-quadruplexes. These methods can be broadly defined into two classes: biophysical and biochemical methods.  Biochemical methods  Biochemical techniques were employed to interrogate G-quadruplex formation in a longer sequence context. In the DNA polymerase stop assay, the formation of a G-quadruplex in a DNA template can act as a roadblock and cause polymerase stalling, which halts the primer extension. The dimethyl sulfate (DMS) followed by the piperidine cleavage assay is based on the fact that the formation of a G-quadruplex will prohibit the N7 guanine methylation caused by DMS, leading to a protection pattern observed at the DNA G-quadruplex region after piperidine cleavage.  Biophysical methods  The topology of the G-quadruplex structure can be determined by monitoring the positive or negative circular dichroism (CD) signals at specific wavelengths. Parallel G-quadruplexes have negative and positive CD signals at 240 and 262 nm, respectively, whereas antiparallel G-quadruplexes place these signals at 262 and 295 nm, respectively. To verify G-quadruplex formation, one should also perform the CD experiments under non-G-quadruplex stabilizing (Li+) and G-quadruplex stabilizing conditions (such as K+ or with G-quadruplex ligands), and scan toward the far-UV region (180‚Äì230 nm). Likewise, the thermostability of the G-quadruplex structure can be identified by observing the UV signal at 295 nm. Upon G-quadruplex melting, the UV absorbance at 295 nm decreases, leading to a hypochromic shift that is a distinctive feature of G-quadruplex structure. Another approach for detection of G-quadruplexes includes nanopore- based methods. Firstly, it was shown that biological nanopores can detect G-quadruplexes based on size exclusion and specific interaction of G-quadruplex and protein nanocavity. The novel approach combines solid-state nanopores and DNA nanotechnology for label-free detection of G-quadruplexes, for their mapping on dsDNA, and for monitoring G-quadruplex formation. Role in neurological disorders G-quadruplexes have been implicated in neurological disorders through two main mechanisms. The first is through expansions of G-repeats within genes that lead to the formation of G-quadruplex structures that directly cause disease, as is the case with the C9orf72 gene and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The second mechanism is through mutations that affect the expression of G-quadruplex binding proteins, as seen in the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1) gene and Fragile X Syndrome. The C9orf72 gene codes for the protein C9orf72 which is found throughout the brain in neuronal cytoplasm and at presynaptic terminals.C9orf72 chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 [Homo sapiens] \\\\- Gene - NCBI Mutations of the C9orf72 gene have been linked to the development of FTD and ALS. These two diseases have a causal relationship to GGGGCC (G4C2) repeats within the 1st intron of C9orf72 gene. Normal individuals typically have around 2 to 8 G4C2 repeats, but individuals with FTD or ALS have from 500 to several thousand G4C2 repeats. The transcribed RNA of these repeats have been shown to form stable G-quadruplexes, with evidence showing that the G4C2 repeats in DNA have the ability to form mixed parallel-antiparallel G-quadruplex structures as well. These RNA transcripts containing G4C2 repeats were shown to bind and separate a wide variety of proteins, including nucleolin. Nucleolin is involved in the synthesis and maturation of ribosomes within the nucleus, and separation of nucleolin by the mutated RNA transcripts impairs nucleolar function and ribosomal RNA synthesis. Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is a widely expressed protein coded by the FMR1 gene that binds to G-quadruplex secondary structures in neurons and is involved in synaptic plasticity. FMRP acts as a negative regulator of translation, and its binding stabilizes G-quadruplex structures in mRNA transcripts, inhibiting ribosome elongation of mRNA in the neuron's dendrite and controlling the timing of the transcript's expression. Mutations of this gene can cause the development of Fragile X Syndrome, autism, and other neurological disorders.\\"Fragile X Mental Retardation\\" The Human Gene Compendium Specifically, Fragile X Syndrome is caused by an increase from 50 to over 200 CGG repeats within exon 13 of the FMR1 gene. This repeat expansion promotes DNA methylation and other epigenetic heterochromatin modifications of FMR1 that prevent the transcription of the gene, leading to pathological low levels of FMRP.  Therapeutic approaches  Antisense-mediated interventions and small-molecule ligands are common strategies used to target neurological diseases linked to G-quadruplex expansion repeats. Therefore, these techniques are especially advantageous for targeting neurological diseases that have a gain-of-function mechanism, which is when the altered gene product has a new function or new expression of a gene; this has been detected in the C9orf72 (chromosome 9 open reading frame 72). Antisense therapy is the process by which synthesized strands of nucleic acids are used to bind directly and specifically to the mRNA produced by a certain gene, which will inactivate it. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are commonly used to target C9orf72 RNA of the G-quadruplex GGGGCC expansion repeat region, which has lowered the toxicity in cellular models of C9orf72. ASOs have previously been used to restore normal phenotypes in other neurological diseases that have gain-of-function mechanisms, the only difference is that it was used in the absence of G-quadruplex expansion repeat regions. Another commonly used technique is the utilization of small-molecule ligands. These can be used to target G-quadruplex regions that cause neurological disorders. Approximately 1,000 various G-quadruplex ligands exist in which they are able to interact via their aromatic rings; this allows the small-molecule ligands to stack on the planar terminal tetrads within the G-quadruplex regions. A disadvantage of using small-molecule ligands as a therapeutic technique is that specificity is difficult to manage due to the variability of G-quadruplexes in their primary sequences, orientation, thermodynamic stability, and nucleic acid strand stoichiometry. As of now, no single small-molecule ligand has been able to be perfectly specific for a single G-quadruplex sequence.Campbell, N.H., Patel, M., et al. (2009). Selective in ligand recognition of G-quadruplex loops. Biochem. 48. 1675-1680.Ohnmacht, S.A., and Neidle, S. (2014). Small-molecule quadruplex targeted drug discovery. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 24. 2602-2612. However, a cationic porphyrin known as TMPyP4 is able to bind to the C9orf72 GGGGCC repeat region, which causes the G-quadruplex repeat region to unfold and lose its interactions with proteins causing it to lose its functionality.Zamiri, B., Reddy, K., et. al. (2014). TMPyP4 porphyrin distorts RNA G-quadruplex structures of the disease associated r(GGGGCC)n repeat of the C9orf72 gene and blocks interactions of RNA-binding proteins. J. Biol. Chem. 289. 4653-4659. Small-molecule ligands, composed primarily of lead, can target GGGGCC repeat regions as well and ultimately decreased both repeat-associated non-ATG translation and RNA foci in neuron cells derived from patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This provides evidence that small- molecule ligands are an effective and efficient process to target GGGGCC regions, and that specificity for small-molecule ligand binding is a feasible goal for the scientific community. Metal complexes have a number of features that make them particularly suitable as G4 DNA binders and therefore as potential drugs. While the metal plays largely a structural role in most G4 binders, there are also examples where it interacts directly with G4s by electrostatic interactions or direct coordination with nucleobases.

Hodgson won the two longer freestyle swimming gold medals at the 1912 Olympics, the only categories in which he competed. He also competed at the 1920 Summer Olympics. Personal life George Hodgson was born in 1893 in Montreal, Quebec. He matriculated at McGill University in 1912, competing in swimming and water polo for the school. While there, he was admitted to the Zeta Psi fraternity, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in applied science in 1916. He was inducted into the Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1955, the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1968, into the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame in 1996, and died in Montreal in 1983. Several members of George Hodgson's extended family were well involved in Canadian sports. His uncles Billy and Archie Hodgson were prominent athletes with the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association in the 1880s and 1890s, playing both ice hockey and lacrosse with the organisation. Archie Hodgson was a member of the first Stanley Cup winning team in 1893, the same year George Hodgson was born. International career George Hodgson, Canada's only Olympic gold medal winner in swimming until 1984, did not stay in competition very long. He won two gold medals at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, with times of 5:24.4s in the 400-metre and 22:00.0s in the 1500-metre freestyle. He had already set a world record of 22:23.0 in the first round of the race. He was eighteen at the time and retired immediately after one of the great races of all time. His unprecedented success was widely attributed to his innovation of the trudgen stroke, a hybrid between the front crawl and sidestroke. It was for the 1500 meter Olympic championship and Hodgson broke world and Olympic records for 1000 yards and meters, and 1 mile in addition to the prescribed 1500 meter race distance. His Olympic record at 400 meters stood until 1924 when Johnny Weissmuller broke it at Amsterdam. He was Canada's lone swimmer in 1912.

It is one of the successors to the Dolby Digital (AC-3) surround sound codec, which is used as the audio standard for the DVD-Video format. In this application, Dolby TrueHD competes with DTS-HD Master Audio, a lossless codec from DTS. Dolby TrueHD uses Meridian Lossless Packing (MLP) as its mathematical basis for compressing audio samples. MLP is also used in the DVD-Audio format, but details of Dolby TrueHD and the MLP Lossless format as used on DVD-Audio differ substantially. A Dolby TrueHD bitstream can carry up to 16 discrete audio channels. Sample depths up to 24 bits/sample and audio sample rates up to 192 kHz are supported. Like the more common legacy codec Dolby Digital, Dolby TrueHD bitstreams carry program metadata. Metadata is separate from the coding format and compressed audio samples, but stores relevant information about the audio waveform and provides control over the decoding process. For example, dialog normalization and dynamic range compression are controlled by metadata embedded in the Dolby TrueHD bitstream. Similarly, a Dolby Atmos encoded Dolby TrueHD stream contains metadata to extract and place the objects in relevant positions. Like all compressed lossless codecs, Dolby TrueHD is a variable bit-rate codec. Blu-ray Disc In the Blu-ray Disc specification, Dolby TrueHD is an optional codec. Dolby TrueHD audiotracks may carry up to 8 discrete audio channels (7.1 surround) and 20 objects of 24-bit audio at 96 kHz or up to 6 channels (5.1 surround) at 192 kHz. The maximum encoded bitrate is 18 Mbit/s. Since Dolby TrueHD is an optional codec, a companion Dolby Digital bitstream (2.0 192 Kb/s or 5.1 448 Kb/s/640 Kb/s) must accompany the Dolby TrueHD bitstream on Blu-ray discs. Blu-ray Disc players consider this combination of two audio bitstreams as a single logical audio track, and a Blu-ray Disc player will automatically select the Dolby Digital or Dolby TrueHD bitstream depending on its decoding and/or bitstreaming capabilities. All Dolby TrueHD-enabled Blu-ray Disc players are capable of decoding the Dolby TrueHD audiotrack to an arbitrary number of channels more suitable for player output. For example, all Dolby TrueHD-capable players can create a 2-channel (stereo-compatible) mix from a 6-channel source audiotrack. The most popular Dolby TrueHD application is as a high definition audio codec for Blu- ray Disc, although early Blu-ray players did not support it. All current Blu- ray players support Dolby TrueHD decoding or bitstreaming. Starting in 2010, Dolby TrueHD steadily lost lossless audio market share to rival DTS-HD Master Audio. Much of that share, however, returned as Dolby Atmos became more common on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray; Atmos is commonly implemented on these discs through a TrueHD bitstream. Transport Audio encoded using Dolby TrueHD may be transported to A/V receivers in one of three ways depending on player and/or receiver support: Thursday, 19 January 2017 *Over 6 or 8 RCA connectors as analog audio, using the player's internal decoder and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). *Over HDMI 1.1 (or higher) connections as 6 or 8-channel Linear PCM, using the player's decoder and the AV receiver's DAC. *Over HDMI 1.3 (or higher) connections as the original Dolby TrueHD bitstream encapsulated in MAT (Metadata-Enhanced Audio Transport) frames, with decoding and DAC both done by the AV receiver.

History The band formed in 1990 as Devourment and began its life as a trio, with Jose on bass and vocals, Luisma on guitar, and Emilio on drums, though this only lasted until the summer of 1991, when Emilio left the band. The group soon reformed, this time as duo, with Luisma again playing the role of guitarist and Jose taking over as drummer, with both performing vocals, and released their first demo as Haemorrhage, Grotesque Embryopathology. Near the end of 1993, Lugubrious and Ramon joined the band as vocalist and bassist, respectively. Between 1994 and 1995, Haemorrhage recorded a seven song promo tape, which was sent to Morbid Records and resulted in a two-album contract, welcomed guitarist Ana, and recorded their first release, Emetic Cult. However, Jose left in the following year due to personal issues and was replaced by Rojas. After releasing five studio albums on Morbid Records the band signed to Relapse Records which put out their albums Hospital Carnage and We are the Gore. Influences and live shows Influences Haemorrhage are, like many goregrind bands, heavily influenced by Carcass, yet still have an identity all their own.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kusel-Altenglan. Altenglan is a recognized tourism community. Also, named after the municipality is the Altenglan Formation, a lithostratigraphic entity, and by extension, so is Altenglanerpeton, a microsaur whose fossil remains were found therein. Geography Location The municipality lies in the uplands in the Western Palatinate on the river Glan, which is the village's namesake, at an elevation in the valley of some 200 m above sea level, although the elevations within municipal limits reach almost 400 m (Bistersberg 387 m on the Glan's left bank; Kalmet 390 m on the Glan's right bank), and on the slopes of the Potzberg within the formerly self-administering municipality of M√ºhlbach almost 500 m. Altenglan lies roughly 5 km northeast of the district seat and nearest town, Kusel, and 25 km northwest of Kaiserslautern. In Altenglan, the Kuselbach and the Reichenbach empty into the Glan. The dale here forms a broad bowl, although the pattern is broken somewhat by the two streams that meet the Glan here, one from each side. Part of the Potzberg massif lies within Altenglan as does part of the long Remigiusberg ridge, although these hills' summits all lie outside the municipality's boundaries. The municipality has an area of 1 362 ha, of which 237 ha is wooded.Location Neighbouring municipalities Altenglan borders in the north on the municipality of Bedesbach, in the northeast on the municipality of Welchweiler, in the east on the municipality of Bosenbach, in the southeast on the municipality of F√∂ckelberg, in the south on the municipalities of Rutsweiler am Glan and Theisbergstegen, in the southwest on the municipality of Rammelsbach, in the west on the town of Kusel and the municipality of Blaubach and in the northwest on the municipality of Erdesbach. Altenglan also meets the municipalities of Elzweiler and Haschbach am Remigiusberg at single points in the east and south respectively. Constituent communities Altenglan's Ortsteile are Altenglan, M√ºhlbach am Glan and Patersbach. Municipality‚Äôs layout The original settlement of Altenglan stretched along the higher parts of the left banks of both the Glan and the Kuselbach, along today's Glanstra√üe from the graveyard with the old church to the T-junction formed by today's Bahnhofstra√üe. This can clearly be seen in a stock book compiled in the mid-18th century. Other settlements on Bahnhofstra√üe had also already arisen by the 18th century. The last house before the bridge was the one that is now the rectory, and across the bridge (known as the Pfarrbr√ºcke ‚Äì ‚ÄúParochial Bridge‚Äù ‚Äì or the Schmiedebr√ºcke ‚Äì ‚ÄúSmithy Bridge‚Äù) stood a smith's workshop. Likewise already standing by the 18th century were houses in the area of today's Ringstra√üe, which the stock book describes as a gemeiner Weg ‚Äì ‚Äúcommon way‚Äù. Thus, a big triangle stretching back from the forks of the Glan and Kuselbach was settled at the time when the original cadastral survey was done in 1848. The settlement began to spread out in the 19th century towards Eckstra√üe and Tr√§nkstra√üe, towards Neuwiesenstra√üe and today's Schulstra√üe. In the early 20th century, houses were built on Kuseler Stra√üe. Altenglan station was built in 1868 along with the railway line between Kusel and Landstuhl. New, bigger residential areas arose after the Second World War west of Bahnhofstra√üe (Bildstock, Am K√∂pfchen, Gartenstra√üe) and to the side of Kuseler Stra√üe (Alte Stra√üe, Am Heiligen Spiegel, An den R√∂dwiesen). A new rectory was built in 1934 on Kuseler Stra√üe, after the old one had been sold. The town hall, in its original form, the then municipality had built after the Second World War. Expansions took place after the founding of the Verbandsgemeinde. Most of the shops, supermarkets, banks and inns stand on the main street along with Austra√üe, and on Glanstra√üe, while the school with its gymnasium and event hall and the Verbandsgemeinde administration building (town hall) stand on Schulstra√üe. Adjoining the school (Gustav-Sch√§ffner-Schule, a Regionale Schule) is a sporting ground. The sport and leisure swimming pool lies east of the village off the main road going towards Bosenbach. The mediaeval church stands in the middle of the graveyard in the village's northeast at the end of Glanstra√üe and across Kuseler Stra√üe. As a very old village, Altenglan has a relatively large municipal area, great swathes of which were opened up to development after the Second World War. The biggest tract of woodland is the Bruderwald, a typical mixed forest once owned by the Remigiusberg Monastery. Besides cropraising and livestock breeding, the municipality also worked at winegrowing to a limited extent in the time before the Second World War.Municipality‚Äôs layout History Antiquity The Altenglan area was settled as early as the last period in the New Stone Age and on into Gallo- Roman times, bearing witness to which are archaeological finds. Since the name Glan is of Celtic origin, it could be that the centre was settled continuously up to the Frankish takeover of the land. From Roman times, too, traces have been preserved, such as a sculpture of a woman, the so-called ‚ÄúVenus of Glan‚Äù, which has since disappeared.Antiquity Middle Ages The name Gleni appears along with the name Cosla (Kusel) in the historical work from the Archbishopric of Reims compiled by the early mediaeval historical writer Flodoard. According to the greater Remigiustestament, which is included in this work, the so-called Remigiusland with Kusel and Altenglan had supposedly already been bequeathed by King Clovis to Saint Remigius as a donation. This forgery was made possibly with the object of reinforcing the claim to Reims holdings in what is today the Western Palatinate through a reference to the famous bishop Remigius. It is highly likely that King Childebert II transferred the Remigiusland with the villages of Cosla and Gleni to Bishop Giles about 590. On these grounds, the municipality celebrated its 1,400-year jubilee in 1989. Altenglan surely exercised an important midpoint function in the Remigiusland. In the time that followed, Altenglan's history corresponded with the Remigiusland‚Äôs. In 1112, the Remigiusland was taken over as a Vogtei by the Counts of Veldenz. In 1444, it passed as a Vogtei to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, which bought the region ‚Äì a Vogtei was only a protective function ‚Äì in 1552. In connection with the Remigiusland, Altenglan was also mentioned in one of Louis the German‚Äôs documents, which was issued in 865, although it is only known today from a 13th-century copy. The name‚Äôs first mention in an original document, one bearing witness to an exchange of holdings by the Bishop of Worms, dates from 992. According to Pr√ºm Abbey‚Äôs directory of holdings, the Pr√ºmer Urbar, this abbey in the Eifel owned near a place called Glan a major holding. It is disputed today whether this meant the village of Altenglan. It is likewise disputed whether a knight named Stra√üenraub lived in Altenglan or indeed in Neuenglan, believed to have been the same place as today‚Äôs Hundheim. Stra√üenraub‚Äôs actual family name, however, was Hettenberg. Since it is known that the noble family Hettenberg had holdings at Altenglan, it is at least possible that Stra√üenraub lived here. The first Schulthei√ü, Dylen (Till), was named in 1388. As well, a 1364 document, in which Count Heinrich I of Veldenz set forth the conditions for the support of his son, also named Heinrich, and his wife Lauretta, Altenglan was mentioned as an Amt seat along with Br√ºcken near Ulmet. It can be assumed that Altenglan had had this administrative function since the founding of the County of Veldenz in the earlier half of the 12th century. In 1410, the two √Ñmter were merged, and the new seat was Pilsbach, a place on the Glan‚Äôs right bank that was later swallowed up by Ulmet. Altenglan thereby lost its central function, which it had likely had since the Early Middle Ages.Middle Ages Modern times Johannes Hoffmann‚Äôs 1588 description of Altenglan may be exaggerated, but it nevertheless gives today‚Äôs reader a little glance at the village‚Äôs original importance. Hoffmann described the village of Alten-Glan as ‚Äúquite an old place‚Äù that had been built, like Trier and some other towns, more by ‚Äúheathens‚Äù than anyone else, and these heathens had apparently built Altenglan into a ‚Äúvery great town‚Äù, girding it each side of the river Glan with ringwalls, so that the river flowed through the middle of the town. Altenglan's first known municipal charter dates from 1567, and was renewed in 1581. At the time of the 1609 ecclesiastical Visitation, there were 37 families in the village. As a result of the Plague, the population shrank greatly even before the Thirty Years' War broke out. According to the Huberweistum, a 1630 Weistum (a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times), there were then only 30 families still living in the village. That same year, Imperial troops plundered Altenglan. As in the whole swathe of countryside around Kusel, especially because of the wartime events of 1635, very few people in Altenglan survived this frightful war, and almost all the houses had been destroyed. For a long time, it was not even worth the trouble of holding church services in the church. Even after the population had built itself back up somewhat through newcomers to the village, there was more war, this time King Louis XIV's wars of conquest. About 1680, Altenglan was said to be ‚Äúburnt‚Äù. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, the population once again rose quickly by both migration to the village and natural growth, and according to the 1742 stock book, there were once more 47 houses in the village. In the time of the French Revolution, French Revolutionary troops plundered Altenglan (1794), but otherwise left it unscathed. The village now belonged to the Department of Sarre, the Arrondissement of Birkenfeld, the Canton of Kusel and the Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Ulmet.Modern times =Recent times= After the formation of the Bavarian Rheinkreis, as the Palatinate was known after the Congress of Vienna awarded it to Bavaria, Altenglan remained in the Canton of Kusel, but now formed the seat of its own B√ºrgermeisterei (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) to which Patersbach also belonged (which is now a constituent community of Altenglan). The original 1845 cadastral survey shows 85 houses. In the time of industrialization, cloth weavers from Kusel began walking their cloth in Altenglan. The Schleip machine factory set up a wire drawing works. Beginning in 1870, the hard-stone quarrying industry expanded. Along with those who earned their livelihood at agriculture, the number of workers at quarries and factories rose steadily. In 1890, a workers‚Äô association was founded. The workforce held fast to its political outlook even after Adolf Hitler‚Äôs 1933 seizure of power, with 15% of the voters locally voting against Hitler at the November 1933 Reichstag elections at a time when voters throughout the Third Reich were voting 99% yes (the ballots offered no alternative to Hitler, the Nazis and their sympathizers). Towards the end of the Second World War, Altenglan had to suffer steady Allied bombings, and villagers were killed. On 9 March 1945, American troops marched in. Post-war times brought a new territorial arrangement and Altenglan was grouped into newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The B√ºrgermeisterei of Altenglan was kept for the time being, within the district of Kusel. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1968, The village of Altenglan became an Ortsteil of a new municipality that likewise bore the name Altenglan, but also included Patersbach and M√ºhlbach besides. The original plan had called for Bedesbach to be part of this municipality, too, but the residents there successfully fought a campaign to keep themselves out of it. At the same time, Altenglan became the seat of a Verbandsgemeinde in 1972 to which all together 16 Ortsgemeinden belong.Recent times Population development In 1609, there were 37 families living in Altenglan and thus, the village had roughly 100 inhabitants. There was a drop in population, however, even before the Thirty Years' War, likely due to the Plague and other epidemics, and there were only 30 families living in Altenglan by 1630. Fewer than ten villagers survived the Thirty Years‚Äô War, but repopulation came with newcomers, although this was interrupted, and perhaps even reversed, by King Louis XIV's wars of conquest. There was an upswing in numbers early in the 18th century. At the time when the 1749 stock book was compiled, some 50 families lived in Altenglan and thereby some 200 inhabitants. In the next one hundred years, the population doubled. By 1835, according to the original cadastral survey (dates for this vary because the survey took a long time to complete), there were some 400 people in Altenglan. The following table shows population development over the centuries for Altenglan, with some figures broken down by religious denomination:Altenglan‚Äôs population development { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"500\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1825  1835  1871  1905  1939  1961  2007 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  455  509  621  979  1,088  1,840  2,948 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  12  176 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  422  1,648 - align=\\"center\\"  Jewish  21  ‚Äì - align=\\"center\\"  Other  ‚Äì  26 } Municipality‚Äôs name The oldest form of the municipality's name, Gleni, appears in the history of the Archbishopric of Reims by the mediaeval historical writer Flodoard, in a forgery of Archbishop Remigius's will no less, likely put together by Archbishop of Reims Hinkmar. This form of the name also crops up in one of Louis the German's documents from 865 or 866. Gleni is a Celtic word for flowing body of water. The name, therefore, refers to the river that flows by the village. The modern form Altenglan leads to the supposition that there must once have been another village elsewhere on the Glan, founded later, with the name Neuenglan (alt and neu are German for ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù respectively), which writer M. Dolch identifies as the village now called Hundheim. Other older forms of the name Altenglan are as follows: Aldenglane (992), Glene (1124), Glana (1138), Glannam (1154), Glayna (1342), Alden Glane (1364), Alttenglahn (1629).Municipality‚Äôs name Religion As early as the Early Middle Ages, it is likely that Altenglan was an ecclesiastical hub for the area between Rammelsbach and Erdesbach. It is, however, unknown when the parish acquired its first church. The Altenglan church had its first documentary mention in 1252, and in 1290 a village priest named Nikolaus was mentioned. Altenglan was also long regarded as the residence of the mediaeval Glan chapter. Only one archpriest of the Glan chapter, though, is known to have had his seat in Altenglan. His name was Jakob von Glayn, who was mentioned in 1365. It is assumed that the designation Glankapitel (‚ÄúGlan chapter‚Äù) referred to the whole Glan region and not to the archpriest's seat in particular. At the time of the introduction of the Reformation in 1537, the militant clergyman Nikolaus Dieburg was in office. He set about defending himself against the change, not only carrying out his ecclesiastical duties but also farming his glebe and taking the vineyards into the church's care. In 1558, the first ecclesiastical Visitation since the Reformation's introduction was undertaken, while others were now undertaken at seven-year intervals thereafter. Because so few people survived the Thirty Years' War, there was no resident clergyman in Altenglan for 111 years, until 1746, and consequently no church services, either. Towards the end of this era, though, the parish had the church renovated, preserving for the time being an old Romanesque steeple. In 1747, at what was then the edge of the village, a rectory was built on the Kuselbach; this is nowadays the Autohaus Lotter ‚Äì a car dealership. In 1805, the Romanesque steeple had to be torn down because it had fallen into such disrepair. It was replaced with the roofed tower that still stands today. In 1860 or 1861, the church got new bells and in 1873, it had an organ for the first time. In 1934, the old rectory was sold and a new one was built on Kuseler Stra√üe. In 1952, the church once again got new bells and in 1962 once again a new organ. Catholic Christians once again settled in Altenglan beginning in the late 17th century, albeit in small numbers. Their religious needs were fulfilled by the Catholic church of the town of Kusel at first, but since about 1954, the church of Rammelsbach has been responsible for that. A small Jewish community was established in the late 18th century. By the time that Hitler's Nazis began persecuting Jews in 1933, however, there were no longer any Jews in Altenglan. There never was a synagogue.Religion The Protestant parish of Altenglan is a merger of two parishes, one Altenglan and the affiliated centres of Bedesbach, Patersbach and Friedelhausen, together with the other, M√ºhlbach am Glan. The greater parish tends a flock of roughly 3,200, with 2,400 in Altenglan and 800 in M√ºhlbach. Politics Municipal council The council is made up of 20 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"300\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  SPD  CDU  BL  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  11  4  5  20 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  11  6  3  20 seats } ‚ÄúBL‚Äù is a voters‚Äô group. Mayor Altenglan's mayor is Frieder Haag, and his deputies are Mareike Zimmer and Harry Schwarz.Altenglan‚Äôs council The two outlying centres each have representation on council through an Ortsvorsteher. For Patersbach, this is Harry Schwarz, and for M√ºhlbach, Michael Dick. Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Tierced in mantle dexter azure Saint Remigius proper vested and mitred argent garnished Or bearing in his dexter hand a book gules garnished of the second and in his sinister hand a bishop's staff of the third, over his dexter shoulder a dove displayed reversed wings inverted proper, sinister argent a lion rampant of the first armed, langued and crowned of the third, in base gules the letter V surmounted by the letter V reversed, both of the third. Alternatively, ‚Äúthe letter V reversed‚Äù might be called ‚Äúthe letter lambda‚Äù. Saint Remigius on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the Bishopric of Reims. A disputed version of the local history from the 9th and 10th century, however, holds that King Clovis I, the Frankish Kingdom's founder, after his 496 victory over the Alamanni, donated the so-called Remigiusland, including Kusel and Altenglan, to Saint Remigius himself, the Bishop of Reims, rather than simply to the abbey that Remigius oversaw. The dove symbolizes Clovis's baptism. The Veldenz lion on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is a reference to the village's former allegiance to the County of Veldenz and later to the Duchy of Zweibr√ºcken. The charge in base stems from the old Ulmet court seal, which was also once used to seal documents from Altenglan. However, another source identifies the charge as the letters A and V (although the crossbar seems to be missing from the A), supposedly standing for ‚ÄúAltenglan‚Äù and the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde.More about Altenglan‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district =Altenglan (main centre)= * Kuseler Stra√üe 2 ‚Äì Protestant parish church; Baroque aisleless church with hipped roof, marked 1720, essentially older, ridge turret 1806; Romanesque sculpture fragment; thorough renovation 1956, architect Hans-Georg Fiebiger, Kaiserslautern; at the graveyard: warriors‚Äô memorial 1914-1918, dying warriors, 1927 by A.

Today, agriculture plays only a subordinate role. Industrial operations arose as early as the time after the Thirty Years' War, when chalk deposits within the municipal area were worked. This was, however, given up after the Second World War. In 1835, the Altenglan mill was taken over by clothmakers from Kusel, who built it into a walking mill. The wire-drawing mill, too, was established by entrepreneurs from Kusel. The wireworks is now out of business, and the building itself has since been torn down. In 1872, the municipality reached an agreement with the railway for the use of the quarry to mine ballast and crushed stone in Altenglan for railway and road building. Beginning in 1952, industries located in Altenglan, among them Mainmetall and a concrete works.Economic structure Established businesses The biggest industrial concern in Altenglan is the firm Main Metall, which has a foundry in Altenglan that manufactures alloys of outstanding quality that are further processed for building machines, special vehicle axles, for instance. Two big food markets, several other shops and inns, an optician‚Äôs shop, a pharmacy, five physicians‚Äô practices, several workshops, carpentry shops, a varnisher and a scrapyard are all located in Altenglan. Currently, the commercial-industrial park named ‚ÄúIm Br√ºhl‚Äù is being opened up, and the fire brigade has already located there. The location's favourability towards transport is one reason why the park has been steadily developing. Among others, a carpentry business and a metal construction business have opened for business there. Transport Because two major brooks empty into the Glan here, Altenglan has always been a transport hub, lying as it does in or near several valleys. In Altenglan, Bundesstra√üe 423 ends at Bundesstra√üe 420, along which the Kusel interchange on Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier) can be reached ten kilometres to the southwest. Bundesstra√üe 420 itself leaves the Glan valley here and leads to Kusel and Neunkirchen in the Saarland. Bundesstra√üe 423 leads through the middle Glan valley by way of Homburg and Zweibr√ºcken to the French border near Sarreguemines. Another road leads through the Reichenbach valley to Kaiserslautern. Serving nearby Altenglan is Altenglan station on the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway. There are hourly trains at this station throughout the day, namely Regionalbahn service RB 67 between Kaiserslautern and Kusel, named Glantalbahn after a former railway line that shared a stretch of its tracks with the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway.Transport Verbandsgemeinde institutions Available among Verbandsgemeinde institutions are a Regionale Schule, a heated swimming pool for sport and leisure,Sport- und Freizeitbad Altenglan (retrieved 19 May 2011) the Verbandsgemeinde administration and public works and the fire brigade. Education The first efforts on the municipality's part to set up a school were undertaken even before the Thirty Years' War. These efforts, though, were forever foundering for lack of any rooms designed for school classes and, perhaps worse, for lack of anybody who could work as a teacher. Only in 1694 ‚Äì several decades after the Thirty Years' War ‚Äì did schooling at last begin in Altenglan, although an actual schoolhouse was not dedicated until 1740. It stood at the end of the village, just outside the graveyard. While surrounding villages had only winter schools (schools geared towards agricultural communities‚Äô practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare), Altenglan's school had year-round classes, and so children from those outlying villages came to school in Altenglan in the warmer months. In the course of the 19th century, the school acquired a third class. On the site of the old schoolhouse, a new, bigger building arose in 1828. Only after the Second World War, however, could a fourth class be added. Beginning in 1962, children from several neighbouring villages once again attended classes in Altenglan when attempts to set up a central school had been carried to fruition. The 1969 school reform split Grundschule (primary school) and Hauptschule. All children from Hauptschulen in the Verbandsgemeinde were gathered together in the 18 classes at the new school building. A central primary school came into being at Rammelsbach. The Altenglan Hauptschule introduced the 10th school year early and today has the status of a Regionale Schule. As for adult education, Altenglan has a location of the Kreisvolkshochschule Kusel.Education There are also two kindergartens in Altenglan, the Protestantische Kindergarten in Altenglan and the municipal kindergarten in M√ºhlbach. Firefighting Located in Altenglan is the Verbandsgemeinde firefighting base. Altenglan's volunteer fire brigade has existed since 1880 and thus celebrated its 125th anniversary in September 2005. The youth fire brigade has existed since 1980 and hence celebrated its 25th anniversary in the same year. From here, all deployments, even ones handled by other local brigades, are backed up by the deployment centre at the Altenglan fire station. Each year, the Altenglan fire brigade handles more than 100 deployments. The number of firefighters, however, is shrinking steadily, as it is in other Verbandsgemeinden, leading thus far to the closure of three local fire stations in the Verbandsgemeinde of Altenglan.

It originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim on January 15, 2006. The episode's name was taken from The Lord of the Rings volume The Return of the King. It won a Peabody Award in 2006.66th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2007. Plot The episode begins with two epigraphs: Huey Freeman narrates an alternate version of history in which Martin Luther King, Jr. survived his assassination attempt on April 4, 1968, but fell into a 32-year coma. Awakening in October 2000, he experiences a resurgence of popularity and signs a deal to write his autobiography, but is unable to vote in the year's presidential election. A biopic based on King's life is released shortly after the September 11 attacks, and it fails at the box office as a result. During an appearance on Politically Incorrect, King states that the teachings of his Christian faith require him to \\"turn the other cheek,\\" even with respect to enemies such as Al-Qaeda. His commentary draws severe scorn from major news outlets and the White House, and his popularity plummets. During a book signing in Woodcrest attended by no one, Huey and Robert Freeman meet King. Robert had participated in the Montgomery bus boycott, but has harbored a long-standing grudge against Rosa Parks because she received all the attention for refusing to give up her seat. Huey and Robert offer to let King stay with them while he is in town. Following an uneasy family dinner with King, Tom DuBois, and Uncle Ruckus as guests, Huey and King watch television together and King bemoans the state of black popular culture. Huey tells him that the deterioration occurred because the culture was waiting for King or another strong leader to emerge. The next day, Huey persuades King to try and reach out to the public again, this time by starting a political party. King tries to explain its principles on a talk show, only to be repeatedly cut off by the host until Huey throws a chair at him. Huey and King next decide to spread the word by going door to door, but King hires an event promotions firm to publicize a planning meeting for the party without telling Huey. The meeting becomes a raucous event, filled with dozens of young black attendees and performers behaving as though they are at a nightclub. Shocked and disgusted by the crowd's poor behavior, King launches into a furious tirade that stuns them into silence. He sharply castigates them for falling victim to the worst stereotypes about their race after the Civil Rights Movement did so much to give them the opportunity to better themselves, and ends by announcing his plans to relocate to Canada. King thanks Huey for trying to help, tells him to do all he can, and leaves. It is the last time that Huey sees him alive. Word of King's speech begins to spread, sparking a national uprising among black citizens that profoundly affects their culture. The front page of a November 2020 newspaper shows that King has died in Vancouver, British Columbia at the age of 91, and that Oprah Winfrey has just been elected President of the United States. Huey's final comment is \\"It's fun to dream,\\" indicating that the entire episode has been his imagining of how history might have unfolded if King had not died in 1968. Controversy \\"Return of the King\\" was the most controversial episode of The Boondocks's first season. The episode received criticism from Al Sharpton for depicting Martin Luther King Jr. using the term \\"nigga.\\" He demanded an apology from Aaron McGruder and Cartoon Network, stating \\"Cartoon Network must apologize and also commit to pulling episodes that desecrate black historic figures. We are totally offended by the continuous use of the n-word in McGruder's show.\\" Cartoon Network replied by releasing a statement saying, \\"We think Aaron McGruder came up with a thought- provoking way of not only showing Dr. King's bravery but also of reminding us of what he stood and fought for, and why even today, it is important for all of us to remember that and to continue to take action.\\" McGruder himself responded to Sharpton's criticism in The Boondocks comic strip, by having the characters ridicule the activist's choice to attack a cartoon over other, more relevant issues. The characters in the strip never specify the cartoon to which they're alluding. The incident was also referenced on the show, in the episode \\"The Block is Hot.\\" While Huey listens to an internet radio station, the broadcaster mentions that Al Sharpton: \\"Folks, this heat will not let up, it is hot! Speaking about hot, Al Sharpton is hot right now. Havin' a big ole protest. Seems his anger again has something to do with... I think it's a cartoon this time...\\"  References  Category:The Boondocks (TV series) episodes Category:Peabody Award-winning broadcasts Category:Cultural depictions of Martin Luther King Jr. Category:2006 American television episodes Category:2006 controversies in the United States Category:2020 United States presidential election in popular culture ","title":"Return of the King (The Boondocks)"},{"id":"4238754","text":"Marr is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

Geography Location The municipality lies in a hollow in the Glan valley in the uplands in the Western Palatinate, with peaks such as the Galgenberg, the Klopfberg, the Eckertsberg and the Wingertsberg. On the Glan‚Äôs right bank, at the foot of the Hochwald (‚ÄúHigh Forest‚Äù) lies the outlying centre of Bettenhausen. The bottom of the dale has an elevation of 215 m above sea level. The highest elevation within municipal limits lies in the Eichenwald (‚ÄúOak Forest‚Äù) at 388 m above sea level. Glan-M√ºnchweiler lies roughly 8 km southeast of Kusel and 25 km west of Kaiserslautern. The municipal area measures 464 ha, of which 112 ha is wooded.Location Neighbouring municipalities Glan-M√ºnchweiler borders in the north on the municipality of Rehweiler, in the east on the municipality of Niedermohr, in the south on the municipality of Nanzdietschweiler, in the southwest on the municipality of B√∂rsborn, in the west on the municipality of Henschtal and in the northwest on the municipality of Quirnbach. Constituent communities Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs Ortsteile are Glan-M√ºnchweiler (main centre) and Bettenhausen.Constituent communities Municipality‚Äôs layout On the terrace that juts out from the western slope into the Glan valley, monks from the Hornbach Monastery established an estate in the 8th century for clearing and farming the surrounding countryside. The village core that arose here with its estate and church was fortified on the downstream side in 1344, as witnessed by ‚Äúcivic building‚Äù. After the Thirty Years' War, Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs built-up area spread westwards towards what is today Marktstra√üe (‚ÄúMarket Street‚Äù). Ringstra√üe and Hauptstra√üe (‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù) soon formed a residential quadrangle through which ran only one street from the village core, Kirchstra√üe (‚ÄúChurch Street‚Äù). With the opening of the building zone in the cadastral area known as ‚ÄúTeich‚Äù (‚ÄúPond‚Äù), the built-up area began to spread northwards in 1953 towards the slopes of the Fronberg and Galgenberg, stopping only at the ridge in many places. With the graveyard‚Äôs expansion in 1970, even Friedhofstra√üe (‚ÄúGraveyard Street‚Äù) and the area below were opened up. The Autobahn, also finished in 1970, touches Glan-M√ºnchweiler just at the southwest, tightly hemming the village‚Äôs development in. Only the sporting ground with its two football pitches and athletic complex could be laid out to the highway‚Äôs west. The supply road built for the Autobahn‚Äôs construction was developed after the Second World War and is now called Embachstra√üe. The forester‚Äôs house built in 1914 on the road leading out of Glan-M√ºnchweiler towards Quirnbach served after the war as a kindergarten owned by the Catholic Church, although it is now under private ownership. At the turn of the millennium, Glan-M√ºnchweiler had 27 streets and 358 houses.Municipality‚Äôs layout History Antiquity The village‚Äôs beginnings and first settlers lie in the time before the Christian Era. Archaeological finds of stone hatchets within Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs limits bear witness to settlers in the New Stone Age. The barrow fields in the Eicherwald give clues as to a certain continuity in settlement in the Iron Age. Glan-M√ºnchweiler lies at the crossroads of some old roads. Many finds from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD show that the place was settled in Roman times. A trove of coins unearthed in 1976 in what is now the village core, along with further clues, point to a fire in 351 or 352.Antiquity Middle Ages After the Frankish takeover of the land, the Glan-M√ºnchweiler area passed in about the middle of the 8th century through donation into Hornbach Abbey‚Äôs ownership. About this time, the Hornbach monks established an estate (after which the municipality is named; see Municipality‚Äôs name below) for clearing and farming the land, and also built a church, some remnants of which were found in today‚Äôs church‚Äôs foundations. The Hornbach Monastery pledged the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù (dale) in the time that followed to the Raugraves of Neuenbaumburg and Altenbaumburg. Thus, secular lords became the fiefholders in this area. In 1383, the fief passed to the Lords of Breitenborn, and shortly thereafter to the Burgmann family of Mauchenheim. Sir Georg von der Leyen wed Eva Mauchenheimer in 1468, thus beginning the long lordship of the Counts of Leyen in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù, which lasted until 1801. Glan-M√ºnchweiler acquired the status of Unteramt together with the villages of Steinbach, Haschbach, Nanzweiler, Dietschweiler, B√∂rsborn and Gries. The seat of the Oberamt was Blieskastel. The highest lord in the land remained, however, the Duke of Palatinate- Zweibr√ºcken, who exercised the blanket lordship over the Hornbach Monastery. Over the centuries, this led to disputes over questions of authority. There were usually two Schulthei√üen, one appointed by the Counts of Leyen and the other by the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The first Schulthei√ü appointed by the Counts of Leyen in 1490 was named Andreas Stemmler, while the first one appointed by the Duchy was named Johann Jakob R√∂hrich.Middle AgesGlan- M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs history Modern times The ecclesiastical, legal and social convulsions in the time of the Reformation brought new antagonisms and disputes into the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù. The Dukes of Zweibr√ºcken, as rightful successors to the Hornbach Monastery, were Reformed, whereas the Counts of Leyen had chosen to remain Catholic. Administration and use of landholds were forever a cause of disagreement and feuding. During the Thirty Years' War, Glan-M√ºnchweiler was largely destroyed and plundered by Croatian mercenaries. In 1621, Glan-M√ºnchweiler was stricken with a frightful outbreak of the Plague, which claimed most of the lives in the village. Indeed, two villages in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù ‚Äì Reichertsweiler and Fr√∂schweiler ‚Äì died right out in the epidemic.Modern timesGlan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs history =Recent times= The French Revolution brought the hitherto prevailing lordship arrangements to an end. Imperial Countess Marianne von der Leyen, during her flight before the French Revolutionary troops, sought shelter for a week at the Evangelical rectory. The County of Leyen was dissolved in 1801; likewise liquidated was the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The Palatinate was now French. M√ºnchweiler became the seat of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), belonging to which were also the villages of Steinbach, Haschbach, Nanzweiler and Dietschweiler. The village now lay in the Canton of Waldmohr, the Arrondissement of Saarbr√ºcken and the Department of Sarre. After the Palatinate‚Äôs cession to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816, Glan-M√ºnchweiler was administered by the Landcommissariat of Homburg. In 1920, after the First World War, the Saar passed to France. The Canton of Waldmohr, which belonged to the Bezirksamt of Homburg, and along with it the B√ºrgermeisterei (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Glan-M√ºnchweiler, was grouped into the Kusel district. In preparation for the Battle of France in the Second World War, the Organisation Todt built a F√ºhrer Headquarters in Glan- M√ºnchweiler, called ‚ÄúWaldwiese‚Äù (‚ÄúGlade‚Äù). It was, however, never used as such. Since then, the complex has been completely dismantled. Considerable changes arose from the 1969-1972 administrative restructuring in Rhineland- Palatinate. On 7 June 1969, the hitherto self-administering municipality of Bettenhausen was split away from the Kaiserslautern district, grouped into the Kusel district and merged with Glan-M√ºnchweiler to form the new municipality of Glan-M√ºnchweiler, which itself became the seat of a newly created Verbandsgemeinde in 1972, to which also belong B√∂rsborn, Herschweiler- Pettersheim, H√ºffler, Wahnwegen, Krottelbach, Langenbach, Quirnbach, Henschtal, Steinbach am Glan, Nanzdietschweiler, Rehweiler and Matzenbach.Recent times Glan-M√ºnchweiler retains this form to this day.Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz ‚Äì Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006 , Seiten 162, 177 (PDF) Population development Of the just under 300 inhabitants in Glan-M√ºnchweiler in 1610, only six ‚Äúsubjects/families‚Äù were left when the Thirty Years' War ended. In 1725 it was reported that there were shoemakers, shopkeepers, weavers and nailers who had joined together in guilds. By introducing cotton spinning as a cottage industry, opportunities to earn income were improved. Approval for trial digging for coal and other minerals was first granted in 1764. Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs population figures rose in the 18th and 19th centuries, but only slowly. Quicker growth came only after the First World War.

According to Hans Weber, writing at regionalgeschichte.net, Glan-M√ºnchweiler had its first documentary mention in 1333 as Monichwilari, derived from the Latin Monachorum Villa (‚Äúthe monks‚Äô estate‚Äù). Other names that the village has had over the ages are Monchwilre (1415), Monchwiller (1564), M√ºnchweiler am Glan (1730), Glan-M√ºnchweiler (as of 1885).Municipality‚Äôs name Nevertheless, according to the Verbandsgemeinde website and authors Wilhelm Volkert and Richard Bauer, Glan-M√ºnchweiler had its first documentary mention as M√∂nchweiler in 1019. M√∂nch is still the German word for ‚Äúmonk‚Äù today (this is a reference to the monks‚Äô estate); Weiler means ‚Äúhamlet‚Äù, or originally ‚Äúhomestead‚Äù. In 1330, the slightly different spelling of M√ºnchweiler was used, and then in 1867, the village was known as M√ºnchweiler am Glan.Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs history Finally, in 1885, the village settled on the name Glan-M√ºnchweiler, which it still bears today.Wilhelm Volkert, Richard Bauer: \\"Handbuch der bayerischen √Ñmter, Gemeinden und Gerichte 1799-1980\\", S. 487 The sources at least agree that Bettenhausen had its first documentary mention in 1393 but they differ as to whether the original name was Bottenhusen (Weber) or Bottenhausen (Volkert et al.). Weber furthermore puts forth the notion that the village was likely named after a man named Botto; so the name Bettenhausen would mean ‚Äúat Botto‚Äôs house‚Äù. The name of the river Glan is of Celtic origin and means ‚Äúfishing water‚Äù or ‚Äúclean water‚Äù. Religion About 820, some monks took over the Frankish estate that had been here and built the first, Romanesque chapel, which was consecrated to Saint Pirmin, for it had been he who had founded their monastery at Hornbach. In the early 13th century, the great Gothic church arose, whose quire and vestry still exist today. Its lovely windows and graceful vault ribs make it a jewel among churches. In 1771, the church‚Äôs nave was renovated, leading to the discovery of three Vierg√∂ttersteine that had been used as part of the foundation (a Vierg√∂tterstein is a sculpted stone of monumental size designed to support a Jupiter Column; its German name means ‚Äúfour-god stone‚Äù in reference to the godly images carved into each of its four sides). They, of course, point to a Roman origin for Glan-M√ºnchweiler. Further renovations to the church were undertaken in 1853-1854 and 1958. Until the Reformation, Glan-M√ºnchweiler and its parish lay under the Hornbach Monastery‚Äôs overlordship. The abbot had patronage rights at the church. It was he who named and paid the priest and he gathered tithes from each family, as was customary. After the Reformation, the Hornbach Monastery was dissolved. The Dukes of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken had been the ones who had introduced the Reformation. The first Lutheran pastor is known to have been in the village as of 1555. A rectory was built in 1599. In 1737, this was torn down and a new one was built on the same spot. This still stands today and is still the Protestant rectory. Along with the Haus Lehn√©, it is one of Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs oldest buildings. There is one thing that characterizes the local ecclesiastical history in a somewhat unusual way. It arose from the longstanding dispute over who had authority in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù, with both the Duke of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and the Counts of Leyen vying for supremacy. It turned into a struggle between Protestants and Catholics over who held the post of parish priest (or pastor, as the case may be) and who got to use church property and income. In 1684, the Catholics were granted the right to share the church. During the upheavals arising from French King Louis XIV‚Äôs Politique des R√©unions, a further improvement in the Catholics‚Äô favour arrived on the scene. A 1786 agreement awarded the Protestants two thirds and the Catholics one third of the church‚Äôs property. With this compromise, the two denominations for the most part lived together in peace. The simultaneum at the church lasted until 1902. The Catholic community then built its own church and received from the Protestants an indemnity of 8,000 marks.Religion Politics Municipal council The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"300\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  SPD  CDU  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  7  9  16 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  7  9  16 seats } Mayor Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs mayor is Fred M√ºller (CDU). Coat of arms Bettenhausen‚Äôs old coat of arms The municipality‚Äôs arms might be described thus: Gules in base an inescutcheon azure a pale argent, issuant from behind which Saint Pirmin of the third vested, mitred and crined Or holding in his dexter hand a book of the field and in his sinister hand an abbot‚Äôs staff, the crook to sinister, of the fourth. The human charge in the arms, Saint Pirmin, is a reference to the village‚Äôs founding by monks from the Hornbach Monastery, which Pirmin founded. The inescutcheon azure a pale argent (that is, blue with a vertical silver stripe) is a reference to the village‚Äôs former allegiance to the House of Leyen, whose counts held the fief in Glan-M√ºnchweiler from 1486 to 1794, and who bore such arms. In its current form, the arms match a court seal from 1564. Bettenhausen, too, once bore its own arms, for it was once a self-administering municipality. Its arms might be described thus: Per fess argent a demilion azure armed and langued Or and azure a pale of the first. The lion is a reference to the village‚Äôs former allegiance to the County of Veldenz, the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and Electoral Palatinate. The lower half of the arms is the old Leyen arms.Description and explanation of Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs and Bettenhausen‚Äôs arms Culture and sightseeing Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland- Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district =Glan-M√ºnchweiler (main centre)= * Saint Pirmin‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Pirminus), Ringstra√üe 29 ‚Äì two-naved Romanesque Revival sandstone block building, belltower, 1900‚Äì1902, architect Wilhelm Schulte I * Hauptstra√üe 16 ‚Äì Protestant parish church; mediaeval rectangular quire, flanking quire tower, vestry addition in the 15th century, Baroque aisleless church, 1771 while maintaining surrounding walls, architect Philipp Heinrich Hellermann, Zweibr√ºcken; Stumm organ from 1865; Roman spolia and sarcophagi * Beethovenstra√üe 4 ‚Äì Protestant rectory; Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street) with half-hipped roof, marked 1737, commercial wing 1777 * Hauptstra√üe 2 ‚Äì mill on the Glan; stately building with half-hipped roof, 1812, architect Peter Bell, Kusel; joining wing with waterwheels, part of the old mill building, 1938, later given extra floor and expanded * At Hauptstra√üe 13 ‚Äì sandstone gateway arch, marked 1754 * Hauptstra√üe 21 ‚Äì so-called Alte Apotheke (‚ÄúOld Apothecary‚Äù); house, sandstone- framed plastered building, 1862 * Ringstra√üe 42 ‚Äì former forestry office building; villalike building with hipped roof, one-floor side wing and staircase, marked 1914, architect Bruno Seyfarth, Kaiserslautern; characterizes village‚Äôs appearance * Schulstra√üe 1 ‚Äì former school; cube with teaching-room wing and one-floor entrance and lavatory building, pitched roofs, Bauhaus style, 1932, architect Bruno Seyfarth, Kaiserslautern; characterizes village‚Äôs appearance =Bettenhausen= * Bettenhausen 31 ‚Äì R√ºb estate complex; corner complex, essentially from the 18th century, expansion into three-sided estate in the 19th century; house with wooden gallery and half-hipped roof, marked 1751, two commercial wings, 1882/1886, shed, servants‚Äô house; characterizes village‚Äôs appearance * Bettenhausen 33 ‚Äì stately Quereinhaus, 1835; together with R√ºb estate complex characterizes village‚Äôs appearance Regular events The traditional kermis (church consecration festival) is held on the second weekend in July.

Foremost among these would be the ‚ÄúLiederkranz‚Äù singing club, founded in 1876, and the gymnastic and sport club from 1922, each with its various departments and many activities. As a pastime, nine-pin bowling has long been popular; the oldest of the many clubs has existed since 1910. In the field of culture, events staged by the folk high school at the Glantalschule (school) can be named. Moreover, the Verbandsgemeinde organizes its own concerts under the name ‚ÄúKultur live‚Äù. The churches and the ecclesiastical clubs also enrich the offerings of events. The bank branches in Glan-M√ºnchweiler also offer many exhibitions.Clubs Economy and infrastructure Economic structure In the small territory held by the Counts of Leyen, the most important economic endeavour was until the early 19th century agriculture. Since the Middle Ages, though, there had been other occupations in Glan-M√ºnchweiler having to do with administration, transport and trade. In the original 1845 cadastral survey, 36 farming businesses and 45 people who ran other kinds of businesses were listed. Improvements to economic circumstances and the building of the railway in 1868 brought along with them a measure of upward mobility among the villagers. There was a great expansion in trades, among them dealers in livestock, fruit, fertilizer, agricultural machinery, fat and coal as well as brewers and tanners. The Volksbank was founded in 1875, and the Raiffeisenbank in 1891. The only major firm in Glan- M√ºnchweiler is Gebr√ºder Hanz (‚ÄúGebr√ºder‚Äù = ‚ÄúBrothers‚Äù), which is in the construction business (road and underground construction), and was founded in 1940. The most important commuting destinations are Kaiserslautern and Homburg.Economic structure Education The first schools in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù were established after the Reformation. The pastor was also the schoolteacher, holding classes at either the church or the rectory. The schoolteachers and schoolmasters are known from records beginning in 1580. They were paid very meanly from church coffers for their teaching at winter school (a school geared towards an agricultural community‚Äôs practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare) from early November to late February. They were craftsmen, mainly coopers, tailors or blacksmiths. The teacher‚Äôs workshop or some other wanting room would be where classes were held. Considerable improvements to schooling conditions were wrought by the 1710 building of the Protestant parish schoolhouse. By 1772, this had grown far too small and was torn down, only to be replaced with a new, bigger one. At this time, Glan-M√ºnchweiler had 60 Evangelical and 30 Catholic schoolchildren. The earliest Catholic school is attested from 1686. Particularly worthy of mention in Glan-M√ºnchweiler‚Äôs paedagogical life is that two related ‚Äúteacher families‚Äù characterized teaching at the Evangelical school in an uninterrupted sequence of schoolteachers spanning two hundred years, the families B√∂rstler and Kiefer. The new political order in 1818 (the Palatinate had recently been awarded to the Kingdom of Bavaria by the Congress of Vienna) brought schooling decisive changes. School became compulsory and year-round. In 1831, a new Evangelical schoolhouse was built, and so was a Catholic one. Both are still standing, on what is now Beethovenstra√üe, but both are now private houses. Both were used as schools, though, for 100 years, until the new shared school building was completed in 1932. For the disparate village schools in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù, the eventual building of a combination primary school-Hauptschule in 1975 on the Galgenberg was an important advance. Beginning in the 2000-2001 school year, the Hauptschule was run as part of the Regionalschule, thereby offering all students a nearby opportunity for education. The district folk high school and the district music school maintain branch locations in Glan-M√ºnchweiler. The Evangelical parish sponsors a three-class kindergarten. A new building is being planned.Education Transport Glan-M√ºnchweiler railway station Serving Glan-M√ºnchweiler is Glan-M√ºnchweiler station on the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway. There are hourly trains at this station throughout the day, namely Regionalbahn service RB 67 between Kaiserslautern and Kusel, named Glantalbahn after a former railway line that shared a stretch of its tracks with the Landstuhl‚ÄìKusel railway, including the former junction at Glan-M√ºnchweiler. It also lies on the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier); the interchange is also called Glan-M√ºnchweiler. In the area where Glan-M√ºnchweiler today lies, two long-distance roads crossed each other even as far back as Roman times. The building of the railway line between Landstuhl and Kusel in 1868 and of the one between Glan-M√ºnchweiler and Homburg contributed considerably to improvements in transport links. Meeting here are Bundesstra√üe 423 from Homburg to Altenglan and two highways to Miesau and Landstuhl. The connection to the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier) right near the village in 1970 was a further upgrade towards being a transport hub. Nevertheless, the Autobahn and other highways, the railway and the river Glan have served as dividers and limits, greatly thwarting the village‚Äôs expansion, but there is now, given the favourable location with regard to transport and the high quality of living, a long and growing demand for building land.Transport Famous people Sons and daughters of the town * Johann Christian Boerstler (b. 1752 in Glan- M√ºnchweiler; d. about 1820 in Maryland) ::Boerstler was one of the best known personalities from the families Kiefer and Boerstler, who were related by marriage, and who for almost 200 years worked as teachers in the ‚ÄúM√ºnchweiler Tal‚Äù. Besides his profession, Boerstler busied himself with naturopathy. He was freedom-loving and criticized exploitation by the authorities. In 1784, he emigrated to the United States and there successfully worked as ‚ÄúDr. Boersteler‚Äù. Parts of his journals have been published.Johann Christian Boerstler * Armin Reichel (b. 31 January 1958 in Glan-M√ºnchweiler) ::A footballer. * Johann Ludwig Daniel Weber (b. 1775 in Glan-M√ºnchweiler; d. 20 August 1854 in Glan-M√ºnchweiler) ::Weber was a mill owner and the mayor of Glan-M√ºnchweiler. During the French Revolutionary troops‚Äô occupation, the Bannm√ºhle (mill) was transferred into his ownership. He furthered trade and the ideas of freedom in Glan-M√ºnchweiler. The number of businesses rose sharply. Successors of the Weber clan from Glan-M√ºnchweiler are today the owners of the Karlsberg brewery in Homburg (branded as Karlsbr√§u outside Germany to avoid confusion with the Danish brewer Carlsberg).Johann Ludwig Daniel Weber Famous people associated with the municipality * Otto Feick (b. 1880 in Reichweiler; d. 1959 in Sch√∂nau an der Brend) ::Feick was the inventor of the Rh√∂nrad and grew up in Glan-M√ºnchweiler. Owing to his passive resistance to the Occupation of the Rhineland, the French removed him from the Palatinate. Up to 1925, he was developing the said gymnastic device, which he called the ‚ÄúRh√∂nrad‚Äù after his new home, the Rh√∂n Mountains (Rad means ‚Äúwheel‚Äù). By exhibiting it at the 1936 Summer Olympics, Feick made the Rh√∂nrad world-famous. Wheel gymnastics is a sport now pursued in many countries.Otto Feick In Feick‚Äôs honour, the municipality has placed a Rh√∂nrad as a monument in the middle of the roundabout on Bundesstra√üe 423 in the outlying centre of Bettenhausen. * Paul N√§gle (b. 1907 in Wiesbaden; d. 1967 in Glan-M√ºnchweiler) ::N√§gle worked as a pastor in M√ºnsterappel and from 1950 to 1967 in Glan- M√ºnchweiler.

In 2004, he released the third Chroma Key album, Graveyard Mountain Home, and wrote the soundtrack (released as Ghost Book) to the Turkish horror film Okul. Matheos and Moore both had holes in their schedules, so decided to work on a second OSI album. The writing and recording process were largely the same as that for the first OSI album. Matheos would send Moore guitar, keyboard and programming parts; Moore would then \\"chop them up and stuff\\". Matheos considers the writing process for OSI as more collaborative than writing for his other band, Fates Warning: \\"With Fates I write songs and we don‚Äôt really change a whole lot from my final version to the version that goes on the record,\\" he said. \\"With Kevin it's much more collaborative in that I come up with a song idea and it can change completely from my original idea to the final product on the record.\\" Matheos originally intended the first OSI album as a \\"project\\" which would never produce a second album. For Free, Matheos and Moore wanted to use a different musician lineup to focus OSI on primarily being Matheos and Moore. They did not want to give the impression that the guests on the first album were part of the band. Matheos stated that the music on Free was \\"focused less on the progressive elements or the metal elements that were on the first record. We thought we could do something just a little more groove oriented.\\" Matheos and Moore had both worked with bassist Joey Vera in the past and considered him \\"perfect\\" for the album. Moore was pleased with Vera's bass parts: Vera sent them to Moore in a state such that they required very little editing or enhancement for the final mix of the album. Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy was listed as a full member of OSI on the first album, but found working on the first album to be a difficult experience. Moore noted that Portnoy \\"wasn't used to having other people have strong ideas about what the drum parts should be\\". For Free, Portnoy contributed drum tracks as a session musician, agreeing to \\"take [Matheos and Moore's] ideas and do the best he could with playing\\", according to Moore. Portnoy's drum parts were recorded at Carriage House Studios in Stamford, Connecticut from November 18 to November 20, 2005. Composition Moore stated that he and Matheos had an idea of what style of music to write for Free as they \\"both have similar feelings about what worked on the first album\\". He considered the album as \\"more focused\\" than its predecessor. He noted that Free continued \\"the mood of some of the songs of the first album and the melodies and mixing up some of the heavy stuff with the programming. As opposed to the instrumental, straight ahead, progressive stuff we did\\". He attributed the band's sound to the \\"very different\\" ideas he and Matheos' had. Moore described the lyrics on the album as \\"just whatever is going on in my head... I try to development from a stream of consciousness to something that makes sense\\". He said the lyrics primarily spoke of relationships, \\"our way of trying to keep them, the resulting problems and that kind of thing\\". Moore cited Roger Waters and Peter Gabriel as influences on his vocal style, \\"Those guys don‚Äôt have the best voices either, but they pull it off then I figured I could do it too,\\" he said. He noted that musically his progressive influences \\"will always be there\\" because they influenced all his music, but could not name any other influences as \\"[he listens] to so much stuff it just gets lost\\". Moore doubletracked his vocals, but apart from occasional use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers the sound of a detuned guitar: \\"To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings,\\" he said. \\"It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [a] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a pain in the ass, but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string.\\" The bonus track OSIdea 9 features audio clips of former chess world champion Robert 'Bobby' Fischer's rambling interview with a radio station after his arrest in Japan, in which he asserts that the U.S. government will torture and murder him once extradited back to the country. Release and promotion Free was released by InsideOut Music on April 24, 2006. Matheos and Moore were keen to tour the US and Europe in the fall of 2006. In a 2009 interview, Moore reflected that \\"we tried to get together [to tour], but it just didn‚Äôt happen\\". The special edition of the album contained six extra songs: two were songs that didn't make it to the final album, but Matheos noted \\"were interesting nonetheless\\"; two tracks were songs Moore had written for Radio For Peace International. Another track was a demo of \\"When You're Ready\\", a track from Office of Strategic Influence. An EP entitled re:free was released on October 24, 2006. InsideOut Music released a CD version of the EP and Burning Shed released a vinyl version. The EP features the tracks \\"Go\\" (remixed by Console), \\"Kicking\\" and \\"Home Was Good\\" (both remixed by Moore) and a multimedia track of \\"Free\\". Reception Critical reception for Free was generally positive. Blogcritics praised the album as \\"a masterful evolution of the sound of two fabulous musicians\\", describing it as \\"a magnificent symbiosis of metal and experimental electronica.\\" Jake Rosenberg of Transcending the Mundane stated that on Office of Strategic Influence, \\"it sounded like they were experimenting with different approaches, but never really established the OSI sound\\". He lauded Free for \\"[sounding] like the work of a mature and confident band\\". Adrien Begrand of PopMatters regarded Free as \\"a challenge to fans of both Fates Warning and Dream Theater, and one that will surprise those who think this is just another slice of flashy prog metal bombast.\\" Reviewers commented on the differences between Free and Office of Strategic Influence. Rosenberg described Free as \\"heavier, darker, more experimental and a lot more consistent\\" than the first album. Stewart Mason of Allmusic described the album as \\"downright commercial in a way that none of the duo's previous projects have been\\". He regarded the album as less like the \\"standard-issue epic metal\\" of the first album and more like \\"Evanescence's gothy metal-pop crossed with late-era Radiohead's fondness for electronic interference\\". He considered the songwriting as \\"catchy enough that it's not unthinkable that unadventurous rock radio programmers could take a shine to the title track or 'Go'\\", although noted that \\"Fates Warning and Dream Theater fans might be less impressed\\". Rosenberg considers Free as musically \\"a more progressive version of Nine Inch Nails. Instead of creating their darkness with angst and depression, OSI creates their darkness with sheer indifference.\\" Begrand compared the album to Head Control System, \\"in that it tends to stray from the typical metal template in an attempt at something a little more electronic influenced\\". Although not considering Free to be as \\"enthralling\\" as Head Control System, he noted that the album \\"still has its moments\\". Critics noted that there was a greater focus on Moore's keyboards than Matheos' guitar riffs. Blogcritics said that \\"Free focuses a lot on the keyboards and programming of Kevin Moore\\", although Matheos' \\"heavy guitar riffs, while not as frequent on this disc, have an even harder edge. They have an energy, and urgency, and serious metal crunch to them that will make any rocker sit up and pay attention.\\" Chad Bower of About.com noted that Free \\"isn't one of those metal albums that hypes you up and makes you want to break stuff. It's one where you have to sit back, throw on the headphones, and appreciate the complexity and musicianship.\\" Olav Bj√∂rnsen of Prog4you.com stated that \\"layers upon layers of electronic sounds, that fill out the soundscapes of the songs, create nuances and subtle moods as well as walls of sound and tension.\\" He said that Matheos used acoustic and electric guitars \\"to fill out the soundscapes even more, and is at the most effective when playing the acoustic guitar, giving life and warmth to songs that would have been a bit cold sounding without that input.\\" Bower described Moore's \\"laid back and relaxed\\" vocals as \\"[fitting] in perfectly with the atmospheric style music\\". Blogcritics praised Moore's vocals as being \\"in such stark contrast to the music that it serves to heighten the tension of the songs\\". Bj√∂rnsen considered Moore's vocals as \\"an important asset\\" to the album: \\"He isn't a good vocalist when it comes to singing voice or range, but utilizes his talk- like singing effectively, binding together eleven quite different sounding songs.\\" Rosenberg considered Moore's vocals and lyrics as \\"the thing that stands out the most\\", comparing him to Roger Waters. Mason dismissed Moore's vocals, describing them as \\"unfortunately reminiscent of any number of faceless alternative rock singers\\". Begrand criticized Moore's \\"monotonous droning\\" as \\"tiresome\\". Mike Portnoy's drumming received praise. \\"Mike Portnoy continues to amaze with his adaptability, playing perfectly with just about whatever style of music,\\" Blogcritics noted. Bj√∂rnsen commended Portnoy's performance, noting that \\"He delivers driving rhythms when appropriate, and has a more laid back approach when necessary\\". Batmaz praised Portnoy for \\"displaying admirable restraint\\": \\"Free is perhaps his most minimalistic side, because of the thick atmosphere on the album, but at any rate, his performance his spectacular\\". Blogcritics praised Vera's bass parts as \\"[adding] extra strength and depth to the rhythm section.\\" Batmaz regarded \\"All Gone Now\\" as \\"arguably the best song\\", describing it as being \\"built upon a strong foundation of atmosphere and dynamics. Constantly shifting between mad riffage and daunting synth passages, this song features some of the finest melodies Kevin Moore has written since Awake. His synth melodies simply soar to high levels while Matheos' playing contrasts the eerie mood of the piece.\\" Bj√∂rnsen dismissed \\"Our Town\\" as \\"filler\\".

History and background Theatres des Vampires was formed in 1994 by Alessandro \\"Lord Vampyr\\" Nunziati, after leaving the band VII Arcano because of stylistic differences. Problems with the initial lineup of Theatres des Vampires meant that the first full-length studio album, Vampyr√¨sme, N√®crophilie, N√®crosadisme, N√®crophagie (1996) was recorded single-handedly by Alessandro \\"Lord Vampyr\\" Nunziati. By 1999 the band had a stable lineup, and recorded The Vampire Chronicles as a group effort. The promotion for which saw Theatres des Vampires employing movie effects to create spectacular live shows. The band's members expressed a fascination with vampires and anything connected to them, earning themselves and their music the title \\"vampiric metal\\" from their contemporaries. The band created an image of vampirism in their stage performance and within the lyrical themes and atmospheres of their music, which contributed heavily to the gaining of their fanbase. The third album Bloody Lunatic Asylum, was delivered in 2001 with live work including dates with Iron Maiden, Children of Bodom and In Flames amongst others. The band has produced ten albums in ten years with the English label Plastic Head, and has gained more recognition within the metal scene in Europe, South America and Russia, partially because of the band's participation in various festivals around the world. These include Vampyria III in London in 1999, Gods of Metal in Italy in 2000, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig in 2003 and in 2006, Gotham in London in 2004, and Female Voices Festival in Wieze, Belgium in 2006. In 2003, the band toured with Christian Death throughout Europe, and recorded an album with Valor of Christian Death and Gian Pyres of Cradle of Filth as special guests. Since 2004, Sonya Scarlet has remained the solo vocalist and front of the band, replacing her previous role as backing vocals. Scarlet sometimes cuts herself with razors at performances, freely letting fans drink her blood. In 2005 several English clubs forbade her performing the display of bloodletting, because it violates English laws against the incitement to commit suicide. On 28 November 2005, Aural Music released the album Pleasure and Pain. Distributors throughout Europe bought the album and it was published with permission in Europe, South America, the USA, Russia, and Japan. On 19 March 2007, they released Desire of Damnation. It is a double CD, with live songs from The Addiction Tour 2006 and some new studio songs and remixes. Guitarist Robert Cufaro (\\"Morgoth\\") left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Stephan Benfante. On May 2008, Aural Music released the album Anima Noir. On 14 January 2011, Aural Music released the album Moonlight Waltz. Moonlight Waltz is the ninth studio album. A music video for the song \\"Carmilla\\" was filmed on August 28 and 29, directed by David Bracci, who worked on most of Dario Argento's films in the past decade, and has also directed the \\"Lilith Mater Inferorum\\" music video.Theatres des Vampires announce Moonlight Waltz On 14 October 2016, the band released its tenth studio album, Candyland, via Scarlet Records, which counted with a guest appearance by Fernando Ribeiro, the vocalist of Portuguese gothic metal band Moonspell. Musical style Theatres des Vampires in 2011 Theatres des Vampires is noted for the vast spectrum of styles they have encompassed during their career. At the beginning of their career Theatres des Vampires were widely regarded as melodic black metal. On their 1999 album, The Vampire Chronicles they began to introduce a more gothic approach to their music. Along with Moonspell and Cradle of Filth, Theatres des Vampires is often regarded as one of the pioneers in combining gothic and black metal. Over time the black metal influences decreased, being dropped completely on the 2004 studio album Nightbreed of Macabria, which is symphonic/gothic metal. The 2008 album, Anima Noir saw the biggest change in the band's style with the introduction of electronic sounds. This album can be regarded as Gothic/Industrial metal. Their most recent album Moonlight Waltz took a turn in the symphonic direction, utilising a full orchestra, resulting in the most bombastic sound in the band's history. One of the most distinguishable features of the band is the vocal style of Sonya Scarlet, ranging from her unique emotive tones to her use of lyric soprano. Male and female vocals are often used together, creating the familiar beauty and the beast effect.

Plot  Dr. Kevin Saunders (played by David Schwimmer) and Dr. William Larson (played by Chris Cooper) pioneer the usage of silicone breast implants. Saunders and Larson gain immense financial success as cosmetic breast augmentation surgeries rise in acceptance and frequency in American culture, but follow different life paths thereafter: Dr. Saunders becoming a narcissist interested in developing and implanting the exaggeratedly larger-sized types of implants popular with a mostly erotic dancer and female porn star clientele. Doctor Larson, Saunders' former mentor and business partner, is portrayed as continuing to pursue a more serious, clinical approach (e.g., reconstructive breast surgeries for female breast cancer survivors, etc.).  Historical accuracy  The film very loosely tracks the history of the real-life breast implant phenomenon, from its radical introduction through its incredible popularity, through the controversial link of its silicone base to various types of illnesses and cancers (culminating in the Food and Drug Administration's moratorium on use of silicone in breast implants, leading the industry to use saline implants, instead). The story is interspersed with interview snippets of women from the 1970s who underwent breast augmentations with varying degrees of success, including their likes and dislikes about them. The interviews are marked by the fact that they show only the interviewees' nude breasts and torso. In reality, silicone implants were developed by Texas-based plastic surgeons Drs. Frank Gerow and Thomas Cronin.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/implants/cron.html  Production  Much of the filming was done in Galveston, Texas, and includes numerous interior and exterior shots of historic Star Drug, a drug store and soda fountain with a distinctive vintage ceramic Coca-Cola sign displayed over its front door. Star Drug burned in 1998 but has since been rebuilt. Limited footage is shown, as well, of the University of Texas Medical Branch campus.

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Oberes Glantal, and is its seat. The municipality was formed on 7 June 1969 in the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate out of the former municipalities and outlying centres of Sch√∂nenberg, K√ºbelberg, Schmittweiler and Sand.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006, Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz , Seite 195 (PDF) The centres have melded together since then and now stand as an economic hub for the southern Kusel district. By population, Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg is the Kusel district's biggest municipality.Municipal population statistics It is also a state-recognized tourism community.‚ÄúAnerkannte Fremdenverkehrsgemeinde‚Äù Geography Location The municipality of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg lies in the Western Palatinate near the boundary with the Saarland some 15 km south of Kusel, and 10 km northeast of Homburg. The two Ortsteile lie at the edge of the Landstuhler Bruch (a hollow). K√ºbelberg on the long mountain ridge south of the Klingbach runs seamlessly into Sch√∂nenberg to the east, while Sch√∂nenberg also melds without a break with the outlying centre of Sand. Within the municipality, the land rises from 241 m above sea level at the edge of the brook up to 264 m near the church in K√ºbelberg. Outside the built-up area, the highest elevations in the municipal area reach some 300 m above sea level in the Steinwald and Peterswald (forests).Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg‚Äôs location Neighbouring municipalities Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg borders in the north on the municipality of Br√ºcken, in the northeast on the municipality of Gries, in the east on the municipality of Bruchm√ºhlbach-Miesau, in the south on the municipality of Waldmohr, in the west on the municipality of Dunzweiler and in the northwest on the municipality of Dittweiler. Constituent communities Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg's Ortsteile are Sch√∂nenberg, K√ºbelberg, Schmittweiler and Sand. Also belonging to Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg are the outlying homesteads of Heidhof, Elmerthof and Klingenm√ºhle.Constituent communities Municipality‚Äôs layout In each of the two biggest centres, the old village core can still be made out today. For K√ºbelberg this lies in the area of the Catholic church, west of Bundesstra√üe 423, and for Sch√∂nenberg east of this thoroughfare on the road branching off towards Sand. South of this road stand the village hall, which houses both the municipal and Verbandsgemeinde administration, and the Evangelical church. What were once two linear villages (by some definitions, \\"thorpes\\") have grown together, along with the outlying centre of Sand, and have also spread in every direction, southwards, particularly to the railway line, in the east end also over the railway. The central school building with a Realschule and a Hauptschule stands north of the village in the Kohlbach valley. The primary school, which is still used today, stands on Pestalozzistra√üe (named after an educator, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi) in K√ºbelberg. Near the railway line south of Sch√∂nenberg spreads a major sporting facility.Municipality‚Äôs layout History Antiquity By prehistoric times, the area that is now Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg was already settled, as witnessed by archaeological finds within the municipal area and in neighbouring ones. A heavily damaged stone axe was found within municipal limits, and is now kept at Speyer. Several groups of barrows dating from the Iron Age are to be found in the Peterswald, south of the village. Noteworthy are two finds that were unearthed and described as early as the 19th century, a fibula and a bronze armring. Actual Roman finds have not been found within Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg's municipal limits, but quite a few artefacts have been unearthed in the surrounding area.Antiquity Middle Ages In 956, K√ºbelberg had its first documentary mention as Cheuilunbahc, while Sch√∂nenberg had its first documentary mention in 1419. All the centres that today make up Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg once lay within the (originally free) Imperial Domain (Reichsland) around the Castle Lautern, which during the 10th century was for a while held by the Bishopric of Worms. It is, however, unclear whether all these centres had already arisen at the time when this area held the status of Imperial Domain. It is certain that the Amt seat was there, namely K√ºbelberg, and the village of Sand was there, too. K√ºbelberg lay next to a castle that served as the seat of an Amt within the Imperial Domain. It is likely that this castle vanished before the Middle Ages were over. In some houses on Schmittweiler Stra√üe in K√ºbelberg, sparse remnants of the castle can still be made out. In the 13th century the castle belonged to the ring of fortifications in the broad area surrounding Castle Kaiserslautern. The area, now known as the Court of K√ºbelberg (Gericht K√ºbelberg), was repeatedly pledged by the Empire beginning in 1312 to various lordships, lastly to the Counts of Sponheim, under whose lordship it passed to Electoral Palatinate in 1437, which itself had already taken over the Amt of Kaiserslautern as an Imperial pledge as early as 1375. The Court of K√ºbelberg thus now belonged within the Electoral Palatinate to the Oberamt of Kaiserslautern. The village of Sch√∂nenberg shared this turn of events within the Amt (or Court) of K√ºbelberg, although there may have been the odd divergence; these, however, are not always verifiable. For instance, after the first documentary mention in 1419, the Junker of Breidenborn, as lords of the neighbouring Amt of M√ºnchweiler, counted the Schulthei√ü Heinecze von Schonenberg among their subjects. In a further Breidenbach document from the 15th century, other names of inhabitants of Sch√∂nenberg were mentioned. Sch√∂nenberg must therefore have belonged, at least for a time, to the Amt of M√ºnchweiler, and must thus also have been held by the Hornbach Monastery. A 1456 Weistum (cognate with English wisdom, this was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) from the Court of K√ºbelberg has been preserved as a faithful copy.Middle Ages Modern times A further preserved Weistum comes from the year 1554. Even in the description of the √Ñmter of Zweibr√ºcken and Kirkel by Tilemann Stella, a Renaissance-era academic, K√ºbelberg is mentioned, as Kibelnberg. In 1600, the Electoral Palatinate forest superintendent Velmann described the whole area of the Court of K√ºbelberg, also mentioning subjects‚Äô names in his writing, which began with a description of Sch√∂nenberg's municipal area. All the municipal area's particularities were noted, including the five ponds, which all belonged to the subjects. Following this was a description of K√ºbelberg's municipal area, noting its three ponds, although these ones belonged to the \\"heirs\\". During the Thirty Years' War, the villages of the Amt of K√ºbelberg, too, suffered serious hardship and misery. In 1635, during the siege of the Amt town of Kaiserslautern, Imperial troops, in many cases Croats, marched through the land, plundering, robbing and murdering. The villagers fled into the woods or sought shelter in small towns that belonged to Electoral Palatinate, like Wolfstein. The land was depopulated both by war and by the Plague. According to local historian Ernst Christmann, a whole swath of land including the villages of K√ºbelberg, Sch√∂nenberg, Sand, Elschbach and Schmittweiler lay for decades desolate. Slowly, the population figures built themselves back up with villagers who had been driven out returning to their homes, and also with others migrating to the area, although French King Louis XIV's wars brought the people further havoc. Only with the Treaty of Ryswick, which put an end to the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), did a lasting peace set in. French migrants may well have been arriving even during the wars with the French, but at this time, it was mainly migrants from Switzerland. The population grew so quickly that emigration, mostly to the Americas, began to grow, too. In 1744, Sch√∂nenberg once again got a market, after the former K√ºbelberg Market had been put to an end by the Thirty Years' War. In 1779, a territorial swap resulted in a new political arrangement when Electoral Palatinate agreed to exchange its Amt of K√ºbelberg with twelve villages (K√ºbelberg, Sch√∂nenberg, Sand, Br√ºcken, Ohmbach, Schmittweiler, Dittweiler, Frohnhofen, Altenkirchen, Ober-Miesau, Nieder-Miesau and Elschbach) and six mills for the villages of Duchroth and Oberhausen and part of the village of Niederkirchen in the Odenbach valley, all of which had hitherto belonged to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. From this time there also survives a description of the villages in the Amt. The short Zweibr√ºcken interlude lasted until the outbreak of the French Revolution, during which the Amt of K√ºbelberg was transferred from the Oberamt of Kaiserslautern into the Oberamt of Homburg. The duke who ruled at that time, Charles II August, who had had himself a fairytale castle built in Homburg, was said to be the very model of a princely despot. He awarded himself the title \\"Admiral\\" and had a ship built ‚Äì on the Neuwoog (a pond) in the Peterswald, now part of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg. After little time, this ship ran aground and rotted. The Duke also forbade his subjects the use of the Peterswald so that he could use it as his hunting ground. For their part, the subjects registered their displeasure at this by chasing away any lordly lumberjacks that they found.Modern times =Recent times= The first French Revolutionary troops showed up in the area in 1793. France annexed the Rhine‚Äôs left bank in 1801. Sch√∂nenberg became the seat of a mairie (\\"mayoralty\\") to which also belonged the villages of Br√ºcken, Gries, K√ºbelberg, Sand and Schmittweiler. Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg both lay in the Canton of Waldmohr in the Arrondissement of Saarbr√ºcken and the Department of Sarre. In 1814, the French withdrew from the Rhine's left bank. After a transitional period, the Bavarian Rheinkreis ‚Äì an exclave of the Kingdom of Bavaria ‚Äì was founded in 1816. This was later called the Rheinpfalz (\\"Rhenish Palatinate\\"). The administrative entities that had come into being during French Revolutionary and later Napoleonic times were retained and Sch√∂nenberg became the seat of a B√ºrgermeisterei (\\"mayoralty\\") in the Canton of Waldmohr in the Landkommissariat of Homburg, although the seat actually shifted from place to place over the next century, according to where the mayor lived. After the First World War, the victorious powers grouped the Bezirksamt of Homburg into the autonomous Saar area, but not the Canton of Waldmohr, to which Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg both belonged. This stayed with the newly formed Free State of Bavaria ‚Äì the Kaiser had been overthrown and so had the Bavarian king ‚Äì and thereby with Weimar Germany. The canton belonged to the Bezirksamt of Kusel with an administrative branch of its own, which it retained until 1940, whereafter the Canton of Waldmohr was administered directly from Kusel. In 1969, Sch√∂nenberg, K√ºbelberg, Sand and Schmittweiler merged to form a new municipality with the name Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg. In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, Sch√∂nenberg- K√ºbelberg became the seat of a Verbandsgemeinde in 1971.Recent times Population development In both villages, Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg, the villagers originally earned their livelihoods mainly at agriculture, although alongside farmers there were also craftsmen and peat cutters. From the 19th century onwards, a general shift began in which farming fed ever fewer people directly and many farmers‚Äô sons sought work in industry. Unlike many other villages, which offered only a few job opportunities, Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg today has developed considerable industry of its own. Nevertheless, many members of the workforce must commute elsewhere, to industrial works in Kaiserslautern and mines in the Saarland, or to smaller centres such as Landstuhl or Homburg. After the Second World War, many jobs arose in connection with the stationing of United States Armed Forces at Ramstein Air Base and the Miesau Army Depot. This development brought about a sharp rise in the population. With respect to religion, among Sch√∂nenberg's and K√ºbelberg's mainly Christian inhabitants, roughly 60% are Catholic and the other 40% Evangelical, with the Catholic share of the population having grown slightly over the last two centuries. There was once also a small Jewish community, but their share of the population was not very great. As a result of foreign families and asylum seekers settling in the municipality, a considerable Muslim community has sprung up. As early as 2000, some 16% of the population did not belong to any of the mainstream Christian denominations. The following tables show population development over the centuries for both Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg up to 1961, and then for the merged municipality of Sch√∂nenberg- K√ºbelberg:Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg‚Äôs population development =Sch√∂nenberg= { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1592  1684  1825  1835  1871  1905  1939  1961 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  70  5  529  628  601  779  1,221  1,815 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  ‚Äì  194  726 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  70  335  1,070 } =K√ºbelberg= { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1592  1684  1825  1835  1871  1905  1939  1961 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  75  0  460  544  532  692  1,103  1,412 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  ‚Äì  337  1,196 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  75  83  214 } =Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg= { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"400\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1961  1987  2007 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  3,227  4,085  5,752 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  1,922 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  1,284 - align=\\"center\\"  Other  21 } Municipality‚Äôs name Sch√∂nenberg first appeared in a document in 1419 as Schonenberg, and K√ºbelberg first appeared in a document in 956 as Cheuilunbahc. Other names that the two centres have borne are as follows: * For Sch√∂nenberg: Schollemberg and Schowemberg (1737), Sch√∂nberg (1564), Sch√∂nnbergk (1592), Sch√∂nenberg (1797) * For K√ºbelberg: Kebelinbach (1018), Keyfelberch (1263), Kebelinburg (1291), Kobelnberg (1291), in castro Keulnberg (1297), Kebelinberg (1304), Kebelnberg (1305 and 1310) The meaning of the name Sch√∂nenberg is not hard to discern. It comes from the German words sch√∂n (\\"lovely\\") and Berg (\\"mountain\\"), and thus it means a settlement at a lovely mountain. The meaning of the name K√ºbelberg, on the other hand, is not quite as transparent. Although it literally means \\"tub mountain\\" (which explains the canting charge in the civic coat of arms), writers Dolch and Greule think that the name may be linked to the old German waterway name Cheuilun. Furthermore, in the Ortsteil of K√ºbelberg once stood a mediaeval motte-and-bailey castle, the Burg K√ºbelberg, and it is believed that this caused a shift in the placename ending from ‚Äîbach to ‚Äîberg. The first part of K√ºbelberg's name changed steadily over time before settling on its current form about 1600.Sch√∂nenberg‚Äôs and K√ºbelberg‚Äôs names Vanished villages Mentioned in the historical record is a place named Wunnenberg, at which it is likely another castle stood. This was known as Wonnenberg, Wonnenburg, Winnenberg or Winnenburg. The actual 1358 document mentioning it says \\"Wunnenberg, gelegen bei Keblinberg\\" (\\"Wunnenberg, lying near Keblinberg\\"). A certain correspondence in meaning can be seen between sch√∂n (\\"lovely\\") and Wonne (\\"blissfulness\\" or \\"delight\\"). It may well therefore be that this Wunnenberg and Sch√∂nenberg were one and the same. There was also a place in the Peterswald that could be regarded as the seed that gave rise to today's Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg. It was called Neunkirchen, and it was mentioned in a document as early as 937 as a donation to the Bishopric of Worms. It was then mentioned several times in the 10th century, and again in the 15th century, before cropping up in a 16th-century record as an abandoned estate in the Peterswald.Vanished villages Religion As mentioned above, in 937, even before K√ºbelberg's first documentary mention, the now vanished village of Neunkirchen (then called Niunchiricha), which lay right near today's Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg, appeared in the historical record as a donation to the Bishopric of Worms, perhaps as a country church outside any built-up area. It cannot be ruled out that this church was already consecrated to Saint Valentine. During the Middle Ages, K√ºbelberg was not only the seat of an Amt and a court, but also the hub of a parish whose boundaries changed over time. By no means was the parish coextensive with the court region. The Reformation came to both Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg, and on the basis of the traditional rule of cuius regio, eius religio, all inhabitants of Electoral Palatinate were obliged to convert to the new belief. In the Reformation's early years, both Lutheranism and the Reformed church were trying to become the predominant belief; in the end, the latter gained the upper hand locally. Any ecclesiastical victory between Protestant denominations, however, was quite moot, for the two villages mostly died out in the Thirty Years' War, and the church in K√ºbelberg was destroyed. Thereafter, what predominated was religious freedom, and believers from any Christian denomination were welcome to settle in the villages. The pattern of postwar settlement, though, was not the same in both villages: more Protestants settled in Sch√∂nenberg, whereas more Catholics settled in K√ºbelberg. During King Louis XIV's wars in the Palatinate, the French also promoted the settlement of Catholics, and in general, during the 18th century, the Electors of the Palatinate ever more strongly advocated in favour of Catholicism. The results can still be seen today with about 60% of the two villages‚Äô combined population being Catholic and the other 40% being Evangelical. Saint Valentine's Church (Kirche St. Valentin) in K√ºbelberg goes back to a mediaeval building, parts of whose tower are still preserved. In 1702, the new Catholic church was built with support from the Order of Malta, who then held rights in K√ºbelberg. The new church was attended by all Catholics living in the surrounding area. It was repeatedly remodelled and acquired a new organ in 1841 built by the Stumm organ-building family. In 1963, the church was extensively expanded, whereby the old nave became the chancel, and on the south side, a great, modern hall church arose. The Evangelical Christians at first had no central church. The Reformed community was bigger, and they attended church services in Miesau. The Lutherans had a small church in Br√ºcken at their disposal. After the unification of the Reformed and Lutheran faiths in the Palatine Union of 1818, the Evangelical Christians from K√ºbelberg orientated themselves towards Waldmohr, while the ones from Sch√∂nenberg stayed with the parish of Miesau. Only in 1954 was the parish of Sch√∂nenberg, which still exists now, established, and to this belong the villages of K√ºbelberg, Sand and Schmittweiler (the whole municipality, in other words). Sch√∂nenberg has had an Evangelical church since 1935, which at first was a converted tollhouse. The Evangelical church that stands in K√ºbelberg was built in 1971 and acquired a belltower in 1986. Today, the Catholics in both the municipality's main centres belong to the Catholic deaconry of Homburg and the Evangelicals belong to the Evangelical deaconry of Homburg.Religion Politics Municipal council The council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

Mayor Sch√∂nenberg- K√ºbelberg's mayor is Josef Weis, and his deputies are Klaus Gummel and Maria Rubly.Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg‚Äôs executive Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Azure a bend sinister wavy argent charged with a cross patt√©e in pale sable, in dexter chief a daisy proper and in sinister base a tub, handle to sinister, Or hooped of the second. The bend sinister wavy (slanted wavy stripe) refers to the municipality's wealth of water at the edge of the Landstuhler Bruch. The daisy stands for Sch√∂nenberg and the tub (K√ºbel in German, thus making this a canting charge) stands for K√ºbelberg. The arms have been borne since 1975 when they were approved by the Regierungsbezirk administration. Before this time, Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg each bore their own arms. Sch√∂nenberg's were azure three tubs one and two, handles to dexter argent hooped Or (a reference to the Court of K√ºbelberg), while K√ºbelberg's were gules a pile throughout between two tubs Or and charged with a wall and a tower embattled of the same masoned sable on a field lozengy argent and azure. Before amalgamation, the centres of Sand and Schmittweiler bore no arms.Description and explanation of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg‚Äôs arms File:Wappen Schoenenberg-Kuebelberg.jpgMunicipality's current arms File:Wappen Sch√∂nenberg (Pfalz).jpgSch√∂nenberg's old arms File:Wappen K√ºbelberg (Pfalz).jpgK√ºbelberg's old arms Town partnerships Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg fosters partnerships with the following places:Partnership with Szabadsz√°ll√°s * Szabadsz√°ll√°s, B√°cs-Kiskun County, Hungary Culture and sightseeing Buildings The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district =K√ºbelberg= * Saint Valentine‚Äôs Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Valentinus), Kirchengasse 5 ‚Äì Baroque aisleless church, 1702‚Äì1709, marked 1790, tower raised 1826; Stumm organ from 1841, expansion-conversion 1963 * Kirchengasse 1‚Äì6 (monumental zone) ‚Äì distinctive village square appearance around the Catholic church with the former Catholic schoolhouse (no. 3), the former nurses‚Äô residence (no. 4), rectory (no. 6), wayside cross and a small Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street; no. 1) * Near Saarbr√ºcker Stra√üe 71 ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial 1914-1918 and 1939-1945, 1935 by Richard Menges, Kaiserslautern, expansion 1956 =Sand= * Miesauer Stra√üe 39 ‚Äì one-floor Quereinhaus with knee wall, 1898, in the righthand corner stable and shed =Schmittweiler= * H√∂cherbergstra√üe 2 ‚Äì former school; sandstone-framed plastered building, 1879 architect possibly Regional Building Director (Bezirksbauschaffner) Rottm√ºller, Homburg; characterizes village's appearance * H√∂cherbergstra√üe 5 ‚Äì Quereinhaus, dwelling wing with knee wall about 1780, commercial wing, partly timber-frame, between 1806 and 1842 * Lindenstra√üe 2 ‚Äì stately Quereinhaus, marked 1844, in the righthand corner a pigsty; characterizes village's appearance * Lindenstra√üe 16 ‚Äì Quereinhaus with half-hipped roof, marked 1839 =Sch√∂nenberg= Sch√∂nenberg, Bahnhofstra√üe 48/52 monumental zone: railway station * Bahnhofstra√üe 48/52 (monumental zone) ‚Äì railway station with side buildings (pissoir and storage building) and railway hotel; railway station (no. 52) sandstone-block building, 1903/1904, spire light after 1920; railway hotel: sandstone-framed building with half-hipped roof, 1908 * Glanstra√üe 50 ‚Äì dwelling wing of a former Quereinhaus, partly timber-frame (plastered), 18th century, wooden gallery and enclosure possibly from the latter half of the 19th century; characterizes street's appearance Regular events Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg has old customs such as the Carnival parade (Faschingsumzug) at Shrovetide, the St. Martin's Day children's parade and its own ways of celebrating kermises, as well as newer customs such as Halloween, among others.

There are several hypermarkets and discount stores as well as many one-line businesses filling household and craft needs, a car dealership with workshops, a big motor vehicle scrapping and salvaging business, craft businesses in building and architectural engineering, a construction company, a building supply wholesaler, bank branches and professionals such as lawyers and physicians. In both Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg, the villagers earned their livelihoods mainly from agriculture, although there were also craftsmen and peat cutters. Beginning in the 19th century, there was a gradual shift that led to agriculture directly feeding ever fewer people, and many farm boys seeking work in industry. Unlike many other villages, which offer very little in the way of job opportunities, Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg has developed considerable industry of its own. Nevertheless, many working people must commute to work, to the industrial operations in Kaiserslautern and to the mines in the Saarland, even to smaller centres like Landstuhl and Homburg. After the Second World War, many jobs became available in the course of the stationing of US Forces at Ramstein Air Base and Miesau Army Depot. This development spurred a strong upswing in the population.Economic structure Education In the course of the Reformation, the Electors promoted schooling. As early as 1510, a schoolteacher is believed to have taught classes in K√ºbelberg, even though the village did not yet have any schoolhouse. In 1615, the Reformed pastor Nicolaus reported to the Oberamt of Kaiserslautern: \\"At K√ºbelberg is a schoolmaster, Petrus Matzenbach. Has a salary from the Collector of 30 Rhenish guilders ‚Ä¶ also seven malter of corn. ‚Ä¶ This schoolmaster is hardworking, good at his calling ‚Ä¶\\". During the Thirty Years' War (which began only three years after Pastor Nicolaus‚Äôs report), schooling fell by the wayside, and it only began again once many children began growing up in the families that came to settle the village after the war. In Sch√∂nenberg and K√ºbelberg, schooling took different directions in each village. K√ºbelberg, as a new Catholic parish, established in the early 18th century a Catholic school, though the schoolteacher had to wait a long time for his monetary and material emoluments, since according to the rules, there was still supposed to be a Protestant schoolteacher. The Catholic school also sought out Catholic children from the neighbouring villages, mainly from Sch√∂nenberg. The building of the Catholic schoolhouse in K√ºbelberg about 1705 was financed by the pastor himself. Until then, school was taught at private houses or at the rectory. In 1754, the Schulthei√ü reported to the Oberamt that the Catholic schoolmaster in K√ºbelberg had to teach 60 children and received 10 Malter of corn and 25 guilders each year, lived in a small, not well-built house and had at his disposal a little garden. About the children‚Äôs behaviour there was no complaint. Given the steady population growth, the available schoolhouse soon was no longer big enough for the village. In 1797, the people of K√ºbelberg got a new schoolhouse for all the area‚Äôs Catholic children. In this building, which would later become the convent, school was taught until 1910. In 1848, the municipality bought up the inn to convert it into a school, too. The number of Catholic children rose more quickly than the number of Evangelical children, and thus Sch√∂nenberg soon found itself having to make an equalization payment to K√ºbelberg. The year 1965 marked the last time that a school for K√ºbelberg alone stood on Pestalozzistra√üe in K√ºbelberg. Since the establishment of the Schulzentrum S√ºd, this building has served as a primary school for the whole, merged municipality of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg. The Protestant children, mainly those from Sch√∂nenberg, at first attended school in neighbouring Miesau. Only about 1730 did the municipality of Sch√∂nenberg build a schoolhouse for the Reformed and Lutheran children. It was expanded in 1802. In 1821, a new Evangelical schoolhouse was built in Sch√∂nenberg, though after a few decades, it was no longer up to the task at hand. Thus, a new one was built in 1910, although great population growth also quickly made this one too small, particularly as Sch√∂nenberg introduced Christian community school. So, with the Second World War looming, Sch√∂nenberg began to build yet another schoolhouse, but this was left unfinished until after the war, whereupon it was built into a private house. For a while, the district maintained an agricultural vocational school near the Sch√∂nenberg schoolhouse in the time after the war. In 1972, there was a thorough reform of schooling. All schoolchildren from all four of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg‚Äôs centres now attend a single primary school, which has no local peculiarities, nor denominational affiliations. From 1979 to 1982, the Schulzentrum S√ºd (\\"School Centre South\\") was built for all the Hauptschule students of the Verbandsgemeinde (Erich- K√§stner-Schule). Also housed at this complex is a Realschule. The primary school pupils from the whole municipality are now taught at the schoolhouse on Pestalozzistra√üe. The nearest Gymnasium is in Homburg (not even in the same state), while special schools can be found in Kusel and Br√ºcken. Nearby universities are in Homburg (Saarland University, Faculty of Medicine), Kaiserslautern (Kaiserslautern University of Technology), Trier (University of Trier) and Saarbr√ºcken (Saarland University).Education Transport Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg is linked by Bundesstra√üe 423 (Mandelbachtal - Altenglan) to the national road network. Some 5 km to the south runs the Autobahn A 6 (Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMannheim) with an interchange at Waldmohr, while roughly 13 km to the northeast runs the Autobahn A 62 (Kaiserslautern‚ÄìTrier) with an interchange at Kusel. The former railway station on the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn) in the municipality itself has been abandoned. Homburg and the even nearer Bruchm√ºhlbach-Miesau have stations on the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn). Public passenger transport is provided by bus routes that radiate from the municipality in almost every direction.Transport Famous people Famous people associated with the municipality *Albert Buchheit (b. 1862 in Contwig; d. 1933 in Kirchmohr) ::A Catholic priest, Buchheit was a well known church historian and author of the book Die s√§kularisierten Kircheng√ºter der Pfalz (\\"The Secularized Church Properties of the Palatinate\\").

It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde Oberes Glantal. Geography Location The municipality lies at the western end of the Landstuhl Marsh (a depression), right at the state boundary with the Saarland roughly 15 km southwest of Kusel, and 10 km north of Homburg. Spreading out along a length of the Glan into the hills on each side, Waldmohr's municipal area reaches elevations of 362 m above sea level at the Waldziegelh√ºtte (an outlying centre whose name means ‚Äúforest brickworks‚Äù) and 234 m above sea level at the Eichelscheid (another outlying centre). The chain of hills, Steines, Fuchsberg, Bolsten, Schachen and Heidenkopf with Oehlb√ºhl, which slope down to the south towards the Glan, and the mountain ridges, H√§upel, M√ºhlfeld, H√§rtel, and Kr√§mmel, which even out gently towards the north and east, are heavily settled along the greater thoroughfares leading to the heart of the village. Landesstra√üe 355 bypasses the village to the east and links it to the Autobahn. The river Glan, which rises in neighbouring H√∂chen, receives considerable contributions at Waldmohr's municipal limit, where the Branschbach and the M√∂rschbach empty into it at the edge of the D√∂rrberg. Several big ponds (D√∂rrbergweiher and Mohrm√ºhlweiher) and many fishing ponds enrich the landscape's appearance. The old tank trench at the Eichelscheiderhof has long been a renaturated stretch of the GlanLocation Neighbouring municipalities Waldmohr borders in the north on the municipality of Sch√∂nenberg-K√ºbelberg, in the east on the municipality of Bruchm√ºhlbach-Miesau, in the south on the town of Homburg (not to be confused with the municipality of Homberg), in the west on the town of Bexbach and in the northwest on the municipality of Dunzweiler. Constituent communities Waldmohr's Ortsteile are Waldmohr (main centre), Eichelscheiderhof (10) and Waldziegelh√ºtte (112). Also belonging to Waldmohr are the outlying homesteads of Bahnhaus (5), Bolsterhof (14), Erlenhof (6), Mohrm√ºhle (24), Oehlb√ºhlerhof (2), Waldhaus (3) and Autobahnrasthaus (0). Figures in parentheses are population figures as of 2000. =Eichelscheiderhof= Originally a noble estate belonging to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, the Eichelscheiderhof once stood within J√§gersburg's municipal limits. With the formation of the Saar zone of occupation under a League of Nations mandate in 1920, the estate was split from J√§gersburg and added to Waldmohr. The name first crops up in Tielemann Stella's writings from 1587 as Eichenschitt, and refers to the wealth of oaktrees in the area (Eiche means ‚Äúoak‚Äù in German). The Eichelscheider Hof itself had its first documentary mention at the time of its founding in 1704. While the J√§gersburg Hunting Palace (Jagdschloss J√§gersburg) was being built near the district seat of Homburg, the estate was converted into a lordly stud farm, serving the famous Zweibr√ºcken breeding until the end of the Second World War. Napoleon‚Äôs parade horse came from the Eichelscheider Hof. The stables are laid out horseshoe-shaped with a great inner yard, and parts have been converted to dwellings. The gateway dominates the estate's appearance. To the right of the stables stands the former manor house. The village of J√§gersburg belonged wholly to Waldmohr. Only when the Saar was occupied in 1918 was J√§gersburg taken away from Waldmohr. J√§gersburg thereby became a self-administering municipality, although it has since been merged into Homburg. Municipality‚Äôs layout The very old linking roads to neighbouring villages are mostly still preserved and usable. The economically important forest paths used for logging and hiking are maintained and in good condition, whereas others are being reclaimed by the wilderness and are disappearing. Farm lanes, too, are only passable if the fields that they reach are still being used. During the Flurbereinigung undertaken in the late 1950s, which saw various parcels of land consolidated, many fieldpaths were swept away. As of 1990, the municipality of Waldmohr had all together 563.9 ha of wooded land, of which 365 ha was state-owned, 159.3 ha was municipally owned and 39.6 ha was privately owned. As of 1983, Waldmohr had an area of 1 307 ha, of which 363 ha, or 27.2%, was under agricultural use. According to the municipal plan, 18.5 ha is given over to existing bodies of water. Various rural cadastral names point to historical ownership, location, particular soil conditions or former bodies of water. A few examples include: Kirchelborn or Kirckelborn, Spickelberg, Warbach, Bolsten, H√§upel, Heiligenwald, etc. In 1901, the forestry office building came into service. The region over which it holds sway is today one of the biggest in the Palatinate. In 1257, the Mohrm√ºhle, one of the oldest mills in the region, had its first documentary mention. The old mill, where from sometime before 1610 until 1645 in the Thirty Years' War direct ancestors of former President of Germany Richard von Weizs√§cker lived, is now a destination for outings with a restaurant. In the 1960s, another old mill, the Waldmohrer M√ºhle, built in 1715, was falling into ever greater disrepair and ended up being torn down. Only a couple of rural cadastral names (in den M√ºhlwiesen, auf dem M√ºhlfeld) now recall the actual mill. It was both a gristmill and a sawmill in its time. Three outlying farmsteads (Aussiedlerh√∂fe) are still worked nowadays. These are Oehlb√ºhlerhof (founded in 1958; area 0.9 ha), Bolsterhof (founded in 1958; area 0.9 ha) and Erlenhof (founded in 1965; area 0.8 ha). The Oehlb√ºhlerhof is tended by the owner of the Erlenhof.Municipality‚Äôs layout History In 830, Waldmohr had its first documentary mention in the Lorsch codex as villa Moraha ‚Äì ‚Äúvillage on the boggy brook‚Äù. In 1449, the village passed into the lordship of the Dukes of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken and remained under their rule until the duchy itself was swept away by the events of the French Revolution in 1794. Under French rule, Waldmohr became the seat of the like-named canton in the Department of Sarre, thus beginning the village's history as an administrative seat. After the French occupation ended, the Palatinate passed to the Kingdom of Bavaria, with Waldmohr retaining its function as the cantonal seat for 57 villages between Kirkel and Glan-M√ºnchweiler. It lost its place as such only after the separation of the Saar after the First World War. In 1920, Waldmohr was assigned to the Bezirksamt of Kusel and downgraded to a Bezirksamt branch location. In 1946, it was grouped into the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate, and in 1971, when it became the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Waldmohr, it regained some of its lost glory. Antiquity The barrows that go back to middle Late Hallstatt times (about 550 BC) on both sides of the Rhineland-Palatinate-Saarland boundary in the Kuhwald (‚ÄúCow Forest‚Äù) visibly bear witness even today to early settlement, and after archaeological digs at two of them in 1995 and 1996 they became an attraction for those interested in history. The old highway is still today recognizable along almost its whole length, and much broader than an ordinary country path. In various descriptions from the 14th to the 16th century, it is called the Mohrerweg or Landstra√üe von Mor nach Erbach (‚ÄúHighway from Mor to Erbach‚Äù), with Mor or Mohr in each case referring to Waldmohr (the prefix Wald‚Äî simply means ‚Äúforest‚Äù). Long-settled villagers still speak today of the old Homburger Weg (Erbach lies near Homburg, and is today a constituent community of that town), while in Erbach, it is seen as the Waldmohrer Weg. This east-west road link is of Roman origin, if not even older. After the Romans withdrew in the early 5th century, the region was almost empty of people, and only once the Franks had come to take the land was it slowly settled once more. In this time, the Bliesgau was grouped administratively into Francia.Antiquity Middle Ages The placename Moraha was used for centuries more, even after the name Waltmore had had its first documentary mention in 1418. From 1190 to 1441, a knightly family named ‚Äúvon Moran‚Äù was mentioned as being among the vassals of the Counts of Homburg. Several times, the counts pledged the village and court of More, or at least parts thereof, for example, between 1383 and 1410 to the Counts of Veldenz, and once again to the same noble house between 1449 and 1475. In 1312, forty farmers were living in Waldmohr. From 1475 to 1815, the Schulthei√üerei of Waldmohr belonged to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. As early as 1404, Waldmohr was mentioned as being the seat of a lower court.Middle Ages Modern times In 1535, the Reformation was introduced, after a parish had existed since at least 1219 according to records. The existence of a school in Waldmohr is mentioned for the first time in a 1564 Visitation report. In 1605 came the first mention of an actual schoolhouse. In 1609, the village had 225 Reformed inhabitants at 42 ‚Äúhearth places‚Äù (for which, read ‚Äúhouseholds‚Äù). Waldmohr did not fare well in the Thirty Years' War, when troops burnt it down in 1622 and destroyed it utterly in 1635. In 1688 and 1689, the village was once again beset and burnt down in the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession). From 1679 to 1697, Waldmohr ‚Äì along with the whole region ‚Äì found itself under French rule. In 1701, a new schoolhouse was built. In 1704, the Eichelscheiderhof had its first documentary mention, as did the Waldziegelh√ºtte in 1749. Between 1752 and 1757, Duke Christian IV had the Eichelscheiderhof stud farm built on the site of the estate of that name. It was built in the shape of a small palatial residence with its gateway into the horseshoe-shaped complex. In 1765, near the old village church auf der Fels (‚ÄúOn the Cliff‚Äù), the new Evangelical church was consecrated. In 1775, a directory of Reformed parishioners (for Waldmohr only), not counting shepherds, menservants or maidservants, listed 54 men, 71 women, 91 boys and 89 girls. The parish belonged until the establishment of the Oberamt of Homburg in 1781 to the Inspection of Zweibr√ºcken, to which the village also belonged administratively. From 1798 to 1815, Waldmohr was seat of the like-named canton in the Department of Sarre, and seat, too, of a mairie (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù), belonging to which were Waldmohr, J√§gersburg, Kleinottweiler, H√∂chen, Frohnhofen, Breitenbach, Altenkirchen and Dittweiler. Besides Waldmohr, the canton also included K√ºbelberg, Sch√∂nenberg, Sand, Miesau, Elschbach, Scheidenberg (Schanzer M√ºhle), Ohmbach and Br√ºcken. The canton belonged to the Arrondissement of Saarbr√ºcken. An 1812 record mentions a cantonal prison in Waldmohr. In 1813, Waldmohr had 683 inhabitants.Modern times =Recent times= Beginning in 1816, after Napoleon‚Äôs downfall and the Congress of Vienna, Waldmohr belonged to the Kingdom of Bavaria, within which it was once again seat of the like-named canton, but now within the Landcommissariat of Homburg in the Rheinkreis (the Palatinate under Bavarian rule). The Canton of Waldmohr now contained 57 villages, estates and mills. That same year, the village was given a magistrates‚Äô court. In 1824, the common schoolhouse was built on Bahnhofstra√üe (‚ÄúRailway Station Street‚Äù). A new steeple was dedicated in 1831 on the occasion of the Silver Jubilee of King Maximilian I Joseph's coronation. In 1834, the municipality founded Catholic education. Completed in 1850 was the town hall, which also housed the court, which from the very beginning caused a space problem. Only in 1901 could the municipality open its own courthouse ‚Äì today a community centre ‚Äì and at the same time a forester's office across the street. In 1855, a post office was set up in Waldmohr, in its own building. In 1873, the Waldmohr municipal health insurance fund took up its healthcare function, and was only dissolved on 31 December 1913 by the Reichsversicherungsordnung (‚ÄúImperial Insurance Order‚Äù), whereupon it was taken over by the general health insurance fund. Journalism began in Waldmohr in 1892 with the publication of the first edition of the Waldmohrer Zeitung (meaning simply ‚ÄúWaldmohr Newspaper‚Äù), and in 1895, the first master forester for the Waldmohr forester's office region was named. In 1916, electric light came to Waldmohr, after gaslights had replaced petroleum lamps in 1905. The Waldziegelh√ºtte, on the other hand, had been electrified in 1914, the same year that a motorized bus route began running from Waldmohr to Bexbach, Oberbexbach and the Frankenholz mine. A telephone exchange was built on Bahnhofstra√üe in 1928. From 1920 until the Saar's reintegration into Germany in 1935, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazis had swept the Weimar Republic away and instituted the Third Reich, Waldmohr was a border village. One consequence was that Waldmohr was split away from the Bezirksamt (equivalent to Kreis ‚Äì district) of Homburg to which it had belonged, and a branch location of the Bezirksamt of Kusel was therefore set up in Waldmohr for all municipalities that had likewise belonged to the now occupied Bezirksamt. In 1927, a branch location of the Kusel labour office was also located in the village. With the approach of the Second World War, the first fortifications began to appear in Waldmohr's municipal area in 1938. This was part of the Westwall, commonly known in English as the Siegfried Line. There were tank trenches, dragon's teeth, bunkers and road barriers, all installed by Organisation Todt. In the autumn of that year, more than two thousand soldiers (horse-drawn artillery) were posted to the Kuhwald. Until 1995, a big horse's drinking trough recalled this event. Organisation Todt built the Siegfried Line's second Main Battle Line (Hauptkampflinie, HKL) in and around Waldmohr, with more than 30 bunkers (although 70 had been planned). On Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938), SS commandoes from outside the village perpetrated great destruction at Jewish villagers‚Äô homes, particularly at Dr. Salomon's (dentist) and Dr. Levi's (general practitioner), among others. In 1944, more fortifications, trenches, dams and road barriers were laid out, along with so-called Tobruk bunkers. During the war, bombs fell on H√∂cherstra√üe and Glanstra√üe (streets), as well as in the surrounding countryside, causing deaths and damage to houses. After the war, from 1946 to 1960, Waldmohr once again became a border village as the Saar was once again occupied by the victorious Allies. Shortly after the 1948 currency reform, though, new businesses were coming to the municipality and setting up industrial operations. In 1958, the labour office branch and the municipal revenue agency were housed in a new office building on the street then called Hauptstra√üe (‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù, but now called Saarpfalzstra√üe, or ‚ÄúSaar-Palatinate Street‚Äù). In 1960, a 70-hectare commercial-industrial park began to open up in the Kuhwald and on the heath. In 1964, a modern school with a gymnasium and a small indoor swimming pool was opened. In 1971, the Verbandsgemeinde of Waldmohr was founded, with Waldmohr itself as the administrative seat. Besides Waldmohr, the new Verbandsgemeinde comprised Dunzweiler and Breitenbach. In 1980, the municipality celebrated its 1,150-year jubilee by dedicating a new marketplace and the new village centre.Recent times Population development Waldmohr was as early as the Middle Ages one of the bigger villages. In 1312, forty farmers were living there. According to Tilemann Stella, it was 43 in 1547. In 1609, the village had 225 Reformed inhabitants in 42 households, according to a church protocol. The population was greatly reduced in the Thirty Years' War, leaving only six subjects (families) in Waldmohr in 1655 (seven years after the war ended). Nonetheless, the number of families rose again quickly, but then the Nine Years' War wrought further decimation. A 1675 record reads ‚ÄúWaldmohr, burnt down, 16 families‚Äù. During the 18th century, growth became continuous, although by now, a few families were emigrating. In 1696, there were 24 ‚Äúhearth places‚Äù (households; 1 clergyman, 1 schoolteacher, 15 farmers, 1 cooper, 1 cabinetmaker, 1 shepherd, 2 maids, 3 menservants and 3 day labourers). In 1718, 42 residences were counted in Waldmohr; by 1760 this had risen to 70. In 1813, in late Napoleonic times, Waldmohr had 683 inhabitants. Old documents convey to the modern reader only a few villagers‚Äô names, and indeed until the early 15th century, usually only first names were recorded. An ‚Äúimmigration patent‚Äù issued by the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken after the 1648 Peace of Westphalia was meant to raise the region's population after the wartime devastation. Only a second such patent issued in 1698 by Duke Karl XII met with great success, bringing many families from Switzerland to Waldmohr (Munzinger, Agne, Hollinger, Sandmeyer, Danner, Gerhard, B√§chle, Blum, Burckhardt, Klein, Keller, Clo√ü, Jakoby, Kurtz). According to the original 1845 cadastral survey, it seems that destitution (division of inheritance, hunger, early death) and the 1848/1849 political upheavals were the main forces driving people to emigrate from the region. Many names are accompanied by notes such as ‚Äúout of the country ‚Äì in the land of America‚Äù. Nevertheless, in the latter half of the 19th century, ever more people were coming to Waldmohr, even with the fee for becoming a local citizen having been set at 102.85 marks in 1878. During the building of the Nordfeldbahndamm ‚Äì a railway embankment ‚Äì between 1902 and 1904, several Italians were employed who settled in the village. The two world wars exacted a heavy toll in blood, particularly the Second World War, which claimed many victims. With the separation of the Saar from the rest of Germany after both world wars, many customs officials and their families came to Waldmohr. Both in Weimar times and after the Second World War, miners‚Äô families moved to the Ruhr area or the Aachen mining region either out of need for work or for better wages. In the 1940s and 1950s, ethnic Germans driven out of Germany's former eastern territories came to settle in Waldmohr. Only the location of industry and opening of valuable building land over the past few decades, however, coupled with good infrastructure development over that time, has led to steady population growth through migration, mainly from the Homburg area, Neunkirchen and the Glan valley. Also, quite a few Turkish families came beginning in 1971. After the Soviet Union's downfall, many ethnically German families from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan ‚Äì former Volga Germans and Black Sea Germans ‚Äì came to the village. The commonest names in the village these days are still B√§chle, Bauer, Becker, Blum, Braun, Burkart/Burkhardt, Ecker, Emich, Hoffmann, Jung, Kampa, Keller, Kiefer, Klein, Krupp, Leibrock, Lothsch√ºtz, Maurer, Metzger, M√ºller, Rapp, Sch√§fer, Schmidt/Schmitt, Schneider, Schwarz, Simon, Trumm, Wagner, Weber, Wei√ü/Weis/Weiss, Wolf, Wunn and Zimmer. The following table shows population development over the centuries for Waldmohr, with some figures broken down by religious denomination:Waldmohr‚Äôs population development { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"500\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1825  1835  1871  1905  1939  1961  1995  2007 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  1,025  1,191  1,193  1,762  2,245  2,965  5,711  5,310 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  128  806 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  884  2,117 - align=\\"center\\"  Jewish  13  ‚Äì } Municipality‚Äôs name As early as prehistoric and protohistoric times, the Waldmohr area was settled, as archaeological finds (such as blades, small lacrymatories, remnants of smelting ovens) and barrows bear witness. The first documentary mention dates from AD 830 and is found in a document from Lorsch Abbey, the Lorsch codex (also known as the Reichsurbar, Codex Laureshamensis; kept at the State Archive in Munich), in which the three royal estates of Lutra, Nannenstuol and M√∂rahha are named (the last one corresponding with the second syllable in ‚ÄúWaldmohr‚Äù). The name's meaning comes mainly from the Old High German terms mor for ‚Äúwetland‚Äù (Old English had the same word, and the English ‚Äúmoor‚Äù and the German Moor are both still used todayEtymology at Online Etymological Dictionary) and ahha for either ‚Äúbrook‚Äù or ‚Äúwater‚Äù. A few researchers, however, derive the m√∂r part of the name from the Latin mora, which can mean either a stay or a rhetorical pause (a royal estate as a rest stop?). The word ahha crops up a number of times in Old High German poetry from Carolingian times, spelt with only one H, thus aha, and always means ‚Äúwater‚Äù. Over the centuries, the village called itself, using various spellings, mora, Mohra, More, Moir, Mohr and mor or Mor. Only in 1418 did the name Waltmore crop up. The name, later Waltmor, Waltmohr, Waldmoor, Waldtmohr and eventually Waldmohr, only became generally customary in the 17th century; the prefix was meant to distinguish ‚ÄúMohr‚Äù from other, nearby, similarly named places such as Kirchmohr, Niedermohr and Obermohr, among others.Municipality‚Äôs name Religion In the time of the Reformation, under the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, all the inhabitants had to convert, at the Duke's behest, to Lutheranism, that is, until 1588, when Duke Johannes I made them all convert once again, this time to Calvinism. Only beginning in 1648 ‚Äì after the Thirty Years' War ‚Äì could Lutherans, Reformed believers and Catholics once more live side-by-side in the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. With the new arrangement of parish areas in 1821, Dunzweiler, along with the Waldziegelh√ºtte, passed to the parish of Breitenbach, and to make for a fair endowment, the parochial estate in Waldmohr was also signed over to the parish of Breitenbach. The parish still holds property in Waldmohr to this day. In 1902, the Catholic community, which belonged to the parish of K√ºbelberg, had 371 souls. Only in 1929 did Waldmohr welcome its own pastor. The two Catholic parishes of Waldmohr and Breitenbach would thereafter be administered together. The oldest church or chapel likely stood on the stony ridge, upon which the later church was built, upon whose foundations and walls, in turn, the current Protestant church from 1765 stands. It was said to be at that time a village hub of sorts, and the first known graveyard in the village ‚Äì the churchyard ‚Äì was there. In 1814, another graveyard was laid out in the Kr√§mmel (a cadastral area), and expanded in 1852. The current graveyard in the Br√ºchelchen dates from 1898. This has already twice been expanded, and in 1958 it got a new mortuary. In 1924, a forest graveyard was also built at the Waldziegelh√ºtte, right at Saint Mary's Chapel (Marienkapelle), likewise built at that time. In August 1923, the Catholic parish's long planned so-called ‚ÄúEmergency Church‚Äù (Notkirche) was consecrated. It was later torn down, and on its former site arose Saint George‚Äôs Church (St. Georgskirche) in 1960. The ‚ÄúWhite Hall‚Äù (Wei√üe Halle), a Catholic parish community centre, was likewise torn down. It had at one time housed a shoe factory and outlet. Now it was to get a new building and it went into service as a meeting place in 1992. In 1866, the Stumm organ at the Protestant church was dedicated. At the time when the Palatine Union came into effect in 1818, which united the Reformed and Lutheran churches, the small Lutheran parish had all together 620 parishioners, 130 of whom lived in Waldmohr.Religion Politics Municipal council The council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"350\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  SPD  CDU  FDP  FWG  Total - align=\\"center\\"  2009  13  5  3  1  22 seats - align=\\"center\\"  2004  12  6  2  2  22 seats } ‚ÄúFWG‚Äù is a voters‚Äô group. Mayor Waldmohr's mayor is Friedrich Wunn, and his deputies are Prof. Dr. J√ºrgen Schneider and Horst Reiser. All three represent the SPD.Waldmohr‚Äôs council Coat of arms The municipality's arms might be described thus: Per fess gules a lion rampant couped at the line of partition at the knees argent, and Or the letters W and M interlaced in pale sable. Until 1982, Waldmohr bore different, but nonetheless very similar, arms. The main difference was in the tinctures, whereas the charges were almost the same. The field tinctures were argent and sable (silver and black) while the lion, which was a demilion in the old arms (couped at the waist rather than the knees as in the newer arms), was azure armed and langued gules (blue, but with red claws and tongue) and the two interlaced letters were argent. Those arms had been approved in 1925, and the change was brought about after an expert opinion from Dr. Debus that cited the much longer time that Waldmohr had spent under the Counts of Homburg than under the Counts of Veldenz. Accordingly, the Veldenz lion was changed for the Homburg one. The lower field's tinctures represent the Palatine colours, and the two letters, W and M, may well be a municipal mark, for Waldmohr. In the 19th century, when a professor from Munich suggested using a Moor's head as a charge in the coat of arms, the municipal council was outraged and bluntly refused the suggestion. This would, of course, have made the arms canting, for the word used for this charge was Mohrenkopf (Kopf means ‚Äúhead‚Äù).Description and explanation of Waldmohr‚Äôs arms Town partnerships Waldmohr fosters partnerships with the following places:Partnership with Is-sur-Tille * Is-sur- Tille, C√¥te-d'Or (Burgundy), France since 3 April 2004 Culture and sightseeing Buildings Eichelscheiderhof 2‚Äì5: former Ducal Zweibr√ºcken stud farm, Eichelscheider Hof The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland-Palatinate‚Äôs Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Kusel district =Waldmohr (main centre)= * Protestant parish church, Bl√ºcherstra√üe 3 ‚Äì aisleless church, marked 1765, architect Philipp Heinrich Hellermann, Zweibr√ºcken, expansion 1903, tower, marked 1831, on Late Gothic ground floor; Stumm organ from 1861 * Bahnhofstra√üe 45 ‚Äì former post office; building with hipped roof, Swiss chalet style, 1926, architect Heinrich M√ºller, Speyer * Eichelscheiderstra√üe ‚Äì warriors‚Äô memorial 1914-1918 and 1939-1945, base by F.

Music Well known is the Westricher Madrigalchor (the Westrich is an historic region that encompasses areas in both Germany and France), a mixed choir that in 1998 sprang from the singing association (S√§ngervereinigung), under the direction of Thomas Gr√§ff. The Musikverein Waldmohr e.V. was founded, in its current form, on 8 October 1922. The first official mention of a ‚ÄúWaldmohr Music Club‚Äù was on the occasion of the fourth Palatine Music Festival (Pf√§lzisches Musikfest), which was held in Speyer in January 1830. Today, the Musikverein Waldmohr is made up of a youth wind orchestra and a saxophone quartet. Clubs Cultural life in Waldmohr is characterized by a very active and multifaceted branch location of the district folk high school, the S√§ngervereinigung 1872, the Catholic church choir, the Protestant singing circle, the Musikverein with its various music groups, the promotional circle for art, and various other sporting, social and community service clubs: * TV Waldmohr (sport club) * VfB Waldmohr (sport club) * HSV Waldmohr (sport club) * ASV Waldmohr (sport club) * Sch√ºtzenverein Waldmohr (shooting club) * Reit- und Fahrverein Waldmohr (equestrian club) * TC Waldmohr (tennis club) * Behinderten-Sportclub Waldmohr (disabled sports) * DLRG * Karateclub Waldmohr * Verein ‚ÄûDorf f√ºr Kinder‚Äú (‚ÄúVillage for Children‚Äù) * Pf√§lzerwaldverein Waldmohr (hiking) * Obst- und Gartenbauverein Waldmohr (gardening and fruitgrowing) * DRK (German Red Cross) * Pension√§rverein Waldmohr (pensioners‚Äô club) * Both churches, with their many bodies and groups * VdK (advocacy group) * Reservisten-Kameradschaft (military) * ‚ÄúKrea-Mief‚Äù theatre clubClubs Regular events Besides the various Shrovetide (Fastnacht) events held by some clubs, the dance in May, the Marketplace Festival, the kermis (church consecration festival), the Christmas Market, the D√∂rrbergfest and the Weiherfest held by the clubs and parties, there is hardly any upholding of old customs, unless the kindergartens‚Äô yearly Martinmas parades are counted (11 November). Also, on Epiphany, the Sternsinger go door-to-door. The primary school-Hauptschule choir actively participates in many municipal events.Regular events Natural monuments Within municipal limits lies the ‚ÄúBruchwiesen Waldmohr‚Äù recreation area, within which the river Glan has been renaturated. Regarded as a natural monument is the Heldenhain (‚ÄúHeroes‚Äô Grove‚Äù) with its stand of limetrees. The old oaktree standing on the north slope of the D√∂rrberg is considered worthy of protection and is to be incorporated into the municipal plan as such.Natural monuments Economy and infrastructure Agriculture In recent decades, the amount of land under agricultural use has been slowly but steadily shrinking with the decline of full-time and even part-time farming. More than half the agricultural land is still cropland. The greenbelt areas make up about 45% of it, and land used for special cultivation hardly 1%; these have no economic importance. Grain farming has been decreasing since 1971. Potato farming claims the lion's share of the cropland. Fodder farming has even grown, leading to growth in livestock rearing, too. Over the last few decades, cattle and swine have been growing in numbers, even though the odd farming operation has been given up. Woodland As mentioned above, Waldmohr had 563.9 ha of wooded land in 1990. This represents a gain of 5% over the total wooded land in 1970. Extensive common beech forests dominate, and only in the Eichelscheid area are spruce and pine the main trees. The woods on the D√∂rrberg and Eichelscheid in particular have a protective function, and a recreational function. The Schachenwald is set out as a recreational forest for seniors and also serves as a noise barrier and valuable stand of trees. Industry and employment Before industrialization, almost all the villagers worked as farmers, craftsmen, day labourers, tradesmen, forestry workers or bureaucrats. After the middle of the 19th century, many went to work at the ironworks in Homburg and Neunkirchen, and later to the mines on the Nordfeld, in Frankenholz and in Neunkirchen. With the coalmine shutdowns and the onset of the steel crisis in the 1960s, Waldmohr began with the laying out of a 70-hectare commercial- industrial park, bringing the village many new jobs; thus today, 2,700 workers earn their livelihoods here. Nevertheless, more and more people commute to jobs elsewhere. Waldmohr earns its living today mainly from industrial operations and craft businesses. It is the district's biggest industrial location. The biggest employer, with roughly 590 employees as of 2000, is the firm CS Schmal M√∂bel GmbH (furniture). Over the last few years, the firm Minitec, founded in 1986, has grown greatly. As of 2006, it has roughly 190 employees. The firm has at its disposal a patent for aluminium parts whereby drilling is no longer needed. Of the many small craft businesses of bygone days, little is left. The smith, the wainwright, the locksmith and cabinetmakers of all descriptions are no longer found in the village. There are, however, a shoemaker‚Äôs shop, a butcher‚Äôs shop, a bakery, a furrier‚Äôs shop, two roofing businesses, three barber/hairdresser‚Äôs shops, a carpentry business, a plasterer‚Äôs shop and two painting businesses, which can be described as ordinary craft businesses. Other businesses in Waldmohr are a wholesale bakery, five sanitary businesses, three electrical speciality shops, five automotive repair shops, three building companies, a sawmill, a sculpture studio, two tiler‚Äôs businesses, two craft metalworking shops and a wholesale metalworking business. Among other small and midsize businesses are a marble workshop, a printing shop, a furniture factory, a prefabricated building business and prefabricated cellar manufacturer, a drywall-making business and a window-making business. Since the introduction of the weekly market in 1993 ‚Äì market day is Saturday ‚Äì the market has been well received by the villagers. Moreover, the various flea markets and the Christmas market enjoy great popularity. Unfortunately, the Turnerjahrmarkt (‚ÄúGymnasts‚Äô Yearly Market‚Äù) has in recent years fallen by the wayside. In addition to Schmal's employment of 450 or so, a number of other companies are important employers. The firm Kampa, which makes high-quality prefabricated houses, currently employs 320 people at its Waldmohr works. Working at the firms Metronic and WIG von Gr√ºnenwald are 120 and 50 employees respectively. Stehma has a workforce of 75 building steel halls. A notary, two lawyers and several architectural offices have a great deal to do. Despite Waldmohr's emergent industry, 1,069 workers commute daily to the Saarland, 855 of them to Homburg alone. Commuting to Kaiserslautern and other workplaces in the Palatinate are 362 workers. On the other hand, there is also a daily inflow of commuters, 384 of whom come from the Saarland, 528 from other places in the Kusel district and 64 from elsewhere in the Palatinate. There has been an upward trend in inbound commuters in recent years. Public institutions Waldmohr is home to the administration of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde. Education It was in 1564, in a Visitation report by the clergyman, that a school in the village was first mentioned, but apparently, it did not have its own building. Such a thing as a schoolhouse in Waldmohr was not mentioned until 1605. A 1613 report said that nobody in the village could read or write. Learning was not very efficient, and hence only met with slight success. The teachers were so poorly paid that they often had to put up with hunger. A teacher's wages were first mentioned in 1589. The teacher at the Reformed school received 4 Malter of grain and 8 Gulden in gold from the church treasury, and from the municipality 2 Malter of grain for ringing the bells. In 1596, the then schoolteacher received a small amount of land for the schoolyard as remuneration. Nevertheless, no teacher ever stayed very long before seeking a better paying job. After the Thirty Years' War, the historical record tells of a school in Waldmohr once again in 1659, eleven years after the war had ended. Employment there was, however, apparently no better after all those years, for the teachers were still changing so often that the post was often left unfilled. Only in 1728 was this pattern broken, when schoolteacher Schwartz from Quirnbach came to Waldmohr and stayed until his death in 1761. In the earlier half of the 18th century, the Lutherans and the Catholics likewise each had their own school. Attending the Reformed school in 1783 were 79 pupils, while in 1809, the Lutheran school had 25. The earliest figures for the Catholic school come from 1825, when it had 25 pupils. All together, there were 256 schoolchildren attending the village's schools that year, leading the government to institute a third teaching post (by this time, there was Lutheran-Reformed unity). It was for the Catholic school. The Catholic teacher's yearly salary was 200 Gulden. The Protestant teachers were paid 450 Gulden; this was not all in cash, however. It was made up of a dwelling, a garden, a hillside plot, 2 Morgen of meadowland, 6 hL of grain, 3 klafters of wood, from each of 120 households 1 barrel of grain, from each of 160 schoolchildren 1 Gulden in cash from the church treasury, the municipal coffer and special ecclesiastical events. The recompense was also split between two teachers. The head teacher got 250 Gulden with the remaining 200 Gulden going to his assistant. In 1862, teachers‚Äô salaries were reformed and payments in kind were dropped. In 1870, a continuation school (Fortbildungsschule) was established whose classes ran from November to early February each year. At this time, the municipality had three schools, two Protestant and one Catholic. With the establishment of the communal Christian school in 1877, teachers‚Äô salaries were reformed yet again. Under the new terms (1878), each member of the teaching staff received 897.38 marks. In 1901, superannuation payments were specially introduced, and teachers‚Äô pay was in 1905 raised to 1,500 marks. The Fortbildungsschule, which had long been run as a Sunday school (inasmuch as classes were held on Sunday; it was not religious), became a Wednesday afternoon school beginning in 1906. In 1935, the eighth school year was introduced, in 1966/1967 the ninth and in 1991/1992 the tenth.Education The Rothenfeldschule is a combined primary school and Regionale Schule with the tenth class. Since the 2007/2008 school year it has been the only school in Rhineland-Palatinate to offer year-round daycare. Public utilities On Breitenbacher Stra√üe stands a modern electrical substation owned by Pfalzwerke, which ensures the electrical supply for both home and industry. Waldmohr manages to do without any partnerships to ensure its water supply, having its own deep wells, pumphouses and cisterns. A sewage treatment plant costing 10,000,000 DM (about ‚Ç¨5,113,000), built to handle a capacity of 10,000 inhabitants, has been brought into service and uses the most modern wastewater treatment. The whole village is supplied with both electricity and natural gas. At the turn of the 20th century, the village even owned its own gasworks, although this was shut down in the First World War owing to unprofitability. Transport Saarpfalzstra√üe, which was built as a relief and bypass road for the former Hauptstra√üe (now Rathausstra√üe), is now the main road within the municipality, and as Bundesstra√üe 423 also the most important road for through traffic. Also particularly busy within the municipality are Landesstra√üe 354, leading to the commercial-industrial park and, by way of Landesstra√üe 355, to interchange 50 on the Autobahn A 6 (Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMannheim) ‚Äì sometimes called Via Carolina ‚Äì and the Waldmohr service centre with its motel, and Kreisstra√üe (District Road) 3 from the village centre to H√∂chen and Bexbach. Also heavily frequented are Bahnhofstra√üe and Rathausstra√üe. As early as 1985, the daily number of vehicles at the edge of the village going towards K√ºbelberg reached 4,852, and at the edge of the village going towards J√§gersburg, it reached 5,505. The Autobahn links Waldmohr not only to the national road network, but also to France and the Czech Republic. The Nordfeldbahn (railway) was built in 1903. The railway line from Homburg to Bad M√ºnster, dedicated in 1904, was closed in 1981. The last passenger train was a three-unit railbus that with the end of the 1980-1981 winter timetable did its last run between Glan-M√ºnchweiler and Homburg on 30 May 1981 ‚Äì complete with a bunch of gorse fastened onto the front. In 1990, the tracks were torn up and in 1993, the bridge across Landesstra√üe 354 was torn down, leaving only an industrial spur between the Waldmohr commercial-industrial park and Homburg.Transport Public transport is integrated into the VRN. The Glantalbahn (railway), which once ran through Waldmohr, is no longer used along this stretch of the right-of-way. The nearest line is now the Saarbr√ºcken-Heidelberg line, which runs some 6 km south of Waldmohr.

First flying in 1917, it was designed as a two-seat trainer for the United States Army, then adopted by the United States Navy as its first fighter aircraft. In 1922, a VE-7 became the first airplane to take off from an American aircraft carrier.[Lloyd S. Jones, U.S. Naval Fighters (Fallbrook CA: Aero Publishers, 1977, ), pp. 11-13] Design and development The Lewis & Vought Corporation was formed just months after the U.S. entered World War I, with the intention of servicing war needs. The company's trainer was patterned after successful European designs; for instance, the engine was a Wright Hispano Suiza of the type used by the French Spads. In practice, the VE-7's performance was much better than usual for a trainer, and the Army ordered 1,000 of an improved design called the VE-8. However, the contract was cancelled due to the end of the war. However, the Navy was very interested in the VE-7, and received the first machine in May 1920. Production orders soon followed, and in accordance to Navy policy at the time, examples were also built by the Naval Aircraft Factory. In all, 128 VE-7s were built. Vought VE-7 - McCook Field, Ohio 1917 The fighter version of the VE-7 was designated VE-7S. It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a Vickers machine gun mounted over it on the left side and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had flotation gear consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when ditching at sea. The Bluebird won the 1918 Army competition for advanced training machines.Janes Fighting Aircraft of World War I by Michael John Haddrick Taylor (Random House Group Ltd. 20 Vauxhall Bridge Road, London SW1V 2SA, 2001, ), page 252. The VE-8 variant completed in July 1919 had a 340hp Wright-Hispano H engine, reduced overall dimensions, increased wing area, a shorter faired cabane, and two Vickers guns. Two were completed. Flight test results were disappointing, the aircraft was overweight, with heavy controls, inadequate stability and sluggish performance.The Complete Book of Fighters cover Editors: William Green & Gordon Swanborough (Barnes & Noble Books New York, 1998, ), pp. 336-337 The VE-9 variant, first delivered to the Navy on 24 June 1922, was essentially an improved VE-7, with most of the improvements in the fuel system area. Four of the 21 ordered by the U.S. Navy were unarmed observation float seaplanes for battleship catapult use. Operational history USS Langley, 1922. Note the Landing Signal Officer. The VE-7s equipped the Navy's first two fighter squadrons VF-1 and VF-2. A VE-7 flown by Lieutenant Virgil C. Griffin made history on October 17, 1922 when it took off from the deck of the newly commissioned carrier . The VE-7s were the Navy's frontline fighters for several years, with three still assigned to the Langley in 1927; all were retired the following year.

It rises in Lough Finn in County Donegal and flows east through a deep mountain valley to Ballybofey and Stranorlar (on opposite sides of the river) and on to the confluence with the River Mourne at Lifford. The Monellan Burn flows into the River Finn very near a hamlet called The Cross, not far from the former site of Monellan Castle, just outside Killygordon.Ballybofey, Stranorlar and District Historical Society: Monellan Castle. https://www.finnvalleyhistory.com/monellan-castle/ From Castlefin downstream, the river is tidal, becoming deeper towards Strabane. The Finn is long and together with its tributary the Reelin River, drains a catchment area of 195 square miles. The River Foyle is formed by the confluence of the River Mourne and the River Finn, west of Lifford Bridge. The area which the River Finn flows through is called the Finn Valley. The village of Clady, near Strabane in County Tyrone, is on the River Finn. The football club in Ballybofey, Finn Harps, is named after the river.http://waterlevel.ie/hydro-data/search.html?free=finn# Angling The upper reaches of the Reelin and the Finn are fast downstream to Ballybofey and can give excellent fishing. From Ballybofey downstream the river becomes deeper and slower. In all there is more than of salmon fishing on the river from Flushtown right up to Bellanmore Bridge and part of the Reelan too. There is good sea trout fishing at Liscooley and Killygordan and from Ballybofey to Bellanamore Bridge. The Finn and its tributary the Reelan are probably the most prolific salmon and grilse rivers in Donegal and indeed throughout the Foyle catchment. Fish species such as roach, perch, eels and brown trout are caught in the Finn system. Area of special scientific interest The River Foyle and tributaries Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) include the River Foyle and its tributaries i.e. that part of the River Finn which is within Northern Ireland, the River Mourne and its tributary the River Strule (up to its confluence with the Owenkillew River) and the River Derg, along with two of its sub-tributaries, the Mourne Beg River and the Glendergan River. The area encompasses 120 km of watercourse and is notable for the physical diversity and naturalness of the banks and channels, especially in the upper reaches, and the richness and naturalness of its plant and animal communities. Of particular importance is the population of Atlantic Salmon, which is one of the largest in Europe. Research has indicated that each sub- catchment within the system supports genetically distinct populations.

Early life Sauvage grew up in the mining community of Penrhos, Rhosllannerchrugog, Wales, the son of Thomas and Mary Savage of The Square. Before he was nine years old, he began working in one of the local collieries, the Brandie Pit No. 6 at Ruabon, working twelve-hour days. His musical talents appeared at an early age and as a child his voice was highly appreciated in local concerts and eisteddfodau, and he sang alto in the choir at the Calvinistic Methodist Capel Mawr (literally \\"Big Chapel\\") in Rhos. At the age of eighteen, he left to seek work in the coalfields of Ohio in the United States with several other young men from Rhos. A few years later, in the town of Jackson, Ohio, he met Lewis William Lewis (known by his bardic name of 'Llew Llwyfo') of Penysarn, Llanwenllwyfo, Anglesey, Wales. Lewis was touring the Welsh communities of the US with a concert party he had brought over from Wales. Llew Llwyfo managed to persuade James Savage to give up his job in the mines and join the concert party, a decision which changed the course of his life. Musical career On returning to Wales, Sauvage began to make a name for himself in the musical world, and was frequently called upon to perform at the National Eisteddfod. He later gained a place at the Royal Academy of Music, London, England and in two years, the shortest time in record there for a student, won the bronze, silver, and gold medals. He was later elected associate of the institution and soon after became a Fellow of the Royal Academy. Although he started his singing career as a tenor he later developed as a world-famous baritone. He was widely known as an operatic singer, and for a number of years was a member of the Carl Rosa Opera Company, and his repertoire included the standard English, French and Italian works. Sauvage continued to make regular visits to the United States and eventually the family settled there in Lincoln Park, Newark, New Jersey. James took up the position of Director of Music at the Peddie Memorial Church in Newark and later was appointed Professor of Singing at Vassar College in New York. James Sauvage eventually became a naturalised United States citizen. Every summer James made an annual 'pilgrimage' back to Rhosllannerchrugog, travelling in some style between New York and Liverpool on the best of the Cunard Line liners. He made his last visit to Rhos in the summer of 1922. Death and legacy Professor James Sauvage died in Newark, New Jersey at the age of 73. David Lloyd George, who later became British Prime Minister, wrote of James Sauvage: > About thirty five year ago he was the principal vocalist in the Criccieth > Eisteddfod. After having charmed the thousands who came to listen to him > from the hills and valleys, he came home with me for a cup of tea. When he > learned that my mother could not attend the eisteddfod, owing to ill health, > he sang to her all of his programme of songs and encores, with the same > vigour and enthusiasm that he displayed in singing to the thousands. What > pleasure this gave to my dear old mother. Ever since, there has been a warm > spot in my heart for the famous musician. Personal life James Savage married Eleanor Lewis, the daughter of his mentor Llew Llwyfo, on 11 December 1871 at St. Louis, Missouri. They had six children. Their first child Lillian was born in St. Louis in 1872. Their second child Thomas (always to be known as 'Tonzo') was born in Rhyl, Wales in 1874 and in 1898 married Elsie Peddie in Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of Republican politician Thomas Baldwin Peddie. Their third child, Vilda, was born in Aberystwyth, Wales in 1875 while James was studying at Aberystwyth University. James and Eleanor's fourth child, Mary Blodwen, was born in Fulham, London, England in 1877. They had two more children, Louis Idris born in Hammersmith, London, England in 1885 and James Elwyn born in 1890 in Newark, New Jersey.

Before 1 July 2014 it was the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde, since then it is part of the Verbandsgemeinde Lauterecken-Wolfstein. Wolfstein is known for its two castle ruins, Neu-Wolfstein standing over the heart of the town, and Alt-Wolfstein standing at the narrowest spot in the Lauter valley at the town's northern entrance. Wolfstein is a state-recognized recreational resort (Erholungsort).Ruins and resort Geography Location The town lies in the North Palatine Uplands, in the so-called K√∂nigsland (‚ÄúKingsland‚Äù), between Idar-Oberstein and Kaiserslautern. The municipal area measures 1 377 ha, of which 644 ha is wooded. Also, 154 ha is given over to residential properties and transport facilities, 574 ha to agriculture and 5 ha is taken up by other uses and open water. Geographically, the municipal area belongs to the Glan-Alsenz mountain and hill country, which meets the Kaiserslauterer Senke (a depression) to the north. The town centre lies in the Lauter valley, cut narrowly into the land, between the steep slopes on either side of the Lauter, the K√∂nigsberg on the left bank and the Eisenknopf on the right. The K√∂nigsberg (not to be confused with the former East Prussian city) is the town's highest point at 568.4 m above sea level. Other selected elevations are as follows: * Lang-Heck (Ro√übach) ‚Äî 404.1 m * Neu-Wolfstein castle ruin ‚Äî 238 m * Stahlhausen valley floor (southern town limit) ‚Äî 196 m * Wolfstein railway station ‚Äî 187.9 mLocation The town lies roughly 23 km northeast of Kusel, and 20 km northwest of Kaiserslautern. Neighbouring municipalities Wolfstein borders in the north on the municipalities of Lohnweiler and Heinzenhausen, in the northeast on the municipalities of Oberweiler-Tiefenbach and Ein√∂llen, in the east on the municipality of Relsberg, in the southeast on the municipality of Niederkirchen, in the south on the municipality of Kreimbach-Kaulbach, in the southwest on the municipality of Rutsweiler an der Lauter and in the west on the municipality of Aschbach. Wolfstein also meets the municipalities of Hohen√∂llen, E√üweiler and Offenbach-Hundheim at single points in the northeast, southwest and northwest respectively. Constituent communities Wolfstein's Stadtteile are the main townsite, also called Wolfstein (1,792), Ro√übach (178) and Reckweilerhof (11). The figures are populations as at 2007.Constituent communities Town‚Äôs layout Until 1905, the town's municipal area was limited to the area on the Lauter's left bank between Rutsweiler to the south, Lohnweiler to the north and Aschbach to the west. According to the original Bavarian cadastral survey (about 1840), Wolfstein's area measured 616 ha. In the 174 houses at that time lived 826 persons. Spreading out from the old town (known as the Flecken, meaning ‚Äúmarket town‚Äù) in the hollow, the settled parts of town lay in the 19th century on the slopes between the Tauchental (dale) and Schlossgasse (or Obergasse ‚Äì a lane), on the narrow strips of land either side of Lauterstra√üe (or Untergasse) and on Hauptstra√üe (‚ÄúMain Street‚Äù, but in an outlying neighbourhood). Worth mentioning are several old buildings in Wolfstein: the Evangelical church (1868, beside the town hall), the Catholic rectory (1845, outside town centre), the Evangelical rectory (1899, outside town centre), the court and prison building (1902/1903, outside town centre) and the former Kurhaus Lautertal (spa hotel, 1862, renovated in 1912, outside town centre). With the expansion of Wolfstein's inhabited area, the old town's girding, mediaeval wall, which still stood in the early 19th century, had gaps knocked through it and eventually, along with both the town gates and the B√ºrgerturm (tower), it was torn down altogether. It was not possible to expand Wolfstein onto lands over on the Lauter's right bank, for stretching for roughly 4 km between Kreimbach and Oberweiler was the village of Ro√übach with, as it had then, its five Ortsteile: Stahlhausen, Ro√übach (main centre), M√ºhle, Immetshausen and Kuhbr√ºcker H√ºbel. The gap between Stahlhausen and the upper village, and the one between Immetshausen and Kuhbr√ºcke, were used for farming. Any building work worthy of note within Ro√übach's limits was never to be seen even as late as 1969. The number of houses there, beginning in 1900, hovered around 100. In 1905, the Bavarian State Government ‚Äì the Palatinate had belonged to the Kingdom of Bavaria since the Congress of Vienna ‚Äì ordered the cession of the Kuhbr√ºcker H√ºbel, with its railway station, seven houses on the slope side of Bahnhofsstra√üe (‚ÄúStation Street‚Äù), seven others on Hefersweilerstra√üe, a few storage sheds next to the railway and the storehouse of the Consumvereine (‚Äúco√∂peratives‚Äù), to the town of Wolfstein. The decisive factor in favour of the amalgamation of this strip of land on both sides of the railway line, which had been opened in 1883, was economic considerations. For the goal of expanding the town's residential area, however, it was quite useless, for the slopes east of the ceded area on the valley floor still belonged to Ro√übach. Thus, until the village of Ro√übach in der Pfalz along with all its Ortsteile was merged into the town of Wolfstein in 1969, the town's foremost new building area remained the steep slope stretching up the K√∂nigsberg west of Hauptstra√üe (Bundesstra√üe 270), even after the Second World War (R√∂ther Weg, Steinwiesen, Am Hang, Am Gericht, In der Trift, Bergstra√üe, Am Kirchpfad). Even this was hemmed in somewhat by the galleries at the chalk mine. Beginning in 1970, work shifted to what had until recently been a self-administering, neighbouring village, and building began in Ro√übach on formerly agricultural lands east of the railway line between Sandfeld (Immetshausen) and Eisenknopf (Schlettweg, Barbarossastra√üe, Habsburgerstra√üe, Kurpfalzstra√üe, Stauferstra√üe, Wingerstbergstra√üe, Hahnbach and Sandfeld). By 2000, 78 residential buildings had arisen here, mostly one- and two-family houses. The amalgamation increased Wolfstein's area by 616 ha to 1 377 ha.Town‚Äôs layout Climate Yearly precipitation in Wolfstein amounts to 729 mm, which falls into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 46% of the German Weather Service's weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in June. In that month, precipitation is 1.4 times what it is in April. Precipitation varies only slightly and is spread extremely evenly over the year. Only at 1% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded. History Antiquity Archaeological finds from both the Old Stone Age and the New Stone Age on the K√∂nigsberg's and the Selberg's west flank, barrows in the Jungenwald (forest) at the town limits with Aschbach and Lohnweiler that have been explored and many finds of Roman coins with effigies of Roman emperors at the old Celtic settlement, which was once surrounded by a ringwall, on the Kreimberg at the town limit with Kreimbach-Kaulbach (known as the Heidenburg, or ‚ÄúHeathen Castle‚Äù) bear witness to the presence of people in what is now Wolfstein in prehistoric times and early historic times. Leading over the ridge of the K√∂nigsberg was the ‚ÄúRoman road‚Äù, one of the Palatinate's oldest settlement roads. Nevertheless, there was never any Roman settlement within what are now Wolfstein's limits.Antiquity Middle Ages Until 1768, the river Lauter was a border, cleaving today's unified town into the town of Wolfstein on the one side, which was held by Electoral Palatinate, and the village of Ro√übach on the other, which lay within territory held by the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken. The Reckweilerhof belonged as an either Ducal or Electoral fief to the holdings of the Offenbach am Glan Benedictine Monastery. These three centres, therefore, did not share a common history until that date, and accordingly, they are treated separately for the time up to the 18th century. =Wolfstein= Wolfstein was founded in 1275 on Habsburg King Rudolph I's orders, which called for a ‚Äúfortified and free‚Äù town near his castle, ‚ÄúWoluisstein‚Äù, now known as the Alt-Wolfstein (‚ÄúOld Wolfstein‚Äù) ruin. Rudolph forthwith granted the new town the same town rights and freedoms as the town of Speyer. As an ‚Äúeverlasting marketplace‚Äù, it was to be a sanctuary for commerce, trade and dealing. The first townsmen and -women came from the surrounding, much older villages. Only for a few decades did the new town enjoy royal immediacy, whereafter it was passed time and again to and from various territorial lordships as a pledged holding. The almost endless chain of pledgings began as early as 1312 with the town's transfer to the Counts of Sponheim, and only ended in 1673 when the town passed to Electoral Palatinate. The Electoral Palatinate Amt (or Unteramt) of Wolfstein in the Oberamt of Kaiserslautern comprised the two court regions of Katzweiler and ‚ÄúRothe am Seelberg‚Äù (Rothselberg).Wolfstein‚Äôs mediaeval history =Ro√übach= The landholders in the Middle Ages (beginning in the 12th century) were the Counts of Veldenz. Far away from their small seat on the Moselle (Veldenz Castle), they owned considerable lands between the Alsenz, the Glan and the Nahe, among which was Honhelden daz ampt (1387), within which lay the settlements in question. Sometime about the middle of the 16th century, the Schulthei√ü‚Äôs seat was moved to Ein√∂llen. In the early 15th century, the Count‚Äôs only daughter (and indeed, only child) and sole heir wed Count Palatine Stephan of Zweibr√ºcken from the House of Wittelsbach. After her father‚Äôs death in 1444, the now defunct (for a woman could not inherit the comital title, and there was no male heir) County of Veldenz passed by inheritance to her son, Ludwig I, who now bore the title Duke of Veldenz-Zweibr√ºcken, thereby ushering in a long time of political stability for Ro√übach. The village was spared the repeated transfers and pledgings that characterized the neighbouring town‚Äôs history at this time.Ro√übach‚Äôs mediaeval history =Reckweilerhof= Throughout the Middle Ages up until the beginning of the 19th century, noble feudal lords granted their vassals this estate for hereditary and proprietary use. The landholders at first were the Waldgraves and Raugraves of Grumbach, then the Counts of Veldenz (1387), and lastly, beginning in 1444, the Dukes of Palatinate-Zweibr√ºcken, who were at the same time the guardians and patrons of all holdings belonging to the Offenbach Monastery, and (beginning in 1733) the Electors of the Palatinate. The estate holders‚Äô names from 1514 are known without any gaps in the record. They discharged their hereditary pledge to the monastery, receiving as a reward usage and grazing rights in the ‚Äúlordly monastery woodlands‚Äù, ‚Äúfree lumber and firewood‚Äù, the ‚Äúsheep meadow on the estate‚Äôs area as well as the municipal area of the market town of Wolfstein with its own herd of maximally 200 head‚Äù (1786).The Reckweilerhof‚Äôs mediaeval history Modern times =Wolfstein= The Amtskellerei, whose mostly noble Amtskeller were charged with executing princely orders, was to be found at Neu-Wolfstein Castle, and after that was destroyed in 1688 by King Louis XIV‚Äôs troops in the Nine Years' War (known in Germany as the Pf√§lzischer Erbfolgekrieg, or War of the Palatine Succession), at a small house beside the old town hall at the foot of the Schlossberg; beginning in 1753 it was at the great building before the outer town gate (today the town hall) built on Elector Karl Theodor‚Äôs (1742-1799) orders from Amtsgef√§llen ‚Äì Amt taxes. By territorial swap between the Elector and the Duke of Zweibr√ºcken in 1768, the places within the Schulthei√üerei of Ein√∂llen (Ein√∂llen, Hohen√∂llen, Tiefenbach, Oberweiler, Ro√übach and Sulzhof) passed to Electoral Palatinate and were assigned to the Amt of Wolfstein. The town‚Äôs days as an Electoral Palatinate holding came to an end when French Revolutionary troops occupied the lands on the Rhine‚Äôs left bank, including the town itself; by 1801, this territory had been annexed under the terms of the Treaty of Lun√©ville by the soon to be Napoleonic France. As early as 1797, Wolfstein became, in the course of administrative reform carried out by the French, a cantonal seat in the Arrondissement of Kaiserslautern and the Department of Mont-Tonnerre (or Donnersberg in German). Belonging to the canton were 32 municipalities with 8 mayors and roughly 8,000 inhabitants. The Mairie (‚ÄúMayoralty‚Äù) of Wolfstein comprised four municipalities with roughly 1,300 inhabitants; in the town itself lived 37 families and 311 persons. In 1814, the French withdrew from the Canton of Wolfstein.Wolfstein‚Äôs early modern history =Ro√übach= From 1444 to 1768, the villagers of Ro√übach were Ducal-Zweibr√ºcken subjects. From this epoch, only a few noteworthy events are recorded: The Ro√übacher Weistum (1544 ‚Äì a Weistum ‚Äì cognate with English wisdom ‚Äì was a legal pronouncement issued by men learned in law in the Middle Ages and early modern times) reported about yearly meetings of the Gemeinsmannen resident in Ro√übach, Imzmann√ühausen (about 1250: Ziermannshusen; today: Immetshausen), Melhausen (since vanished), Stohlhaussen (today: Stahlhausen) on Saint Dionysius‚Äôs Day (9 October) on the ‚ÄúDionysiusberg (mountain) near the chapel to the saint, Dionysius‚Äù (today: Auf dem M√ºhlacker). The small house of worship was a chapel of ease in the parish of Tiefenbach, which found itself in the hands of the Order of Saint John from the early 15th century until the Reformation as a donation from the Counts of Veldenz. As early as 1528, Tiefenbach became a Reformed parish. The chapel was used into the 18th century for church services by Reformed worshippers, then also by Lutherans and Catholics. It was torn down in the 19th century, although the surrounding graveyard was still used as such until 1902. In the early 1930s, it was levelled during the building of the memorial square. The M√ºhlarzt (‚Äúmill doctor‚Äù) Adam Silberw√§scher from Baumholder built a gristmill with a millrace in 1604 on a ‚Äúlittle stream up from the village called Ro√übach‚Äù; it was the first mill recorded in Ro√übach. It was, however, destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. In 1695, Johannes Schwammbacher built a new gristmill downstream from Ro√übach on the Lauter, ‚Äúwhere none has ever stood before‚Äù. A new centre sprang up around the mill, Bei der Ro√übacher M√ºhle (today: ‚ÄúIn M√ºhlhausen‚Äù or ‚ÄúIn der Hohl‚Äù). Duke Christian IV of Zweibr√ºcken transferred to Elector Palatine Karl Theodor the Schulthei√üerei of Ein√∂llen. Five little villages were incorporated into the Unteramt of Wolfstein. The municipality of Ro√übach comprised at this time 1,125 Morgen of cropland, 57 Morgen of meadows, 33 Morgen of vineyards, 10 Morgen of gardens and 137 Morgen of forest. Living in the village were 222 people. There were 42 houses, 1 church and 2 schools.Ro√übach‚Äôs early modern history =Reckweilerhof= From 1644 to 1788, the estate was run as an hereditary tenancy by the Amtsschulthei√ü at Odenbach am Glan and his heirs. After feudalism was abolished, the Ducal W√ºrttemberg Minister of State Emich Johann von √úxk√ºll bought the estate for 22,500 Gulden. He let the estate in 1796 to Christoph Burckhardt, who transferred the running of the estate to his son Ludwig Karl Friedrich (born 1779). In 1817, Ludwig Burckhardt bought the estate, and ever since, it has been in the family Burckhardt‚Äôs ownership. Even today, Ludwig Burchhardt‚Äôs descendants, through his son Heinrich, still run the Hotel Reckweilerhof. These statistics about the Reckweilerhof in the time just before the French Revolution are drawn from the 1786 G√ºterbestandsaufnahme (‚ÄúEstate Inventory Record‚Äù): Two-floor manor house; on 1st floor dwelling for ‚Äúestate people‚Äù, on upper floor a spacious dwelling for the ‚Äúlord of the manor‚Äù, three cattle stables, sheepcote for 300 head, a special dwelling for the shepherd, all together and under one roof; then barn, winepress house, vaulted cellar, herdsman‚Äôs house, bakehouse and 8 great pigsties; a well laid out seedling nursery.‚Äî52 Morgen of meadows, 4 Morgen of vineyards, 474 Morgen of cropfields and 19 Morgen of grazing fields. Estimated worth 22,000 Gulden.The Reckweilerhof‚Äôs early modern history =Recent times= Kingdom of Bavaria times After the new post-Napoleonic order imposed by the Congress of Vienna in 1814, Wolfsteiners became Bavarian nationals, which until 1918 meant the Bavarian king‚Äôs subjects; after monarchy was overthrown in 1918, they belonged to the Free State of Bavaria in the days of the Weimar Republic. Only in 1947, after the Second World War, did the Palatinate formally cease to be a Bavarian exclave, whereupon it was incorporated into the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The break with Bavaria was confirmed by referendum on 22 April 1956. In the ‚ÄúBavarian Rhine District‚Äù (Bayerischer Rheinkreis ‚Äì that is, the Bavarian Palatinate), Wolfstein was grouped into the Landkommissariat of Kusel (from 1862 Bezirksamt and from 1939 Landratsamt). To the Canton of Wolfstein in 1817 belonged 33 municipalities. The B√ºrgermeisterei (‚Äúmayoralty‚Äù) comprised the town with the Reckweilerhof, the municipalities of Ein√∂llen (until 1900) and Ro√übach (until 1905). From 1814 to 1832, the town administration was led by the physician Wilhelm Vogt as Oberb√ºrgermeister. After the 1849 Palatine Uprising, many people from the town emigrated to the United States. In connection with the 1832 Hambach Festival and the later Palatine Uprising, there is a story: On the republican-liberal citizenry‚Äôs side was the 23-year- old tanner‚Äôs son Jakob Krieger, who fled to the United States, where he founded a trade and banking company in Louisville. His daughter Amy married the Wolfstein banker Karl Otto Braun. On the other side was the State Procurator General at the court of appeal in Zweibr√ºcken, Wolfstein-born Ludwig Schmitt, Heidelberger Romantik painter Georg Philipp Schmitt‚Äôs brother, and also Jakob Krieger‚Äôs cousin. Schmitt led the prosecution of the trials against the insurrectionists. In 1852, the cantons were changed into district municipalities (Distriktgemeinden). On the district councils ‚Äì 30 municipalities belonged to the Wolfstein district (Distrikt Wolfstein) ‚Äì farmers held the majority, as the voting rather favoured those who were most heavily taxed. Of the 43 councillors in the Wolfstein district, 35 were farmers. Monarchy came to an end in Bavaria with the last Bavarian king‚Äôs abdication in 1918 (he had reigned since 1913), after the First World War, in which 35 soldiers from Wolfstein and 19 from Ro√übach fell.Kingdom of Bavaria times Weimar Republic and Third Reich (1919-1945) At the elections for the Weimar National Assembly and the Bavarian Landtag, the Social Democrats (SPD) earned roughly 34% of the vote in Wolfstein, about the same as the German Democratic Party (DDP), while the German People's Party (DVP) earned about 23% and the Bavarian People's Party (BVP) about 9% of the votes cast. By the time of the Reichstag elections in 1924, though, the SPD‚Äôs share of the vote had sunk to 9%, while the Nationale Rechte earned 34%, the Communists (KPD) 4%, the V√∂lkischer Block 30%, the BVP 12% and the Freiwirtschaftsbund 11%. The 1930 Reichstag elections brought the ‚ÄúHitler Movement‚Äù (NSDAP) 54% in Wolfstein (279 votes), the SPD 13% (68 votes), the Centre Party 4% (25 votes), the KPD 3% (18 votes), the DVP 4% (21 votes), the Wirtschaftspartei 15% (78 votes) and splinter parties 6% (27 votes). At the first town council election after the Nazis seized power in Germany (21 April 1933), the NSDAP won 8 of the 10 seats, and in the same year, town council bestowed honorary citizenship upon President Paul von Hindenburg, Reichskanzler ‚Äì he did not yet bear the title F√ºhrer ‚Äì Adolf Hitler and Reichsstatthalter Franz Ritter von Epp; the same honour was awarded to the local poet Pauline K√∂nig. On the Ro√übach municipal council, too, the Nazis won a majority. Public servants such as police officials, municipal officials, field and forest rangers and the chief of waterworks were replaced with men who were true to the National Socialist ideology. The Party and its many organizations more and more came to define the town‚Äôs economic and cultural life. Thus, in 1933, the local singing clubs were merged into the ‚ÄúWestmark‚Äù singers‚Äô association, the chamber of commerce, which had been founded in 1899, was dissolved in 1934 ‚Äúunder approval of all present‚Äù and the local Jugendleite (secular coming-of-age ceremony) was held on Confirmation Day, causing 189 people to leave their religious community. The town, which 100 years earlier had been associated with the struggle for democracy, was now welcoming, with a majority among its population, Nazi dictatorship. Once the Nazis‚Äô goals had become manifest, however, it was too late to turn back. Wolfstein was largely spared any material destruction in the Second World War; however, the human toll was quite heavy: on Wolfstein‚Äôs war memorial to the fallen, built in 1930 at Neu-Wolfstein castle, a further 100 names now had to be chiselled; over in Ro√übach, the 1931 war memorial bore 44 new names after the war.Weimar Republic and Third Reich Since 1945 Beginning in 1947, Wolfstein was part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland- Palatinate. On 7 June 1969, the until then self-administering municipality of Ro√übach in der Pfalz was merged into the town of Wolfstein.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis 2006, Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz , Seite 201 (PDF) Since 1971, the town has been the administrative seat of the Verbandsgemeinde of Wolfstein. Population development Living in Wolfstein about 1600, according to the townsmen‚Äôs register in the Stattbuch (‚Äútown book‚Äù), which was begun in 1599, were some 150 people in 36 households. In 1618, there were 50 families with some 200 persons, but this is estimated to have dropped to only 50 inhabitants by the time the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) ended. The 1618 population level was once again reached in 1684. Thereafter, the population figures kept rising. No records of Ro√übach's population from the 17th century are available. In 1885 ‚Äì only ‚Äúpresent‚Äù persons were counted, while soldiers and the wandering musicians for which the region was then famous were left out of the total ‚Äì there were 471 inhabitants (95 houses, no rented dwellings, no multi-family houses with separated living areas; occupancy per dwelling 4.95 persons). In 1900, there were 577 inhabitants (Kuhbr√ºcke 78, Immetshausen 55, Ro√übach main centre 381, Stahlhausen 63). In 1905, after the Kuhbr√ºcke had been transferred to Wolfstein, there were 489 inhabitants. In 1918 there were 466 in 100 dwellings. In 1925, there were 504 in 98 houses. In 1933, there were 483 and in 1939, 515 (263 male and 252 female). In 1969, just before amalgamation with Wolfstein, there were 541 inhabitants. The following table shows population development over the centuries for Wolfstein, with some figures broken down by religious denomination:population development { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" width=\\"500\\" - bgcolor=\\"#eeeeee\\" align=\\"center\\"  Year  1787  1826  1850  1867  1900  1939  1969  1969  1975 - align=\\"center\\"  Total  486  788  900  1,128  1,691  1,564  1,667  2,208  2,346 - align=\\"center\\"  Catholic  95  130 - align=\\"center\\"  Evangelical  693  997 - align=\\"center\\"  Mennonite  ‚Äì  1 } The two separate figures for 1969 indicate numbers before and after Ro√übach's amalgamation.

Also, in the local dialectal speech, the town is called Wolschde. The name ‚ÄúRo√übach‚Äù has likewise undergone spelling changes: Ruosbach (1024), Ro√übach or Ruspach (1544), Ro√übach (1558). In the local dialectal speech, the village is called Roschbach. The name ‚ÄúReckweilerhof‚Äù has undergone some more pronounced changes: Regewilre (1200), Reckweiler (1509), R√∂gswiller or R√∂chswiller (1600), Reckweylerhof (1777/1778), R√∂ckweilerhof (1917) and now Reckweilerhof, or in the local dialectal speech, Reckwillerhof.Town‚Äôs name Religion Before the Reformation, Wolfstein belonged to the parish of Zweikirchen, whereas Ro√übach belonged to the parish of Tiefenbach. Only about the middle of the 15th century did Wolfstein get its own church in the town centre (on Wassergasse). This church, called St. Georg (‚ÄúSaint George‚Äôs‚Äù), was the successor to the like-named chapel at Neu-Wolfstein Castle, where church services had been held until then. As early as 1528, Tiefenbach became a Reformed parish with chapels of ease in Ro√übach and Ein√∂llen. After the rectory in Tiefenbach was destroyed, the parish seat was moved to Ein√∂llen in 1670. In 1704, for the whole parish of Ein√∂llen, a Lutheran parish came into being with its seat at Ro√übach. Adding to the mixture after Duke Gustav Samuel Leopold's conversion (reigned 1718-1731) to Catholicism were a small number of Catholics, and thereafter, believers in the Reformed, Lutheran and Catholic faiths all lived in this town, not always without problems, although there was mutual tolerance. In 2012, the Catholics, who had until now been served by their own priest, were merged into the parish of Lauterecken. Arising in Wolfstein about the middle of the 16th century, under the pledge-lords Schwickard von Sickingen's (1549-1562) and Georg Johannes I's (Palatinate- Veldenz, 1543-1592) influence, were a Reformed community and a Lutheran one alongside each other. The former belonged (along with Kreimbach, Rothselberg and Rutsweiler) to the parish of Zweikirchen with the chapel of ease on Wassergasse while the latter, to avoid disputes with the former, established its own chapel in Wolfstein. The clergyman's seat changed between Wolfstein, Ro√übach and E√üweiler. This chapel was, on the occasion of the union of the Reformed and Lutheran faiths, sold in 1818, and the proceeds were used to build a rectory (Haus Adam, 1822). After the ecclesiastical merger, the Protestant parish seat was moved from Zweikirchen to Wolfstein in 1823. Wolfstein thereby became the mother-church centre while Zweikirchen and Rutsweiler became branches. Ro√übach belonged until 1844 to the parish of Ein√∂llen, when it passed to Wolfstein. Between 1866 and 1868, the Evangelical church, which still stands now, was built. Today, the Protestant parish of Wolfstein comprises the mother-church centre of Wolfstein along with the Reckweilerhof and the branches of Rutsweiler an der Lauter with Selbachm√ºhle and Oberweiler-Tiefenbach. From the late 17th century, the Catholic parish of Wolfstein grew into a broad, scattered community taking in the villages of Rutsweiler, Kreimbach, Kaulbach, Olsbr√ºcken, Neum√ºhle, Katzweiler, Hirschhorn, Obersulzbach, Untersulzbach, Tiefenbach, Oberweiler and Ro√übach, with all together 381 souls. For church services, they used the old Saint George's Chapel at the castle, and from time to time, in simultaneum, the Reformed church on Wassergasse. In 1776 they acquired the newly built, stylistically pleasing Baroque church on Obergasse. Today (2000), the Catholic parish comprises Kaulbach (with a chapel of ease), Kreimbach, Ro√übach, Rutsweiler an der Lauter, Rothselberg, E√üweiler, Schneeweiderhof, Oberweiler im Tal, Aschbach, Reckweilerhof and Oberweiler-Tiefenbach, with all together roughly 900 souls, half of whom live in Wolfstein/Ro√übach. The denominational shares of the population in Wolfstein in 1802 were as follows: roughly 66% Reformed, 22% Lutheran, 12% Catholic. In 2000 the figures were as follows: roughly 20.9% Catholic, 65.2% Protestant, 13.9% other. Towards the end of the 19th century, the Pf√§lzischer Verein f√ºr Innere Mission (‚ÄúPalatine Association for Inner Mission‚Äù) established itself in Ro√übach; since 1995 this has been the Evangelischer Gemeinschaftsverband e.V. (‚ÄúEvangelical Community League‚Äù), which is now joined with the Evangelischer Gnadauer Gemeinschaftsverband e.V. (‚ÄúEvangelical Gnadau Community League‚Äù) and is a member of the Diakonisches Werk of the Palatinate. As early as 1898, the members built themselves their own ‚Äúclubhouse‚Äù with a meeting room and a dwelling for the (itinerant) preacher that the club hired and his family. Belonging to the broad missionary region are Bosenbach, Frankelbach, Hefersweiler, Hirschhorn (with its own mission hall), Lauterecken, Morbach, Niederkirchen, Olsbr√ºcken, Reipoltskirchen, Relsberg, Seelen and W√∂rsbach.Religion Politics Town council The council is made up of 16 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.

A mine railway leads the visitor, with knowledgeable guidance, into the chalk mine at the K√∂nigsberg, where until 1967 chalk blocks were quarried underground and processed in town. All apparatus is still on hand in its original form. The chalk mine is held to be an industrial monument of special rank, and is unique in Germany. Sport and leisure Signposted paths open the K√∂nigsberg and its environs to the hiker. The Glan-Lautertal-H√∂henweg, part of the Gro√üer Westpfalzwanderweg (‚ÄúGreat West Palatinate Hiking Trail‚Äù) leads through the town's municipal area. Hiking destinations of particular note are the Laufhauser Weiher (pond), the Neu-Wolfstein and Alt-Wolfstein castle ruins, the Eisenknopf (peak) with its pavilion, the Zweikirche, the Heidenburg (‚ÄúHeathen Castle‚Äù) on the Kreimberg, the Selberg (545 m above sea level) with its lookout tower and the gliderport near E√üweiler. Worth seeing in the town itself are the inn ‚ÄúZur Alten Schenke‚Äù, which from 1590 to 1753 was the town hall, today's town hall, the former Amtskellerei, which was once an administrative centre, the Schlossplatz (‚ÄúCastle Square‚Äù) with its Musikantenbrunnen, a fountain celebrating the local tradition of the Musikanten (see the Hinzweiler article ‚Äì sections History and Famous people ‚Äì for more about this), the remodelled Schlossgasse (‚ÄúCastle Lane‚Äù) with its Eulenbrunnen (‚ÄúOwl Fountain‚Äù) and the remodelling area around the Alte M√ºhle (‚ÄúOld Mill‚Äù, on M√ºhlgasse). The 112-kilometre-long Palatine Ridgeway (hiking trail) leads from Winnweiler by way of Rockenhausen to Wolfstein. The Sport- und Freizeit-Center K√∂nigsland has games, sport and swimming with sporting grounds and a heated outdoor swimming pool. Other sporting facilities in Wolfstein are riding halls and other equestrian facilities (CJD), shooting facilities, tennis courts and a fistball court, among yet others.Sport and leisure Regular events * Whitsun: ** Open-air theatre performance ** Fireworks ** Maikur (forest hike on Whit Monday) * Wolfsteiner Stadtfest, town festival before beginning of summer holidays, every other year, alternating with the next * Feuerwehrfest (‚ÄúFire Brigade Festival‚Äù), every other year, alternating with the foregoing * Herbstmarkt (‚ÄúAutumn Festival‚Äù) in October * Ro√übacher Zeltkerwe (‚Äútent fair‚Äù) in August * Weihnachtsmarkt (‚ÄúChristmas Market‚Äù), Saturday before the first day of Advent * Reitertage (‚ÄúRiders‚Äô Days‚Äù) held by the CJD of national importance, last weekend in JuneRegular events Clubs Of the 26 clubs in town at the turn of the 20th century, those worthy of mention are: * Musiker-Unterst√ºtzungsverein (‚ÄúMusician Support Club‚Äù), for musicians who were ill or otherwise unable to work * Johannis- Verein, for people unable to work * Kriegerverein (‚ÄúWarriors‚Äô Club‚Äù), for supporting sick veterans and their families * Liberaler Verein (‚ÄúLiberal Club‚Äù), for the promotion of national and liberal politics * Deutscher Flottenverein (Navy League) * Radfahrerverein (cycling) * Ziegenzuchtverein (goat breeding) Today there are 25 clubs in town, the oldest of which is the M√§nnergesangsverein 1858 e.V., a men's singing club. Ro√übach's oldest club is the gymnastic club (Turnverein), founded in 1924.Clubs Economy and infrastructure Youth hostel, built in 1978-1980 Economic structure In Electoral Palatinate times, handicrafts and smallhold agriculture defined the town's economic structure. The greater part of Wolfstein's inhabitants lived in poverty. In the late 18th century, improvement came with the mining of cinnabar-bearing stone that yielded quicksilver on the Princely-Electoral side of the K√∂nigsberg, a pursuit promoted by Prince-Elector Karl Theodor. Under the leadership brought by experienced professionals who had come to town, this mining reached its highest point between 1770 and 1790. Nevertheless, the mining lasted no longer than 30 years before coming to a complete end in the 19th century, with destitution and hardship as the upshot for the now jobless miners and their families. While it was true that new ventures arose in the 19th century through Wolfstein citizens‚Äô initiatives, such as chalk mining, coalmining, tanning, brewing, linen and cotton article manufacturing, bricks, and so on, these fell far short of employing everybody who sought a job. Thus, out of the need for a livelihood arose the Musikant business, not only in Wolfstein but also in many of the outlying villages. For a time, more than 750 professional musicians from the Canton of Wolfstein tried their luck ‚Äúon the world‚Äôs roads‚Äù, in circus orchestras, on Siberian noblemen's estates, aboard pleasure boats and elsewhere. Within what is now the Verbandsgemeinde of Wolfstein, all together roughly 3,500 people were active as Musikanten. In the early 20th century, the economic situation generally improved: for one thing, the Lauter Valley Railway (Lautertalbahn), which had been opened in 1883, made it possible for workers to commute to the nearby quarries or to jobs in Kaiserslautern, and for another, new commercial establishments in Wolfstein and across the river in Ro√übach offered earning potential. These included the Pf√§lzische Schwerspatwerke Braun, Krieger u. Cie. (1902-1950; baryte works), the Pf√§lzische Bandagenfabrik Karl Otto Braun (1903; forerunner of Karl Otto Braun KG; bandages), the Zigarrenfabrik Felsenthal u. Co. (1910-late 1920s; cigars), the Industriewerke Ro√übach and the Kort brothers‚Äô brush factory (1896-1923). Likewise of importance, as early as the 19th century, was the family Martin's pottery business. Currently, the greater part of Wolfstein's inhabitants work in the secondary sector of the economy (all figures are rounded): 1,200 persons, or 67% of the workforce, of whom 1,030 employees and 60 trainees are at KOB KG alone, Europe‚Äôs biggest bandage factory, which recently gave up part of its independence to co√∂perate with the biggest distributor of bandage material, Paul Hartmann AG. Only 240 employees actually live in Wolfstein. Most of the commuters who come to town come from places around the K√∂nigsberg, which speaks to the factory‚Äôs importance to the ‚ÄúK√∂nigsland‚Äù region's economic situation. Working in the tertiary sector of the economy are 600 persons, of whom 330 persons, or 19% of the workforce, are in ‚Äúnot-for-profit organizations‚Äù (CJD, Verbandsgemeinde and town administration, ecclesiastical institutions, schools), 80 persons, or 4%, are in trade, credit business or transport and 180 persons, or 10%, are in other fields (senior citizens‚Äô homes, hospitality, healthcare, etc.). The share of workers in agriculture and forestry in the agrarian community of Ro√übach in 1949 was still 46%. There were 84 operations, 28 of them full-time, but with relatively small working areas (all under 20 ha) and widely scattered plots of land. In the town itself, farming, somewhat limited by the steep slopes and the lean soils, always played a subordinate role. Now, however, even the outlying centre of Ro√übach is purely residential, although some 90 ha of its cropland and meadowland is worked by the CJD. The last full-time farming operation within Wolfstein's limits is run by the family Sonn at the Reckweilerhof.Economic structure Education =Schools= Information about schools in Wolfstein and Ro√übach up until the early 18th century is full of gaps. It is known, however, that given the town's denominational makeup, with Reformed, Lutheran and Catholic believers, there were three denominational schools, one for each denomination. After the unification of the Reformed and Lutheran churches, and as a result of the swelling population, the class at the Protestant school was for a while more than 100-strong, all of whom had to be schooled in the little one-room schoolhouse next to the Reformed church. In response, Wolfstein acquired a building before the town gates in 1823, and converted it into a schoolhouse with two classrooms, and also two dwellings, one for the Protestant teacher and the other for the Catholic teacher. Also attending Catholic classes were Catholic children from Kaulbach, Rutsweiler, Ro√übach and Oberweiler-Tiefenbach. About the middle of the 19th century, a Protestant teaching assistant was hired who took over classed for the girls in the then existing six school age groups. For the Catholic children, a third classroom was set up in the loft. After the introduction of the 7th school year in 1856, the number of pupils grew to more than 200, bringing about the founding of a three-class ‚Äúsimultaneous‚Äù municipal school at which pupils were divided into three groups, lower (1st and 2nd year), middle (3rd and 4th year) and upper (5th to 7th year), and thereafter, Wolfstein's Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren learnt their lessons together. In 1892, a new schoolhouse with four classrooms next to the Protestant church was dedicated. In 1928, the eighth school year was introduced. Until the same was introduced over in Ro√übach (once the new schoolhouse there had been opened), eighth-year pupils from Ro√übach had to attend classes in Wolfstein. The Ro√übachers built a schoolhouse in the village centre in 1825, and until 1871, both Catholic and Protestant schoolchildren attended classes there given by one teacher in one room. Once the school had been expanded that year with the addition of a second classroom and a second teacher's dwelling, the two denominations were separated, although given the unbalanced numbers, first-year Protestant schoolchildren were assigned to the Catholic school. The two denominational schools were converted into a two- class ‚ÄúGerman Christian Communal School‚Äù in 1933, which in 1937 moved to a new schoolhouse ‚ÄúAuf dem M√ºhlacker‚Äù (‚ÄúAt the Mill Field‚Äù), which for the time was quite modern and extensively equipped. Beginning in the 1962/1963 school year, all seventh- and eighth-year pupils from Ro√übach, Rutsweiler, Kreimbach, Kaulbach, Frankelbach and Oberweiler-Tiefenbach were taught in grade-level- differentiated classes in Wolfstein, which led to great difficulties in allocating room for everybody. This was solved in 1965 with the move to the Volksschulhaus, said to be the ‚Äúmoment of the birth of the Mittelpunktschule (‚Äúmidpoint school‚Äù, a central school, designed to eliminate smaller outlying schools) on the K√∂nigsberg‚Äù. Brought together here, beginning in the 1990/1991 school year, were all fifth- to tenth-year classes from 14 villages in the Verbandsgemeinde feeder area. Currently serving the town's needs are Grundschule Wolfstein (primary school; feeder area: Aschbach, Ein√∂llen, Kreimbach-Kaulbach, Oberweiler-Tiefenbach, Relsberg, Rutsweiler, Wolfstein) and, since 1998, the Regionalschule and (with some classes being phased out) the Hauptschule (feeder area: the Verbandsgemeinde). Wolfstein's old schoolhouse was for a time used by BASF, the chamber of commerce and the CJD. It is foreseen that it will become the town museum and library, while Ro√übach's old schoolhouse has already become a village community centre. =Higher learning= The Christliches Jugenddorf Wolfstein (CJD; founded in 1972) is a member if the Diakonisches Werk der Pfalz (a Christian youth charity) and is one of the institutions of professional training and clinical social work of the Christliches Jugenddorfwerk Deutschlands (likewise abbreviated CJD). In their vocational preparation year, boys and girls aged 14 to 16 who have no Hauptschulabschluss are taken towards the professional training level. In the CJD's own workshops and external businesses, the CJD leads to a qualification in one of 15 different occupations in the industrial- technical, agricultural, gastronomical and sales fields. While in the Jugenddorf (‚ÄúYouth Village‚Äù), a broad spectrum of tended lodgings is available to the youths. The administrative seat is the former town mill. The Wolfstein branch location of the Kusel district folk high school offers courses for further training in data processing, applied data processing, foreign languages, fibre craft, cooking and many more.Education Transport =Road= Running through Wolfstein is its main traffic artery, Bundesstra√üe 270, which leads from Pirmasens by way of Kaiserslautern (interchange with the Autobahn A 6 Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìMannheim) and Lauterecken (interchange with Bundesstra√üe 420) to Fischbach/Kirn (Nahe valley, interchange with Bundesstra√üe 41). The B 270 bypass road was opened to traffic after just under five years of construction on 17 November 2006. The quickest road link to the district seat of Kusel goes by way of Rothselberg, Jettenbach and Altenglan (Landesstra√üe 370, 23.6 km). Running from the Reckweilerhof is Landesstra√üe 368 by way of Aschbach and other places in the heights and on into the Glan valley (Glanbr√ºcken). From the Kuhbr√ºcker H√ºbel, Landesstra√üe 384 (‚ÄúHefersweiler Stra√üe‚Äù) opens the way to the places in the dales and in the heights around the Donnersberg. =Rail= Wolfstein also lies on the Lauter Valley Railway (Lautertalbahn), a single-tracked, 34-kilometre-long railway that links Wolfstein to Kaiserslautern Central Station and the Mannheim/Ludwigshafen ‚Äì Saarbr√ºcken long-distance services available there, as well as the local rail travel within the Palatinate. In the local town area, trains stop at Ro√übach (Friedhof), Wolfstein (Bahnhof) and Reckweilerhof.Transport Famous people Sons and daughters of the town * Friedrich Jakob Sander (1809‚Äì1876), musical instrument builder * Franz Schmitt (1816‚Äì1891), painter * Ernst Krieger (1867‚Äì1943), chess compositor * Pauline K√∂nig (1868‚Äì1938), Palatine ‚Äúhomeland poet‚Äù, honorary citizen of Wolfstein. * Fritz Zolnhofer (1896‚Äì1965), painter * Friedrich Joss√© (1897‚Äì1994), painter and graphic artist References External links * Town‚Äôs official webpage * Region K√∂nigsland (VG Wolfstein) * Visitable mine with mine railway and outdoor wine tasting Category:Towns in Rhineland- Palatinate Category:Kusel (district) ","title":"Wolfstein, Rhineland-Palatinate"},{"id":"4238937","text":"Parish church in the village of St. Ulrich (former Benedictine priory) Bollschweil Priory was a Cluniac monastery of nuns at Bollschweil (formerly Bolesweiler) in the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.

It is located five km north of the town of Jericho, at Khirbat al-Mafjar in the West Bank. Spreading over , it consists of three main parts: a palace, an ornate bath complex, and an agricultural estate. Also associated with the site is a large park or agricultural enclosure (·∏•ayr) which extends east of the palace. An elaborate irrigation system provided the complex with water from nearby springs. History of study The site was discovered in 1873. The northern area of the site was noted, but not excavated, in 1894 by F.J Bliss,Bliss 1894. but the major source of archaeological information comes from the excavations of Palestinian archaeologist, Dimitri Baramki between 1934 and 1948. In 1959 Baramki's colleague, colonial administrator for the British Mandate government Robert W. Hamilton, published the major work on Hisham's Palace, Khirbat al-Mafjar: An Arabian Mansion in the Jordanian Valley. Baramki's archaeological research is unfortunately absent from this volume, and as such, Hamilton's analysis is exclusively art historical. Baramki's research on the archaeological aspects of the site, particularly the ceramics, was published in various preliminary reports and articles in the Quarterly of the Palestinian Department of Antiquities.Whitcomb and Taha 2013 Many of the finds from Baramki and Hamilton's excavations are now held in the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem. In 2006, new excavations were carried out under the direction of Dr. Hamdan Taha of the Palestinian National Authority's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. Current research is being conducted by the Jericho Mafjar Project, a collaboration between the ministry and archaeologists from the University of Chicago. In 2015, an agreement was signed between the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to enable the 825 square meter mosaic in the palace, one of the largest in the world, to be uncovered and readied for display. Context It is difficult to establish a secure historical framework for Hisham's Palace. No textual sources reference the site, and archaeological excavations are the only source of further information. An ostracon bearing the name \\"Hisham\\" was found during the course of Baramki's excavations. This was interpreted as evidence for the site's construction during the reign of the caliph HishƒÅm ibn  øAbd al-Malik. Robert Hamilton subsequently argued that the palace was a residence of al-Walid b. al-Yazid, a nephew of Hisham who was famous for his extravagant lifestyle.Hamilton 1988 Archaeologically it is certain that the site is a product of the Umayyad dynasty in the first half of the 8th century, although the specifics of its patronage and use remain unknown. As an archaeological site, Hisham's Palace belongs to the category of desert castles. These are a collection of monuments dating to the Umayyad dynasty and found throughout Syria, Jordan, Israel, and the West Bank. Although there is great variation in the size, location, and presumed function of these different sites, they can be connected to the patronage of different figures in the Umayyad ruling family.Bacharach 1996. Some of the desert castles, for example Qasr Hallabat or Qasr Burqu, represent Islamic occupations of earlier Roman or Ghassanid structures. Other sites like Qastal, Qasr Azraq, or al-Muwaqqar are associated with trade routes and scarce water resources. With a few exceptions, the desert castles conform to a common template consisting of a square palace similar to Roman forts, a bath house, water reservoir or dam, and often an agricultural enclosure. Various interpretations for the desert castles exist, and it is unlikely that one single theory can explain the variety observed in the archaeological record. Architecture The palace, bath complex, and external mosque are enclosed by a retaining wall. The southern gate was known from Baramki's excavations, but the recent discovery of a northern gate in alignment indicates that the development of Hisham's Palace was conceived of as a complete unit to be constructed at once. Palace The palace The largest building at the site is the palace, a roughly square building with round towers at the corners. It originally had two stories. Entrance was through a gate on the center of the east side. The inner rooms were aligned around a central paved portico, which featured an underground cellar or sirdab, for refuge from the heat. The room to the south of the portico was a mosque with a mihrab built into the outer wall. Outer pavilion and mosque East of the palace entrance was a pavilion and fountain. A second, larger mosque was located to the northeast of the palace entrance.Baer, \\"Khirbat al-Mafjar\\" Bath complex The bath complex is located just north of the palace across an open area. This free- standing structure is approximately thirty meters square, and three of its sides feature round exedrae which project out from the building. The east face of the bath had an ornate entrance in its center, flanked by exedrae. Inside the main square hall was a pool. The entire interior floor surface of the bath complex was paved with spectacular mosaic decoration. A special reception room, or diwan, was entered from the northwest corner. The floor of this room was paved with the famous \\"tree of life\\" mosaic, depicting a lion and gazelles at the foot of a tree. The actual bathing rooms were attached to the northern wall of the complex, and were heated from below the floor by hypocausts. Agricultural annex To the north of the bath complex are the ruins of a large square structure which has clearly gone through many phases of reuse and reconstruction. This part of the site was initially assumed to be a khan or caravanserai, but recent excavations have indicated that the northern area had an agricultural function connected to the hayr or agricultural enclosure during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods. Decoration Panel in the Rockefeller Museum The decorative elements at Hisham's Palace are some of the finest representations of Umayyad period art and are well documented in the publications of Robert Hamilton. Mosaics The most famous artistic aspect of the site is the \\"tree of life\\" mosaic in the diwan of the bath complex, although the mosaic floor of the main bath hall is no less impressive. All of the mosaics found at Hisham's Palace are of very high quality and feature a wide variety of colors and figural motifs. Carved stucco The carved stucco found at the site is also of exceptional quality. Of particular note is the statue depicting a male figure with a sword, often presumed to be the caliph, which stood in a niche above the entrance to the bath hall. Additional male and female figures carved in stucco, some semi-nude, adorn the bath complex. Geometric and vegetal patterns are also quite common. While Hamilton described the carvings at Hisham's Palace as amateurish and chaotic, many subsequent art historians have noted similarities with Iranian themes. Hana Taragan has argued that the artistic themes seen at the site are Levantine examples of an Islamic visual language of power that coalesced from Sasanian influences in Iraq.Taragan 2003 Priscilla Soucek has also drawn attention to the site's representation of the Islamic myth of Solomon.Soucek 1993 Post- Umayyad occupational history The site is commonly thought to have been destroyed and abandoned by the earthquake of 747/8, but an analysis of Baramki's detailed reporting shows that this is incorrect. Instead the ceramic record indicates that the occupation continued through the Ayyubid-Mamluk period, with a significant phase of occupation between 900‚Äì1000 during the Abbasid and Fatimid periods.Whitcomb 1988 Further excavations will no doubt contribute to a more detailed picture of the site's continued use through different periods. Heritage Hisham's Palace is the most archaeologically important Islamic monument in Palestine, and is a major attraction for both visitors and Palestinians. In 2010, according to figures collected by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, the site received 43,455 visitors. The site is a common field trip destination for Palestinian schoolchildren. Foreign visitors who enter Palestine through the nearby Allenby Bridge often make Hisham's Palace their first stop. The site has been visited by foreign dignitaries, and was the set for a production of Shakespeare's Richard II in 2012. According to Global Heritage Fund (GHF), the rapid urban development of Jericho, as well as expansion of agricultural activity in the area, are limiting archaeologists‚Äô access to the site, much of which remain unexplored. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting important structures have been hindered by lack of resources. In a 2010 report titled Saving Our Vanishing Heritage, GHF identified Hisham's Palace as one of 12 worldwide heritage sites most \\"On the Verge\\" of irreparable loss and destruction. H. Taha, director of antiquities has published reports concerning the preservation of this and other sites in the Jericho region.Taha 2005 Gallery Image:Hishams Palace window Author MDarter.jpg Image:Hishams Palace placard Author MDarter.JPG Image:Hishams Palace placard toilet Author MDarter.jpg Image:Hishams Palace walkway Author MDarter.jpg See also *Desert castles *History of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes Notes References *Baer, Eva. \\"Khirbat al-Mafjar.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam 2nd ed. *Bliss, F.J.

Originally titled Guild News, the newspaper was renamed Redbrick in 1962. As with most student newspapers Redbrick is not fully independent due to funding arrangements, but is editorially independent as is set out in its charter. Redbrick is written, photographed, edited and published entirely by University students, and is run not for profit, funded by both advertising revenue and the Guild of Students. It consists of News, Comment, Culture, Music, Film, TV, Gaming, Food&Drink;, Travel, Life&Style;, Sci&Tech; and Sport sections. A sport supplement titled The Lion was published biannually until 2014. The newspaper is produced fortnightly during term time, with the exception of the summer semester as publication halts during exam season. The newspaper celebrated its 75th birthday in February 2011. The paper is distributed free around campus and the local area every Friday of publication week. Redbrick's website has grown significantly following a redesign in early 2011. Since then it has won the Guardian Student Media Award for 'Website of the Year' 2011 and it receives over 6,000 unique visitors every week, meaning it has now overtaken the print edition in terms of readership. In December 2018, Redbrick published its 1500th print issue. History Redbrick is one of the oldest student newspapers in the United Kingdom. First published as Guild News on 5 February 1936, its current name dates to 1962. One of three student publications at the university, the others being SATNAV (Science and Technology News and Views) and The Linguist, the paper was originally published alongside the student magazine The Mermaid; this ceased publication. The newspaper continued to publish throughout the Second World War. The first issue after its declaration featured on its front page an article on the potential difference between The Great War, and the war with Germany in which the country had just become involved. In summer 1972, following the holding of the Gay Liberation Front's yearly conference in Birmingham by the Guild of Students (the University of Birmingham's students' union), Redbrick published a controversial article titled 'Who's a Wanker?', which described \\"the practical aspects of homosexuality\\", then a highly controversial topic. The issue ran out and had to be reprinted. Simultaneously, it was reported to the Press Council because of that article, and it was subsequently withdrawn. Over the years, Redbrick has covered everything from visits by Prime Ministers, controversial politicians and even Malcolm X. The paper has featured many expos√©s, reports from behind the Iron Curtain, the 1968 student sit-ins and from behind the scenes at the BBC's first ever Prime Ministerial debate. Perhaps Redbrick's most successful day so far was its coverage of the 2011 England riots in Birmingham. Redbrick ran a live feed covering the events in Birmingham as they happened, including photography, commentary and a selection of tweets, which attracted over 100,000 visitors in the space of a few hours. Redbrick continued to do this into the second and third days of rioting, and received national recognition for its coverage. The society has won recognition from various student bodies. In 2005, Redbrick won the most improved society award; following this in 2010 the newspaper won the Guild of Students Most Outstanding Society of the year award. In the same year it won the Outstanding Contribution to Sport award from the University. As previously mentioned, in November 2011, Redbrick also won the Guardian Student Media award for 'Website of the Year'. In 2015, the Sport section of the newspaper was commended for its coverage, winning the Student Publication Association's 'Best University Sports Coverage' award. In 2017, the Redbrick News section won the SPA's 'Best News Story' award for an in-depth investigation into the university's sport clubs' initiations. In 2014, a funding shortfall caused the newspaper to reduce its publishing frequency from weekly to fortnightly, and its circulation from 3000 per week to 1500 per fortnight. Editorial team Redbrick appoints its core editorial team for the coming academic year via simple majority at an annual general meeting in the summer semester. Redbrick now encompasses a large team, including writers, editors, designers and managers. Other It is closely linked to the other media groups at the Guild of Students: BurnFM.com, Guild Television (GTV) and PhotoSoc. Many former editors have gone on to work for national publications, the most notable including Roland Buerk and former Reviews Editor Lizo Mzimba.

In the 16th century it became a community of monks. History About A.D. 1087, Saint Ulrich of Zell, a monk of the Abbey of Cluny, founded Bollschweil Priory, a monastery of nuns, which was moved in 1115 to nearby S√∂lden and became known as S√∂lden Priory. This foundation was a complement to the monastery he had founded at Gr√ºningen and later moved to Zell, afterwards known as St. Ulrich's Priory in the Black Forest (). S√∂lden was a priory directly subject to Cluny, as was the norm in that reform congregation of the Order of St. Benedict. The community consisted of approximately 13 to 20 nuns under a prior appointed by Cluny. The priory declined so severely in the 15th century that by 1500 there were no nuns left here, and the priory eventually became occupied by monks. The men were subject at first to St. George's Abbey in the Black Forest from about 1546 and then transferred in 1560 to St. Peter's Abbey in the Black Forest, into which it was formally incorporated in 1598. The priory was dissolved in 1807 in the course of secularisation. Territory and buildings S√∂lden's grounds were not extensive and were concentrated in Breisgau. The Vogtei belonged to the Priory of St. Ulrich. Of the monastic buildings still remaining, the oldest portions date from the 15th century. Much refurbishment took place in the Baroque period.

It has worked to promote the Mass as the main Sunday service in churches, regular confession, and the Eucharistic fast. The society's motto is Adoremus in aeternum sanctissimum sacramentum, or in English, \\"Let us forever adore the Most Blessed Sacrament\\". It is the oldest Anglican devotional society. In its present form it resulted from the amalgamation on 26 February 1867, of two older societies: the Society of the Blessed Sacrament, founded in 1860, and the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament, founded in 1862 by Thomas Thellusson Carter during the Oxford Movement in the Church of England. Members are known as Associates.  Duties of associates  Associates and priests-associate (the constitution differentiates between the two, but the requirements are identical) of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament strive to promote reverence for Jesus in the Holy Eucharist through the witness of their lives, words, prayers and teaching. They pray for one another at Mass and before the Blessed Sacrament and make use of the Sacrament of Reconciliation.  Structure   Autonomous provinces  The confraternity consists of autonomous provinces, of which there are currently two - the English (and original) CBS and the American CBS - each led by a superior- general and administered by a secretary-general and treasurer-general. Additionally there are semi-autonomous branches of CBS in both Canada and Australia, though currently neither has the numerical strength to become a fully autonomous province, and so they remain part of the English CBS. The English CBS is also active in Sweden, Wales and the Channel Islands. Currently lacking structure, there are fledgling CBS movements in parts of Africa.  Districts  Within an autonomous province of CBS there may be a further level of structure known as a \\"district\\". The English CBS is divided into 23 districts. A district is led by a \\"district superior\\", who may appoint a \\"district secretary\\", and is a collection of all the wards within a particular region.  Wards  The local unit of CBS is known as a \\"ward\\". Members of the confraternity meet together in local wards for prayer, worship and mutual support under the guidance of a priest as \\"ward superior\\", assisted by a \\"ward secretary\\". Each ward decides its own annual programme of events and the ward superior has authority to admit new associates (although he must consult the district superior or superior-general before admitting a new priest- associate). Many wards are attached to a local parish, although this is not necessary according to the constitution, which merely requires a priest- associate (as ward superior) to gather other associates around himself in order to form a ward. In recent times a number of priests-associate have formed wards which are not attached to any parish church. Examples in the English CBS include: *The Ward of the Sacred Heart, attached to the Diocese of Lincoln and holding a meeting once a year; *The Ward of St Cuthman - attached to the Deanery of Storrington and holding meetings throughout that deanery; *The Ward of the Precious Blood - attached to the Deanery of Horsham and holding meetings throughout that deanery; *The Ward of St Mary and St Nicolas - attached to Lancing College and for the benefit of members of that school who belong to CBS; *The Ward of St Brigid - a geographically vast ward, uniting scattered CBS members throughout Sweden. There remain unattached associates of CBS, who live too far from any ward to be able to participate in its life. These unattached associates receive updates and news directly from the secretary-general.  Finances  The English CBS has benefited from a number of generous bequests and careful financial management and has consequently built up considerable financial reserves. These allow it to provide grants of vessels and vestments to priests celebrating the Eucharist and reserving the Blessed Sacrament in poorer parishes and also to provide financial support to large projects and conferences, including the annual Caister Conference. In early July 2011, controversy broke when it was first rumoured, then reported in The Times, that the confraternity had made a grant of ¬£1 million to the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham, thus divesting itself of more than half its assets. Christopher Pearson, superior- general of the confraternity, was reported (by Ruth Gledhill) in The Times as stating that the trustees believed, having taken legal advice, that the grant was compatible with the charitable objects of the confraternity, a view which Pearson also stated in a letter to members of the Confraternity. This was disputed by others including Paul Williamson who described the grant as \\"a disgrace\\", and made formal complaints to both the Archbishop of Westminster and the Charity Commission. In June 2012 the Charity Commission for England and Wales stated that following a \\"substantial number of complaints\\" it had carried out an investigation, and judged the grant to be improper in that a majority of the Trustees (of CBS) who authorised the grant were themselves members of the Ordinariate, meaning that \\"the majority of the Trustees [had] a (financial) personal interest in the decision\\". The Commission ruled that the grant was both \\"invalid\\" and \\"unauthorised\\". The Commission also appeared to rule out any similar grants in the future, when it stated: \\"there is substantial doubt whether the Confraternity could make a grant to the Ordinariate (even with restrictions) which could be applied by the Ordinariate consistently with the objects of the Confraternity\\". Shortly after the publication of the Charity Commission's findings the Superior-General (Christopher Pearson), Secretary-General, and Treasurer-General of CBS, who were all members of the Ordinariate, resigned. The full ¬£1 million grant was repaid to the Confraternity, with interest.  Other points of interest  The English CBS publishes a quarterly newsletter and prayer schedule, known as the Quarterly Paper or QP, and sent to all associates. Other publications include The Constitution, The Manual, and The Directory (of districts and wards). There are copies of the society's manuals in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, listed under Classmark 1295 CON. Members of the Confraternity were instrumental in the founding (in 1869) of a religious order of Anglican nuns whose work was to make reparation (by prayer) for what the founders perceived to be dishonour to Jesus through the historic attitude of the Church of England to the Blessed Sacrament. The sisters were known as the Community of Reparation to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament (CRJBS). Bishop Roger Jupp is the current superior-general in the United Kingdom.Officers listed here .

M Perry. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 233. They are the structures that limit both the practice and the imaginative possibilities in a socio-political order, and in doing so shape the routines of conflict over social, political and economic resources that govern access to labor, loyalty, and social station, e.g. government power, economic capital, technological expertise, etc. In a formative context, the institutions structure conflict over government power and capital allocation, whereas the imaginative framework shapes the preconceptions about possible forms of human interaction. Through this, a formative context further creates and sustains a set of roles and ranks, which mold conflict over the mastery of resources and the shaping of the ideas of social possibilities, identities and interests. The formative context of the Western democracies, for example, include the organization of production through managers and laborers, a set of laws administering capital, a state in relation to the citizen, and a social division of labor. Background Also referred to as order, framework, or structure of social life, the concept of formative context was developed by philosopher and social theorist Roberto Unger. Whereas other social and political philosophers have taken the historical context as a given, and seen one existing set of institutional arrangements as necessarily giving birth to another set, Unger rejects this naturalization of the world and moves to explain how such contexts are made and reproduced. The most forceful articulation and development of the concept is in Unger's book False Necessity. The thesis of formative context is central to Unger's theory of false necessity, which rejects the idea of a closed number of institutional arrangements of human societies, e.g. feudalism and capitalism, and that these arrangements are the product of historical necessity, as theories of liberalism or Marxism claim. Rather, Unger argues that there are myriad institutional arrangements that can coalesce, and that they do so through a contingent process of struggle, reconciliation, and innovation among individuals and groups. For Unger, the concept of formative context serves to explain the basis of a certain set of institutional arrangements and their reliance upon each other. It offers an explanation of the cycles of reform and retrenchment of a socio-economic political system and how it remains undisturbed by rivalries and animosities. The theory of false necessity goes on to explain the connections of a formative context, their making and remaking, and how they maintain stability despite the contingent formation.For good overviews of Unger's thought see Collins, Hugh. ‚ÄúRoberto Unger and the Critical Legal Studies Movement,‚Äù Journal of Law and Society 14 (1987), Trubek, David M. \\"Radical Theory and Programmatic Thought.\\" American Journal of Sociology 95, no. 2 (1989). Criteria While a formative context of a society exerts a major influence on the course of social actions and behaviors, it is itself hard to challenge, revise, or even identify in the midst of everyday conflicts and routines. Thus there are two criteria for determining if an institution or structure belongs in a formative context, one subjective and one objective. The subjective criteria considers the perspective of the social actors themselves and the arrangements that are assumed in their speech and actions. For example, the attempts of big business and labor to protect themselves through deals with each other, and the political efforts of unorganized labor and petty bourgeoisie to undermine and circumvent these deals by pressuring the government, operate on the same institutional assumption of the distinction between economy and polity, and that victory in one can be offset by the other. The objective criteria is simply that if a substitution of the proposed structure affects the hierarchies or cyclical conflicts‚Äîif it alters the social divisions‚Äîthen it can be included in the formative context. For example, a change in any one of the following conditions would completely change the formative context of a Western democratic state: if the state stopped being democratic or was democratic enough to allow collective militancy and subject private centers of power to public accountability; if business could have its way and override all regulatory controls of govt; or if no workers could unionize or all of them could and did. Western democracies The formative context of the North Atlantic democracies can be organized into four clusters of institutional arrangements: work, law, government, and occupational structure. *The work- organization complex makes a distinction in work between task definers and task executers, with the material rewards concentrated in the task defining jobs. *The private-rights complex understands the rights of the individual vis-a-vis other individuals and the state. This structure is central to the allocation and control of capital, ensuring all forms of capital distribution and entitlement. *The government-organization complex is the institutional arrangement to protect the individual from the state, and to prevent those in power from changing the formative context. It establishes a link between safeguards of freedom and the dispersion of powers, e.g. partisan rivalries fail to extend to debates over the fundamental institutions that affect social interactions. *The occupational-structure complex is a social division of labor characterized by a lack of caste or religious division. It is based on material reward and task defining jobs receiving the highest pay. Influences in other fields The thesis of formative contexts has been heavily drawn on and used within the Social Study of Information Systems. In the field of Information systems Claudio Ciborra and Giovan Lanzara define the term \\"formative context\\" as the \\"set of institutional arrangements and cognitive imageries that inform actors' practical and reasoning routines in organisations\\". They posit that the common inability to inquire into, challenge or shape formative context can inhibit individuals and organizations from acting competently and learning what they need to know in order to make the most of situations and technological transitions as the enchaining effect of Formative Context can lead to cognitive and social inertia.

Vocalist Jon Hershey eventually quit the band during the same year, which led to Josh McManness taking on the position as lead singer. After several months of playing with McManness, August Burns Red signed to Solid State Records in 2005. Hershey would later go on to form post-rock band Bells. August Burns Red released Thrill Seeker, their first full-length album, on November 8, 2005. In 2006, drummer Matt Greiner was endorsed by Truth Custom Drums following the release of the album.

Artistry Musical style and influences August Burns Red is generally credited as a metalcore band, and has also been said to share progressive metal elements. The band is also identified as a melodic metalcore band. August Burns Red songs frequently feature highly melodic guitar riffs, technical or odd time signatures and breakdowns, with a variety of influences including Meshuggah, Symphony in Peril, Pelican, Slayer and The Dillinger Escape Plan, as well as Between the Buried and Me, Misery Signals and Hopesfall. Unlike other melodic metalcore vocalists, Jake Luhrs generally does not mix clean vocals with his screams, though he does include spoken word parts on occasion. For example, their track \\"Spirit Breaker\\" features Luhrs reading a letter. However that changed when the band released Phantom Anthem, which featured Luhrs' clean vocals for the first time in a few songs, most notably \\"Coordinates\\" and later in \\"Lighthouse\\" from their recent album Guardians, which featured a clean-singing chorus. While the group has stated that they don't mind being classified as metalcore, Brubaker has grown a distaste for many of the genre's bands: \\"I feel like anyone who can pick up and play a guitar and learn to play a metalcore riff and any drummer who can learn to play a thrash beat over a breakdown is doing it. It's almost become very formulaic, and metal to me was never a formulaic genre.\\" Musically, the group has incorporated instrumentals such as the cello and the violin while also featuring song elements such as classical music inspired interludes, pushing the boundaries of what is considered 'metalcore'. Many of their songs do not contain choruses, unlike other bands in the metalcore scene.  Band name  August Burns Red members have been asked about the origin of their band name on many occasions and have given numerous different stories. The most popular story behind the name is an incident involving Jon Hershey, the band's original vocalist, when he dated a woman named August who burned his dog Redd alive in his dog house. However, it was later revealed in a radio interview that this meaning (along with others) was simply a comical story created by the members and that there is no actual meaning behind the band name. Drummer Matt Greiner stated in the interview that \\"we just came up with the name to come up with a name.\\" Christianity For a significant part of the band's history, August Burns Red has widely been considered a Christian band. JB Brubaker mentioned in an interview with online magazine Shout!, that \\"Christianity is a religion, not a style of music\\" and he would \\"rather just let the music speak for itself.\\", and that he would rather let Christianity shine through the band's lyrics. Brent Rambler commented on the fact that \\"It is important to us that people know that we are indeed Christians... without having us stand up there and ram it down people's throats.\\" JB Brubaker responded to a 2015 interview question about the band's reaction to being labeled as a Christian metal band by explaining that the presence of Christianity varies in each of the members' lives, but then says, \\"We decided years ago that we were not going to be an 'evangelical band.' We're not onstage to bring people to God, that's not our purpose up there. Our number one purpose in ABR is to entertain.\\" In a 2014 interview, Jake Luhrs responded to a similar question by saying, \\"No, we are not a Christian band because, in my eyes, and I'm a believer in Jesus Christ...that doesn't mean because all of us are Christians we are now a Christian band.\\" Since the members of the band are Christian, their beliefs are sometimes reflected in their writing and lyrics. However, these lyrics aren't meant to be religious but rather, positive and in songs such as \\"Fault Line\\", for the band's fans. Brent Rambler said in a 2016 interview, \\"We don't preach from stage, and we made the active choice that this band is about music, and being a positive influence. Since a lot of people correlate Christianity for positivity, that label has stuck with us.\\" Recently some of the members have stated in interviews that not all of the band are Christian. They have said that they now just hope to spread positive messages in their music and lyrics, whether they are perceived as spreading a Christian message or not. In a 2019 podcast, Matt Greiner stated that the band decided to drop their Christian label in 2012, after disputes within the band over what kind of message they were trying to spread, and whether their main intention was to make music or to spread a Christian message. Although the decision initially was met with disapproval by Greiner and Luhrs, members of the band continue to state that August Burns Red is not a Christian band.

It was his debut novel and was published in 1999. The novel is set in a boarding school for boys in 1950s Norfolk, England.The Wishing Game at WorldCat It deals with bullying, secrets, supernatural phenomena, and homosexuality.Review of The Wishing Game, Phoenix Book Reviews (archived link) It was published in the US as Something Dangerous.Something Dangerous at WorldCat Synopsis Jonathan Palmer is a shy teenager at a traditional British boys boarding school in the 1950s. He has three friends: bookworm Nicholas and twins, Stephen and Michael. Unfortunately, his friends live in a separate dormitory, leaving Jonathan exposed to regular bullying at the hands of sadistic James Wheatley and his cronies Stuart and George. There is only one boy who is not bullied with James Wheatley ‚Äì Richard Rokeby. Richard is a loner but has confidence and scathing wit. Jonathan gradually befriends dark and dangerous Richard, who in turn encourages Jonathan to be brave and stand up to the bullies (both students and faculty members). Richard begins to turn Jonathan against his three friends. One night, Richard suggests that the boys play a game with a ouija board that he has brought to the school from his aunt's house. The twins refuse and leave. Nicholas refuses to let Richard scare him, so he remains. Following that evening, bad things begin to happen that Jonathan believes he has caused. Both James Wheatley's cronies leave the school ‚Äì Stuart's family leaves for the United States and George spends a considerable time in hospital after a brutal injury on the rugby field. This leaves James Wheatley vulnerable. James Wheatley becomes paranoid and becomes too afraid to go to sleep. Driven mad, he ends up running out of the school in his pyjamas and is killed in a hit and run. Jonathan believes that it was his fault and begins to fear Richard Rokeby. It is on the last night of the school year that police are called to the school grounds. The headmaster has a heart attack. The cruel Latin professor has gone insane and has beaten his wife to death. The closeted history teacher has hanged himself. Michael has fallen to his death trying to stand up to Richard. The police break into a locked room where Richard and Jonathan are. Both boys are dead and one police officer has to break a window for air, as he is suffocated by an indescribable smell in the room. Nicholas ends up taking the blame for all of it, despite being innocent. Many decades later, an adult Nicholas tells his story to a journalist. However, he tells the journalist that if he publishes the story, Nicholas will ensure that his life is ruined.

Jandun is best known for his outspoken defense of Aristotelianism and his influence in the early Latin Averroist movement. Life Jandun was born in Reims, in the Champagne region of France, between 1280 and 1289, though the exact date is unknown. It is likely that he grew up in the small town of Jandun (modern day Signy-l'Abbaye). Jandun is known to have become a member of the arts faculty in Paris by 1310, likely by as early as 1307. While a professor in Paris, Jandun was well informed and involved with theological debates. In 1315 Jandun became an original member of the faculty at the College of Navarre and was in charge of 29 students. In 1316 Pope John XXII awarded Jandun a canonry of Senlis, and it is likely that he spent time there, though he continued to teach in Paris for the next ten years. Jandun identified closely with Marsilius of Padua, another Latin Averroist who was rector at the university in Paris from 1312-1313. Marsilius presented Jandun with a copy of Pietro d'Abano's commentary on the problems of Aristotle. On 19 June 1324 Jandun was involved in a business transaction to rent a house for life. Four days later Marsilius finished the Defensor Pacis. When it became known in 1326 that Marsilius had authored the Defensor Pacis, he and Jandun fled together to the court of Louis IV of Bavaria. Pope John XXII began issuing condemnations against Jandun from 6 September 1326 and finally excommunicated Jandun on 23 October 1327 as a heretic. Jandun accompanied Louis IV to Italy, and was present in Rome on 1 May 1328 when Louis IV was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. Louis appointed Jandun as Bishop of Ferrara. Ten weeks later Jandun was formally accepted as a member of Louis IV's court, and was given indefinite rations for three servants and three horses. Later that summer, around 31 August 1328, Jandun died in Todi, most likely en route to his new bishopric. Works Jandun is best known for his work on the agens sensus, the principle of individuation, and the priority of universal knowledge to particular knowledge. He also wrote on the theory of the vacuum, plurality of forms, form and matter, the soul, the intellect, as well as other topics relating to Aristotle. Because of his closeness to Marsilius of Padua, Jandun is often incorrectly credited with authoring or coauthoring the Defensor pacis. It is now generally accepted that he did not write it, but it is possible that Jandun advised Marsilius on the work.(there is a reference to this collaboration in R. Rubenstein \\"Aristotle's Children\\" p. 237). Jandun's works first appeared in manuscript beginning with a short quaestioin 1314, though he may have begun writing as early as 1310 or 1307. He is also the author of an encomnium to Paris (Tractatus de laudibus parisius), written in 1323, which gives a description of that city in the fourteenth century.An edition of the text, along with introductory notes and a translation, appears in Paris et ses historiens aux 14e et 15e si√®cles; documents et √©crits originaux recueillis et comment√©s par Le Roux de Lincy et L.M.

Legacy Jandun's work carried the Latin Averroist tradition from Paris to Bologna, Padua, and Erfurt in the fourteenth century, and Krakow in the fifteenth century. Jandun tended toward the views of Aristotle, but was not afraid to follow an idea to its logical conclusion. Many of his views were uncommon and controversial, and were not received well by the Catholic Church. Manuscripts and printed editions influenced the Latin Averroist movement until the time of Galileo. References *Gewirth, A. (1948). John of jandun and the defensor pacis.

It consists of five teams from New Brunswick and one team from Prince Edward Island, which make up the EastLink North Division (formerly Roger Meek), and six teams from Nova Scotia which make up the Eastlink South Division. The winner of the MHL playoffs competes for the Fred Page Cup against the winners of the Quebec Junior AAA Hockey League and the Central Junior A Hockey League. The winner of the Fred Page Cup then moves on to compete for the Canadian National Junior A Championship, formerly known as the Royal Bank Cup. History Originally known as the Metro Valley Junior Hockey League, the league was founded in 1967 by Fred McGillivray and Louie Lewis of Halifax, Nova Scotia and Don Stewart of Berwick, Nova Scotia as a Junior \\"B\\" level hockey league. Originally an exclusively Nova Scotia hockey league, it included six teams: East Hants Junior Penguins, Halifax Colonels, Dartmouth Hoyts, Windsor Royals, Kentville Riteways, and Berwick Shell Juniors. 1968 saw the Truro Bearcats and Amherst Ramblers replace the teams from Kentville and Berwick. In 1971‚Äì72 the New Glasgow Bombers and the Pictou Maripacs entered the league. Stellarton and a new Kentville franchise entered the league in 1973 and 1974 respectively. In 1977, still known as the \\"Metro Valley\\", the league entered into the Tier II Junior \\"A\\" level. The jump to Junior \\"A\\" was, in theory, to be a catalyst for the development of the league. However The budgets necessary to play at the Jr. 'A' level resulted in the immediate withdrawal of the Chester Ravens and the East Hants Penguins. The Cole Harbour Colts (Scotia Colts), who entered the league in 1976, became the first team in league history to host the national championship, then known as the Centennial Cup, in 1980. The 1983 season saw the addition of the expansion Moncton Midland Hawks of Moncton, New Brunswick, the league's first non-Nova Scotia team. The Hawks came from the New Brunswick Junior Hockey League and are now known as the Dieppe Commandos. In 1986, the league expanded to Antigonish and the Scotia Colts, again, hosted the Centennial Cup. The Summerside Western Capitals of the Island Junior Hockey League, Prince Edward Island's junior hockey league, hosted the 1989 Centennial Cup. In 1991, Summerside and Charlottetown of Prince Edward Island left the IJHL and joined the newly dubbed \\"Maritime Junior A Hockey League\\". The IJHL is still PEI's premier Junior league, but now is only a Junior \\"B\\" league. The winner of the IJHL's playoffs compete for the Don Johnson Cup, the Maritime Junior \\"B\\" Championship. For the 1996‚Äì97 season, the league added the Cape Breton Islanders and Restigouche River Rats. In 1996‚Äì97 the league consisted of the Amherst Ramblers, Antigonish Bulldogs, Charlottetown Abbies, East Hants Penguins, Dartmouth Oland Exports, Moncton Gagnon Beavers, Saint John Alpines, and Summerside Western Capitals. The Saint John Alpines folded in January. With financial losses totalling $40,000 and an additional $50,000 shortfall projected should the team finish the season, they simply ran out of money. The Summerside Western Capitals won the league's first ever national title. The Capitals hosted the Royal Bank Cup at Cahill Stadium and won the championship game 4‚Äì3 over the South Surrey Eagles. Truro and Bathurst received approval for new teams to start in 1997-98 but due to the relocation of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Laval Titan to Bathurst, the Truro Bearcats would be the sole new team. The Cape Breton Islanders moved to Glace Bay and became the Glace Bay Miners, but with the arrival of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Cape Breton Screaming Eagles, they folded in December of that season, leaving the league with nine teams again. During the 1998‚Äì99 season two teams changed their names. The first was the Dartmouth Oland Exports when they moved to the Halifax Forum to become the Halifax Oland Exports. The second was the 1998‚Äì99 MJAHL champions, the Restigouche River Rats, as they changed their name to the Campbellton Tigers.Old Logo A 10th team was added for the 2000‚Äì2001 season, the Miramichi Timberwolves. At the same time, the East Hants Penguins moved to Dartmouth and became the Scotia Dairy Queen Blizzard. At the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, the league approved the transfer of the Blizzard to Yarmouth. The Yarmouth Motormart Mariners began play in September 2002. In early 2003 the league governors approved expansion into Woodstock, N.B., with the Slammers beginning play in the 2003‚Äì04 season. The league hired its first professional full-time league president in 2003, Vernon Doyle. The league got their second national Championship when the Halifax Oland Exports won the 2002 Royal Bank Cup on home ice. One year later, after financial trouble with Oland Brewery, the franchise's name was changed to Halifax Team Pepsi. In the spring of 2004, the Weeks Hockey Organization bought the club, moved it to New Glasgow and renamed it the Pictou County Weeks Crushers. On that same day Halifax was granted an expansion franchise, the Halifax Wolverines. In the spring of 2008, the MJAHL had some big changes. On April 15, the Antigonish Bulldogs announced that they were applying for a leave of absence for one year.Hockeyscene.com ‚Äì Your Source For Hockey Information In Atlantic Canada On April 26, the Bulldogs had to choose between two groups trying to buy the team and relocate it. The first group would move the franchise to New Richmond, Quebec. The other group would relocate the team to the Halifax area. At the Board of Governors meeting that day, the proposal to relocate the Antigonish franchise to New Richmond, Quebec was not considered to be in the best interests of the league and its members. The Governors did leave the door open to the sale to a Halifax group and a move to Metro Halifax. The sale and relocation of the franchise to Halifax was later approved. At the same Governors meeting, in response to the decision to leave the door open on the sale of the Bulldogs, the owners of the Halifax Wolverines announced their plans to move to Bridgewater. The Governors voted on the decision and it was approved.Hockeyscene.com ‚Äì Your Source For Hockey Information In Atlantic Canada Following a name the team contest, the franchise was dubbed the Bridgewater Lumberjacks. Later that week on April 29, the Moncton Beavers announced that they had failed to come to terms on a new lease for the Tim Hortons 4-Ice centre and had subsequently moved themselves to the neighboring city of Dieppe. The team was renamed the Dieppe Commandos.MJAHL Rounding out this very busy month in the history of the MJAHL was the Charlottetown Abbies' decision on May 1 to apply for a leave of absence for one year, which was accepted.Charlottetown, The Guardian: Sports  Abbies taking break The Halifax franchise (former Antigonish Bulldogs) announced on August 22 that the club would be known as the Halifax Lions. This was the name of the successful Halifax team in the 1980s.Halifax Lions roar into the MJAHL In 2010, the MJAHL changed its name to the Maritime Junior Hockey League and unveiled a new logo. In 2011 the Halifax Lions moved to Dartmouth and were renamed the Metro Marauders. Two years later the Marauders were renamed the Metro Shipbuilders for the 2012‚Äì2013 season. That season was a disaster for the Shipbuilders, as they only recorded four wins in their 52-game schedule and averaged just 232 fans per game. The relocation rumours had them moving back to Halifax after three years in Dartmouth but they finally moved to Kentville and were renamed the Valley Wildcats. After one season in Kentville they moved to Berwick. In 2014 the league approved an expansion team in St. Stephen named the County Aces. As a result of the expansion, the league was back up to 12 teams for the first time since the folding of the Charlottetown Abbies in April 2008. In November 2014, the league took over the ownership of the Bridgewater Lumberjacks after owner Ken Petrie left the team because of financial trouble. The team was sold two weeks later to a local businessman and the team was renamed the South Shore Lumberjacks. In November 2016, the Dieppe Commandos announced they would be moving to Edmundston, New Brunswick after the 2016‚Äì2017 season, and be renamed the Edmundston Blizzard. In May 2018, the Woodstock Slammers applied for a leave of absence for the 2018-19 Season; the team is later sold and relocated to Grand Falls, New Brunswick and renamed the Grand Falls Rapids. In April 2019, the St. Stephen Aces were sold to a group from Fredericton, New Brunswick and became the third team in three years to relocate. The Aces relocated to Fredericton, New Brunswick for the 2019‚Äì20 MHL season and were renamed the Fredericton Red Wings. The current MHL has twelve teams, six in each division. The league has hosted the Royal Bank Cup and Centennial Cup seven times, winning twice. MHL teams have also won seven Fred Page Cups as the Junior \\"A\\" Eastern Canadian champions to earn the right to compete for the Royal Bank Cup.

In 1991, the Callaghan Cup became exclusive to the MJAHL.

Plot synopsis King Hedley II is the ninth play in August Wilson‚Äôs ten-play cycle that, decade by decade, examines African American life in the United States during the twentieth century. Set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1985, it tells the story of an ex-con in Pittsburgh trying to rebuild his life. The play has been described as one of Wilson's darkest, telling the tale of a man trying to save $10,000 by selling stolen refrigerators so that he can buy a video store, as well as revisiting stories of other characters initially presented in Seven Guitars. Hedley‚Äôs wish, now that he has returned to Pittsburgh from prison, is to support himself by selling refrigerators and to start a family. Set during the Reagan Administration, the play comments critically on the supply-side economics theories of the day, examining whether their stated aim of providing trickle- down benefits to all Americans truly improved the lot of urban African Americans. ;Characters * King Hedley II * Tonya, King Hedley II's wife * Ruby, King Hedley II's mother * Elmore, a southern hustler (and former boyfriend of Ruby) * Mister, friend * Stool Pigeon, a wise man and a prophet Notes on characters King Hedley II draws \\"on characters established in Seven Guitars, King Hedley II shows the shadows of the past reaching into the present.\\"\\"Overview\\" samuelfrench.com, accessed March 2, 2019 Some of the characters presented earlier include King Hedley II, \\"the spiritual son of King Hedley from Seven Guitars and Stool Pigeon, a \\"sixty-five year old harmonica player...now a newspaper-collecting history carrier\\".\\" King Hedley II, 2000\\" huntingtontheatre.org, accessed March 2, 2019 The character of Ruby was a \\"vivacious young newcomer to Pittsburgh\\" in Seven Guitars but in King Hedley II is \\"...overcome with worry and regret...\\".

The album is dedicated to the memory of former drummer Ingo Schwichtenberg, who committed suicide the previous year. Album description The Time of the Oath is a concept album. According to Andi Deris, it is based on the prophecies of Nostradamus, referring to the prophecies made for the years 1994 to 2000. Nostradamus' interpreters believe that he predicted a third World War followed by a millennium of peace if humans made the right choices. The album is meant to reflect the choices of humanity. The Keeper that appears on this album, having returned from the first two Keeper of the Seven Keys albums and later to return on the third, could represent God, or the stupidity of humanity in the form of the seventh trooper in the song \\"Before the War.\\" Instead of a space scene as on the cover of Keeper of the Seven Keys Part 1, the area under the Keeper's hood is filled with stars and a line of golden rings, in the fashion of Master of the Rings' artwork. The track \\"The Time of the Oath\\" reflects on Act V of Faust Part Two, written by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Andi Deris plays the part of Mephistopheles, reclaiming the soul of doctor Faust, whereas the Choir of the Orchestra \\"Johann Sebastian Bach\\", Hamburg, (conducted by Axel Bergstedt) sings the Dies irae from the traditional requiem, representing the angels rescuing Faust's lost soul. The album contains three singles: \\"Power\\", \\"The Time of the Oath\\", and \\"Forever And One (Neverland)\\".

Biography He was born Donald Rhys Hubert Peers in the Welsh mining town of Ammanford. His father was a colliery worker and a prominent member of the Plymouth Brethren who disapproved of the variety theatre, and never heard or saw his son work. Peers' family were hoping he would become a schoolteacher, but he had other ambitions and left home at the age of sixteen. Peers travelled around the country working as a house painter and, for a time, went to sea as a mess steward on ships. He met his wife in 1930 in Richmond, North Riding of YorkshireBefore 1/4/1974 it was the North Riding and they had a daughter, Sheila, in 1931. He joined a dance band as a singer and continued his day job as a painter. His first BBC Radio broadcast took place on 17 December 1927, with the popular comedy duo, Clapham and Dwyer. One of the songs he sang was, \\"In a Shady Nook by a Babbling Brook\\", which became his most requested song and, later, his signature tune. His London debut took place in a revue at the Bedford Theatre in 1929. He struggled on until 1933 when, after an appearance on the BBC Music Hall programme, he got a recording contract with HMV Records. In 1940 Peers enlisted in the Royal Army Service Corps as a clerk, where he served until D-Day in 1944, when he was invalided out. When in service, he entertained his fellow troops in shows. In 1944 he recorded \\"In a Shady Nook by a Babbling Brook\\", written by E.G. Nelson and Harry Pease in 1927. Other 1940s recordings included \\"I Can't Begin To Tell You\\", \\"Bow Bells\\", \\"Far Away Places\\", \\"On The 5.45\\" (a vocal version of \\"Twelfth Street Rag\\", with lyrics by Andy Razaf), \\"Powder Your Face With Sunshine\\" (one of his biggest successes), \\"Lavender Blue (Dilly Dilly)\\", \\"A Strawberry Moon (In A Blueberry Sky)\\", \\"Everywhere You Go\\", \\"Clancy Lowered the Boom\\", \\"It Happened in Adano\\", \\"A Rose in a Garden of Weeds\\", \\"I'll String Along with You\\" and \\"Down in the Glen\\". He toured in variety, building up quite a following in the provinces, and, in 1948, after a big break on BBC Radio, became a West End star. Henry Hall booked him with Billy Russell and Norman Wisdom for a new show called Buttons & Bows in 1949 and, in the same year, he performed his one-man show at the Royal Albert Hall and the London PalladiumTobler, John (1992). NME Rock 'N' Roll Years (1st ed.). London: Reed International Books Ltd. Peers appeared in the 1950 Royal Variety Performance. He was given his own radio show, Cavalier of Song, and had hits with, \\"On a Slow Boat to China\\". In the early 1960s Peers was given his own television programme, Donald Peers Presents, and, in that programme, he introduced Tom Jones and also scientist and writer Brian J. Ford, this time playing boogie piano. He appeared in several filmsIMDb.com including, The Balloon Goes Up (1942) and Sing Along with Me (1952), and continued recording with songs such as, \\"The Last Mile Home\\", \\"Dear Hearts and Gentle People\\", \\"Out of a Clear Blue Sky\\", \\"Music!

After several years at the top Peers left for Australia, where he stayed for two years. When he returned to the UK in 1968, his fans had all but forgotten him and he had to work back to stardom via the club circuit, which had taken over from the variety theatres. He made a comeback with \\"Please Don't Go\\" (a ballad set to the tune of Offenbach's \\"Barcarolle\\" from The Tales of Hoffmann), which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1969. Eddy Arnold had pop and country success with his cover version. This was followed by a string of singles and albums by Peers, but it was not until 1972 that he had another hit record with \\"Give Me One More Chance\\", which reached the UK Top 40. Donald Peers often sat in the garden of his Surrey home playing ukulele and singing while his wife and daughter worked on the plants in the garden. Peers died in a Hove nursing home on 9 August 1973 at the age of 65, with The Brighton & Hove Gazette and Herald announcing his demise. He was cremated in the Downs Crematorium, Brighton.

The village is best known for serving as a hiding place for the Norwegian royal family and Cabinet and sustaining German bombing during the German conquest of Norway. The town is also the birthplace of award-winning Norwegian writer and translator Tormod Haugen. General information Location Nybergsund is located a few kilometres south of the municipality's administrative center Innbygda. The village is built on the eastern banks of the Trysilelva (Trysil River), which is a segment of the larger river known in Sweden as Klar√§lven. Nybergsund is located roughly away from Norway's border with Sweden. Name Nybergsund was named after a local farm, Nyberg, and the element -sund, meaning strait. In the village's early days, the site of Nyberg farm was used as a harbor for ferries that went along Trysilelva. History World War II alt=A stone monument in a forest clearing, adorned with a plaque and small Norwegian flag Two nights after the invasion of Norway, on 11 April 1940, King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav, and the fleeing Norwegian government sought refuge in Nybergsund. Previously, they had been staying in the nearby town of Elverum to the southeast, where the Elverum Authorization was made that gave absolute power to the executive branch after the Parliament of Norway could no longer safely convene in Oslo. It was in Nybergsund that King Haakon met with his Cabinet, telling them of the ultimatum he received when he had met with German Minister to Norway, Curt Br√§uer. The minister had urged him to follow the example of his brother Christian X of Denmark and capitulate, appointing the fascist leader Vidkun Quisling as the new Norwegian Prime Minister. King Haakon had already refused the minister's demands, despite threats of harsh conditions for Norway if he did not comply, but he also said that he could not give a decision until he consulted with the government ministers, who had the final word. In an emotional meeting with the Cabinet, King Haakon said that he felt it was against his duty as king and the will of the Norwegian people to give in to the demands, but he would abdicate so as not to stand in the way if the Government decided otherwise. Within hours, the Cabinet had made their decision to not capitulate. They reached Minister Br√§uer by telephone that night to inform him of their decision. They also broadcast a message to the Norwegian people on NRK, reiterating their decision and promising that Norway would resist the invasion for as long as possible. Nybergsund was bombed by Luftwaffe aircraft at about 17:00 the next day, on 11 April 1940. No-one was killed in the attack, but a number of buildings were destroyed, among them a local co-op, school, and telephone exchange office. When the bombing began, the royal family and cabinet ministers fled from their hotel out into the snow-covered forest nearby. The government then continued farther north towards Molde, where they were picked up by ship to Troms√∏, which would later become the provisional capital until the country was completely under Germany's control in June 1940. After the war, the area of forest that the royal family and cabinet sought refuge in became a park known as Kongeparken (The King Park). In 1946, King Haakon presented the park with a stone monument commemorating the bombing, and the event drew over 8,000 people. In 1990, on the 50th anniversary of the bombing, King Olav V unveiled a bust of his father, Haakon, to sit alongside the monument. Prime Minister Jan P. Syse and President of Parliament Jo Benkow were also in attendance. And in 1996, almost exactly fifty years after the first monument was erected, King Harald V and Queen Sonja gave the park a bust of his father, Olav, thus commemorating all the royal family members who had sought shelter in the forest during the attack. In a 2005 interview from Aftenposten with King Harald V, he said of the Nybergsund meeting: \\"Of all the decisions made by the Cabinet, it is the one in Nybergsund on 10 April 1940 that is most important and significant for the Norwegian people in all 100 years of the monarchy.\\" Industry Due to its location along the river Trysilelva, Nybergsund has attracted quite a few industries in the area. In 1957, Trysil Interi√∏rtre, a wood processing business, began operations at a plant just across the Nybergsund Bridge on the west bank of Trysilelva. The location was chosen because of the ease of transporting logs downriver. The plant initially produced particle board, but has since changed its production slightly and now produces laminated and veneered components for furniture as well as fire-resistant wall linings for construction. Another industry that takes advantage of Trysilelva is Sagnfossen Power Plant, located about south of Nybergsund. The Kaplan turbine- based hydroelectric power plant was built in 1945 and now generates of power per year for its owner, Eidsiva vannkraft. The plant is one of three on the Norwegian side of the river. alt=A small building with \\"Bakeri\\" written on a sign over the door In 1997, a small dairy opened up in Nybergsund called TINE Meieriet Trysil. The dairy, which specializes in pultost and skj√∏rost, has 13 employees and processes of milk into cheese yearly. Nybergsund was also home to a bakery that was in operation until the 1980s. The bakery building, located in the village center, has since been turned into part of the Trysil/Engerdal museum, and occasionally holds bakery days where local residents get together and bake traditional recipes. The village also features some local retail businesses, such as a convenience store, a tailor, an auto repair shop, and a gas station with a post office inside it (post i butikk). Transportation alt=A bridge with three wooden arches, spanning a river Riksvei 26 is the central road in Nybergsund, extending north towards Innbygda and south towards the Swedish border, where it becomes Riksv√§g 62. Riksvei 25 lies just north of the village, and it runs east towards √òstby and southwest towards T√∏rberget. Both roads cross Trysilelva at the newly built Nybergsund Bridge. The original bridge was built of wood in 1929 and then was rebuilt out of steel in 1949. The old bridge was very narrow and traffic could only pass one way at a time, regulated by traffic lights, so in 2004, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration commissioned a new one to be built just north of the old site. The bridge, which was completed on 24 August 2005, cost 19.5 million kroner and uses a wooden arch design. The old bridge is still in operation but has been downgraded to a municipal road. The village is also served by a local bus route, Trysilekspressen (The Trysil Express). The service, managed by Boreal Transport, runs busses between Trysil and Oslo several times per day. Recreation Nybergsund I.F. playing against alt=Two football teams in a stadium, the away team celebrating The village has a local football team, Nybergsund I.L., that was founded in 1918. It currently plays in the Norwegian Second Division, having been relegated from Adeccoligaen in 2011. They play at Nybergsund Stadion on Idrettsvegen. The stadium features artificial turf and seating for up to 1,500 spectators. Aside from the stadium, there are also sports facilities at the local Nybergsund School, including a small football field, basketball court, and skateboard ramp. There are many marked hiking trails in the area that lead up to local mountains such as Klank, which rises to above sea level at its peak. During the summer, the bathing area at the lake Tj√∏nna is very popular, with public facilities such as picnic tables, changing rooms, bathrooms, and a beach volleyball court. On the west side of Trysilelva there is Trysil Skytterlag, a shooting range with a covered firing point. The village also has a community center that regularly hosts events such as bingo and concerts. Trysilfjellet mountain and the associated ski resort owned by Skistar is also very close to Nybergsund, lying just to the northwest. The ski resort is the largest in Norway, featuring 31 lifts and 66 different slopes. The resort is popular mainly because of its relatively close proximity to Oslo, with about two and a half hours of travel time by car each way.

He was born in 1872 in Newark, New Jersey. He worked with Thomas Edison before attending Rutgers University, from which he obtained a B.S. in chemistry in 1894. His major contribution in the field of chemical engineering was the development of the Dorr classifier which became a practical method for the separation and chemical treatment of fine solids suspended in liquid. This technology was used in sewage treatment, water purification, de-silting projects, minerals milling, and sugar production. He founded the Dorr Company in 1916. In the early 1950s, Dorr postulated that at night and when rain, snow or fog impaired vision, drivers hugged the white lines painted in the middle of highways. Dorr believed this led to numerous accidents and that painting a white line along the outside shoulders of the highways would save lives. Dorr convinced highway engineers in Westchester County, New York, to test his theory along a stretch of highway with curves and gradients. The decrease in accidents was dramatic and a follow-up test in Connecticut had similar results. Dorr then used his own foundation to publicize the demonstration's results. Dorr was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Scott Medal in 1916, the Chemical Industry Medal in 1938, and the Perkin Medal by the Society of Chemical Industry in 1941. He was the benefactor of several major philanthropies, as well as founding his own charity, the Dorr Foundation.

However, the WWE then WWF held three wrestling house shows at the rink in 1993 with wrestlers such as The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Randy Savage, Razor Ramon, Diesel, Ted Dibiase and Yokozuna appearing. As with concerts the WWE now does all of its Newcastle shows in the larger Utilita Arena. In 2005, the ice rink was used to film BBC sitcom Thin Ice. Even though the series was set in Derby, Whitley Bay Ice Rink was chosen because the production company had used the venue on numerous occasions in the past. Although reference is made to Whitley Bay as the host of the British Championships in the programme, no mention is made in the credits. In 2006, the ice rink was criticized by local authorities after demonstrating exceedingly poor fire regulations when a blaze was discovered. Skaters continued on the ice whilst the fire escalated. 2008 saw the rink undertake several improvements, such as new barriers and plexi glass, bench doors for hockey players and a new Zamboni (an ice resurfacer). The Newcastle Vipers played their remaining home games at Whitley Bay ice rink due to the Utilita Arena not participating in holding sports events anymore. This stopped when the Vipers ceased operation at the end of the 2010/11 season.

Scott Fitzgerald that was first published in Metropolitan magazine in December 1922 and later collected in All the Sad Young Men in 1926. The story, frequently anthologized, is regarded as one of Fitzgerald's finest works \\"for poignantly portraying the loss of youthful illusions.\\" In the Fitzgerald canon, the story is considered to be in the \\"Gatsby-cluster\\" as many of its themes were later expanded upon in his famous novel The Great Gatsby in 1925. Writing his editor Max Perkins in June 1925, Fitzgerald described \\"Winter Dreams\\" as \\"a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea.\\"  Background  The short story was based upon Fitzgerald's unsuccessful romantic pursuit of socialite Ginevra King. A wealthy heiress from a Chicago banking family, Ginevra enjoyed a privileged upbringing and was feted in the Chicago social scene as a member of the elite \\"Big Four\\" debutantes during World War I. While teenagers, Ginevra and Fitzgerald met at a sledding party and shared an unconsummated romance from 1915 to 1917, but their budding relationship soon ended when Ginevra's imperious father, Charles G. King, publicly humiliated the impressionable young writer and bluntly told him that \\"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.\\" Heeding her father's advice, Ginevra spurned Fitzgerald due to his lack of financial prospects. Fitzgerald later claimed that Ginevra had rejected him \\"with the most supreme boredom and indifference.\\" Purportedly, \\"Fitzgerald was so smitten by King that for years he could not think of her without tears coming to his eyes.\\"  Plot summary  Dexter Green is a middle-class young man born in rural Minnesota who aspires to be part of the \\"old money\\" elite of the American Midwest. His father owns the second most profitable grocery store in the town. To earn money, Dexter works part-time as a teenage caddy at a golf club in Black Bear Lake, Minnesota, where he meets the eleven-year-old Judy Jones. He quits his job rather than be Judy's caddy as he cannot abide acting as one of her obsequious servants. After college, Dexter becomes involved in a partnership in a laundry business. He returns to the Sherry Island Golf Club and is invited to play golf with the affluent men for whom he once caddied. He encounters Judy Jones again on the golf course, only now she is older and more beautiful. Later in the evening on Black Bear Lake, Dexter swims to a raft where he encounters Judy who is piloting a motor boat. She asks him to drive the boat while she rides on an attached surfboard. After this encounter, Judy invites Dexter to dinner, and a romance blossoms. However, he soon discovers that he is merely one of a dozen beaus whom she is clandestinely romancing. After eighteen months, while Judy is vacationing in Florida, Dexter becomes engaged to Irene Scheerer, a kind-hearted but ordinary-looking girl. When Judy returns, however, she again ensnares Dexter's affections and asks him to marry her. Dexter breaks off his engagement with Irene, only to be unceremoniously dropped again by Judy a month later. Unable to cope with this recurrent heartbreak, Dexter joins the American Expeditionary Forces to fight in the Great War. Seven years later, Dexter has become a successful businessman in New York. He has become wealthy but hasn't visited his home in years. One particular day, a Detroit man named Devlin visits Dexter on a business pretext. During the meeting, Devlin reveals that Judy Simms‚Äîformerly Judy Jones‚Äîis the wife of one his friends. Devlin recounts how Judy's beauty has faded, and her husband treats her callously. This news demoralizes Dexter as he still loves Judy. Later Dexter realizes that his dream is gone and that he can never return home.  Critical response  Fitzgerald biographer Matthew Bruccoli described \\"Winter Dreams\\" as \\"the strongest of the Gatsby-cluster stories.\\" He continues: Scholar Tim Randell has asserted that \\"Winter Dreams\\" should be regarded as a crowning literary achievement as Fitzgerald \\"achieves a dialectical metafiction\\" in which he deftly criticizes \\"class relations and print culture.\\" Fitzgerald's short story \\"identifies ruling class interests as the collective origin of meaning and 'reality' for the entire social body\\" and \\"conveys the possibility of counter, collective meanings\\" driven by class antagonism. Randell argues that the story chronicles a young man's alienation with modernity due to a \\"lack of communal meaning\\" and his self-conscious descent into despair and melancholy.

The aircraft was constructed of welded steel tubing, covered in fabric. The wings were made of wood and fabric covered. The prototype first flew on 21 June 1929, and was tested on a simulated carrier deck in Norfolk, Virginia. It was found satisfactory, allaying concerns about problems due to the rather long cowling over the engine.

It is located approximately southeast of Stettler, Alberta. Although Endiang enjoyed fair prosperity in the early years of the 20th century, the Great Depression, World War II, and better transportation have led to the depopulation of the local farming community, and with it, of the hamlet. In former years, Endiang was home to a post office, two general stores, two hardware stores, bank, train station, grain elevators, hotel and pool hall, gas station, tractor dealership, lumber yard, and all the other establishment expected in most communities. Today, Endiang is still home to a community hall and a restaurant. Its population in 2011 was 35. The hamlet is located in census division No. 7 and in the federal riding of Crowfoot.  History  A little known fact about Endiang is that during the cold war it was considered the place most likely for conflict between the U.S.S.R. and the U.S.A. to begin. If the Soviet Union were to have fired a missile first, and the American military were to respond, it was considered likely that the two missiles would collide over Endiang. This fact was immortalised in the poem \\"Armageddon at Endiang, Alberta\\". An interesting bit of history is that the original settlement of Endiang was located about 5 kilometers northeast of the present hamlet and was established by William Foreman on his homestead in 1910. It was named for a summer resort hotel the Foreman family owned in the Muskoka Lakes region of Ontario, named \\"Endiang,\\" from the Anishinaabe language Endaayaang, meaning \\"our home\\".Freelang Ojibwe Dictionary The tiny settlement included a post office, store and hall. When the CNR built a railroad through the area in 1925 it missed the original settlement, so with the aid of horse power the buildings were moved to the new site of Endiang. Endiang is also notable for being the home to the Shaben family, some of whom were involved in the establishment of the first mosque in Alberta. NHL hockey player Darcy Tucker who played for Montreal, Tampa Bay, Toronto and Colorado was raised at Endiang and his family still resides there. The history of the Endiang area was first recorded in local author Jean James' book This Was Endiang.Jean James - This Was Endiang In 2002 the history of the area was updated with family histories included in the book \\"Endiang - Our Home\\". The latest 650 page history book was the project of the Endiang History Book Committee. The Endiang community celebrated their Centennial on July 23‚Äì25, 2010.  Geography  Endiang is located on a plain bounded by ranges of hills to the west and south, and by Sullivan Lake, a large alkali lake to the east. The Chain Lakes lie to the southwest. Its geography and climate is similar to that of most other prairie areas of East-Central and Southern Alberta, experiencing cold winters broken up by Chinook winds, and warm, dry summers. In recent years, Endiang has experienced both extreme droughts and extreme wet conditions, having a great impact on the local farming community, although this sort of weather pattern is typical of other such areas found in Palliser's Triangle. Endiang's closest neighbor is the small hamlet of Byemoor, located about to the west. Together the two communities are commonly referred to as \\"Endmoor\\".  Demographics  As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Endiang recorded a population of 15 living in 8 of its 16 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 35.

History Migdalim was first established in 1984 as a pioneer Nahal military outpost, and demilitarized when turned over to residential purposes in 1986 to non- Orthodox Jewish Israelis. One of the reasons for choosing this location was to provide a continuity of settlements along the Trans-Samaria Highway between Kfar Tapuah on the \\"mountain spine\\" and Ma'ale Efrayim in the Jordan Valley.

By the nineteenth century, La Pergola was performing operas of the best-known composers of the day including Vincenzo Bellini, Gaetano Donizetti and Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi's Macbeth was given its premiere performance at the Pergola in 1847. The Pergola's present appearance dates from an 1855‚Äì57 remodelling; it has the traditional horseshoe-shaped auditorium with three rings of boxes and topped with a gallery. It seats 1,000. It was declared a national monument in 1925 and has been restored at least twice since. Today the theatre presents a broad range of about 250 drama performances each year, ranging from Moli√®re to Neil Simon. Opera is only presented there during the annual Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Tommaso Sacchi is the Chairman of Fondazione Teatro della Toscana - Teatro della Pergola.

Origins Haigh Foundry was established in the Douglas Valley in Haigh around 1790 by Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres and his brother Robert, as an ironworks and foundry. The ironworks was not a success but the foundry was, particularly after Robert Daglish became chief engineer in 1804, and the works acquired a reputation for manufacturing winding engines and pumping equipment for the coal mining industry. The foundry was leased by E.Evans and T.C.Ryley in 1835 for 21 years. The partners intended to produce railway locomotives and were later joined by a Mr Burrows. In 1855 Haigh Foundry and Brock Mill Forge were offered for lease. They had manufactured some of \\"the largest pumping engines and the most powerful factory engines in the kingdom\\" in the previous decade. The iron works, on the bank of the River Douglas, consisted of a foundry, five cupola furnaces, three air furnaces for making the largest castings and another foundry for smaller pieces. Also on site were blacksmiths' and pattern-makers' shops, office, drawing shop, the foreman's house, boiler yard and iron warehouse. A water wheel driven by the river powered the machinery, line shafts and furnace blasts. The forge was powered by water and steam. Part of the works where spade making was carried out had Naysmyth steam hammers and a rolling mill. Also for lease was the firebrick and tile works which used fire clay from a nearby pit and had a kiln, drying sheds and a steam powered grinding wheels. The manager's house and cottages for workers were part of the lease. A railway line connecting it to the Lancashire and Yorkshire and London and North Western Railways was being built. Locomotives and other products Lancashire's first three steam locomotives were built here in 1812, 1815 and 1816 for John Clarke's Winstanley Colliery Railway at Orrell. In 1819, the firm built an 84\\" cylinder Cornish beam engine and beam engines were also exported to the colonies before 1820. After 1835 the foundry produced and type locomotives, many subcontracted from Edward Bury and Company. In 1837 Ajax was supplied to the Leicester and Swannington Railway, followed by Hector, an , a design so powerful that orders were received from a number of other railways. The company built two broad gauge locomotives for the Great Western Railway with upward gearing in 1838 but these were not successful and the gearing was removed around 1840. Four more s for the South Devon Railway were built to a design by Daniel Gooch in the 1850s (Damon, Falcon, Orion and Priam). The works continued to build locomotives on their own account, and under sub-contract. Among these were long boiler types for Jones and Potts and three for T.R.Crampton. In 1855 two locomotives for use in the Crimean War, capable of hauling guns up inclines as steep as 1 in 10, were reputed to have been built with horizontal cylindrical furnaces, rather than rectangular fireboxes, and boilers fed by force pumps. They were described as having outside cylinders driving the third set of wheels, while two pairs of wheels were flangeless.Lowe, J.W., (1989) British Steam Locomotive Builders, Guild Publishing The description given here is from the only reference to them from an unreliable list produced in the 1890s. No such engines were recorded in the Crimea, and it is probable they were never built.Jack, Harry, (2008) Railway Archive No 18 pp66-70 When the lease expired in 1856, Haigh Foundry had built over 100 locomotives, produced swing bridges for Hull Docks, ironwork for the Albert Dock in Liverpool and some massive pumping engines. The pumping engine for Mostyn Colliery, Flintshire weighing 30 tons was 17 feet long and had a 100\\" bore cylinder and it is believed that when built in 1848, it was the largest cylinder in the world. Bettisfield Colilery at welshcoalmines.co.uk In 1849 the company delivered about 1000 yards of 40 inch cast-iron water pipes for the Manchester Corporation Waterworks Scheme in the Longdendale Chain. Birley & Thompson The new leasees, Birley & Thompson, concentrated on heavy engineering but made at least two locomotives and quoted unsuccessfully for the Festiniog Railway's 'Prince' class. The company produced stationary engines including a 100\\" x 14 ft stroke beam engine for the Talargoch Lead Mine (the engine house survives) and a 1000 h.p. McNaught compound beam engine for a cotton spinning mill. Other examples were supplied to many Lancashire collieries. Until 1860, everything that Haigh Foundry made had to be hauled up the steep and twisting Leyland Mill Lane. Teams of up to 48 horses were needed, many hired from local farmers. However a railway line was built from the Earl of Crawford & Balcarres' colliery network at Aspull in 1860 and was replaced in 1869 by a link from the Lancashire Union Railway's 'Whelley' loop. The foundry designed and built large winding, pumping and mill engines, heavy engineering and architectural castings until early 1885. The firm's assets were sold in September of that year. Many of the foundry buildings survive along with two cast iron bridges used by the works railway line. Part of the premises is still an iron foundry, though on a somewhat smaller scale.

Originally from K≈çzuke Province, and later centered in Inaba Province, the clan claimed descendance from the Seiwa Genji line, and from Minamoto no Yoshishige in particular. The clan took its name from the village of Yamana in present-day Gunma Prefecture. They were valued retainers under Minamoto no Yoritomo, and counted among his gokenin. The Yamana were among the chief clans in fighting for the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate, and thus remained valued and powerful under the new government. They were Constables of five provinces in 1363, and eleven a short time later. However, members of the Yamana clan rebelled against the shogunate in the Meitoku Rebellion of 1391 and lost most of their land. Yamana S≈çzen (1404 - 1473), likely the most famous member of the clan, would regain these lands in 1441. Through all of this the clan managed to somehow retain a great degree of reputation and power within the shogunate government; along with the Hosokawa and Hatakeyama clans, they served as agents of the shogunate in resolving various disputes. S≈çzen would then become embroiled in a conflict with Hosokawa Katsumoto over naming the sh≈çgun's successor; this conflict grew into the ≈ånin War, which destroyed much of Kyoto, and led to the fall of the shogunate and beginning of the Sengoku period. In the end this cost the Yamana much of their former influence and land. By the end of the 16th century, the Yamana had been reduced to holding the better part of Inaba Province. That area would be retained by the Yamana even until the end of the Edo period.

His brother Joaqium Alemao, who was then Minister in the Government of Goa, also lost as he could not retain his Cuncolim constituency. Churchill Alemao's daughter Valanka and Joaquim's son Yuri also lost the 2012 elections. All four candidates from the Alemao family suffered defeat. Churchill Alemao later blamed the then Chief Minister of Goa, Digambar Kamat and the Electronic Voting Machines for his defeat. Entry into the All India Trinamool Congress In 2014, after his daughter Valanka Alemao was denied candidature by the Indian National Congress party in the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha from the South Goa, Alemao resigned from the Indian National Congress and announced that he would contest the polls as an independent candidate. Two days later, Alemao joined the All India Trinamool Congress party and was formally inducted in the party by Madan Mitra, a Minister of State in the Government of West Bengal. He contested the elections to the 16th Lok Sabha from the South Goa (Lok Sabha constituency) as a candidate of the All India Trinamool Congress and was defeated by Narendra Keshav Sawaikar of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Alemao polled 11,941 votes in these elections. Joining Nationalist Congress Party On 17 October 2016 Alemao joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and declared his intent to contest the election on the NCP ticket.

These devices employ a variety of transmission technologies and physical media (wireless, copper wire, fiber-optic cable, coaxial cable). The extender forwards traffic between LANs transparent to higher network-layer protocols over distances that far exceed the limitations of standard Ethernet. Options Extenders that use copper wire include 2- and 4-wire variants using unconditioned copper wiring to extend a LAN. Network extenders use various methods (line encodings), such as TC-PAM, 2B1Q or DMT, to transmit information. While transmitting over copper wire does not allow for the speeds that fiber-optic transmission does, it allows the use of existing voice-grade copper or CCTV coaxial cable wiring. Copper-based Ethernet extenders must be used on unconditioned wire (without load coils), such as unused twisted pairs and alarm circuits. Connecting a private LAN between buildings or more distant locations is a challenge. Wi-Fi requires a clear line-of-sight, special antennas, and is subject to weather. If the buildings are within 100m, a normal Ethernet cable segment can be used, with due consideration of potential grounding problems between the locations. Up to 200m, it may be possible to set up an ordinary Ethernet bridge or router in the middle, if power and weather protection can be arranged. Fiber optic connection is ideal, allowing connections of over a km and high speeds with no electrical shock or surge issues, but is technically specialized and expensive for both the end equipment interfaces and the cable. Damage to the cable requires special skills to repair or total replacement. Specialized equipment can inter-connect two LANs over a single twisted pair of wires, such as the Moxa IEX Series, Cisco LRE (Long Reach Ethernet), Enable-IT Ethernet Extender Experts VDSL2, Patton CopperLink or EtherWAN Ethernet Extenders using VDSL technology. Distances of 300 m (1000 feet) at 50 Mbit/s up to at 128 kbit/s is possible. Westermo DDW products are capable of 10 miles at 30.3Mbit/s using SHDSL technology. Coaxial cable are often permitting higher speeds and larger distances than twisted pair wires. The equipment is mostly simple to operate, and the connection wire is common, cheap and maintainable. Ordinary ADSL modems cannot be connected back-to-back, because the ATU-R (ADSL Termination Unit - Remote) units that are used by customers require specialized ATU-C (Central Office) support provided by phone company equipment, usually by a complex and expensive DSLAM (DSL access multiplexer). However some symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL) modems such as the SpeedStream 5851 can be connected back-to-back, allowing upload and download speeds of about 2Mbit/s over substantial distances, using a simple twisted pair of wires. Back-to-back operation may also be possible with single-pair high-speed digital subscriber line (G.SHDSL) modems. Similar technologies were standardized as Ethernet in the first mile: * 2BASE-TL ‚Äî Full-duplex long reach Point-to-Point link over voice-grade copper wiring. 2BASE-TL PHY can deliver a minimum of 2 Mbit/s and a maximum of 5.69 Mbit/s over distances of up to 2700 m (9,000 ft), using ITU-T G.991.2 (G.SHDSL.bis) technology over a single copper pair. * 10PASS-TS ‚Äî Full-duplex short reach Point-to-Point link over voice-grade copper wiring. 10PASS-TS PHY can deliver a minimum of 10 Mbit/s over distances of up to 750 m (2460 ft), using ITU-T G.993.1 (VDSL) technology over a single copper pair.

A field may also be an area left to lie fallow or as arable land. Many farms have a field border, usually composed of a strip of shrubs and vegetation, used to provide food and cover necessary for the survival of wildlife. It has been found that these borders may lead to an increased variety of animals and plants in the area, but also in some cases a decreased yield of crops. Paddock Rotational grazing with pasture divided into paddocks, each grazed in turn for a short period A Black sheep on a New Zealand paddock with Lake Rotorua in the background In Australian and New Zealand English, any agricultural field may be called a paddock, especially if for keeping sheep or cattle. If stock are grazed there, the space may be called a run, e.g. sheep run; cattle run.The Macquarie Dictionary run n. Def. 113 The term paddock is used more specifically in animal husbandry for a system in which grazing land is divided into small areas, paddocks, and the stock graze each paddock in turn for a short period. Paddock grazing systems may be designed with, for example, 6 or 11 paddocks used in rotation. A paddock is normally fenced, usually by wire, and often defined by its natural boundaries, or is otherwise considered distinct. A back paddock is a smaller field that is situated away from the farm house; possibly land of lesser quality.definition of 'B-1', part of Australia Decoded at artistwd.com The equivalent concept in North America and the UK is a pasture. In Australia the word seems to have had its current meaning since at least 1807 and in New Zealand since at least 1842. However, the English meaning of \\"field\\" was used earlier in Australia and is still occasionally used. Similarly, meadow was in early use and has appeared later, for example, in 2004. Field remains in regular use in Australasia in expressions such as football field, Field Day and field trip. In a new style of intensive farming developed in North America, a paddock is a small (perhaps 1 acre) temporary subdivision of a pasture made with electric fencing, which is intensely grazed for a day and then left to rest for perhaps 80 days or more.

The monastery is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History Exterior of the priory church Wall paintings in the priory church It was founded between 950 and 960 by the Burgundy royal family and especially by Queen Bertha of Burgundy. In 965, the Empress Adelaide placed the priory under Cluny Abbey. On 2 February 1033, Emperor Conrad II held an assembly, was elected, and crowned King of Burgundy at the abbey.C.W. Previt√©-Orton, Early History of the House of Savoy, (Cambridge University Press, 1912), 32. In the first half of the 12th century, the monks falsified a number of documents as \\"Testament of Queen Bertha\\". With the fake documents they appropriated a number rights that they were not entitled to exercise. The priory was first directly managed by the two abbots from Cluny, Odilo and Maiolus, both of whom lived several times in Payerne. Starting in 1050, Cluny pulled back slightly from directly administering the priory, and the local prior led the monastery with increasing independence. The monks tried, based on the forged documents to gain the freedom to choose their own priors. Although this project failed, they loosened their ties to Cluny Abbey. The reforming Cluniac, Saint Ulrich of Zell, was prior here in the later 11th century. From the end of the 13th century, the monastery was in conflict with the city. While the city formally recognized the sovereignty of the prior after the receipt of the town charter in 1348, in fact, he possessed no real power. Beginning in 1444, the antipope Felix V raised the priory to an abbey. However, this new status was only recognized at the local level and not by their religious superiors or the Roman Curia. This elevation brought no benefits to the monastery. Starting in 1445, it was administered by the Commandry Abbot, who was under the vicar general of Payerne. In 1512 it was brought under the dean of the monastery of Sainte-Chapelle in Chamb√©ry. The monastery was under the protection of the kings of Burgundy and the Holy Roman Emperor, but the Abbot of Cluny retained the right to choose the kastvogt or ecclesiastical bailiff. The office of kastvogt was first held by the Counts of Burgundy, whose last representative, William IV, was murdered in 1127 in Payerne. After that, it was held by the Z√§hringers in the early 12th century, followed by the Montagny family, then the Savoys starting in 1240 and after 1282 by the emperor. In 1314 the office of the kastvogt went again to the Savoy family who held the office until the Protestant Reformation. After the reformation, the bailiff was appointed by the Canton of Vaud and a local governor. The Reformation and the weakening of Savoy power led to the dissolution of the monastery. The nearby cities of Bern and Fribourg began to exercise influence in Payerne and on the priory. The Protestant Bern supported a small community of Reformed citizens, while the catholic Fribourg declared itself the guardian of the monastery. After the Bernese conquest of Vaud, Bern won the upper hand. In 1536 they dissolved the priory and acquired the building of the monastery as well as a portion of its rights and property. Fribourg took in the monks and other catholic believers from Payerne. At the priory, some of the buildings were demolished, the remainder put to various secular uses: a bell foundry in the 17th century, a grain store in the 18th and later as a prison and barracks. At the end of the 19th century it was placed under protection because of its exceptional cultural value. At the beginning of the 20th century restoration began on the buildings and in 1926 a preservation society was founded to support this work. Priory buildings View of the nave looking toward the choir Archaeological excavations have led to new insights into the first church, which was built in the 10th century. In 960 it was expanded following the model of the Church of Cluny and the entrance hall was extended. A second building phase began in the middle of the 11th century, which brought the church to approximately its current appearance. A new nave was added around 1070-80. Later, the church received four turrets and a ring of gables around the Gothic bell tower. The interior of the church was decorated with paintings around the entrance in 1200, and to the choir by 1454. Several of the columns are decorated with roman capitals. When convent buildings became the seat of the Bernese bailiff in the 16th century, they were converted and renovated on a large scale. Again in the 19th century, they were converted when the buildings were used by the school administration.

Welch (July 1, 1965October 16, 2008) was an English painter, illustrator, cartoonist, and art professor who lived in Chicago, Illinois, United States. He billed himself as \\"Patrick W. Welch, Painter of Hate,\\" a spoof/homage to Thomas Kinkade, Painter of Light.  Career  Welch was born a king in Billericay, England, and attended state schools. He earned a BA in graphic design from the Norwich School of Art in 1987 and an MA in illustration from the Royal College of Art in 1991. In 1993 Welch gained cult status for \\"The Hippogryph Files,\\" a series of graphic short stories that appeared in The Baffler, Pulse!, and numerous comics anthologies, as well as being printed as postcards. Welch shared a London studio with illustrator Mikey Georgeson, better known as The Vessel from the indie-pop band David Devant & His Spirit Wife. In 1995 Welch moved to the United States with his American wife, Carrie Golus. During the 1990s Welch and Golus co-edited a short-lived comics anthology, Thurn & Taxis. Welch taught sequential art at Savannah College of Art and Design in Savannah, Georgia, from 1995 to 1998. In 1998 Welch moved to Chicago, where he became a professor of media arts and animation at the Illinois Institute of Art ‚Äì Chicago. Beginning in 1998, Welch collaborated with Golus on a series of non-fiction political/social comics for the alternative weekly newspaper Newcity as well as a comic strip, \\"Alternator,\\" which ran in The Stranger, UR Chicago, and other alternative weeklies. Beginning in 2001, Welch began to gain recognition for his painting. His solo painting exhibitions at Gescheidle Gallery in Chicago, where he was represented from 2002 until his death in 2008, included Revenge: The Miniature Hate Paintings of Patrick W. Welch (2002), Patrick W. Welch versus The Village of Schaumburg: Miniature Redemption Paintings (2004), Art Destroys: More Miniature Hate Paintings and Mini-Insult Blocks from Patrick W. Welch (2005), and I now know more than you ever will (2008), which was his final exhibition. Welch's paintings were often autobiographical, combining violent subject matter with black humour. He is perhaps best known for his \\"Miniature Hate Paintings,\\" which evoke a strange combination of childhood nightmare and adult neurosis, drawing on references from contemporary fine art, comic books, and science fiction. His \\"Miniature Insult Blocks,\\" painted on 1\\" x 2\\" blocks of wood, detailed English playground childhood insults in, according to Welch's description, \\"the saccahrine colours of boiled sweets.\\" Commenting in Chicago's Newcity critic Michael Workman writes: \\"Welch has been on a ride into the infinite regress of his distaste for human existence for years now, and it's a testament to his obduration that he's managed to keep lively each self-reference as the fecal discharge of famous mainstream artists. Most successful, however, are the grid of even tinier acrylic panels, \\"Mini Insult Blocks\\" as he calls them, each emblazoned with an insulting word such as plonker or bumbandit. Every time I encounter these paintings, it's never the frothy sense of loathing that wins me over, but the undeniable, laugh-out-loud funny humor of them all, an aspect of the work that no doubt has the capacity to elevate them even further into that stratosphere of the imaginary world beyond.\\" Sporting career Though not a naturally gifted sportsman, Patrick determined in the 1990s to not only learn the game of soccer but become, for a short time, one of its most feared and respected exponents on the London amateur scene. From 1991 to 1995, initially shod with Wellington boots, but progressing to professional-level footwear, he was a battling midfielder noted for aggression rather than celerity, appearing for the Sao Paolo XI at Hurlingham Park. After his transfer to the States it is believed he never played again. Animation instructor As a teacher at the Illinois Institute of Art - Chicago, Welch was well known, liked and respected as one of the most notable teachers in the Animation department. Classes he had taught included Acting for Animation, Story-boarding, Drawing and Characterization, Character Design, Advanced Life Drawing (occasionally) and Portfolio classes. Welch taught alongside Lindsay Grace at the school. Part of his popularity may have been due to his delightfully morose personality quirks. He was known for his self-deprecating humor and detached, bleak outlook on the world, while maintaining a generally positive disposition in spite of it. While generally portraying himself as a pessimist in regard to society at large, he was undeniably an optimist in regard to the ability and potential of his students. Welch was in the habit of indicating an imminent break to the students attending his lectures with the words \\"Come on everyone, these cigarettes are not going to smoke themselves\\".  Micromentalists  In 2006, Welch started an art movement collectively known as the Micromentalists. The general philosophy of the group was that art need not be \\"monumental\\" in scale to be important, and has been described as \\"pseudo-Marxist\\". Welch's purpose in putting together the Micromentalists was to start an art movement based on this philosophy. Founding members included artists Bill Drummond, Steve Keene, Paul Nudd, James J. Peterson, and Eric Doeringer. The group became known not only for its premise of small art, but also for its commercial practice of selling art at lower prices, adjusted for the income of the buyer. Their first shows were mentioned in Chicago and national art media for these reasons and for the participation of notable artists such as Drummond and Keene.

It is widely regarded as the place where Delta blues music was born.Palmer, Robert (1981). Deep Blues. . Blues musicians resident at Dockery included Charley Patton, Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. History The plantation was started in 1895 by Will Dockery (1865‚Äì1936), a graduate of the University of Mississippi who originally bought the land for its timber but soon recognised the richness of its soil. At the time, much of the Delta area was still a wilderness of cypress and gum trees, roamed by panthers and wolves and plagued with mosquitoes. The land was gradually cleared and drained for cotton cultivation, which encouraged an influx of black labourers. Some became settled sharecroppers, who would work a portion of the land in return for a share of the crop, while others were itinerant workers. Dockery earned a good reputation for treating his workers and sharecroppers fairly and thus attracted workers from throughout the South. Dockery's land was relatively remote, but was opened up for development by a new branch of the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad, known as the Yellow Dog. Around 1900, Dockery had a rail terminal built on his plantation, so connecting his land with the main rail system at Rosedale. Because of its circuitous route, this local line was known as the \\"Pea Vine\\". Dockery Plantation eventually supported over 2,000 workers, who were paid in the plantation's own coins. In addition to the railroad terminal, it had its own general store, post office, school, doctor, and churches. The workers‚Äô quarters included boardinghouses, where they lived, socialized and played music, particularly guitars, which had been introduced to the area by Mexican workers in the 1890s. Dockery took no interest in his workers' music, but he made it easy for them to travel and to spend their leisure time as they pleased. Charley Patton and his family are believed to have moved around 1900 to the Dockery Plantation, where he came under the influence of an older musician, Henry Sloan. In turn, Patton became the central figure of a group of blues musicians including Willie Brown, Tommy Johnson, and Eddie \\"Son\\" House, who played around the local area. Because of its location, central to Sunflower County‚Äôs black population of some 35,000 in 1920,[ the plantation became known as a centre for informal musical entertainment. By the mid-1920s, the group widened to include a younger generation of musicians, including Robert Johnson, Chester \\"Howlin‚Äô Wolf\\" Burnett, Roebuck \\"Pops\\" Staples, and David \\"Honeyboy\\" Edwards. Some of these were itinerant workers, while others lived more permanently on the farms. In 1936, the plantation was inherited by Joe Rice Dockery (1906‚Äì1982). With agricultural mechanisation and the employment attractions of the larger cities further north, the plantation settlements gradually disappeared, although some of the historic buildings remain. The farm later diversified to produce corn, rice and soybeans. Later members of the Dockery family have established a foundation to fund research into the Delta blues. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Today the site hosts a small number of private tours, lectures, and events in partnership with the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, Delta State University, and other academic and cultural institutions.

Five Ardclough players featured on the Kildare hurling team of the millennium: Richie Cullen, Tommy Christian, Bobby Burke, Johnny Walsh and Mick Dwane. Bridget Cushen was selected on the Kildare camogie team of the century. Current (2011) Kildare senior hurling panellists are Richie Hoban and Martin Fitzgerald. History RIC records from 1890 show that Hazlehatch Irish Harpers, based on Lord Concurry's field near Skeagh, had 70 members with officers listed as Ambrose Dwyer, Christy Fitzsimons, Michael Saunders and John Cantwell. John Buggle is listed as an officer with Kilteel King O'Tooles club. Thomas Kenny from Ardclough bore the nickname \\"The Harper\\" Kenny all his life. An Ardclough club competed in the 1924‚Äì27 championships. The current club was founded at a meeting in Mick Treacy's workshop in 1936, growing out of an under-14 team organised by Fr O'Brien at Ardclough national school, and the hurling club founded by Mick Houlihan in 1949. Gaelic Football Ardclough were the smallest community to win the Kildare football championship when Dan Graham's team beat a star-studded Army team in the replay of the 1949 county final, drawing a record attendance of 10,035 to the replay in St Conleth's Park. Goalkeeper Jim Nolan was the star of the drawn match, Christy Burke was the star of the replay, when a Dick McKenna goal before half-time and a series of points from the \\"Butcher\\" Graham and Jimmy Butler gave Ardclough a I-11 to 2‚Äì6 victory. They lost the 1953 semi-final by a point and beat both the Army and Sarsfields in Leader Cup finals before being regraded in 1958. Their rivalry with Sarsfields exploded into controversy in the 1950 county semi-final before a record 7,730 attendance. Ardclough's 1968 Jack Higgins Cup winners merged with the survivors of Kills' 1962 semi-final team to create area team Wolfe Tones which went to the 1971 semi-final and a three-point defeat to Carbury. Ardclough won the Junior A and Jack Higgins Cup in championship in 2000. Ardclough forms St Edward's along with Rathcoffey and Straffan for underage purposes and St Edward's fields teams at all levels from Under 9 to Under 21. Hurling Ardclough contested 20 county finals in success between 1963 and 1985, including a notorious battle with √âire √ìg in 1973. The club beat Buffer's Alley in the 1976 Leinster Senior Club Hurling Championship and was the first from Kildare to win an All Ireland Feile Division 4 in 1993. Ardclough regarded senior for the second time after winning the 1959 Junior championship and a morale-boost by the victory of their minors in 1956, inspired by Tim Gleeson and Kieran O'Malley. The careers of Tommy Christian, Mick Duane, Colm O'Malley and Bobby Burke spanned all twenty years. The 16-year-old Richie Cullen played his first final at centre field in 1966 and afterwards at full-back. Wexford born Ned Walsh came in 1967 and was joined by his brother, free-scoring Johnny Walsh in 1970. Ardclough contested nine successive finals against √âire √ìg 1965‚Äì74, a record for any grade in football and hurling, including their first title in 1968 when one of their minors, Richie Cullen, captained the team. Der Connor, John Cummins and Mick Duane contributed to the 2‚Äì12 total against 3‚Äì3 for √âire √ìg. Counting semi-finals the sides met for 14 years in a row. Even though it took 19 years to win their next senior title Ardclough played a prominent role in Kildare hurling, losing the 1998 final by a point to Colm Byrne's late free for Coill Dubh. Ardclough returned to beat Coill Dubh 2‚Äì12 to 0‚Äì11 in the 2004 county final with goals from Andy Whelan and Padraig O'Malley. Ardclough regained the title in 2006 with a crushing win over Confey. They then went on to make history winning the Leinster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship beating Ratharney of Westmeath in the final. Camogie Ardclough camogie club was founded in 1962 by Mick Houlihan, Patrick O‚ÄôConnor and Ann Johnson, the original colours were brown and yellow, now black, red and yellow,. Josie O‚ÄôConnor captained the team that won the championship in 1968. Honours *Kildare GAA Club of the Year 2006.

Conflict can be defined as an interference between individuals or groups of people who have differing aims, values, expectations, purposes, etc. Managing conflict is pivotal in laying the way for the amount of tension caused in the conflict, if a conflict is poorly managed it can cause more issues than the original conflict. Conflict is defined as a situation in which the concerns of two people appear to be incompatibleThomas, K. W. (2008). Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode. TKI Profile and Interpretive Report, 1-11. There are five modes offered as solutions to managing a conflict that are assessed on a scale of assertiveness and cooperativeness. Assertiveness is the extent an individual attempts to satisfy their own concerns, while cooperativeness is the extent of trying to satisfy the other parties. Studies have been conducted on the modes of conflict management and their effect on relationships. A model called the \\"Thomas-Kilmann model\\" was designed by two psychologists, Kenneth Thomas and Ralph Kilmann. It demonstrates how individuals choose the conflict styles when they handle conflict. Thomas-Kilmann model suggests five principles that guide individuals via the conflict process. These are competing, accommodating, avoiding, compromising, and collaborating.Kadir, Ashraful (2011, March 11). Five Conflict Management Styles at A Glance. Sources of Insight. Retrieved from http://sourcesofinsight.com/conflict-management-styles-at-a-glance/. * Competing means stand up for your own rights and defend what you believe is correct. * Accommodating means that you yield to other's points of view. * By Collaborating both sides are willing to cooperate and listen to others. * By Compromising both parties seek a better solution in the middle ground as one gives to another while one takes. * Avoiding. An unassertive, uncooperative approach whereby a solution is delayed or avoided altogether. Both sides might wait until they would find a better solution or evade the situation.  Background  Communication is crucial to maintaining a healthy relationship and the way you resolve conflict is important to maintaining an important and healthy relationship.Conflict Resolution. (n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.loveisrespect.org/healthy-relationships/conflict-resolution/. Thomas and Kilmann studied the five MODES of conflict management, which are adaptable ways to handling conflict. Several different forms of these modes, developed from 1960-1975, can be used to handle a particular conflict.  Modes of Conflict Management  According to Thomas and Kilmann there are five ways or styles that are used to satisfy concerns in a conflict. These styles can be assessed on axes of cooperativeness to assertiveness.  Collaborating  According to Thomas and Kilmann collaborating is mutually problem solving to solve the needs of both parties. This falls on the scale of being both assertive and cooperative. This style can be beneficial to close relationships because individuals dig deeper to find the root of the conflict and find an alternative solution. You learn the other parties insights to try and find a more creative solution to the conflict. This model is best used when you need an integrative solution because both parties needs are too important to not be addressed, you want to join together insights or work through hard feelings in the relationship.  Compromising  Compromising is exchanging concessions, both parties will give up a want or need in order to satisfy the conflict. This is intermediate in assertiveness and cooperation. Compromising is similar to collaborating, in that you find a mutually beneficial solution to the problem. The difference is compromising does address the issue, but it doesn't seek the root of the issue as is done in collaborating. Compromising is used when issues are important, but not worth using an assertive approach, you want a temporary fix or when collaboration or competing fail.  Competing  Different than the first two styles this style is one in which the individual tries to win their own position. It is assertive and uncooperative. This style could hurt a close relationship due to the competitive nature, leaving the losing party unsatisfied. Competitiveness can take things further than just the conflict and potentially permanently hurt feelings. In this style the individual will be standing up for their rights, defending their position or simply trying to win. This style is typical used when a quick decision needs to be made, issues where you need to protect yourself or when you know your side of the issue is correct.  Accommodating  Rather than trying to win your own position, in the accommodating style an individual satisfies the other parties goals while being unassertive and cooperative. When accommodating an individual makes a sacrifice of their own needs in order to make the other party involved content. This can be good in a relational sense, but this can also lead to the party making sacrifices to become burnt out of using this style. This is typically used when you know you are wrong, you need to build up credit for a later situation that may be more important to you or you would rather keep the peace.  Avoiding  The avoiding style simply avoids conflict by postponing or steering clear of any potential conflict. This style is unassertive and uncooperative. Avoiding is stepping out of the way, delaying or simply avoiding a situation. This style can be beneficial in moderation, but eventually the conflicts will build up and create an unhealthy relationship. Popular uses of this style are when you find an issue unimportant, another problem is more pressing or you need to allow time for tension to be reduced.  Studies on Conflict Management   Cross-Cultural Studies  In a study written by the Management International Review different subcultures in Turkey were studied on the styles of conflict management they prefer to use. Although this study took place in Turkey, it opened up the door for cross cultural research on conflict management. This study focused on the handling of conflict by adversaries. They define each of the five styles to be higher in one of the two dimensions. These are explained as, competing is high in assertiveness, collaboration is high in both, avoiding low in both and compromise as a mid-point. Researchers studied the choice of style and what influenced it in the subculture using Schwartz's inventory of value. What they found was that the traditional main culture used the avoiding style, the power seeking culture preferred competing and egalitarians chose to use accommodation. This study shows that there is a correlation with sub-cultures and their chosen style of conflict management, not every culture selects one style to use.  First Conflict as a Relationship Milestone  Relationship theorists study relationships in stage developments, the first time a close relationship encounters a conflict and how they come out of it, is a breakthrough in many close relationships. John Siegert and Glen Stamp write about the \\"FBF\\" or First Big Fight as an episode of conflict as discussing first time feelings that may include doubt or disappointment in the relationship and this event becomes memorable because of its intensity or timing.Siegert, J. R. & Stamp, G. H. (1994). Our First Big Fight: As a Milestone in the Development of Close Relationships [PDF] . Communication Monographs, 61, 345-360. The intensity may put the relationship at risk and the timing may occur after a couple officially enters a relationship or are clearing up what that relationship is to them. This study was given to over 250 undergraduate communication students at a university who were split into three categories based upon if they had survived a FBF with their partner, individuals who had not yet had a FBF with their partner and individuals who had ended a relationship due to the FBF. Interviews of 50 participants were conducted and they were asked open-ended questions about their first FBF where conducted and personalized to each of the classifications. The results were divided into sections of the relational circumstance, outcomes and effects of the fight on the relationship and the difference between those who stayed in the relationships and those who did not. Researchers found that the FBF is a significant turning point that impacts the future of the relationship either positively or negatively depending on the preliminary circumstances and feelings about the relationship.  Avoiding Conflict in Marriage  Conflicts arise frequently in marriages, a study was conducted on the effect of relational power and an individuals decision to withhold their complaints in order to avoid a conflict. According to Solomon et al. the first step is deciding whether to voice a complaint or not and this decision is based on the amount of power your spouse holds over you.Solomon, D. H., Knobloch, L. K., & Fitzpatrick, M. A. (2004). Relational Power, Marital Schema, and Decisions to Withhold Complaints: An Investigation of the Chilling Effect on Confrontation in Marriage [PDF] Communication Studies, 55(1), 146-167 This is determined through interpersonal power, or the degree of influence one exerts over the other in a relationship through the ability to sway the costs and rewards the partner undergoes. Marital schemas are cognitive structures that contain organized knowledge about marriage relationships. This research was conducted by having communication students present a questionnaire to a married individual studying six different types of power as independent variables. The dependent variables were the conflicts that were not brought to the spouses attention. There were a few different results from the findings, the first being that partners felt more comfortable expressing concerns in a relationship where there was less power held over them. The second major result showed that when the spouse shows aggression more information that could cause conflicts is withheld from them. Marital schemas can foresee what information will be withheld and shapes individuals decisions on what to express to their spouses. Application The most widely used tool for this is a conflict style inventory, typically a short questionnaire filled out by a user, with interpretation of the scores given in writing or by an instructor. The point is not to categorize the user, but rather to give him or her a framework in which to assess responses and options. Conflict style inventories include the Thomas Kilmann Thomas Kilmann and Style Matters: The Kraybill Conflict Style InventoryStyle Matters: The Kraybill Conflict Style Inventory  Critiques of Conflict Management  Conflict management is beneficial in improving the quality of the work place and building stronger relationships with employees or leaders. Conflict management can backfire when the incorrect style is chosen to handle a problem. For example, using the avoiding style to ignore issues at hand can cause a buildup of issues and lead to a larger problem later on in a relationship. Using the compromising strategy can leave one party unsatisfied that they are making sacrifices and not getting any benefit, leading to more conflict when they decide they are not okay with this strategy anymore. Conflict management styles can be extremely beneficial in relationships when learned to use them in the right situations. Conflict management styles are critiqued to be based on personality style. There are many different factors that influence conflict management, but a major one is personality traits. The five factor model points out that five personality traits Extroversion, Agreeableness, Openness to experience, Emotional stability, and Conscientiousness has a direct correlation on the selection of which conflict management style is used.

Its campus is located in Montebello, California, United States, a suburb of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The majority of students attending this school live in the Montebello and Monterey Park area, while some also come from neighboring cities and communities such as Commerce, East Los Angeles, South El Monte and Rosemead. Schurr was established as a high school in 1971, with the campus having previously been the site of a junior high school. Overview The school, which sits atop a hillside just east of the border with Monterey Park, was named for George Miller Schurr, a former board member of the Montebello Unified School District. A placard honoring him is displayed in the school's main office. The school previously served as Schurr Junior High School, but due to the growing population of students in the area and the significant distance from the two local public high schools at the time Montebello High School and Mark Keppel High School in Alhambra, California the school became a high school in 1971. The first principal was Walter Wohlheter. Most of the students who attend Schurr come from either Jack F. Macy Intermediate School, which is located in the city of Monterey Park, or Eastmont Intermediate School, which is located in East Los Angeles, just a few blocks from the Montebello city border. Though Schurr and Macy are a few blocks apart, both schools are located on Wilcox Ave. (Schurr technically on N. Wilcox since it is in a different city than Macy). Due to Schurr sitting atop a hill, it is said that Macy students simply \\"climb the hill\\" upon graduation from middle school. While Macy and Eastmont students maintain a rivalry both academically and athletically, their differences are generally considered to be put to rest once they become acclimated to Schurr and one another. Schurr High School was originally built to accommodate 1,700 students. Today, Schurr's population has nearly doubled, and school officials expect that during the 2015-2018 school years, the population will increase to around 3,700 students. The exponential growth in terms of student population has led to many students having to share lockers. The Alma Mater is based on the National Anthem of Russia and the words were written by music and history/government teacher David A. Lebow (1971-2003). Band director, Barry Ulrich (1973‚Äì86) composed the official \\"unofficial\\" fight song, \\"Taco Mambo\\", which is played by the Spartan Legion at home athletic events and school rallies. The Schurr High School mascot is known as Sammy the Spartan, and the school's students and alumni are referred to as Spartans. During the 2017‚Äì2018 school year, solar panels were added to portions of both the teacher and student parking lots, giving the school a new source of energy. Extracurricular activities Schurr offers and encourage students to participate in a variety of sports, clubs, and after school programs that foster critical thinking and problems solving skills. Schurr High students take part in more than 30 clubs and activities, including Astronomy Club, Green Earth Club, Plant Posse, Drama, National Honor Society, and Youth Community Service. Schurr also has a competing marching band, color guard, and drill team. Athletics The sports teams are referred to as the \\"Schurr High Spartans.\\" The school official colors are green and white, with gold being an unofficial accent color. The school has an athletic rivalry with nearby Montebello High School. The rivalry is intensified by several geographical reasons, such as the fact that both schools are located on N. Wilcox Ave. and are separated by only a few blocks, so close in fact that depending on where someone stands on either campus, the other school is visible. The campus is divided into two levels, with the upstairs level serving as the home for the physical education department as well as the home of all the athletic venues, such as Ken Davis field (football, soccer, track and field), two separate gymnasiums for basketball and volleyball which are shared between both sports, the baseball field, the softball field, enclosed tennis courts, and the outdoor aquatics center that was built in 2012 and has an Olympic sized pool. The school's most noteworthy athletic organizations are the football, wrestling, cross country, and track and field teams. The Spartans football team won the California Interscholastic Federation championship in Division 5A in 1980, and 2006, with the later win coming against Santa Fe High School. The 2006 game was played in Fullerton, CA. During the 2016‚Äì2017 school year, the girl's water polo team won the CIF title by defeating Riverside Poly High School 6‚Äì4. A scoreboard for the baseball field was added in for the 2014 school year. In the year 2015, the football field began undergoing long- awaited renovations to transition to an artificial turf surface.

He also worked to revive the Icelandic culture and economy. Background He was the son of a farmer from Svefneyjar in Brei√∞afj√∂r√∞ur. He studied natural sciences, Classics, Grammar, Law and Agriculture at the University of Copenhagen. He obtained a bachelor's degree from the University of Copenhagen. In 1772 he published Reise igiennem Island (Travels in Iceland), an account of the scientific and cultural survey he conducted between 1752 and 1757. The book remains a seminal work on Iceland and its people. Eggert wrote on a wide range of topics. His writing has made him known for his pro-conservation stance on the Icelandic language, which has undergone significant change since the 18th century. Eggert was a devout patriot, and his literary works, chiefly his poems, burn with this fervor. He used his writings to stir up patriotism, which he felt were waning. He hoped to revive Icelandic culturally and politically, so that it would rise once again to its former glory. He went on a research trip around Iceland with Bjarni P√°lsson (who later became Iceland's Director of Health) between 1752 and 1757. During this trip, they visited a great number of Icelandic natural sites and proposed geographical and infrastructural improvements to the regions they visited. Eggert and his wife, Ingibj√∂rg Halld√≥rsd√≥ttir, drowned in 1768 when going back home from a winter sojourn in Sau√∞lauksdalur. Their boat capsized in Brei√∞afj√∂r√∞ur off the northwest coast of Iceland. Matth√≠as Jochumsson wrote a commemorative poem titled \\"Eggert √ìlafsson\\" in his honour. Icelandic romantic poet J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson also wrote a poem for √ìlafsson; titled \\"Huldulj√≥√∞\\", it was never finished.

Major clients of the partnership included the Consumers' Association, the Post Office, British Telecom and London Transport, for whom they redesigned Edward Johnston's famous \\"Underground Sans\\" typeface, as New Johnston. Early life Banks was born in Ruislip, England, and grew up in Margate. He went to Rochester and Maidstone schools of art (both became Kent Institute of Art & Design then eventually the University for the Creative Arts), and met John Miles at Maidstone. Career With John Miles, he was the Production Editor of Which?, and associated magazines, from 1964 to 1993. Typography Banks was an influential designer, and his Telecom (T) identity, created for British Telecommunications when it was instituted in 1981, spawned many imitators. Its replacement by Wolff Olins' BT \\"piper\\" was received with much derision in 1991. Banks received a prestigious RSA/BBC Design Award in 1990, for the paper-saving redesign of the UK's Phonebook.

Following the progress of many modern GAA clubs, they field teams from U6 to senior in both ladies' and men's football. History Football Club The present-day club was founded in 1953, and immediately began fundraising. They started to train in Ann Cullen's field in Borraderra and so intense was their interest in the game that they even trained on Christmas Day. Ladies' Football The Ballykelly girls' Under 14 team was registered in the spring of 1994, twenty years after the first All Ireland ladies' football final was played. The squad consisted of 21 players in an age group from 10 to 14. The squad comprised players who came from families who supported all three clubs in the parish. The teams prospered in their first year and the following season saw six of the players called up for county teams. The team's success continued for a further year drawing fresh players from all over the parish but by in 1996 the successful run was over, partly due to the original squad becoming older. However, some of the girls did continue playing for the boys' team. In 1997 an amalgamation between Ballykelly and Athgarvan was arranged, meaning that some players were now representing Ballykelly on the boys' panel and Athgarvan with the ladies' team. During this season two of the players, Maire Dowling at centre half forward and Margeret McCormack in goal, contributed to the capture of the county shield with the under 14 boys' team and the club was also being represented at intercounty level by several of the girls. In 1999 saw the formation of an Under 12 team and the reformation of the Under 14 team; in 2001 a Senior Ladies' team was formed. Grounds The club purchased its first pitch in 1982 next to the Highbridge and developed it as money became available. The pitch and club rooms were opened on 16 October 1983 by Hugh Campion, former Chairman of Kildare County Board. The facilities were updated after that with the addition of new dressing rooms and showers. In 2005 the club embarked on another major development plan to keep up with the growth in the local population and purchased in the townland of Ballykelly. This new development was completed and officially opened on 16 May 2010 and consists of two adult size pitches, one floodlit and one juvenile pitch, two astro- surfaced pitches, a sports hall, ladies' and men's dressing rooms, meeting rooms and car parking for 350 cars. The facility was named as Kildare Grounds of the Year for 2010.

Life and career Kunz was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania, United States, the only son of Margaret T. (Wehr) and Leonard Kunz, a master baker who played the French horn. He made his debut aged six and made his first appearance as a prodigy aged seven. During World War I he led his own resident band, while working in a munitions factory. He came to the United Kingdom in 1922 as a pianist in a small dance band. He was to remain there until his death from a heart attack in 1958. He is buried in Streatham Vale Cemetery. He was such a distinctive and popular pianist that he abandoned his orchestra to concentrate on his piano playing, both at music hall venues and on the BBC. Two of Britain's most famous female vocalists were with his orchestra in the 1930s: Vera Lynn and Welsh songstress Dorothy Squires. His best known crooner was George Barclay. Kunz was the pianist in a dance band which was led by the drummer, Ed Krick. The band came to London in 1922 to play a residency in the London Trocadero. The band returned without Kunz to Pennsylvania after a successful run at the 'Troc' and, until 1998, still got together for sessions for retirement homes, renamed as 'The B Flats'. His debut as a soloist came in 1934 at the Holborn Empire, London followed by countless variety theatres in Britain and the Continent, after playing in hotels, restaurants and ballrooms. The same year saw the beginning of what was to become a continuous output of solo records of \\"Charlie Kunz Medleys\\".

They are non-sworn private patrol persons, appointed and regulated by the San Francisco Police Commission after an initial background review by the San Francisco Police DepartmentSan Francisco Police Commission: Patrol Specials https://sfgov.org/policecommission/patrol-specials. They are assigned to, or purchase, a specific area, or beat and charge private clients hourly rates for a variety of services.San Francisco City Charter Reference on Patrol Special Police Officers The force has been in operation since 1847 during the California Gold Rush. By current City Code the force provides patrols on the streets of San Francisco as well as at fixed locations, and also provides a range of other safety services as requested by private clients. The San Francisco Patrol Special Police is one of the oldest law enforcement agencies in the United States and credited for the first modern U.S. adaption of the community policing concept. As of 2011, there were approximately 40 patrol special police officers. Services, operation, and financing Patrol Special Police provide a variety of services for private clients pursuant to a negotiated contract, including unlocking or securing doors to a business, making checks of residences or businesses, conducting perimeter checks at burglar alarms, providing a physical presence at businesses and providing security consultations. Officers concentrate on order maintenance, rapid response, and early intervention in quality-of-life matters. Their goal is to prevent disturbances from becoming expensive and serious crimes, and to relieve pressure on the public police. Since 1994 officers operate with citizens' powers of arrest, are on police radio bandwidth, and are trained annually for 24 hrs. of classroom instruction and twice on the range, according to standards set by the Police Chief. Officers are not civil service employees of the San Francisco Police Department nor do they earn City benefits or pensions. However, for specified purposes courts may consider them to be employees, such as for purposes of the SFPD maintaining employment records. The officers are assigned a \\"beat\\" or a specific area where officers serve. By tradition and practice, Patrol Special Police officers respect and consider the distinct tenor and character of neighborhood life where they work. They often attend merchant and resident meetings to listen to concerns or offer advice. Officers become trusted and valued members of neighborhoods where many interact daily with business owners, customers, residents, and families on the streets, thus serving as effective local \\"eyes and ears\\" to dispense important safety advice and gather security information. Clients include merchants, professionals, homeowners' associations, residents, street fair organizers, non-profit organizations (and occasionally, government agencies who may outsource security). The typical hourly rate in 2010 for patrols averaged $50‚Äì60, including a patrol car. Additional services or more intense policing may entail an additional cost negotiated with each client. Patrol Special Police clients and the public are protected from negligent or intentional harm because rules governing program rules require each beat owner to carry liability insurance that protects against potential negligence or injury by an officer. In addition, rules require each beat owner to carry worker's compensation insurance for employees. Each beat owner determines if he or she will fund a health and/or retirement plan for Assistant Patrol Special Police Officers. History and relationship to the San Francisco Police Department and community groups Patrol Special Police force history dates from before the 1848 California Gold Rush prior to formation of the City's formal police department. A citizen and merchant-sponsored neighborhood police force known as the Special Police has kept San Francisco neighborhoods safe since it was established in 1847 with the swearing in of two constables. In 1851, the City increased Special Police to 50 sworn officers, and created the public police department at the same time. In 1857, the Special Police force was formalized in the City Charter. Today, Section 4.127 of the City Charter governs the Patrol Special Police. In cases of public safety emergencies, both historically and today, Patrol Special Police and SFPD officers provide assistance to the other force as required by public safety needs, and work cooperatively together to protect the public. Patrol Special Police Officer Robert Burns was recommended in spring of 2010 for an SFPD Medal of Valor for bringing down a gunman outside of his private client's bar on February 7 and thus, saving many lives. In addition, officers have been called upon to assist SFPD officers during earthquakes such as the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. \\"But in 1994, with backing from the SFPD and the powerful police union, the Police Officers Association (POA), the Police Commission stripped the patrol specials of their status as peace officers with the ability to issue citations and book their own arrests.\\" The ranks of the specials and their assistants ‚Äî some 250 strong at the time ‚Äî plummeted to 18 patrol specials, employing fewer than two dozen assistants. \\"They're killing us by attrition,\\" said Jane Warner, president of the association that represents the specials. Logs of daily activities were introduced in 2010 on the officers' support group website, and demonstrate a close working relationship between the SFPD foot patrol officers and community safety groups in neighborhoods where Patrol Special Police Officers serve. Appointment and program regulation Patrol Special Police Officers and Assistant Officers are duly appointed by the San Francisco Police Commission, an appointed body of seven civilians which has oversight responsibility for the Patrol Special Police Program as well as for the SFPD. The Interim Rules and Procedures for Patrol Special Officers and Their Assistants (The Rules) promulgated by the Police Commission in December, 2008 require that Patrol Special Police Officers pass an initial background check conducted by the SFPD. Officers receive 24 hours of annual training in the classroom and twice on the range according to standards determined by the Police Chief. Before going on patrol, Patrol Special Police check in with the duty watch commander in the police district where they serve. The Rules authorize the uniform and patch as shown above, which are distinct from that of the San Francisco Police Department, however the uniform, service revolver, baton, and patrol car are purchased privately by the Patrol Special Police Officer and not paid for with taxpayer funds. Patrol Special Police Officers wear a patch on their uniform that identifies their force by name on a band at the top, as shown above. The lettering and trim of the patch is embroidered in silver thread. Officers wear a silver-toned six-point star with the words \\"San Francisco Patrol Special Police.\\" Clients Patrol Special clients surveyed in the fall, 2009 by Dr. Edward P. Stringham, a San Jose State University Associate Professor of Economics, consistently reported that the Patrol Specials make their neighborhoods a safer place to live, work, and visit. Clients reported that officers are consistently professional and courteous. Clients observed that officers are particularly responsive to the character of business and residential life and needs of the specific neighborhood where they work, resolving matters quickly and with discretion rather than coming \\"with bells and whistles.\\" Officers are viewed as proactive in resolving minor disturbances early to prevent serious crimes from occurring. Officers respond quickly and effectively to quality-of-life crimes that often SFPD officers do not or cannot rapidly address. Organization The Patrol Special has a professional Association whose President as of June, 2010 is Officer Alan Byard, a 30-year veteran officer serving the Marina beat and part of the Polk Street beat. Other officers include: Vice-President ‚Äì Officer Scott Hart serving the South of Market beat and part of the Tenderloin beat, Treasurer ‚Äì Officer John Barry serving the Bernal Heights and Haight beats, Assistant Treasurer ‚Äì Assistant Patrol Special Officer David Palmer, and Shop Steward ‚Äì Officer Robert Burns serving parts of the Fisherman's Wharf beat. The Association sponsors a website. The force also has a professional support group known as the \\"Special Neighborhood Policing\\" group which sponsors a community outreach website. In popular culture Christian Slater starred in the 1992 film Kuffs, which detailed the story of a young, inexperienced Patrol Special coming into his own. A novel written by John Lescroart, The First Law, also weaves a story line around the Patrol Specials.

It is the main air gateway for all destinations in the country, and in addition serves as a transit airport for Goma and Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Location The airport is located in the suburb of Kanombe, at the eastern edge of Kigali, approximately , by road, east of the central business district of the city of Kigali.  History  During the Rwandan Civil War, Kigali airport was a major strategic point. Since Rwanda is a landlocked nation, this represented the only easy way in and out of the country. The airport had two runways, but after the Arusha Accords, one runway was closed down after a request from the RPF. Later in April 1994, President Habyarimana's plane was shot down. It is disputed who shot down the plane, the RPF or the FAR (Rwandan Defence Forces). This event triggered a renewal of the civil war and the beginning of the Rwandan genocide. Passenger traffic In 2004, the airport served 135,189 passengers. In 2008, the airport served about 270,000 passengers. In May 2011, the Rwanda CAA announced that Kigali airport will be upgraded to meet the strong demand. Works started in October 2012 and will be completed in May 2014. In 2012, data from Rwanda Civil Aviation Authority shows that passenger traffic through Kigali International Airport grew by 30 per cent to 488,903 last year, up from 377,327 in 2011. The airport handled over 300 flights a week. The airport is designed to handle 400,000 passengers per year. According to last figures, international and domestic passenger numbers were nearly 600,000 in 2013, while flight frequencies were about 400 weekly.International and domestic passenger numbers were 710,000 in 2016 Facilities Rwandair Express Aircraft at Kigali airport There are three terminals at Kigali. The main two-story terminal was built to replace the single-story building, now housing the VIP terminal. The main terminal can handle 6 small-to-midsized aircraft, but also up to a Boeing 747 jet. The south side of the runway has two helicopter pads with access to the main runway. Such pads are used for military helicopters. A cargo terminal is also located at the airport. The latest upgrades to tarmac and support systems were made in 2002. There is free WiFi in the airport waiting area. In 2014, Kigali Airport ranked 7th best regional airport in Africa, because of its capacity to respond to disaster, through its fire department (Category Nine), the second best according to International Aviation Organisation standards.

A new airport location is needed as the existing airport does not allow for upgrades such as additional runways and other facilities. The new airport will have one runway, with provisions for a second one to be added later. Construction was planned to begin in 2015.The construction of the Bugesera Airport is expected to commence 2015. First Phase completed for 2017, http://www.rwandan-flyer.com/rwanda- refutes-contract-to-chinese-firm-to-build-bugesera-airport In September 2016, a contract between the Rwandan government and Mota-Engil Engenharia e Constru√ß√£o √Åfrica, S.A., a Portuguese firm, was signed. The company will construct the airport in two phases with works on the first phase now scheduled to begin in June 2017. After finishing the first phase by December 2018, Mota-Engil Engenharia e Constru√ß√£o √Åfrica, S.A. will subsequently operate the airport for 25 years. The airport will have a capacity of 1.7 million passengers per year. A second phase that is planned to be built after that is supposed to raise the capacity of the airport to 4.5 million passengers per year. Mota-Engil Engenharia e Constru√ß√£o √Åfrica, S.A. will cover the costs of US$418 million for the first phase and US$400 million for the second phase, leading to a total investment of US$818 million. As a compensation, the company has the right to keep the profits from operating the airport. Under the agreement, the Rwandan government won't have to contribute to the costs of construction and operation. In March 2019, the government confirmed that some works were put on hold temporarily in order for a redesign to take place. The redesign will make sure that the airport is up to international standards. In December 2019, Qatar state-owned airlines, Qatar Airways collaborated with the Rwanda Development Board to purchase a 60% stake in the Bugesera International Airport. Infrastructure minister Claver Gatete said, ‚ÄúWe are looking for a bigger sized airport. That's why we are looking for a bigger investor.‚Äù Airlines and destinations There are 3 airlines based in Kigali: Akagera Aviation, a Rwandan heli-company; Tempus Jet, an American airline providing charter flights; and Nexus Aero, a Saudi VIP airline. Passenger Cargo Incidents and accidents *6 April 1994 ‚Äì A Falcon 50 owned by and carrying then-president of Rwanda Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down while approaching the airport, killing all 12 aboard including Habyarimana and then-president of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira, who were returning from a meeting to end the Rwandan civil war. The wreckage landed in front of the presidential palace. The attack was blamed on Tutsi rebels, and, as a result, within one hour of the crash Interahamwe militias began the Rwandan genocide. There is no consensus on who actually shot down or ordered the attack on the plane. *1 June 2004 ‚Äì An Antonov 32 owned by Sun Air (9XR-SN), reportedly suffered some problems with the left main undercarriage after takeoff from Beni, Democratic Republic of the Congo. The airplane was headed for Goma, but diverted to Kigali for an emergency landing. The aircraft crashed on landing, causing the Russian pilots and Congolese passengers to sustain serious injuries. The An-32 involved in the accident had been detained in Goma mid-July 2003 because it carried a shipment of armaments destined for a Rwanda-backed militia in the Congolese Kasai region. *12 November 2009, RwandAir Flight 205, a Bombardier CRJ-100 crashed into a VIP terminal shortly after an emergency landing; out of the 10 passengers and 5 crew, 1 passenger died.

Sikorsky Memorial Airport is a public airport in Fairfield County, Connecticut, owned by the city of Bridgeport. It is three miles (6 km) southeast of downtown, in the town of Stratford. It was formerly Bridgeport Municipal Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021 categorized it as a general aviation facility. It has three Fixed-Base Operators (FBO's) and several private hangars. In 2016 Tailwind Air Service started seaplane flights between Sikorsky and the New York Skyports Seaplane Base in central Manhattan.https://flytailwind.com/flight-review-tailwind-new-york-skyports- seaplane-base-to-stratford-ct-usa/  History  The airport was originally Avon Field, a racetrack where aircraft landed on the grass infield. It was the site of the country's first air show held in 1911, on the grounds of what is now St. Michaels Cemetery. It became known as Mollison Field after Captain Jim Mollison's crash landing there in 1933 during an attempt to fly across the Atlantic. The City of Bridgeport purchased the airport in 1937, after which it became Bridgeport Municipal Airport. In 1972 it was rededicated as the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport, honoring the airport's most famous tenant, Igor Sikorsky, who selected Stratford as the site for his Sikorsky Aviation Corporation in 1929.History of Sikorsky Memorial Airport from City of Bridgeport website In the 1950s American Airlines stopped at Bridgeport, one Convair a day; American left in 1960. Allegheny Airlines then provided service until 1976. In the 1980s the airport was served by five carriers or their regional affiliates: Business Express Airlines, Continental Airlines, Piedmont Airlines, US Air and United Express.The View from - Sikorsky Memorial Airport from New York Times website In 1992 airlines flew from Bridgeport to several cities in the northeast, including Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Boston and Newark.Small Airports: Convenience and Limits from New York Times website The airport has been the subject of heated debate in Stratford and Bridgeport. While the City of Bridgeport owns the airport, the whole property is in the Town of Stratford. Before the end of World War II little more than salt marshes surrounded the airport, but in the 1950s and 1960s Stratford permitted extensive residential development in the Lordship area near the airfield. Bridgeport has pushed for runway and terminal expansion, hoping to attract new service to the airport, arguing that service to the airport is necessary for the growth of Bridgeport's economy. Stratford has opposed terminal expansion and runway lengthening that would interfere with existing roads. Even when the airport was served by major carriers, Stratford advocated for limits on flights because of noise in the Lordship and South End neighborhoods. In 2003 the Federal Aviation Administration mandated the lengthening of the two runways with unpaved safety overruns at each end. Stratford and Connecticut officials have resisted the FAA effort to install the overruns, but the FAA has notified Stratford, Bridgeport and state officials that it may obtain a federal court order to use eminent domain to complete the overruns. In June 2006 US Helicopter began scheduled flights to New York's Downtown Manhattan Heliport, continuing to John F. Kennedy International Airport. This was the first airline service since 1999. On September 25, 2009 US Helicopter suddenly shut down. In February 2007 state legislators from Bridgeport, in an effort to force expansion, introduced legislation allowing the State of Connecticut to take over the airport. Officials from Stratford would prefer the town take ownership of the airport and oppose the proposed state takeover. In October 2016 runway 6-24 re-opened after closing in late 2014 for a 300-foot length of ‚ÄúEMAS,‚Äù or engineered materials arrestor system, could be installed at its east end.https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Safer-runway-re-dedicated-at- Sikorsky-Memorial-9642029.php  Facilities Metlife blimp on the southern field in July 2011. The airport covers 800 acres (324 ha) at an elevation of 9 feet (3 m). It has two asphalt runways: 11/29 is 4,761 by 150 feet (1,451 x 46 m) and 6/24 is 4,677 by 100 feet (1,426 x 30 m). Each runway has a runway safety area that does not meet FAA requirements. Both are wide enough, but 6/24 is 10% and 11-29 is 25% of the required length. http://www.ct.gov/dot/lib/dot/documents/ddotinfo/Chapter_2_Inventory.pdf In the year ending February 28, 2019, the airport averaged 136 aircraft operations per day: 94% general aviation, 6% air taxi, and <1% military. 155 aircraft were based at the airport: 107 single-engine, 32 jet, 10 multi- engine, 5 helicopter, and one glider.AirNav: KBDR Airships At over 800 acres, the airport has room for a number of airships, usually moored south of the 11-29 runway. Often blimps use Sikorsky as a base for flyovers of regional sporting events because of lack of space at other airports, security concerns, and avoiding controlled airspace around cities and larger airports.

Ann Corio's original surname was Coiro. She changed her name to Corio for stage purposes and because some family members did not approve of her profession.  Biography  Born in Hartford, Connecticut, she was one of twelve children of Italian immigrant parents. While still in her teens, Corio's good looks and shapely physique landed her showgirl roles that led to her becoming a hugely popular striptease artist. Her rise to stardom as a featured performer began on the Mutual burlesque circuit in 1925. She later worked at Minsky's Burlesque in New York City and Boston's Old Howard Theatre.  Career  Call of the Jungle lobby card After Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed down New York City's burlesque houses in 1939, Corio made her way to Los Angeles. Between 1941 and 1944 she appeared in several Hollywood \\"B\\" motion pictures which featured her in scanty costumes (beginning with 1941 Swamp Woman), the best known of which was perhaps 1942's Jungle Siren opposite Buster Crabbe. In 1944 she made Call of the Jungle and Sarong Girl. A year earlier Corio was guest armchair detective on radio's The Adventures of Ellery Queen, on the January seventh episode entitled, \\"The Adventure of the Singing Rat\\". With the Second World War on, she became one of the volunteer pin-up girls for YANK magazine, appearing in the September 3, 1943, issue of the weekly U.S. Army publication. Corio had a long successful career dancing on stage. In 1962 she put together the nostalgic off-Broadway show This Was Burlesquehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE158ALULIw which she directed and in which also performed. In 1968, she wrote a book with the same title. Her fame was enduring enough that in the 1970s‚Äîwhen Corio was long retired and in her sixties‚Äîshe twice was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. During this same period, she took This Was Burlesque out on the summer stock circuit for several seasons. In 1981, the show played Broadway at the old Latin Quarter, which was then known as the Princess Theatre, and tried to compete with Sugar Babies which was running just a few blocks up the street. In 1985, she mounted the show for the second to last time in downtown Los Angeles, at the Variety Arts Theatre, where it did not have a good run. A year or so later, the show played a dinner theatre in Florida, where it closed for good.  Death  A resident of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, Corio died at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in Englewood, New Jersey, on March 1, 1999, aged 89. Legacy She is a member of the Hall of Fame at the Exotic World Burlesque Museum in Helendale, California. References External links * * * Ann Corio collection *Charles H.

History On 19 January 1989, a meeting was held in the home of Michael Divilly for those who were interested in creating a separate GAA club for the northern half of Leixlip in the parish of Confey. At this meeting it was agreed to hold a public meeting to gain further support for the foundation of a new club, which was subsequently held in the local school on 30 January. Following this meeting a formal approach was made to the Kildare County board, and Confey was formally registered as a club on 27 February 1989. The club's first official match came in March, with the men's football team losing to Cappagh on a scoreline of 2‚Äì3 to 2‚Äì2. The club acquired six and a half acres at Cope Bridge in 1990, followed by a further three and a half acres the following year. The club's first chairman was Pat Sweeney. In 1998 the club opened a new clubhouse, with a bar, sportshall, and several dressing rooms. The club's facilities at Cope Bridge are named Creighton Park in memory of Jimmy Creighton who was one of the early members of the club and club chairman in 1990 and 1991.

They changed to black and white to honour the New Zealand national rugby union team (\\"All Blacks\\"), who played in Dublin in 1905.

Waccamaw Pottery Expansion beyond its original location, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, began in 1982, when the company opened a Burlington, North Carolina location. Next came Spartanburg, South Carolina in 1983, followed by Rolling Meadows, Illinois (outside Chicago) in 1984 and Dale City, Virginia (a Washington, D.C. suburb) in 1985. It grew into the home furnishings business in the early 1990s and operated stores throughout the South and Midwest, selling housewares, bedding, cookware, china, and furniture. In the face of heavy competition from direct competitors Bed Bath & Beyond, Linens 'n Things and Old Time Pottery; as well as discount stores like Walmart and Target, the company merged with the primarily Northeastern HomePlace and grew to over 100 stores by 2001. Waccamaw stores were renamed \\"Waccamaw's HomePlace\\", and were planning to phase out the Waccamaw name altogether when the company filed for bankruptcy. The company ceased operations in June 2001. Waccamaw Factory Shoppes The original Waccamaw Pottery building in Myrtle Beach is still standing, part of the Waccamaw Factory Shoppes complex, once the nation's third-largest outlet shopping complex with more than 100 stores in 750,000 square feet of space on 80 acres. A fourth section was added in 1998 and a renovation of the entire complex was announced in October 2000. Competition from Myrtle Beach Factory Stores, however, was hurting the complex. Also, in December 2000, American International Life Insurance Co. foreclosed on owner Outlet Park RPFIV Associates LLC after a missed payment on a loan.Kathleen Vereen Dayton and Kevin Wiatrowski, \\"Foreclosure Suit Targets Outlets,\\" The Sun News, January 12, 2001. A planned bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway was expected to help the area, along with turning a section of U.S. 501 into a freeway. Some believed the complex could make a comeback, with help. But additional competition was coming from Tanger Factory Outlets as well as a conventional mall nearby.Kathleen Vereen Dayton, \\"Interest Stirs in Troubled Outlets,\\" The Sun News, January 19, 2001. In December 2001, AIG bought the property in an auction. Talk of a theme park began, though some believed the mall could remain.Kathleen Vereen Dayton, \\"Mall's Direction Muddled,\\" The Sun News, May 5, 2002. In August 2003 Horry County Council voted to rezone land for the theme park, and by 2005 Hard Rock Park, a now-defunct music-themed amusement park, appeared likely to become a reality. But the mall had two stores, the upgrading of U.S. 501 had decreased interest in an area that became hard to reach, and AIG had its own problems.Kathleen Vereen Dayton, \\"Mall Still in Limbo As Area Hopes for Development,\\" The Sun News, March 20, 2005. The bridge that was supposed to help the area had no funding, though work on extending Harrelson Boulevard past an interchange on U.S. 17 Bypass was set to begin.Zane Wilson, \\"2 Contracts Awarded for Connectors,\\" The Sun News, May 7, 2005. One of the Waccamaw facility's buildings was used seasonally as a rehearsal location for the Radio City Rockettes. By 2008, a development called Paradise City was planned on part of the site by the developers of Hard Rock Park, which made Mall 3 its headquarters. The plans fell through when the park shut down, and the property became neglected. A few businesses still operated in the shopping center, and some considered themselves successful. On December 30, 2011, according to Horry County property records, 3W LLC bought 52 acres and 600,000 square feet from General Electric Credit Equities (a unit of General Electric) for $7.5 million. Alain Wizman of Keller Williams, which represented 3W in the transaction and would handle leasing, said $1 million would be spent on improvements and the complex would get a new name that included Waccamaw. Property manager Martin Durham said spaces on the outside would be filled first, followed by the interiors of the two malls. By the end of June 2012, one business had moved in. Waccamaw Center, as it was later called, attracted a number of businesses of different types as well as a branch of NewSpring Church. One reason is the location on a major highway without the cost normally associated with this benefit. In October 2014, work was supposed to start on a half million dollars worth of landscaping. Other improvements were planned, and it was predicted that 25 stores would be located in the mall. As of July 2018, Waccamaw Center had 25 tenants, and 3W LLC stated their goal was to establish an Asian-oriented multicultural center. Cultural events had been held over the previous several years.

They were senior football finalists in 1986, club of the year 1979, and home club of Matt Goff who featured on the Kildare millennium football team at full-back. Geography The Leixlip club was first affiliated to the Gaelic Athletic Association in 1887. For the following few years progress was slow and club activity was haphazard. However, in 1912 a meeting was convened in the local school for the purpose of re-forming the club. John J Radley, a local school-master agreed to act as Honorary Secretary and another teacher, P Mullaney ‚Äì then a member of the Leinster Council of the GAA ‚Äì was appointed as his assistant. A committee was formed and, due to the influence of a local priest, Fr. Dooley, permission was given by the late William Mooney of Leixlip Castle, for the use of a field for matches and practice. In 1939 a clubhouse was opened in the Main Street and was the centre of activities until the 1950s when a premises, now Tuthills Shop, was purchased on the Captains Hill and converted to a hall at a cost in excess of IR¬£600. It was named the ‚ÄúJoe Fox Memorial Hall‚Äù as a tribute to Joe‚Äôs many years of endeavour in promoting the ideals of Cumann Luthchleas Gael in Leixlip and Co. Kildare. In 1954, ¬£1,200 was spent on the purchase of out present grounds. The initial development cost ¬£600 and the official opening took place on October 3, 1954. The above amount of money was a large investment in those days as Leixlip was then a very small village community. On June 6, 1975, the President of Ireland, Mr. Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh, laid the foundation stone for the complex and on the October 1, 1978, the official opening was performed by then President of the GAA, Mr. Con Murphy. The Centenary Year of the GAA 1984 was marked by a special Club Day - ‚ÄòL√° na gClub'. The Club‚Äôs Centenary was celebrated in 1987 and proved to be a gala occasion, the centrepiece being a special Banquet at which the guest of honour was the Association's former President, Dr. Michael Loftus. The young members of the club put on a striking pageant ‚Äì depicting the history of the club. It was an impressive performance and is now recorded for posterity on Video. Radley Park was re-opened on May 12, 1991 by the then President of the GAA, Mr. Peter Quinn. May 16, 2004 saw the culmination of years of endeavour by the members and the financial and moral support of the local community when the Minister of Finance and TD, Mr. Charlie McCreevy officiated at the opening the club‚Äôs new facilities. Gaelic Football Six years after their foundation St Mary's lost a replayed junior final to Paul Doyle's Maddenstown team. Leixlip's team led by Tom Farrell and Ned Malone were defeated in the 1924 Kildare junior final by Roseberry, won the Intermediate championship in 1929 and played two Leader Cup finals in 1937, beating Carbury in a replay in Kilcock, and 1940, losing to Carbury in Rathcoffey. Matt Goff played on the Ireland Tailteann Games team of 1928 and won two All Ireland medals with Kildare. Andy Walsh was an inter-county goalkeeper in the 1930s. Kerry All Star Jack O'Shea played with Leixlip in the late 1980s and 1990s. Ronan Quinn and Enda Murphy represented Kildare, while Enda played for Ireland in International Rules Series. Tommy Moolick captained Kildare U21s to their 10th Leinster crown in April 2013. The club's last success at senior level was in 2012, when they won the Senior D Reserve Championship.

Pyrometric devices do not measure temperature, but can report temperature equivalents. In principle, a pyrometric device relates the amount of heat work on ware to a measurable shrinkage or deformation of a regular shape. Care should be taken with the interpretation, as some naively assume they are a measure of temperature alone.  Types  ; Rings :Are flat, hollow centred rings whose contraction is proportional to the heat work experienced. A micrometer or gauge measures the fired ring, with the difference being an arbitrary number that is used to describe the firing regime experienced. Various grades of ring, each of slightly different compositions, are available to cover all firing conditions and temperature equivalents likely to be encountered. Examples of pyrometric rings include Bullers Rings, PTCR Rings and Thermorings.http://www.schwendler.de/english/tempindi.htm ; Bars :Are square, sectioned bars held horizontally across two fixed distance supports. During firing the softening of the material results in sagging at the centre. Pyrometric Bars have found popularity in Kiln Sitters, which uses the described deformation to act as a triggering element, thus turning off the kiln at a desired point of maturity. Examples of pyrometric Bars include Holdcroft Bars and \\"Orton Bars\\". ; Cones :Are slender, three sided pyramids made from a range of compositions each with a reference number corresponding to a certain heat work. Rather than shrink as rings do, a cone's tip will bend forward to the same level as the base at the time of maturity. Other deformation of a cone, such as bloating, cracking, or bending backward, can be appropriately interpreted to troubleshoot activity inside the kiln. ; Discs :Are calibrated ceramic disc-shaped devices. Examples include Bullers Process Control Discs and TempCHEKS.http://www.mantectechnicalceramics.com/products- services/kiln-furnace-products/temperature-control/bullers-process-control- discs-bpcds  History  In 1782, Josiah Wedgwood created accurately scaled pyrometric device, with details published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1782 (Vol. LXXII, part 2). This led him to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society. The modern form of the pyrometric cone was developed by the German ceramics technologist Hermann Seger and first used to control the firing of porcelain wares at the K√∂nigliche Porzellanmanufaktur (Royal Porcelain Works) in Berlin, in 1886. Seger cones are still made by a small number of companies and the term is often used as a synonym for pyrometric cones. Holdcroft Bars were developed in 1898 by Holdcroft & Co.A.Dodd, D.Murfin (ed.)Dictionary Of Ceramics. 3rd edition. Institute of Materials. 1994. . Bullers rings have been in continuous production for over 80 years, and are currently in use in over 45 countries. The manufacturers, Taylor Tunnicliff Limited, were founded in 1867. The Standard Pyrometric Cone Company was founded by Edward J. Orton, Jr. in 1896. PTCR rings (Process Temperature Control Rings) were originally called \\"Phillips Temperature Control Rings\\" and developed by Phillips Electronics in Uden, Netherlands. The plant is now owned by Ferro and moved to its current location in St Dizier France in 2010.

Ones to watch ''' Ryan Sexton a young pacey baller definitely one for the future hacker to watch for Eoghan Connolly he'll come for your Gaa club History Gaelic Football The earliest recorded history of GAA in the area goes back to the turn of the century, Nurney Club was formed in 1912 or 1913 but only lasted 3 years. The main reason for the breakup of the team at this time is believed to have been due to quite a number of the young men of the area going to the First World War. This team wore a white jersey and a green sash and some of the teams they played against in that era were Maddenstown, Kilbern, Narraghmore, Kilrush, Bert, Ballitore and Moone. In 1915 another Club was formed in the area called Kildoon, Joseph Breen was one of the founders. This team also lasted about 2 or 3 years. In the early 1930s another team was formed with Eamonn Lawlor being one of the founders. They played their games on the Balkinstown road in Hanleys field. Some of the players at this time were Paddy, Carroll, Thomas Farrell, Pat Cahill and Johnny Ging, the Chairman of the Club was Tim Kelly. After the break-up of Kildoon in 1940 many players played with a successful Kildangan Team and in 1942 this Kildangan Team won the Junior Championship. The team which won this championship was as follows:- *John Sexton *George Sexton *Jack Sexton *Eamonn Lawlor *Paddy Behan *Tommy Berns *Michael Ryan *Johnny Conway *Mick Behan *Jimmy Behan *Tommy Behan *John Joe Martin *John Merrins *Joseph Conlan *Bill Broderick The Kildangan team beat Cappagh in this final of 1942 in the County Grounds in Newbridge. The winners were 1 point behind in the last minute when a goal by Midfielder Hal Conway secured victory. The previous year in 1941 they had been beaten in the final by Ardclough and in 1943 they reached the Intermediate Final also against Ardclough who went on to dominate Senior Football for a number of years later. Full back Jack Sexton represented Kildare at Senior Level in 1936-37 as did goalkeeper John (Shirty) Sexton around this time. Shirty actually played in the Railway Cup for Leinster around 1937, playing against Munster in Portlaoise. In 1944 Kildoon were reformed, practising in Allens Field with many of the players returning from Kildangan. They were unsuccessful for a number of years and later played their Matches in Merrins & Deerings field. They again broke up in 1950, reforming again in 1956 under the Chairmanship of Tim Kelly and Con Houlihan as Secretary. This team had a relatively successful run getting to a quarter final one year, a semi-final and in 1958 they reached the Junior Final against Clongorey where they were beaten by 2-4 to 2-3. This team also went three years unbeaten in the league. In 1964 a meeting was held with the topic on the Agenda being the amalgamation of the Kildoon & Kildangan clubs to form Nurney G.A.A. Club with Sean O‚ÄôConnor being Chairman and Con Houlihan Secretary. In 1968 it made a major step forward by purchasing a field from the Land Commission, a decision which showed tremendous foresight on the part of men like Con Houlihan, Sean O‚ÄôConnor & Jack Brennan (RIP). The club purchased the field for ¬£800 and the first trustees were Joe Martin, Sean O'Connor, and Jack Brennan, the ownership was vested in them and later in the GAA, Croke Park. The young Club had now its own home and the emphasis was now placed on the playing end of things. Success would not arrive for a number of years. 1975 saw the commencement of the G.A.A. Centre and Dressing Rooms, with this complex being officially opened in 1978 with a game between Kildare and Offaly marking the opening. This period also marked an upturn in the fortunes of the Club with many underage players winning championships with Rosglas and the Junior Team reaching the final stages of the Championship. Nurney reached the Semi-Final of the Championship in 1978, 1981, & 1983\\\\. The first final was reached in 1980 when Nurney was beaten by 2 points in a replay to an Eadestown team containing Larry & Joe Tomkins and Dave Kavanagh. In 1982 another final was reached more heartbreak as Celbridge beat the Nurney men by a single point. Spirits were not dampened by these defeats and numerous Tournaments were won during this period, also a League Title in 1980, Nurney gaining revenge over Eadestown for the Championship defeat. 1984 saw another final being reached and this time Nurney made no mistake beating hot favourites Straffan by 13 points. Nurney continued on their winning ways that year beating Clogherinkoe in the final of the Jack Higgins Cup by 2 points after a replay. Nurney were now an Intermediate side and 1985 saw them reach the Semi final of this Championship only to be beaten by Suncroft after another replay. The Club continued in the Intermediate Championship up to 1989 without success and in 1990 they returned to Junior Ranks. Many Nurney players have worn the White Jersey of Kildare over the years, with Pat Deering winning a Leinster U-21 medal in 1972. Syl Merrins winning a Leinster U-21 medal in 1983, a Leinster Junior Medal in 1989, and an O‚ÄôByrne Cup‚Äù Medal with the Seniors in 1989. In 2004 William Heffernan won an Leinster Under 21 title. Eddie Molloy and Seamus Deering have won All-Ireland medals with the over 40‚Äôs team in 1990 and 1991. Others to represent the County have been John Conway, Pat Burke, Pat Smullen, Francis Byrne, and Darren Byrne, Patrick Hannon and Neil Houlihan and Andrew Behan. For the past few years Michael Conway and William Heffernan have been ever present on the Kildare senior Football panel helping Kildare to an All Ireland Quarter Final, Semi Final and Leinster Final in recent years under the management of Kieran McGeeney. An emphasis has been placed on youth over the last few years, with some promising players coming through the minor and U-16 teams and winning numerous titles with school teams at U-11 & U-13 grades. In 2001 Nurney Camogie Club was reformed and now has almost 100 members catering for girls from under 9 to under 14. In 2005 a junior Camogie team entered competition for the first time in 30 years and this year also Nurney won Under 11 Camogie titles in both Club and schools competitions. In 2006,in a return to winning ways, the senior team won the Junior A championship and Division 3 league title beating Straffan and Grange respectively. The team was Paul Conway, Leslie Broughall, Brian Behan, Keith McCormack, Derek Bracken, Darren Byrne, Robert Behan, Willie Heffernan, Eoin Merrins, Pa Joe Hannon, Patrick Higginbotham, Paddy Sexton, Andy Behan, Mikey Conway, Murt Conway. In 2014 Nurney won the Division 3 league title while also gaining promotion to Division 2. They beat Suncroft in the final 0-13 to 1-6 in St Conleth's Park, Newbridge. The team was Shaun Conway, Keith McCormack, Brian Behan, Robert Behan, Rory O'Donoghue, John Merrins, Ciaran Callan, Willie Heffernan (0-2), Darren Byrne (0-2), Michael Conway (0-5 3fs), Steven Conway, Kevin Callan, Brian Cahill (0-4 1f), Andrew Behan, Martin Conway. The growth in population in the Nurney area has seen a huge increase in the participation of people in our Club. Our pitch and G.A.A. Centre are used on a continuous basis and is a focal point for the community. Hurling Nurney were one of the first participants in the Junior B Hurling championship. Camogie In the early days of Nurney camogie the club was known as St Judes, a set of accounts (one page) exists for a year in the 1930s. This is a very important document as it suggests a committee and a formal structure was in place. Such a formal set up in those years was a precursor for the well organised club that exists today. Margaret Deering (now Sexton) of Nurney scored 1-1 for Kildare in the Leinster Junior/Smyco Cup final victory over Meath in 1967. In 2001 Nurney Camogie Club was reformed and now has almost 100 members catering for girls from under 9 to under 14. In 2005 a junior Camogie team entered competition for the first time in 30 years and in 2005 also Under 11 Camogie titles in both Club and schools competitions. Since then a number of underage competitions have been secured including Senior Schools titles in 2009 and 2010. In 2010 also the club won the Junior C Championship, Under 21 B & Minor B Championship (amalgamation with Moorefield). The following have played at intercounty level for Kildare since the clubs reformation. Under 14- Ciara Merrins, Tara Fahey, Ali O'Brien, √Åine Bagnall, Sin√©ad Hagney. Under 16 - Claire Reilly, Phillippa Cains, Lorna Merrins, Aoife Dowdall, Ciara Merrins, Paula Lambert, Laura Furlong, Louise Higginbotham. Minor - Lorna Merrins, Ciara Merrins, Sophie Fleming, Amy Scanlan Ladies Football In 2007, a ladies football club was formed - Kildangan/Nurney. The club now have teams from Under 10 to Senior level. The success of the underage section of the club in the early years proved beneficial for the senior team in 2012 when they won the Junior D Championship. They followed this success winning a League title in 2013. The club have been represented at county level at all grades, with Lara Gilbert captaining the Kildare U16 team in 2016 and Sabrina Kennedy named as Minor Vice-Captain. Handball Nurney is one of the few clubs where handball has been played continuously. The first alley in Nurney was erected in Kildoon, beside a road that no longer exists; joining Kildoon to Nurney via the Sweeps Lane. It is believed that the Kildoon handball alley was built in the late 1700s and local folklore has it that it was built by men involved with the United Irishmen movement and its erection was used as a front for meetings, a practice that was banned at the time. In the middle of the 1930s a new alley was built on the Nurney end of this lane, in front of Nurney school. The building was of mass concrete and the builders were the young men of the area among whom were Tommy O'Brien, Ned Hyland, P Boland Tim Kelly and Pat Delaney Tommy O'Brien was a formidable athlete and was a well known handballer. He represented Kildare at junior level as an individual and with Ned Hyland as his doubles partner won many an intercounty match.

In 2020, he was honoured to be an international member of the National Academy of Sciences.http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2020-nas- election.html  Life  Patrick Cramer studied chemistry at the Universities of Stuttgart and Heidelberg (Germany) from 1989 until 1995.Website of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, CV He completed a part of his studies as ERASMUS scholar at the University of Bristol in the UK. As a research student he also worked in the lab of Sir Alan Fersht in Cambridge, UK at the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology (LMB) site. In 1995 until 1998 he worked as a PhD student in laboratory of Christoph W. M√ºller at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Grenoble, France. He obtained his PhD in natural sciences (Dr. rer. nat.) from the University of Heidelberg in 1998. From 1999 until 2001 Cramer worked as postdoctoral researcher and fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG) in the laboratory of the later Nobel Prize laureate Roger D. Kornberg at Stanford University, USA. In 2001 Patrick Cramer returned to Germany where he obtained a tenure-track professorship for biochemistry at the Gene Center of the University of Munich (Ludwig Maximilians University, LMU where he was later, in 2004, appointed full professor of biochemistry. Patrick Cramer headed the Gene Center of the University of Munich for 10 years, from 2004 until 2013. He also served as Dean of the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy from 2007 to 2009, and as Director of the Department of Biochemistry from 2010 to 2013. Cramer also was a member of the University Research Board from 2007 to 2013 and speaker of the research network grant SFB464 of the German Research Council (DFG). On January 1, 2014 Patrick Cramer was appointed Director at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen, Germany. He is a member of the Editorial Board for Cell.  Achievements  Patrick Cramer conducts basic research as the head of the Department of Molecular Biology at the Max Planck Institute in G√∂ttingen. He also works as a science manager and an honorary professor at the University of G√∂ttingen. During his postdoctoral research with Roger Kornberg, Cramer determined the atomic, three-dimensional structure of RNA polymerase II, one of the biggest enzymes in the cell nucleus. This work played a decisive role when the Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to Roger Kornberg in 2006 for studies of the molecular basis of eukaryotic transcription. The laboratory of Patrick Cramer investigates the molecular mechanisms and systemic principles of gene transcription in eukaryotic cells. The laboratory uses integrated structural biology methods, including X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy, and biochemical tools. The Cramer laboratory also uses functional genomics and computational biology approaches to study the principles of transcription in living cells. The group of Patrick Cramer created the first molecular movie of transcription initiation and elongation. Moreover, Patrick Cramer developed methods to analyze fundamental aspects of RNA metabolism in cells by integrating aspects of both molecular and systems biology. His long-term goal is to understand the expression and the regulation of the genome. The laboratory thus pioneers an approach that combines structural and genome-wide methods and may be referred to as molecular systems biology. In April, 2020, Dr Cramer's team at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry created the first \\"3D structure of the corona polymerase\\" for the COVID-19 virus. Their model will allow researchers \\"to investigate how antiviral drugs such as remdesivir ‚Äì which blocks the polymerase ‚Äì work, and to search for new inhibitory substances.\\" Patrick Cramer also commits himself to the further development of life sciences in Germany and Europe. He was one of the founders of the national cluster of excellence \\"Center for Integrated Protein Science (CIPSM)\\" and initiated the construction of the new research building, the \\"Munich Research Center for Molecular Biosystems (BioSysM)\\". In addition, Cramer was one of the members of the scientific and technical advisory board of the Bavarian state government and worked on bioethics within the institute TTN.

History The club was founded in 1945 under the name Staplestown GFC. The original colours were green white and gold and remained so until 1963 when the club added St. Kevin's to the Staplestown name and changed their colour to black and red. The name refers to Saint Kevin of Glendalough. Various locations were used for matches until the present grounds were acquired in 1961. The dressing rooms were built in 1982 and the ground was named the Jack Casey Memorial Park in memory of the club secretary who had been so instrumental in purchasing the pitch originally. The bar and hall were added in recent years. The first official match played by the club was a junior league game against Caragh in Prosperous in March 1946 losing out by 3‚Äì4 to 1‚Äì3. It took until the third round of the league to gain the first win, defeating another newly formed club Firmount 1‚Äì3 to 1‚Äì2 which was played in Allen. In their first ever championship match they defeated Rathcoffey 1‚Äì2 to 1‚Äì1 but lost to Straffan in the second round. A lean few years followed until 1966 when they contested the junior league final, the first ever final contested by the club, but were beaten by a point by Milltown. The seventies proved to be the most successful decade for the club when they went from Junior B to Senior. In that period the club contested two Junior B finals, two Jack Higgins Cup finals, a division 3 senior league final, a division 2 senior league final and two junior league division 2 finals. The Junior B championship was won in 1972 when they defeated Raheens, the first ever championship win for the club. The Junior A championship was won in 1976 when they defeated Leixlip. The intermediate final was contested for the first time in 1978 but was lost by a point. The intermediate championship crown was secured in 1979 when they defeated St. Laurence's in the final. The senior league division 3 crown was also won in 1973 by going through the entire campaign unbeaten. Although they lost the division 2 final, promotion to division 1 was won for the first time in 1980. Another Division 2 final defeat came in 1982. The club played in the senior championship from 1980 to 1990, reaching the semi-final in 1984 where they were beaten by five points by eventual winners Clane. The nineties were to prove a frustrating period for the club. The club would go one to contest four intermediate final from 1995 to 1999. In 1995, managed by Joe Fox they lost to local rivals Caragh. They came back again the following year with Tommy Carew in charge only to lose the final after a replay by a point to Eadestown. Two years later it was the turn of Brian O'Keefe to lead them to an intermediate final again only to lose to Kilcullen this time. O'Keefe would lead them to final again the following year only to lose to Maynooth by a point, yet again after a replay. Some consolidation could be taken during the nineties as the division 3 title was won in 1997. Recent years have proved to be a mixed bag for the club. The division 3 title was secured again in 2004. However two more intermediate final defeats came in 2004 and 2005. Brian O'Keefe was back at the helm in 2004 when they lost to Maynooth again in the final. The following year Confey beat them in the intermediate final. After a great start that day they lead Confey by 1‚Äì2 to 0‚Äì0 after 10 minutes but faded badly and Confey won by two points. Confey went on to win the Leinster intermediate championship. A monkey was finally got off their back when they beat bogey team Maynooth in the Division 2 final by 0‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì7 in 2008. The holy grail of the intermediate championship was finally achieved in 2008 but it was done the hard way. They played Monasterevan in the final having lost in the group stage already to Monasterevan in the group stage. The first final was to prove a tense affair with Monaterevan leading throughout. With one minute left Kevin's were down by 4 points but a goal was scored before they equalised deep into injury time. It finished 1‚Äì8 apiece. The replay was to prove a rather one sided affair with Kevin's winning out 2‚Äì9 to 0‚Äì6 All of the players who play hurling play for Coill Dubh as they are in the same parish. Coill Dubh in return provides a lot of players for St. Kevin's.

She is the network's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent reporting for ABC's World News Tonight with David Muir, Nightline, and other network broadcasts. In addition to her work for ABC News, Raddatz has written for The New Republic and is a frequent guest on PBS's Washington Week. Raddatz is the primary fill-in anchor on This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Early life Raddatz was born in Idaho Falls, Idaho. Her family later moved to Salt Lake City. She attended the University of Utah but dropped out to work at a local station. Career Raddatz interviewing United States Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in January 2013 Prior to 1993, Raddatz was the chief correspondent at the ABC News Boston affiliate WCVB-TV. From 1993 to 1998, Raddatz covered the Pentagon for National Public Radio. Raddatz began her tenure at ABC News in 1999 as the network's State Department correspondent and became ABC's senior national security correspondent in May 2003, reporting extensively from Iraq. On June 8, 2006, Raddatz received a tip that terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had been located and killed. This tip allowed Raddatz and ABC News to become the first news organization in the world to break the news shortly after 2:30 a.m. EST. In a March 24, 2008, extended interview with Dick Cheney conducted in Ankara, Turkey, on the fifth anniversary of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Raddatz posed a question about public opinion polls showing that Americans had lost confidence in the war, a question to which Cheney responded by saying \\"So?\\" Raddatz appeared taken aback by the response, and Cheney's remark prompted widespread criticism, including a Washington Post op- ed by former Republican Congressman and Cheney friend Mickey Edwards. Raddatz is also the author of the New York Times bestseller The Long Road Home: A Story of War and Family, a book about the Siege of Sadr City, Iraq. A TV mini series based on the book aired on NatGeo in late 2017. After the national security beat, Raddatz became the network's chief White House correspondent for the last term of the George W. Bush administration. On January 9, 2007, Raddatz's mobile phone went off during a White House press briefing with Tony Snow. Of particular humor was her musical ring tone, Chamillionaire's \\"Ridin'.\\" The press corps and Tony Snow enjoyed a few moments of laughter. Raddatz was appointed to her current position as ABC's Senior Foreign Affairs Correspondent in November 2008. Raddatz served as the moderator of the Vice- Presidential debate on October 11, 2012, between Paul Ryan and Joe Biden at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. Raddatz also served alongside Anderson Cooper as co-moderator for the second presidential debate in 2016, between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump at Washington University in St. Louis. Anderson and Raddatz were reviewed and some commentators noted their \\"no- nonsense approach\\" and \\"aggressive style\\", though Raddatz was criticized for a challenge to one of Trump's statements, which some journalists felt \\"fell outside of her mandate as moderator\\". The Guardian said in 2014 that Raddatz \\"is known for having well-cultivated sources inside the defense department.\\" Raddatz appeared as a reporter interviewing the President-elect of the United States in the 2017 episode \\"Imminent Risk\\" of the Showtime series Homeland.  Personal life  Raddatz resides in Arlington, Virginia, with her third husband, journalist Tom Gjelten.

The charter members of the district, which began playing in the 1994-1995 school year, were Centreville, Chantilly, Herndon, Thomas Jefferson, Oakton, South Lakes, and W.T.

It was not competitive because its size which was well below the AA/AAA cutoff, and also because it was new. Potomac Falls moved to the Northwestern District in 1999, and W.T. Woodson moved to the Liberty District This reunited it with crosstown rival Fairfax which dropped the Concorde to six schools.  2000-  In 2000, Westfield opened and joined the Concorde, making it the second newly established school to join the district. South Lakes left the Concorde in 2003 to the Liberty due to declining enrollment, and Thomas Jefferson was allowed to play in the National District for football while remaining in the Concorde for other sports. In 2005, Thomas Jefferson moved to the Liberty, while Fairfax moved to the Concorde, and Robinson moved from the Patriot to the Concorde district. In 2009, Fairfax returned to the Liberty. In 2017 as part of a realignment by the VHSL, Robinson and founding member Herndon left the Concorde District as Robinson returned the Patriot District and Herndon moved to the Liberty District.

The 1997 Lesotho Labour Force Survey found that 4.6% of males who were working full- time, 14.1% of males who were working part-time and 1.3% of male job seekers in Lesotho were aged between 10 and 15 years. Many of these would have been involved in herding and those with part-time work were not necessarily earning an income but may well have been working on family land in subsistence agriculture (i.e. they were economically active but not earning an income). Boys are most likely to be engaged in paid work, usually herding as reported in the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor. Girls who are paid are primarily engaged in domestic work. It is likely that both boys and girls are engaged in seasonal agricultural work across the border in South Africa, but no data on the extent of this phenomenon is available. Lesotho is in the process of formulating an Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (APEC), with the assistance of the International Labour Organization's (ILO) programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour. A Programme Advisory Committee on Child Labour (PACC), representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guides the development and implementation of the programme. The different elements of process are described in this article. Lesotho ratified both the ILO Minimum Age Convention (C138) and the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (C182) in 2001.

It was released for the PlayStation 2, alongside Xbox, Microsoft Windows and GameCube ports developed by Nixxes Software BV, in 2002. It is the sequel to the first game in the series, Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, with Blood Omen's protagonist, the vampire Kain, returning as the central character. Blood Omen 2 chronologically bridges the stories of the original Blood Omen and Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver, but it takes place in an alternate timeline created by the events of Soul Reaver 2. Centuries after Blood Omen, Kain is opposed by traitorous vampires and the minions of The Sarafan Lord, and sets out to continue his ascent to power. While Crystal Dynamics' Soul Reaver team began to produce Soul Reaver 2, a secondary crew started work on Blood Omen 2 in 1999. They sought to create a more action-focused entry in contrast to the Soul Reaver games' emphasis on puzzle-solving. The final product was a commercial success, becoming a Sony's \\"Greatest Hits\\" title, but received average reception, with critics citing its lower production values and lack of innovation relative to the Soul Reaver games as flaws. Gameplay Gameplay is presented in 3D and is a combination of combat and puzzle solving. Health is represented by two vials - a red vial symbolizing total hit points, and a blue vial which is an indicator as to how long it will take to increase overall health. Lost health can be regained by draining the blood of a downed enemy or civilian. As progression is made throughout the game, several weapons can be attained, such as a broadsword or staff. Weapons have limited durability and will eventually break if used for excessive blocking. If no weapons are selected, claws can be used to attack, as well as abilities, which are gained by killing bosses. These skills help in advancing through sections of the game, as well as puzzles. Most of the abilities - named Dark Gifts in the game - can only be used once the \\"Rage Meter\\" has been filled by defeating opponents. Plot Setting The vampire, Kain, refused to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars of Nosgoth at the end of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, thus damning the Pillars and the world of Nosgoth to an eternity of depravity and decay. Following his refusal, Kain built a vampire army with Vorador's help and attempted to conquer the world. Four hundred years after the events of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Kain awakes in Meridian, Nosgoth's industrial capital city. He remembers very little, and is lacking much of his former power. He is greeted by a vampire called Umah, who informs Kain that he has been asleep for two hundred years. Two hundred years before, Kain's conquest of Nosgoth had been opposed by an army of vampire hunters called the Sarafan Order. The Sarafan Order destroyed Kain's army, and Kain himself was defeated in combat by their leader, the Sarafan Lord who then claimed the Soul Reaver from Kain. In the years since, the Sarafan have imposed harsh martial law on Nosgoth's human population, and started an industrial revolution. Employing 'Glyph magic'‚Äîa new kind of magic, deadly to vampires‚Äîthey have hunted the remaining vampires to near extinction: as a result, several vampires have agreed to serve the Sarafan out of self-preservation. Umah is a member of the Cabal; an underground resistance movement formed of vampires and working to undermine the Sarafan at every turn. The Cabal hopes that Kain will destroy the Sarafan Lord, and the traitorous vampires that protect him. Kain sets out to get his revenge, reclaim the Soul Reaver sword from the Sarafan Lord, and continue his ascent to power. Story The story is a paradox in Nosgoth's history. Because Raziel's soul was not absorbed into the physical Soul Reaver, an alternate history was introduced into Blood Omen 2. This history places Kain at the threshold of gaining his empire, but because of the weakened state of the Pillars, the Hylden race was able to re-enter Nosgoth. The Hylden masquerade as the defunct Sarafan army to exploit Nosgoth. With their arrival they created an Industrial Age, hunted the Vampire race to near extinction, and domesticated humanity through harsh martial laws and overbearing taxation. Their Glyph magic is used to power Nosgoth's industrial revolution. The surviving vampires serve the Hylden through espionage. The Cabal, an underground resistance working to topple the Sarafan's plans, are led by Vorador - resurrected in this alternate timeline. They plan to use Kain as the unseen hand that will destroy the Sarafan's operation from the inside. However Kain plans to use this position to reclaim his place as Nosgoth's ruler. Kain was defeated by the Sarafan Lord through the betrayal of his lieutenants. He finds and kills them, absorbing their dark arts. During reconnaissance of the Sarafan's position one of Vorador's lieutenants, Umah, discovers the location of an amulet called the Nexus Stone. Umah informs Kain that the Nexus Stone is what the Sarafan Lord used to defeat him in their battle. Afterward Vorador tells Kain of a secret weapon, The Device, that will wipe away all life in Nosgoth that is not Hylden. Kain is then told to seek out the Seer, a witch that lives on the outskirts of Meridian. The Seer explains to Kain that the glyph magic that is supplying Meridian with power is also being used to power The Device. He also drinks her blood to receive telekinesis. As they talk the Sarafan Lord, secretly tracking Kain, sets fire to her house. Sacrificing her safety, the Seer then teleports Kain to the Eternal Prison. Kain is able to find the Builder, who confesses he built The Device out of arrogance, and wishes to make amends by helping Kain destroy his creation. He tells Kain the Device is powered by a massive life-form called the Mass. The Mass has powerful psychic abilities but is harmless if there is no way to channel the creature's power. Kain is told the Mass is weak against the blood of an Ancient, and the Builder asks Kain to drain him of his blood, and to feed it to the Mass, ensuring its destruction. Kain does so, and faces his last lieutenant (Magnus) before leaving the Eternal Prison. Kain finds out that Magnus never betrayed him, and only wanted to be his champion. He tried to confront the Sarafan Lord himself, but lost and was then cast into the Eternal Prison, where he lost his mind. Kain destroys the Mass and, leaving the Hylden's lair, meets Janos Audron who has regained his true form. Kain does not know Janos yet, but learns he is the last true ancient vampire. After Janos explains to Kain part of the history concerning the Hylden, their lord/general and Kain's own involvement in them (unwittingly allowing the Hylden Lord to slip into Nosgoth from the Demon Realm as the pillars were ruined and dimensional barriers weakened), Janos transports Kain and Himself to sanctuary where Vorador and Umah are waiting. Janos explains to the gathered vampires the nature of the Hylden and their plan to invade Nosgoth via a Hylden Gate, located in the ancient Hylden city across the Great Southern Sea from Meridian. However, Janos cannot transport the vampires there immediately as the city is protected by a magical barrier. It is agreed that Kain and Umah are to infiltrate a ship heading to the city from the Wharves and neutralize the barrier when on site. Umah starts to question Kain's plans for Nosgoth, wondering how his stern rule would be better than that of the Sarafan. She steals the Nexus Stone from Kain and sets off to defeat the Hylden Lord herself. Not long after that, Kain finds Umah mortally wounded, though he has a chance to save her, he refuses, unable to trust her due to the earlier treachery. Kain kills Umah but regrets it, noting that ‚Ä≥now you have left me alone‚Ä≥. Kain then proceeds to board a vessel heading out to sea. Kain encounters the Hylden Lord waiting at the docks of the Hylden City. The two exchange words and the Hylden Lord attempts to strike Kain down with the Soul Reaver, but is stopped by the Nexus Stone that protected him from Kain's similar attack 200 years ago. The Hylden Lord teleports away and Kain proceeds to explore the Hylden city. After destroying the generator powering the magical barrier, Vorador and Janos warp in. Vorador asks Kain about Umah, being unable to sense her, and Kain tells him that she is dead and openly declares that he killed her for treason, even though he could have saved her. Vorador is horrified at Kain's ruthlessness and the two seem to be on the verge of fighting, but Janos urges them to put aside their conflict. Just as Kain agrees to settle affairs with Vorador later, the Sarafan Lord ambushes the trio and wounds Vorador and Janos, depriving Kain of their help. Janos teleports Kain nearer to the gate and stays behind to tend to Vorador. Having finally reached the Hylden Gate Kain finds the Hylden Lord. Kain and the Hylden Lord speak, Kain offers the Hylden Lord a choice of exile or annihilation as he destroys the Hylden Gate, while the Hylden Lord berates Kain for his petty lust for power and dominion over Nosgoth, akin to a petty noble who gained too much power and can never be sated. Kain denounces the Hylden Lord, boasting how all of his spies and traitors have fallen before him, even Umah. Surprised, the Hylden Lord claims that he has no spy named Umah, at which Kain angrily attacks him. After a brief struggle Kain knocks the Hylden Lord off the platform, but he reappears, gloating how Kain cannot slay him while the Hylden Gate is active. Kain then casts the Nexus Stone into the gate, which begins to implode. Janos arrives at that moment and exchanges hateful words with the Hylden Lord. The Hylden Lord grabs Janos and throws him into the imploding vortex and turns to Kain, who is now in possession of the Soul Reaver. The Hylden Lord and Kain battle one final time, but armed with the Soul Reaver and with the Nexus Stone gone, Kain easily defeats the Hylden Lord. The Hylden Lord, in his dying breath, assures Kain that the war between Vampires and Hylden will never be over, as the Demon Realm ensures the immortality of the Hylden race. Kain states that should the Hylden ever return, he will be waiting and kills the Hylden Lord. As the Hylden City is slowly destroyed by the collapsing gate, Kain is seen slowly walking away, pondering his plans for Nosgoth. Development Blood Omen 2 was not produced with the involvement of the Soul Reaver crew, instead being created by a new team at Crystal Dynamics under the direction of Glen Schofield. A key point of focus for the developers was the main character, Kain; Crystal Dynamics had \\"a huge investment in Kain as a character\\". Reception The Xbox version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the other console versions received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. AllGame gave the PS2 and Xbox versions three stars out of five, saying of the former, \\"Even with the ordinary combat and rather tedious puzzles, Blood Omen 2 still manages to be compelling enough to keep you playing to the end, which is a testament to the overall presentation and varied locales\\"; and of the latter, \\"Less demanding players will be more tolerant of the game's repetitive nature, while others will yearn for something juicier to sink their teeth into.\\" References External links * Category:2002 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Alternate history video games Category:Dark fantasy video games Category:Legacy of Kain Category:GameCube games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox games Category:Crystal Dynamics games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Vampire video games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Blood Omen 2"},{"id":"4239875","text":"Francisco Jos√© may refer to: *Francisco Jos√© Arn√°iz Zarandona *Francisco Jos√© Borja Cevallos *Francisco Jos√© Caeiro *Francisco Jos√© Camarasa *Francisco Jos√© Carrasco *Francisco Jos√© Cox *Francisco Jos√© Cr√≥quer *Francisco Jos√© Debali *Francisco Jos√© Fernandes Costa *Francisco Jos√© Fern√°ndez Mas *Francisco Jos√© Freire *Francisco Jos√© Furtado *Francisco Jos√© Garanito Sousa *Francisco Jos√© Jattin Safar *Francisco Jos√© Lara *Francisco Jos√© Lloreda Mera *Francisco Jos√© Lombardi *Francisco Jos√© L√≥pez Fern√°ndez *Francisco Jos√© Madero Gonz√°lez *Francisco Jos√© Maldonado *Francisco Jos√© Mart√≠nez *Francisco Jos√© Mill√°n Mon *Francisco Jos√© Monagas *Francisco Jos√© M√∫gica *Francisco Jos√© Nicol√°s Gonz√°lez *Francisco Jos√© Pacheco *Francisco Jos√© Pinheiro *Francisco Jos√© P√©rez *Francisco Jos√© Ribas *Francisco Jos√© Rodr√≠guez Gait√°n *Francisco Jos√© S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez *Francisco Jos√© Tenreiro *Francisco Jos√© Urrutia Holgu√≠n *Francisco Jos√© Urrutia Olano *Francisco Jos√© Yndur√°in *Francisco Jos√© de Almeida Lopes *Francisco Jos√© de Caldas *Francisco Jos√© de Ovando, 1st Marquis of Brindisi  See also  * * ","title":"Francisco Jos√©"},{"id":"4239881","text":"The 5th Discover Screenwriting Award, given by the American Screenwriters Association on March 9, 2006, honored the best screenwriter(s) of 2005.

He is sometimes depicted as one of a group of Atomic Knights, which first appeared in Strange Adventures #117 (June 1960) and ran quarterly in that monthly comic up through #160 (January 1964). Sergeant Gardner Grayle is portrayed by Boone Platt in the live action series Black Lightning. The original Atomic Knights The only Atomic Knights cover appearance in Strange Adventures #144. Note the giant Dalmatians. The Atomic Knights appeared in every third issue of Strange Adventures in the early 1960s, beginning with #117 (June 1960) and running through #160 (January 1964). In all there were 15 early-1960s Atomic Knights stories created by writer John Broome and artist Murphy Anderson; they were a band of heroes living in and protecting the post- apocalyptic future of 1992. Following the catastrophic Hydrogen War of 1986, a petty tyrant named the Black Baron ruled a small section of the Midwestern United States with an iron fist. He was opposed by Sgt. Gardner Grayle and the Atomic Knights, who wore medieval suits of armor that were impervious to the Baron's energy weapons, the armor having been irradiated in the war. The other Knights were twins Wayne and Hollis Hobard, Bryndon Smith, the last scientist left on Earth, and brother and sister Douglas and Marene Herald. The group became a symbol of hope to the survivors of the cataclysm. The Atomic Knights, mid-70s incarnation The 15 Atomic Knights stories in Strange Adventures took place in \\"real time\\" (three months usually passed between the events of each story as well as in the real world) and generally dealt with post-holocaust recovery, as the Knights would fend off menaces and attempt to rebuild the area around their home base of Durvale, though they also managed to travel to Los Angeles, Detroit, New Orleans, New York, and Washington, D.C. The Atomic Knights concept then lay dormant for more than a decade, until Cary Bates used the Knights as guest-stars in the mid-1970s series Hercules Unbound, beginning with #10 (April‚ÄìMay 1977). Hercules, Kamandi, and the Atomic Knights all inhabited the same comics universe, one in which the Great Disaster had taken place (references to 1986 became less and less frequent as that date actually approached). Crisis on Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition had two Great Disaster realities: Earth-86 (where the Great Disaster was an atomic war) and Earth-295 (where the Great Disaster was natural). Since the Great Disaster on Earth-295 was natural that reality had no Atomic Knights. The entire Great Disaster concept has since been declared to be out-of-continuity in the current DC Universe, although one of the Post-52 alternate Earths (Earth-17) does feature the world of the Great Disaster. DC Comics Presents #57 attempted to retcon the Atomic Knights by 'revealing' them to be the dream of Gardner Grayle in a state of suspended animation (during which dream Superman attempts to prevent Grayle from causing a nuclear war). This story is not held to be canon in terms of the Earth of the Great Disaster, and little reference has been made to it after publication. The 15 Atomic Knights stories were reprinted in Strange Adventures #217-231. In 2010 they were collected into a single DC hardcover volume; their appearances in Hercules Unbound and DC Comics Presents had not been reprinted until a 2014 volume entitled Showcase Presents The Great Disaster Featuring the Atomic Knights. Fictional character biography Gardner Grayle On Earth-One, Gardner Grayle was a sergeant in the army. His platoon was the infamous Platoon 13 and its symbol was a knight. Feverishly opposed to nuclear war, Grayle volunteered for a virtual reality experiment to see how people would react to a post-atomic war world. Within this experiment, Grayle believed that the adventures of the Atomic Knights were only a dream. After emerging from the experiment, Grayle donned a S.T.A.R. Labs battle suit and declared himself a modern knight in shining armor, briefly becoming the second Shining Knight and serving with the Seven Soldiers of Victory. After a mildly successful career as a superhero, Grayle took a job at S.T.A.R. When he received a premonition from the goddess Cassandra, Grayle proceeded to use his new technical know-how to build his atomic armor. He then participated in the Crisis on Infinite Earths as one of the Forgotten Heroes who contacted Darkseid to enlist his help against the Anti-Monitor. Afterward, he appeared in the Outsiders (vol. 1), a team he joined and stayed with until its disbanding. The Outsiders would later reform (in vol. 2) but were considered fugitives after being framed for the slaughter of a Markovian village (home country to Outsider Geo-Force). At first, he hunted the team down but was ultimately convinced of their innocence and was able to clear their name to the rest of the world. He also helps the Outsiders battle a vampiric infestation of the underground nation of Abyssia. With the Outsiders, he also fell in love with fellow Outsider Windfall and they were seen together at Geo-Force's wedding. Beyond just his Atomic Knight armor, Gardner also had the power to see the future. The Atomic Knights from Battle for Bludhaven #6. Art by Dan Jurgens and Jim Palmiotti. In the post-Infinite Crisis mini-series The Battle for Bl√ºdhaven that takes place One Year Later, Gardner Grayle is the leader of an underground band of new Atomic Knights operating within the destroyed city of Bl√ºdhaven, working with an organization named the Roundtable towards helping citizens harassed by the organization known as S.H.A.D.E. and the new Black Baron (a former pimp and drug dealer who gains metahuman powers after the Bl√ºdhaven destruction and is later defeated by the golem known as Monolith). There are roughly 125 Atomic Knights, with the main Knights being Grayle, Marene and Doug Herald, Bryndon, and Wayne and Hollis Hobard (based on the original group from the 1960s), who are shown posing as refugees with the help of advanced cloaking technology, and using armor with numerous powers including the ability to record and analyze complex data and fire powerful ballistic and nuclear blasts. At the end of the series, Captain Atom obliterates the remains of Bl√ºdhaven, making way for the departure of S.H.A.D.E. operatives. After this, the Knights are seen entering an underground lush environment through a bunker named Command-D, reminiscent of their access to the post-nuclear world of their original incarnation. Command-D is the bunker in which Kamandi and his grandfather, the original OMAC, lived. In the second issue of Final Crisis, Dan Turpin travels to Bl√ºdhaven and briefly sees the Atomic Knights, riding atop giant dogs in the ruined city. Afterwards, he visits the Command-D bunker. In the third issue, the Knights accompany Wonder Woman into the city, where they go up against an evil Mary Marvel who has had her body augmented by their technology, who chops Marene Herald in half. In the fourth issue, the Atomic Knights among those in the Bl√ºdhaven Strike Force are eventually killed in battle, when Darkseid's forces showed their hand at Bl√ºdhaven. Powers and abilities Gardner Grayle has precognition. Equipment Gardner Grayle wears a suit of armor that grants him enhanced strength, speed, endurance and blasts of energy, as well as being adaptable to other technology. Other versions In the out-of- continuity maxi-series Justice, the Atom wears a suit of armor that resembles the Earth-One Atomic Knight. Atomic Knights from 52 Week 52, artist Justiniano In 52, the existence of a new Multiverse is revealed. These Earths are originally carbon copies of the New Earth created at the end of Infinite Crisis. Earth-17 One of the Earths, designated Earth-17 by Rip Hunter, is heavily altered by Mister Mind in his Hyperfly form, and his effects on the Earth have turned it into a copy of the home of the original version of the Atomic Knights, the version from their original stories. Based on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the original setting of the 1960s stories. Earth-38 In Countdown: Arena #2 (2007) an alternate version of Captain Atom appears who is the leader of that world's Atomic Knights.

This version is an A.S.A. sergeant. He first appears in \\"The Book of Resistance: Chapter Two: Henderson's Opus\\" as one of the A.S.A. soldiers seizing suspected metahumans when Black Lightning arrives. In the episode \\"The Book of Resistance: Chapter Three: The Battle of Franklin Terrace\\", Grayle allows Lynn Stewart to escape when the A.S.A.'s headquarters, the Pit, is locked down following Black Lightning's duel with Commander Carson Williams. In the episode \\"The Book of Markovia: Chapter One: Blessings and Curses Reborn\\", Major Sara Grey tasks Grayle and fellow operative Specialist Travis with bringing Jennifer Pierce to high-ranking agent Odell. Grayle enables Jennifer and Brandon to escape by incapacitating Travis. In the episode \\"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Two: Lynn's Addiction\\", Grayle pre-records a message for anyone to find if anything happens to him before helping Lynn to sneak Tobias Whale out of the Pit before they are attacked by a Markovian operative and teleported to Markovia by the teleporting mercenary Instant. In the episode \\"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Three: Motherless Id\\", Grayle contacts Black Lightning about what happened to Lynn and arranges a parley with Major Grey for a temporary truce to handle the matter. In the episode \\"The Book of Markovia: Chapter Four: Grab the Strap\\", while Grayle assisting Black Lightning and his allies in recusing Lynn from the Markovians, he stops Brandon Marshall from killing Dr. Helga Jace and evacuated them. In the season three finale, Grayle assisted in evacuating metahumans out of the Pit, only to be stopped by Gravedigger.

Like the neighbouring village of Glanamman it experienced a coal-mining boom in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but the last big colliery closed in 1936 and coal has been extracted fitfully since then. The village has the only Commissioners' church built in southwest Wales, traditionally a Methodist region. History The location of Garnant and Glanamman was known as Cwmamman (\\"Amman valley\\") before coal was discovered; until the 18th century it was a remote wilderness with just a few farms and rough mountain roads. Mining appears to have started at Brynlloi in Glanamman in 1757 and small coal workings proliferated in the first half of the 19th century. The lease to \\"Garnant Colliery\\" was offered in an advert of 1830, which was probably at the border of Garnant and Gwaun-cae-gurwen near the main road. The arrival of the Llanelly Railway in 1840 meant that coal could be exported on an industrial scale through Llanelli docks. The railway's decision to build two stations at Garnant (originally called Amman Valley) and Glanamman encouraged the two halves of Cwmamman to develop their own identity, as did the construction of Christchurch in Garnant at about the same time. Taking its name from the emblem of the Dynevor family, the \\"Raven\\" colliery in Garnant was operating by 1854 and opened a new shaft in 1907. By World War I it was employing 450 men. However, the mines were very dependent on the railway for transporting the coal, and when in the early 1920s there was a rail strike this caused mass unemployment (at a time when no work meant no pay), as is recorded by Arthur Bullock who was recruited to work at the Labour Exchange. (Page 128) The Raven colliery eventually closed in 1936 after an industrial dispute. The site is now the Raven Industrial Park. Coal mining has continued sporadically since then, most notably at an open-cast mine which extracted 2,000 tons per week between 1988 and 1992. The site is now the Garnant Park golf club.  Government  Cwmamman, the old name for the location of Glanamman and Garnant, was revived for the modern urban council covering the two villages which now have much smaller populations than in their heyday at the turn of the 20th century. Garnant is in the unitary authority of Carmarthenshire. Rhodri Glyn Thomas of Plaid Cymru currently represents the village at the Welsh Assembly in the constituency of Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. He had a majority of 8,000 votes over Labour's Kevin Madge in the Welsh Assembly Elections 2007.  Geography  The village is about 12 miles north of Swansea on the edge of the Black Mountain, in the westernmost part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. It lies at the junction of three rivers, where the Rivers Garnant and Pedol meet the River Amman. Garnant lies in the western part of the South Wales Coalfield, where the coal is particularly high-quality anthracite.  Demography  The effect of the mining boom can be seen in the expansion of Cwmamman parish (including Glanamman and surrounding villages) from just over 3,000 in 1851 to over 11,000 in the early 20th century. The population of Garnant ward was 1,965 people at the 2001 census, increasing to 2,139 at the 2011 census. Glanamman is a similar size.  Economy  Traditionally the economy was based on coal- mining with some dairy farming, but the mines have closed and farms have moved from milk production to beef-farming. Other industries sprang up in the valley during the 19th century, including the Amman Tinplate Works between 1883 and 1932 which was turned into Parc Golwg Yr Aman.  Culture and community  Since 1988 Cwmamman has been twinned with the village of Pouldergat, in Brittany. The community is a stronghold of the Welsh language, with 58.5% of people speaking it in the 2011 census.  Landmarks  The valley has been shaped by coal workings and their waste, but little remains above ground. Christchurch and the chapels (see below) are the main landmarks, along with the new school.  Transport  A turnpike road (now the A474) was constructed along the valley in 1817. The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company built the Llanelly Railway to Garnant in 1840. It was taken over by the GWR on amalgamation in 1923, and closed to passenger services by British Railways on 18 August 1958. Freight traffic continued until the closure of the Abernant Colliery in 1988. The Amman Valley Railway Society are seeking to restore the Abernant branch line as part of the Swansea 9 Lines project.  Education  Three local schools, Ysgol y Twyn, Ysgol Gynradd y Garnant and Ysgol Gynradd Glanaman, were merged to form Ysgol y Bedol (the Horseshoe School) at the confluence of the three rivers in Twyn. This primary school for ages 3‚Äì11 was opened in 2005. Ysgol y Bedol is a category A, or Welsh medium school. The nearest secondary school is Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford.  Religious sites  The Welsh valleys were a stronghold of Nonconformism. Old Bethel Chapel, also known as The Old Meeting House, was built in 1773 high on the north side of the valley between Glanamman and Garnant. Pevsner describes the pulpit on a wine-glass stem as an \\"exceptional rarity\\". In 1875 it was superseded by the New Bethel Chapel on the main road at the west end of village. Christchurch, the only Commissioners' church in southwest Wales was built above the river junction in 1839-42. The interior was refitted in 1888 and it is surrounded by a large graveyard. Ammanford, a few miles down the valley, was a centre of the 1904‚Äì1905 Welsh Revival which saw thousands of new converts. The revival affected Garnant and it was said that young men abandoned gambling and burnt their playing cards.  Sport  Garnant Park (formerly Cwmamman Recreation Ground) was part of Lord Dynevor's Glanrafon Farm estate. It is home to Amman United RFC which was founded in 1903 and is a feeder club for the Scarlets regional team. Players who have gone on to rugby at international level include Claude Davey, Tom Day and Trevor Evans of the British Lions. It is across the river from the old Amman Tinplate Works. In 1996 Cwmamman Town Council bought the site of the works and turned it into Parc Golwg Yr Aman (Amman View Park), with a basketball area, rugby field, skateboard park and fishing platforms. The opencast coalmine on the south side of the valley has been turned into Garnant Park golf club.

Child labour is often seen as a human rights concern because it is \\"work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development,\\" as defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Additionally, child labour is harmful in that it restricts a child's ability to attend school or receive an education. The ILO recognizes that not all forms of children working are harmful, but this article will focus on the type of child labour that is generally accepted as harmful to the child involved.  Origin  During the colonial period between 1914 and 1947, child labour played an important role in the British government's control of Eswatini. Swazi labour history has previously failed to acknowledge the contributions children made to the labour industry during the colonial period, perhaps because children are often seen as extensions of their parents rather than as individuals. At the beginning, children usually performed unpaid labour, but beginning in the 1930s paid labour became more common. Like today, agriculture and farming was one of the largest sectors of child labour.  Demographics  Many of the children in Eswatini subjected to harsh work conditions are victims of human trafficking. Despite the Eswatini government's attempts to reduce child labour, victims of human trafficking have historically worked in the most severe types of child labour jobs. AIDS orphans are also at a greater risk to be exploited for cheap labour. In 2006, half of all children engaged in Eswatini's sex trade were orphans.  Causes  Poverty is one of the most common determinants of child labour, and 69% of Swazis were living in poverty as of 2006. Because child labour interferes with schooling, an individual's ability to escape poverty is significantly reduced. This can create child- labour traps, in which the next generation is also forced into child labour because their family is still in poverty. Specifically, the cost of transportation is a barrier that prevents poor children from attending school in many African countries. According to Hannie Dlamini, the chairman of the Eswatini Aids Support Organisation (EASO), \\"the extended family system is breaking down and there is no-one to look after orphans,\\" meaning that \\"fifteen year olds are responsible for homes.\\" Eswatini is a lower middle- income country, and yet serious poverty exists because there is a very unequal distribution of wealth. The richest 10% control nearly half of the country's wealth, with the bottom 43% living in chronic poverty. In 1999, UNICEF found that many children initially went to work because their parents were unemployed, and the family needed a source of income. Orphaned children are at increased risk, and many orphans have lost their parents to AIDS. Eswatini has the highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, with nearly a quarter of the total population infected. Number of children in a household also affects child labour vulnerability. Because perceived quality of a child tends to decrease as the quantity of children in a family rise, parents and others are less concerned with protecting children that are from large families. In addition, large families have more people to share their income and resources between, consequently increasing their risk of poverty.  Controversy over morality  Although child labour is often seen as inherently bad because it has been found to be linked with adolescent mortality, some also argue that it should not be banned. For example, should a child be permitted to work after voluntarily signing a labour contract? Eswatini's growing poverty causes a need for children to work, particularly in rural areas. Also, 66% of the country's population is unable to meet basic food needs so sometimes, child labour may be the only solution for a family. The ILO also recognizes that some types of child labour may be permissible and makes the distinction between \\"child labour\\" and \\"hazardous work.\\" In 2012, the organization reported that 168 million children aged 5‚Äì17 are subjected to child labour worldwide, with 85 million of these cases considered to be hazardous work.  Efforts to reduce child labour  Globally, efforts to reduce child labour have been successful in recent years. The ILO reports that both child labour and hazardous work have decreased since 2000.  Continental efforts  In 1963, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was formed, with Eswatini joining in 1968. Its purpose was to agree upon a list of human rights and enforce them continentally. The group produced the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights in 1981, which included an article on the protection of children. In 2002, the OAU was replaced by the African Union (AU), whose vision is that of \\"an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in global arena.\\"  1980 Employment Act  The government of Eswatini has also made several independent efforts to reduce child labour. In 1980, the Employment Act was passed, mandating that children not be employed for any industrial work, unless the child was a direct family member of the employer, or the work was primarily educational. The Employment Act defines a child as a person under the age of 15. For non-industrial labour, the Act made it illegal to employ children during school hours, for night shifts, for more than 6 hours a day or 33 hours a week, or for more than four hours continuously without an hour-long break. Additionally, the Employment Act outlines restrictions for hiring \\"young persons,\\" defined as those over the age of 15 but under 18. Again, educational value is the main exception to the restrictions, as apprenticeship or vocational training may be approved by the Minister. Both children and young people are prohibited from work that is underground, involves selling alcohol, or is dangerous to their physical or emotional wellbeing. One of the consequences of child labour is that it prevents children from receiving an education  RECLISA Project  In 2004, the RECLISA (Reducing Exploitative Child Labour in Southern Africa) Project was launched in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Eswatini. Targeting both those already involved in exploitative labour and those at risk for it, the project supported 2,000 children in Eswatini. In addition to ensuring that children were enrolled in primary and secondary schools, the project worked to raise public awareness of exploitative child labour. For the first four years, the RECLISA Project was funded by Khulisa Management Services. Since, the Swazi government has taken over funding to continue to support children. In 2014, the Swazi government assisted orphans and other vulnerable children by paying their school fees and made plans to help pay for the final year of primary school for more children. However, because Eswatini does not have a compulsory education age, this was difficult to enforce and was only partially successful.  Ratifications and agreements  Eswatini ratified both the ILO Minimum Age Convention (C138) and the ILO Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (C182) in 2002. It also signed the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child in 1992, but has not yet ratified it.  Types of child labour   Agriculture  Globally, 58.6% of child labourers work in agriculture. In Eswatini, 84% of the country's poor population lives in rural areas, and nearly three-quarters of the total population relies on subsistence farming for survival. As a result, child labour in Eswatini is dominated by agricultural work. Specifically, the country's top three products are sugar cane, maize, and roots and tubers. Wood pulp, citrus and other fruit, cotton, and meat are also important to Eswatini's agricultural sector. Livestock herding, a type of agricultural work, is considered to be one of the most severe forms of child labour.  Industry  Industry jobs are the third most common type of child labour worldwide, at 7.2%. Several international companies such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury have invested in Eswatini, building factories there. Coal and diamond mining have historically been major industries, but their importance has significantly declined since the 1960s. Eswatini also exports textiles, but thousands of textile workers lost their jobs in 2015 when the country was removed from the U.S. fair trade agreement, due to human rights concerns.  Sex work  Commercial sexual exploitation is one of the most severe forms of child labour, with orphans being particularly vulnerable. The majority of children involved in sex work in Eswatini live away from their place of birth. Young girls are trafficked to South Africa, trading sex for food. High rates of prostitution and other forms of sex work spread infectious diseases, perpetuating the issue of HIV in Eswatini.  Tourism  During the second half of the 20th century, Eswatini tourism industry benefited from the lack of war and relative peace within the country. In order to entertain tourists, however, children are sometimes employed and made to wear traditional attire. Along the scenic highway in Piggs Peak, for example, costumed children dance for tourists for a fee.

A 2013 Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) report indicates that particularly in livestock herding, child labour is prevalent in Namibia, and children work from a very young age, although the extent of the work varies per child. Additional hazards that arise from children herding animals are \\"disrupted physical, mental, moral and social development\\", the danger of being bitten, extreme weather conditions, and the infection with animal-borne diseases. Legislative intervention Between 2006 and 2008 the country has been in the process of formulating the Action Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour in Namibia, which was nationally endorsed in February 2008. This was done with the assistance of the International Labour Organization's (ILO) programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour. A Programme Advisory Committee on Child Labour (PACC), representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guides the development and implementation of the programme.

The IJmuiden steelworks based in IJmuiden, the Netherlands was built between 1920 and 1940, first producing iron, later steel, with hot and cold rolling producing flat products. In the 1960s the company diversified into Aluminium production. The company briefly merged its IJmuiden steel plant with German steel company Hoesch from 1972 forming the joint venture Estel but demerged in 1982. In 1999, the company merged with the larger British Steel plc to create the Corus Group steel company. The aluminium production assets were sold off during the Corus period. In 2007, Corus Group was purchased by India-based Tata Steel and was renamed Tata Steel Europe in 2010. History IJmuiden steelworks =1914-1945= In 1914 H.J.E. Wenckebach and J.C Ankersmit began planning construction of a steelworks in the Netherlands, in 1916 Ankersmit departed for the USA, leaving Wenckebach to continue the work,90 Years of Steel .. (2007), para. 1-2 and on 19 April 1917 Wenckebach presented his plans which included the establishment of three blast furnaces, a coking plant, and plants for using the by products of the process (coking gas and slag). In May 1917 a Comit√© voor oprichting van een hoogovenstaal- en walswerk in Nederland (Committee for establishing blast furnaces and steel rolling mill in the Netherlands) was set up, with the aim of creating a steel works and rolling mills.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), para. 1-5 The plan received support from the large industrial concerns and capitalists of the Netherlands, including Stork, Royal Dutch Shell, Steenkolen Handels-Vereeniging (SHV), Philips; Hendrikus Colijn, Frits Fentener van Vlissingen, and J. Muysken. Additionally the Dutch state and the city of Amsterdam contributed 7.5 million and 5 million of the 30 million Dutch guilders required to capitalise the project. On 20 September 1918 the company Koninklijke Nederlandsche Hoogovens en Staalfabrieken N.V. (KNHS) was created in The Hague. Wenckenbach was the Director, Geldolph Adriaan Kessler the secretary, and A.H. Ingen Housz the company's assignee. One of the motivations for the creation of a steelworks was to end the country's reliance on imported steel.90 Years of Steel .. (2007), \\"Background\\" Since the country's resources of coal and iron ore were limited, a site suitable for import and export by sea was chosen, and IJmuiden was chosen over sites at Rotterdam and Moerdijk due to better ground conditions. The site was on the north bank of the North Sea Canal, outside its sea locks, and two harbours were built - the inner harbour opened in 1920, and the outer harbour in 1923.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), KNHS eerste fase , Havens en opslagen 1920 By 1924 the first blast furnace, casting hall, coke plant, and an electricity generating plant powered by waste gases from the coke ovens and blast furnaces were ready, and the second of two blast furnaces, begun in 1919, became operational in 1926. Both blast furnaces were constructed to a design by American company Freyn, Brassert &Co..; The coking plant continued to be expanded throughout the 1920s and 30s, and after World War II.Korte geschiedenis ..

A brickworks (NV Phoenix Maatschappij voor Vervaardiging van Hoogovensteen), was built to use slag from the blast furnace to make building products, but the enterprise ceased in 1927.Korte geschiedenis ..

A second subsidiary was founded in 1930, an on-site cement factory established as a joint venture between KNHS and the Dutch concrete company Eerste Nederlandse Cement Industrie (ENCI): it was named Cementfabriek IJmuiden (CEMIJ) and manufactured cement using granulated furnace slag as an additive.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), Cemij 1930 During the 1930s the plant was further developed, turning from raw iron production to steel production using open hearth furnaces; again Freyr, Brassert & Co. was chosen to supply the plant's design. A pipe foundry was opened in 1936, and in 1938 construction of a steel conversion plant using the Siemens-Martin (Open Hearth) process was begun. The first 60-ton capacity open hearth furnace opened 19 March 1939, additional furnaces were added during the 1940s and early 1950s, and the capacity of the furnaces increased - by 1956 the plant had six furnaces, each of 190-ton capacity.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), Ge√Øntegreerd staalbedrijf , Buizengieterij 1936; Martin Staal Fabriek 1939 - 1972 Construction of the plant's first rolling mill (Walserij West) was begun in the late 1930s. During the World War II occupation the mill was confiscated and shipped to Watenstedt (Salzgitter), Germany where it was installed in the Reichswerke Hermann G√∂ring steel plant. After the war the mill was returned to the Netherlands, and remained in operation until decommissioned in 1992.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), Ge√Øntegreerd staalbedrijf , Walserij West 1947 - 1992 The Van Leer company established a steel rolling mill (Walsbedrijven NV) at the IJmuiden site in the late 1930s; a plate mill began production in 1938, followed by a strip and profile mill in 1939. As built it was outdated, using second hand equipment. The mill was built to supply the Van Leer company's own steel needs, and not as an independent commercial concern. In 1941, under the Nazi occupation during World War II, Van Leer's Jewish owner Bernard van Leer was forced to flee the country, and the mill was acquired by KNHS, and integrated into the rest of the IJmuiden site: it became known as Walserij Oost, remaining in use until 1953,Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), Van Leer's Walsbedrijven NV > Walserij Oost 1938 - 1953 and being replaced by the mills of Breedband NV. During World War II the company was affected by the German occupation: in 1941 Vereinigte Stahlwerke had acquired 40% of the company from the shareholdings of the state and city of Amsterdam. The directors of the company Housz and Holtrop went into hiding in 1943.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Board of directors into Hiding\\" The mouth of the North Sea canal at IJmuiden was used as a base for the Kriegsmarine, and the steelworks itself was a strategic target for attack, and bombings and lack of raw materials brought production to a halt.History Steel Company (2007), \\"War, company is closed down\\" 13 December 1943 =1945-1999= thumb After the end of World War II reconstruction of the Netherlands began, and as part of this process investments were made in the steelworks. A separate company, Breedband NV, was established on 19 June 1950, receiving funding from both the state and the United States, under the Marshall Plan. The project introduced hot and cold rolling mills for thin plate, of 60 and 75 thousand tonnes per year capacity respectively, and a galvanising line. All three installations were operating by the end of 1953. During the same period architect Willem Marinus Dudok was commissioned to design a head office for the company in Velsen, which was completed 1953. The Breedband project moved Hoogoven's emphasis into flat rather than long products, which continued in later decades. During the 1950s and 1960 the facilities were extended; the plants first oxy-steel converted was put into operation in 1958,History Steel Company, (Corus), \\"Oxy steel factory 1 officially opened, 22 Feb 1958\\" a second cold rolling line was added in 1961, electrolytic galvanising machines were added in 1958, 1962, and 1967, and hot rolling capacity had increased to 1.6 million tonnes per year by 1965. On 4 May 1965 KNHS took over the company Breedband NV.Korte geschiedenis .. (SIEHO), Breedband NV 1950 - 1965 Also in the post-war period an automated casting machine was installed in 1948, two new blast furnaces activated in 1958 and 1961, and a mill for steel rod and wire production was commissioned in 1964.Korte geschiedenis CORUS IJmuiden , (SIEHO), De ruwijzergietmachine; Hoogoven 4 1958; Hoogoven 5 1961; Staaf en Draad Walserij 1964 - 2000] The sixth blast furnace began operation in 1967, and a second oxy-steel plant in 1968. In 1969 a block mill capable of handling 45-tonne blocks, and another hot strip mill with a capacity of over 3.5 million tonnes a year were opened.History Steel Company, (Corus), \\"Blast Furnace 6 officially lit, 28 November 1967\\"; \\"Oxy steel factory 2 put into use, 5 Oct 1968\\"; \\"\\"Block Mill 3 and Hot Strip Mill 2\\" Labour relations at the plant were usually good; during the first two decades of the enterprise's existence the organisational structure was relatively simple, with limited hierarchies, and there were limited attempts at a benevolent social policy by the plant's management. Psychological testing of potential workers was gradually introduced, first for skilled workers, and after World War II for unskilled workers. Vocational training was slowly introduced after 1938. In the post-war period foreign workers from Italy, Spain, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Morocco began to be employed at the plant, and in the 1960s the practice of housing foreign workers in floating hotels was begun.History Steel Company (2007), \\"The Arosa Sun in IJmuiden, 27 February 1960\\" Post-war there was no major industrial action until 1973, when 2,300 workers went on strike at the IJmuiden plant. During the Steel crisis there were no strikes, despite significant lay-offs. In 1972 the first two blast furnaces were decommissioned. In the same year (1972) the IJmuiden steelworks (Hoogovens IJmuiden BV.KNHS formed its interests that were to be merged (the IJmuiden steelworks) into a company Hoogovens IJmuiden BV, source: History Steel Company (2007), \\"Estel is founded, 7 July 1972\\") were formed into a 50:50 joint venture named Estel with Hoesch of Germany as the other partner, which merged its Dortmund steel plant into the concern. IJmuiden, with good access to seaborn raw materials, was to act primarily as a raw steel supplier to the plant in Germany, which was closer to a large market for finished steel products. The steel crisis of the 1970s prevented any positive expansion and the company was disbanded in 1982 when funding arrangements for the loss-making Dortmund plant could not be agreed.See sources in article Estel After the demerger from Hoesch the company required restructuring and investment: the company was producing too much raw steel with not enough semi-finished product manufacturing capacity. This led to the installation of a continuous casting, hot rolling, and steel coating lines of the next decade. The Dutch state supported the process with a loan of 570 million guilders. The workforce was reduced by 3,000 (14%) over 4 years from 1982, with the company becoming profitable again in 1984. The subsidiary Demka was also closed. The company's first continuous caster was put into operation in May 1980.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Continuous Casting Installation, 9 May 1980\\" In 1990 a production line for producing paint coated steel rolls was started.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Paint line put into operation, 16 March 1990\\" The third blast furnace was decommissioned in 1991.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Blast Furnace 3 demolished, 18 October 1991\\" In the late 1990s two blast furnaces were purchased by the Indonesian steel group Gunawan Steel Group and dismantled and shipped to its development in Malaysia, Gunawan Iron and Steel. The dismantling work was carried out by a Chinese contractor which was found to be paying its 120 Chinese workers less than the Dutch minimum wage, with poor safety conditions, with 14 accidents resulting in 2 fatalities due to falls from height. The Chinese contractor was fined for breaches of safety practice, and made to improve working conditions, as well as retrospectively paying its workers 15,000 guilders.Sources:  In 1996 the company changed its official name to Koninklijke Hoogovens.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Name is changed, 1 January 1996\\" A new continuous caster was installed between 1998 and 2000.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Casting mill installation opened, 17 April 2000\\" In 1998 a joint subsidiary with Sidmar, named Galtec, was established at Sidmar's plant near Ghent, producing galvanised steel. In 1998 Hoogovens employed around 23,000 people, and produced approximately 8 million tonnes of steel (and 450,000 tonnes of aluminium) per year, with sales of over $10 billion. The company's main products were rolled steel, including tinplate (thin gauge steel), coated steels, and aluminium extrusions. Production was distributed 20% in the Dutch market, 60% in the rest of Europe and 20% to the rest of the world. =Corus group 1999-2007= In June 1999 British Steel plc and Hoogovens announced that they were to merge, with Hoogovens forming 38.3% of the new group; the new company provisionally entitled 'BSKH' was then the third largest in the world, with sales of ¬£9.4 billion. The name \\"Corus\\" for the new entity was announced in September 1999, The merger was approved by the European Commission in July, and on 6 October 1999 the two companies were merged.History of Koninklijke Hoogovens, (Corus), The 1990s The merger has been characterised as a takeover by British Steel; BS, which exported a third of its output to Europe, was vulnerable to a strong pound, and the merger with Hoogovens could insulate it to some extent from such currency fluctuations, In 2000 a hot dip galvanising line Galtec 2, with a capacity of 400,000 tonnes per year of zinc coated coil began operation; it was the second to be produced as part of a joint venture with Sidmar. A joint venture (42.5%) Galstar LP with Weirton Steel for another galvanising line built in the late 1990s in Jeffersonville, Indiana, USA entered bankruptcy in 2001 having been closed due to poor demand after only 4 months in production.Sources: * * Plans for the construction of an (‚Ç¨223 million) additional hot dip galvanising line and cold rolling mill were made in 2005, for an expected completion in 2008.Sources: * * =Tata Steel 2007-present= In 2007 Tata Steel acquired Corus and subsequently renamed it Tata Steel Europe in 2010. In 2008 due to lack of demand the Corus steel group cut production by 20%; in IJmuiden one blast furnace was taken out of production. In the period after the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 (see Great Recession) the down turn led to significant job losses - 800 persons in 2009, and up to 2014 a further 1000 jobs. In the 2014/2015 financial year the IJmuiden site made a profit of c. ‚Ç¨340million, resulting a 9.19% bonus to the workforce, then numbering c. 8000 to 9000 persons. Aluminium production In 1964 a joint venture with Hoogovens as major (50%) partner established an aluminium company Aldel in the north east of the Netherlands; the enterprised was backed by the state which guaranteed a long term supply of energy a low price: a large natural gas discovery had been made in the region. Mining company Billiton was the other partner in the venture, along with technical support from Alusuisse. In 1970 the company acquired a shareholding in Sidal (Belgium), and in 1987 Kaiser Aluminium's European business was acquired; the acquisition made KNHS a major aluminium producer: by 1996 it had an aluminium smelting capacity of well over 10 million tonnes per annum.History of Koninklijke Hoogovens, (Corus), \\"The 1970's\\"; \\"The 1980's\\" =Corus period= Divisions in the board of Corus arose in 2002 when the company announced it was to sell its profitable aluminium business to Pechiney for over ¬£500 million; Corus's British division was making a loss at this time and the sale was seen by Dutch interests as being used to prop up the loss-making British interests with no backward investment in the European mainland side of the business. The board of Corus Netherlands vetoed the sale. In 2006 Corus's aluminium rolling and extrusion facilities were sold to Aleris.Sources: * * * In 2009 smelters in Delfzijl (Netherlands) and Voerde (Germany) were sold to Briand Investments B.V., an associate of Klesch, a large commodity trader. This ended the businesses' association with aluminium, leaving it primarily as a steel producer. Subsidiaries and joint ventures Demka, an earlier Dutch steel producer became a KNHS subsidiary in 1964, the company was shut down in 1984. Mekog and CEMIJ were established at the IJmuiden site in 1928 and 1930, manufacturing fertiliser, and cement respectively, using steel production by products. CEMIJ was sold off in 1989. A shareholding in coal tar distillation plant Cindu (Chemische Industrie Uithoorn), then named Teerbedrijf Uithoorn, was acquired in 1927; the plant used tar produced as a by-product of coke production. In 2010 Cindu Chemicals BV was sold to Koppers Holding Inc. (Koppers). The welded tubes factory in Zwijndrecht was acquired at the end of 1995 from Van Leeuwen Buizen (see also Van Leeuwen Pipe and Tube Group). In 2011 a ‚Ç¨3million investment was made into the factory improving facilities for manufacturing tube steel for car chassis construction. In 1983 the company, Sidmar and Phenix Works reached agreement on a joint venture SEGAL (Soci√©t√© Europ√©enne de Galvanisation) at Ivoz-Ramet, Liege, Belgium which would produce hot dip galvanized steel for the car industry.History Steel Company (2007), \\"Foundation of Segal, 3 November 1983\\" The shares of the company were wholly owned by Corus by 2004. Metal plating company Hille and Muller became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1997, after acquiring a 50% share acquired in 1988. A 50% share in Belgian steelmaker Usine Gustave Bo√´l (UGB) in La Louvi√®re was acquired in 1997 (as a joint venture HB Holding,), with option to buy the remaining shares. The UGB subsidiary Fabrique de Fer de Maubeuge (FFM) was also acquired, and renamed 'Myriad'. Governmental financing for rescue investment in UGB La Louvi√®re could not be agreed and the plant was sold to Duferco in 1999.

Diatonic scale in the chromatic circle with each interval vector a different color, each occurs a unique number of times C major scale with interval classes labelled; vector: 254361 Whole tone scale on C with interval classes labelled; vector: 060603 In musical set theory, an interval vector is an array of natural numbers which summarize the intervals present in a set of pitch classes. (That is, a set of pitches where octaves are disregarded.) Other names include: ic vector (or interval-class vector), PIC vector (or pitch-class interval vector) and APIC vector (or absolute pitch-class interval vector, which Michiel Schuijer states is more proper.) While primarily an analytic tool, interval vectors can also be useful for composers, as they quickly show the sound qualities that are created by different collections of pitch class. That is, sets with high concentrations of conventionally dissonant intervals (i.e., seconds and sevenths) sound more dissonant, while sets with higher numbers of conventionally consonant intervals (i.e., thirds and sixths) sound more consonant. While the actual perception of consonance and dissonance involves many contextual factors, such as register, an interval vector can nevertheless be a helpful tool. Definition In twelve-tone equal temperament, an interval vector has six digits, with each digit representing the number of times an interval class appears in the set. Because interval classes are used, the interval vector for a given set remains the same, regardless of the set's permutation or vertical arrangement. The interval classes designated by each digit ascend from left to right. That is: # minor seconds/major sevenths (1 or 11 semitones) # major seconds/minor sevenths (2 or 10 semitones) # minor thirds/major sixths (3 or 9 semitones) # major thirds/minor sixths (4 or 8 semitones) # perfect fourths/perfect fifths (5 or 7 semitones) # tritones (6 semitones) (The tritone is inversionally equivalent to itself.) Interval class 0, representing unisons and octaves, is omitted. In his 1960 book, The Harmonic Materials of Modern Music, Howard Hanson introduced a monomial method of notation for this concept, which he termed intervallic content: pemdnc.sbdatf To quantify the consonant-dissonant content of a set, Hanson ordered the intervals according to their dissonance degree, with p=perfect fifth, m=major third, n=minor third, s=major second, d=(more dissonant) minor second, t=tritone for what would now be written . The modern notation, introduced by Allen Forte, has considerable advantages and is extendable to any equal division of the octave. A scale whose interval vector has six unique digits is said to have the deep scale property. The major scale and its modes have this property. For a practical example, the interval vector for a C major triad (3-11B) in the root position, {C E G} (), is . This means that the set has one major third or minor sixth (i.e. from C to E, or E to C), one minor third or major sixth (i.e. from E to G, or G to E), and one perfect fifth or perfect fourth (i.e. from C to G, or G to C). As the interval vector does not change with transposition or inversion, it belongs to the entire set class, meaning that is the vector of all major (and minor) triads. Some interval vectors correspond to more than one sets that cannot be transposed or inverted to produce the other. (These are called Z-related sets, explained below). For a set of n pitch classes, the sum of all the numbers in the set's interval vector equals the triangular number Tn‚àí1 = . An expanded form of the interval vector is also used in transformation theory, as set out in David Lewin's Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations. Z-relation Successive Z-related hexachords from act 3 of WozzeckForte, Allen (1977). The Structure of Atonal Music (New Haven and London: Yale University Press), p. 79\\\\. . . In musical set theory, a Z-relation, also called isomeric relation, is a relation between two pitch class sets in which the two sets have the same intervallic content (and thus the same interval vector) but they are not transpositionally related (are of different Tn-type ) or inversionally related (are of different Tn/TnI-type). For example, the two sets 4-z15A {0,1,4,6} and 4-z29A {0,1,3,7} have the same interval vector but one can not transpose and/or invert the one set onto the other. In the case of hexachords each may be referred to as a Z-hexachord. Any hexachord not of the \\"Z\\" type is its own complement while the complement of a Z-hexachord is its Z-correspondent, for example 6-Z3 and 6-Z36. See: 6-Z44, 6-Z17, 6-Z11, and Forte number. The term, for \\"zygotic\\" (yoked or the fusion of two reproductive cells), originated with Allen Forte in 1964, but the notion seems to have first been considered by Howard Hanson. Hanson called this the isomeric relationship, and defined two such sets as isomeric.Hanson, Howard (1960). Harmonic Materials of Modern Music (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts), p. 22\\\\. . See: isomer. According to Michiel Schuijer (2008), the hexachord theorem, that any two pitch-class complementary hexachords have the same interval vector, even if they are not equivalent under transposition and inversion, was first proposed by Milton Babbitt, and, \\"the discovery of the relation,\\" was, \\"reported,\\" by David Lewin in 1960 as an example of the complement theorem: that the difference between pitch-class intervals in two complementary pitch-class sets is equal to the difference between the cardinal number of the sets (given two hexachords, this difference is 0).Lewin, David. \\"The Intervallic Content of a Collection of Notes, Intervallic Relations between a Collection of Notes and its Complement: an Application to Schoenberg‚Äôs Hexachordal Pieces\\", Journal of Music Theory 4/1 (1960): 98‚Äì101. Mathematical proofs of the hexachord theorem were published by Kassler (1961), Regener (1974), and Wilcox (1983). Though it is commonly observed that Z-related sets always occur in pairs, David Lewin noted that this is a result of twelve-tone equal temperament (12-ET). In 16-ET, Z-related sets are found as triplets. Lewin's student Jonathan Wild continued this work for other tuning systems, finding Z-related tuplets with up to 16 members in higher ET systems. Straus argues, \\"[sets] in the Z-relation will sound similar because they have the same interval content,\\"Straus, Joseph Nathan (1990). Introduction to Post-Tonal Theory, p.67. 1st ed. Prentice Hall: Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. . Cited in Schuijer (2008), p.125. which has led certain composers to exploit the Z-relation in their work. For instance, the play between {0,1,4,6} and {0,1,3,7} is clear in Elliott Carter's Second String Quartet. Multiplication Some Z-related chords are connected by M or IM (multiplication by 5 or multiplication by 7), due to identical entries for 1 and 5 on the interval vector.

He is known for publishing Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather while editor in chief of G. P. Putnam's Sons. Life and career Targ was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Russian Jewish immigrants, Esther (Silverman) and Meyer Torgownik.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:NQRJ-SF2 His name was originally William Torgownik. A high-school dropout with a passion for books and letterpress printing, Targ took a job as an office boy at Macmillan Publishers when he was 18. He opened his own bookstore at 22 in North Clark Street, Chicago.Distant Healing and Elisabeth Targ, Martin Gardner, Notes of a Fringe Watcher, Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2001, retrieved 1 September 2009 From 1942 to 1964 Targ worked as an editor for the World Publishing Company, eventually becoming editor-in-chief. He then moved to G.P. Putnam's Sons where, in 1968, he bought Puzo's novel for a $5000 advance. According to the New York Times, \\"'The Godfather' turned out to be the most profitable single novel ever published by Putnam's and the paperback rights were sold for more than $400,000.\\" Outside of the commercial realm, Targ was committed to the art of bookmanship and the ideals of the private press. After retiring from Putnam in 1978, he founded Targ Editions, a one-man operation he ran from his home in Greenwich Village. Targ sought to publish works by contemporary writers that had not been previously produced in book form. The twenty-five Targ Editions include works by Henry Roth, John Updike, Saul Bellow, Tennessee Williams, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and Norman Mailer--each book a unique volume. As Targ wrote for his Targ Editions checklist: \\"Each of these books is individually designed (no two formats are alike) and they are produced by letter press and are hand-bound. The various printing papers are of high quality, and enduring--mainly of rag, and deckle-edged. The bindings are of pictorial or decorated boards, and or cloth over boards. Each book is signed by its author. The editions are limited to between 150 and 350 copies each.\\" Copies of most of the Targ Editions volumes are housed in the Fales Library and Special Collections at New York University's (NYU) Bobst Library. In his own Targ Editions volume, Abacus Now, William Targ wrote: \\"Print can be as beautiful as music; it has the power to move, it is as volatile as stage magic. As a typophile and bookman, now on my own, I look more closely into the genius and works of the men and women who enriched our lives with beautiful books. I observe closely the contemporary typographic scene, the people engaged with the magical 26 letters by which we live... I don't think the private press printer will save the world; but I think that if we are seeking the pure of heart and a wholesome commitment, such a person may be found more readily beside a hand press than, say, in an advertising agency or in the House of Representatives--or in City Hall.\\" William Targ died on July 22, 1999, at the age of 92, in his Manhattan home. He was survived by his wife, Roslyn, of Manhattan, a literary agent; a son, Russell, of Palo Alto, California; two grandchildren, one of whom is Elisabeth Targ, and four great- grandchildren.

Brumbach Industrial electricity 7th ed. , Cengage Learning, 2004 , pp. 45-46 Wiggy is the registered trademark for a common solenoid voltmeter used in North America derived from a device patented in 1918 by George P. Wigginton.David E. Shapiro \\"Your Old Wiring\\", McGraw-Hill Professional, 2001 page 22 Operation Rather than using a D'Arsonval movement or digital electronics, the solenoid voltmeter simply uses a spring- loaded solenoid carrying a pointer (it might also be described as a form of moving iron meter). Greater voltage creates more magnetism pulling the solenoid's core in further against the spring loading, moving the pointer. A short scale converts the pointer's movement into the voltage reading.Kenneth G. Mastrullo, Ray A. Jones The Electrical Safety Program Book, Jones & Bartlett Learning, 2003 page 70 Solenoid voltmeters usually have a scale on each side of the pointer; one is calibrated for alternating current and one is calibrated for direct current. Only one \\"range\\" is provided and it usually extends from zero to about 600 volts. A small permanent magnet rotor is usually mounted at the top of the meter. For DC, this magnet flips one way or the other, indicating by the exposed color (red or black) which lead is connected to positive. For AC, the rotor simply vibrates, indicating that the meter is connected to an AC circuit. Another form of tester uses a miniature neon lamp; the negative electrode glows, indicating polarity on DC circuits, or both electrodes glow, indicating AC. Models made by some manufacturers include continuity test lights, which are energized by a battery within the tester. This is particularly advantageous when testing, for example, fuses in live circuits, since no switching is required to change from continuity mode to voltage detecting mode. Advantages Solenoid voltmeters are extremely rugged and not very susceptible to damage through either rough handling or electrical overload. For \\"go/no go\\" testing, there is no need to read the scale as application of AC power creates a perceivable vibration and sound within the meter. This feature makes the tester very handy in noisy, poorly illuminated, or very bright surroundings. The meter can be felt, the more it jumps the higher the voltage. Solenoid voltmeters draw appreciable current in operation. This makes them useful for testing residual-current devices (GFCIs) because the current drawn trips most RCDs when the solenoid voltmeter is connected between the live and earth conductors. Also, when testing power supply circuits, a high-impedance connection (that is, a nearly open-circuit fault such as a burned switch contact or wire joint) in the power path might still allow enough voltage/current through to register on a high-impedance digital voltmeter, but it probably can't actuate the solenoid voltmeter. For use with high impedance circuit applications, however, they are not so good, as they draw appreciable current and therefore alter the voltage being measured. Some manufacturers include a continuity test lamp function in a solenoid meter; these use the same probes as the voltage test function. This feature is useful when testing the status of contacts in energized circuits. The continuity light displays if the contact is closed, and the solenoid voltmeter shows voltage presence if open (and energized). Disadvantages In contrast to multimeters, solenoid voltmeters have no other built-in functions (such as the ability to act as an ammeter, ohmmeter, or capacitance meter); they are just simple, easy-to-use power voltmeters. Solenoid voltmeters are useless on low-voltage circuits (for example, 12 volt circuits). The basic range of the voltmeter starts at around 90V (AC or DC). Solenoid voltmeters are not precise. For example, there would be no reliably perceptible difference in the reading between 220 VAC and 240 VAC. They are meant for intermittent operation. They draw a moderate amount of power from the circuit under test and can overheat if used continuous monitoring. The low impedance and low sensitivity of the tester may not show high-impedance connections to a voltage source, which can still source enough current to cause a shock hazard.

He was the last Spanish ruler of New Spain. Biography O'Donoj√∫ was born in Seville of Irish descent (O'Donoghue) He joined the army at a young age and served with distinction in the Peninsular War, also known as the \\"Spanish War of Independence\\". O'Donoju was the Chief of Staff to General Gregorio Garc√≠a de la Cuesta during the Battle of Talavera (27 and 28 July 1809). On 11 July 1809, O'Donoj√∫ served as an interpreter between Cuesta and the British commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Wellesley (later created, in May 1814, The 1st Duke of Wellington), as the two met to make their campaign plans. The meeting was somewhat strained as Cuesta answered many of Wellesley's questions with a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" which O'Donoj√∫ tactfully explained. In 1814, O'Donoju was named Minister of War by the Regency. With the return of Ferdinand VII, he became aide de camp to the king. O'Donoju was a friend of the liberal rebel Rafael del Riego. In 1820, at the time of the re-establishment of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, O'Donoju was the captain general of Andalusia. O'Donoju reached the rank of lieutenant general and was a high officer in the Spanish Freemasons. In 1821, the Cortes Generales appointed him captain general and \\"jefe pol√≠tico superior\\", which gave him the authority (but not the official title) of the former viceroys. At the time O'Donoj√∫ left for New Spain, the Cortes was considering to greatly expand the autonomy granted to the overseas Spanish possessions according to the restored constitution. O'Donoju was sworn into his new offices upon his arrival in Veracruz on 21 July 1821. He found that the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco supported the Plan de Iguala and the rebel general, Agust√≠n de Iturbide. On 3 August 1821, in Veracruz, O'Donoju issued a proclamation of his liberal principles to the people of Mexico. He wrote to Iturbide, inviting him to a conference in a location of his choosing. Iturbide chose the city of C√≥rdoba as the meeting place. O'Donoj√∫, accompanied by Colonel Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, arrived there on 23 August, and the following day the meeting occurred. The men reached an agreement and signed an accord, the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, based on the Plan de Iguala. The only part of the Plan de Iguala that was amended was Article 4, concerning the functions of the governmental junta. The new Article 4 also provided that if no member of the Bourbon family accepted the crown of New Spain (a likely possibility), the Mexican Cortes would freely elect their monarch. Under the circumstances, that effectively granted the crown to Iturbide. The military leaders of the Spanish in the colony did not accept independence. Spanish troops occupied the plazas of Mexico City and Veracruz, the fort of San Carlos de Perote, and the castle of San Diego in Acapulco. They were blockaded and all but Veracruz was surrendered. Francisco Novella was besieged in Mexico City by the Army of the Three Guarantees (the unified pro-independence army formed by the Plan de Iguala), led by Vicente Guerrero and Nicol√°s Bravo. Novella agreed to a suspension of hostilities. Colonel Santa Anna besieged Brigadier Garc√≠a D√°vila in San Juan de Ul√∫a, Veracruz, but the latter was able to hold out for four more years. O'Donoj√∫ used his influence to withdraw Spanish troops from the country with a minimum of bloodshed through reasonable surrender terms. He then approved the promotion of Novella, the previous acting viceroy, to field marshal. On 13 September 1821, O'Donoj√∫ met with Novella and Iturbide at the Hacienda de la Patera, near the Villa de Guadalupe, smoothing over the difficulties and arranging the details of the transfer of power. Novella ordered Spanish troops to leave Mexico City. The insurgents entered the capital on 24 September 1821, two days after the Spanish troops left Mexico City. On 27 September 1821, O'Donoj√∫ and, on 28 September 1821, Iturbide decreed the independence of the Mexican Empire from Spain. Together with thirty-three others, O'Donoj√∫ was a member of the Provisional Governing Junta, headed by Iturbide. O'Donoju signed the Act of Independence on 28 September 1821. On 3 October 1821, the Captaincy General of Guatemala (formed of Chiapas, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras) proclaimed its independence from Spain and its incorporation into the Mexican Empire. The region had been formally subject to New Spain throughout the colonial period, but as a practical matter, it was administered separately. All but Chiapas soon separated from Mexico. O'Donoj√∫ died of pleurisy in Mexico City on 8 October 1821; some historians suspect that he was poisoned by Iturbide. The suspicion is based on the declarations of Carlos Mar√≠a Bustamante, a parliamentarian and writer. O'Donoju's remains were interred with the honors of a viceroy in the vault of the Altar of Kings in the Cathedral of Mexico.

A favourite at poultry shows, it is a dual-purpose fowl known both for its extremely dark eggs and fine meat qualities.  History  The Marans originated in Marans, France, and were imported into the United Kingdom in the 1930s.  Characteristics  Ten colours are recognised in the French breed standard for large fowl: white, wheaten, silver cuckoo, golden cuckoo, black, copper-black, silver-black, copper-blue, black-tailed buff and Columbian. Bantam colours are black, white, copper-black and silver cuckoo. Fourteen colours are listed by the Entente Europ√©enne. In th United Kingdom only five are recognised ‚Äì black, copper-black, dark cuckoo, golden cuckoo and silver cuckoo. They should have orange eyes. The shanks are usually slate or pink, the soles of the feet should always be white as Marans have white skin, not yellow. Though the original Marans could also be feather- legged birds, British breeders preferred the clean-legged version, and thus feather-legged Marans are now mainly found in France and the United States. The Australian Poultry Standard recognises both feather- and clean-legged.2nd Australian Poultry Standard, 2012, published by the Victorian Poultry Breeder Association (trading as Poultry Stud Breeders and Exhibitors Victoria) The American Poultry Association only recognises feather-legged.  Use  Marans eggs Marans hens lay around 150‚Äì200 dark brown eggs each year depending on the variety. Marans are historically a dual-purpose bird, prized not only for their dark eggs but for their table qualities as well.

Microsoft was founded on April 4, 1975, by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its current best-selling products are the Microsoft Windows operating system; Microsoft Office, a suite of productivity software; Xbox, a line of entertainment of games, music, and video; Bing, a line of search engines; and Microsoft Azure, a cloud services platform. In 1980, Microsoft formed a partnership with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers; with that deal, IBM paid Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested Microsoft to develop a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft produced that operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers. As of June 30, 2015, Microsoft has a global annual revenue of US$86.83 Billion and 128,076 employees worldwide. It develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of software products for computing devices.  1975‚Äì1985: The founding of Microsoft  Steve Wood, Bob Wallace, Jim Lane Middle: Bob O'Rear, Bob Greenberg, Marc McDonald, Gordon Letwin Bottom: Bill Gates, Andrea Lewis, Marla Wood, Paul Allen Not pictured: Ric Weiland, Miriam Lubow Gates described this photo in 2009 as \\"that famous picture that provides indisputable proof that your average computer geek from the late 1970s was not exactly on the cutting edge of fashion.\\" Altair 8800 computer with the popular Model 33 ASR Teletype as terminal, paper tape reader, and paper tape punch. In late 1974, Paul Allen, a programmer at Honeywell, was walking through Harvard Square when he saw the cover of the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics that demonstrated the Altair 8800, the first microcomputer. Allen bought the magazine and rushed to Currier House at Harvard College, where he showed it to high school friend Bill Gates. They saw potential to develop an implementation of BASIC for the system. (DOC format) Gates called Altair manufacturer Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), offering to demonstrate the implementation. Allen and Gates had neither an interpreter nor an Altair system, yet in the eight weeks before the demo, they developed an interpreter with the help of Monte Davidoff. When Allen flew to Albuquerque to meet with MITS, the interpreter worked and MITS agreed to distribute Altair BASIC. Allen moved to Albuquerque, Gates soon quit Harvard to join him, and they co-founded Microsoft there. Revenues of the company totalled $16,005 by the end of 1976. Allen came up with the original name of Micro-Soft, a portmanteau of microcomputer and software. Hyphenated in its early incarnations, on November 26, 1976, the company was registered under that name with the Secretary of State of New Mexico. The company's first international office was founded on November 1, 1978, in Japan, entitled \\"ASCII Microsoft\\" (now called \\"Microsoft Japan\\"), and on November 29, 1979, the term, \\"Microsoft\\" was first used by Bill Gates. On January 1, 1979, the company moved from Albuquerque to a new home in Bellevue, Washington, since it was hard to recruit top programmers to Albuquerque. Shortly before the move, eleven of the then-thirteen employees posed for the staff photo on the right. Steve Ballmer joined the company on June 11, 1980, and would later succeed Bill Gates as CEO from January 2000 until February 2014. The company restructured on June 25, 1981, to become an incorporated business in its home state of Washington (with a further change of its name to \\"Microsoft Corporation, Inc.\\"). As part of the restructuring, Bill Gates became president of the company and chairman of the board, and Paul Allen became executive vice president. In 1983, Allen left the company after receiving a Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, though he remained on the board as vice-chairman. Microsoft's early products were different variants of Microsoft BASIC which was the dominant programming language in late 1970s and early 1980s home computers such as Apple II (Applesoft BASIC) and Commodore 64 (Commodore BASIC), and were also provided with early versions of the IBM PC as the IBM Cassette BASIC. Microsoft also marketed through an Apple dealer in West Palm Beach, Florida two products for the Radio-Shack TRS-80. One was \\"Typing Tutor\\" which led the user through learning to use a keyboard. The other was authored by a professor at the University of Hawaii called \\"MuMATH\\" and had the ability to do mathematics in long integer math to avoid floating point numbers. The first hardware product was the Z-80 SoftCard which enabled the Apple II to run the CP/M operating system, at the time an industry-standard operating system for running business software and many compilers and interpreters for several high-level languages on microcomputers. The SoftCard was first demonstrated publicly at the West Coast Computer Faire in March 1980. It was an immediate success; 5,000 cards, a large number given the microcomputer market at the time, were purchased in the initial three months at $349 each and it was Microsoft's number one revenue source in 1980. The first operating system publicly released by the company was a variant of Unix announced on August 25, 1980. Acquired from AT&T; through a distribution license, Microsoft dubbed it Xenix, and hired Santa Cruz Operation in order to port/adapt the operating system to several platforms. This Unix variant would become home to the first version of Microsoft's word processor, Microsoft Word. Originally titled \\"Multi-Tool Word\\", Microsoft Word became notable for its use of \\"What You See Is What You Get\\", or WYSIWYG pioneered by the Xerox Alto and the Bravo text editor in the 1970s. Word was first released in the spring of 1983, and free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of PC World, making it one of the first programs to be distributed on- disk with a magazine. (Earlier magazine on-disk distributions included Robert Uiterwyk's BASIC in the May 1977 issue of Information Age.) However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had gotten out of the Unix business, except for its ownership stake in SCO. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide a version of the CP/M operating system, which was set to be used in the IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. The original CP/M was made by Gary Kildall of Digital Research, Inc. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. Thirty-five of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer. The IBM PC DOS is also known as MS-DOS. InfoWorld stated in 1984 that Microsoft, with $55 million in 1983 sales, In 1983, in collaboration with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained its own version of the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to have control of its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry.Multiple: * * * With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu. 1985‚Äì1994: Windows and Office Redmond campus today includes about and 28,000 employees. Ireland became home to one of Microsoft's international production facilities in 1985, and on November 20 Microsoft released its first retail version of Microsoft Windows (Windows 1.0), originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system. In August, Microsoft and IBM partnered in the development of a different operating system called OS/2. OS/2 was marketed in connection with a new hardware design proprietary to IBM, the PS/2. On February 16, 1986, Microsoft relocated their headquarters to a corporate office campus in Redmond, Washington. Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of the trading day, the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to OEMs. By then the company was the world's largest producer of software for personal computers‚Äîahead of former leader Lotus Development‚Äîand published the three most-popular Macintosh business applications. That year the company purchased Forethought, the developer of PowerPoint and Microsoft's first major software acquisition on the 30th July 1987. Meanwhile, Microsoft began introducing its most prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically found in a word processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as an application for the Apple Macintosh towards the end of 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase. On May 22, 1990, Microsoft launched Windows 3.0. The new version of Microsoft's operating system boasted new features such as streamlined graphic user interface GUI and improved protected mode ability for the Intel 386 processor; it sold over 100,000 copies in two weeks. Windows at the time generated more revenue for Microsoft than OS/2, and the company decided to move more resources from OS/2 to Windows. In an internal memo to Microsoft employees on May 16, 1991, Bill Gates announced that the OS/2 partnership was over, and that Microsoft would henceforth focus its platform efforts on Windows and the Windows NT kernel. Some people, especially developers who had ignored Windows and committed most of their resources to OS/2, were taken by surprise, and accused Microsoft of deception. This changeover from OS/2 was frequently referred to in the industry as \\"the head- fake\\". This article can also be purchased out of the archives at the National Review's website In the recent years, the popularity of OS/2 declined, and Windows quickly became the favored PC platform. 1991 also marked the founding of Microsoft Research, an organization in Microsoft for researching computer science subjects, and Microsoft Visual Basic, a popular development product for companies and individuals. Konrad-Zuse-Str. 1, Unterschlei√üheim, Germany. Microsoft became an international company with headquarters in many countries. During the transition from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged that Microsoft used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released the first version of their popular database software Microsoft Access. The Microsoft sign at the entrance of the Dubai Microsoft campus, Dubai Internet City. Microsoft has developed Arabic versions for most of its products. By 1993, Windows had become the most widely used GUI operating system in the world. Fortune Magazine named Microsoft as the \\"1993 Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S.\\" The year also marked the end of a five-year copyright infringement legal case brought by Apple Computer, dubbed Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., in which the ruling was in Microsoft's favor. Microsoft also released Windows for Workgroups 3.11, a new version of the consumer line of Windows, and Windows NT 3.1, a server-based operating system with a similar user interface to consumer versions of the operating system, but with an entirely different kernel. As part of its strategy to broaden its business, Microsoft released Microsoft Encarta on March 22, 1993, the first encyclopedia designed to run on a computer. Soon after, the Microsoft Home brand was introduced ‚Äì encompassing Microsoft's new multimedia applications for Windows 3.x., Microsoft changed its slogan to \\"Where do you want to go today?\\" in 1994 as part of an attempt to appeal to nontechnical audiences in a US$100 million advertising campaign. 1995‚Äì2007: Foray into the Web, Windows 95, Windows XP, and Xbox Microsoft continued to make strategic decisions directed at consumers. The company released Microsoft Bob, a graphical user interface designed for novice computer users, in March 1995. The interface was discontinued in 1996 due to poor sales; Bill Gates later attributed its failure to hardware requirements that were too high for typical computers, and is widely regarded as one of Microsoft's most unsuccessful products.Multiple:  * DreamWorks SKG and Microsoft formed a new company, DreamWorks Interactive (in 2000 acquired by Electronic Arts which named it EA Los Angeles), to produce interactive and multimedia entertainment properties. On August 24, 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, a new version of the company's flagship operating system which featured a completely new user interface, including a novel start button; more than a million copies were sold in the first four days after its release. Windows 95 was released without a web browser as Microsoft had not yet developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their browser as Internet Explorer. Spyglass went on to later dispute the terms of the agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system. Internet Explorer was first included in the Windows 95 Plus! Pack that was released in August 1995. In September, the Chinese government chose Windows to be the operating system of choice in that country, and entered into an agreement with the company to standardize a Chinese version of the operating system. Microsoft also released the Microsoft Sidewinder 3D Pro joystick in an attempt to further expand its profile in the computer hardware market. On May 26, 1995, Bill Gates sent the \\"Internet Tidal Wave\\" memorandum to Microsoft executives. The memo described Netscape with their Netscape Navigator as a \\"new competitor 'born' on the Internet\\". The memo outlines Microsoft's failure to grasp the Internet's importance, and in it Gates assigned \\"the Internet the highest level of importance\\" from then on. Microsoft began to expand its product line into computer networking and the World Wide Web. On August 24, 1995, it launched a major online service, MSN (Microsoft Network), as a direct competitor to AOL. MSN became an umbrella service for Microsoft's online services, using Microsoft Passport (now called a Microsoft account) as a universal login system for all of its web sites. The company continued to branch out into new markets in 1996, starting with a joint venture with NBC to create a new 24-hour cable news television station, MSNBC. The station was launched on July 15, 1996, to compete with similar news outlets such as CNN. Microsoft also launched Slate, an online magazine edited by Michael Kinsley, which offered political and social commentary along with the cartoon Doonesbury. In an attempt to extend its reach in the consumer market, the company acquired WebTV, which enabled consumers to access the Web from their televisions. Microsoft entered the personal digital assistant (PDA) market in November with Windows CE 1.0, a new built-from-scratch version of their flagship operating system, designed to run on low-memory, low-performance machines, such as handhelds and other small computers. 1996 saw the release of Windows NT 4.0, which brought the Windows 95 GUI and Windows NT kernel together. While Microsoft largely failed to participate in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. In November 1996, Microsoft Office 97 was released, which is the first version to include Office Assistant. In 1997, Internet Explorer 4.0 was released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated that Microsoft had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows. Windows 95-98 desktop The year 1998 was significant in Microsoft's history, with Bill Gates appointing Steve Ballmer as president of Microsoft but remaining as Chair and CEO himself. The company released an update to the consumer version of Windows, Windows 98. Windows 98 came with Internet Explorer 4.0 SP1 (which had Windows Desktop Update bundled), and included new features from Windows 95 OSR 2.x including the FAT32 file system, and new features designed for Windows 98, such as support for multiple displays. Microsoft launched its Indian headquarters as well, which would eventually become the company's second largest after its U.S. headquarters. Finally, a great deal of controversy took place when a set of internal memos from the company were leaked on the Internet. These documents, colloquially referred to as \\"The Halloween Documents\\", were widely reported by the media and went into detail of the threats that free software / open source software poses to Microsoft's own software, previously voiced mainly by analysts and advocates of open source software. The documents also alluded to legal and other actions against Linux as well as other open source software. While Microsoft acknowledged the documents, it claimed that they are merely engineering studies. Despite this, some believe that these studies were used in the real strategies of the company. IT-Forum in Copenhagen in 2004 Microsoft, in 2000, released new products for all three lines of the company's flagship operating system, and saw the beginning of the end of one of its most prominent legal cases. On February 17, Microsoft released an update to its business line of software in Windows 2000. It provided a high level of stability similar to that of its Unix counterparts due to its usage of the Windows NT kernel, and matching features found in the consumer line of the Windows operating system including a DOS emulator that could run many legacy DOS applications. On April 3, 2000, a judgment was handed down in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp., homepage at the United States Department of Justice calling the company an \\"abusive monopoly\\" and forcing the company to split into two separate units. Part of this ruling was later overturned by a federal appeals court, and eventually settled with the U.S. Department of Justice in 2001. On June 15, 2000, the company released a new version of its hand-held operating system, Windows CE 3.0. The main change was the new programming APIs of the software. Previous versions of Windows CE supported only a small subset of the WinAPI, the main development library for Windows, and with Version 3 of Windows CE, the operating system now supported nearly all of the core functionality of the WinAPI. The next update to the consumer line, Windows ME (or Windows Millennium Edition), was released on September 14, 2000. It sported several new features such as enhanced multimedia abilities and consumer-oriented PC maintenance options, but is often regarded as one of the worst versions of Windows due to stability problems, restricted real mode DOS support and other issues. Windows XP introduced a new interface, along with many other new features. This screenshot shows Windows XP Professional.Microsoft released Windows XP and Office XP in 2001, a version that aimed to encompass the features of both its business and home product lines. The release included an updated version of the Windows 2000 kernel, enhanced DOS emulation abilities, and many of the home-user features found in previous consumer versions. XP introduced a new graphical user interface, the first such change since Windows 95. The operating system was the first to require Microsoft Product Activation, an anti-piracy mechanism that requires users to activate the software with Microsoft within 30 days. Later, Microsoft would enter the multibillion-dollar game console market dominated by Sony and Nintendo, with the release of the Xbox. The Xbox finished behind the dominant PlayStation 2 selling 24 million units compared to 155 million overall; however they managed to outsell the GameCube which sold 21 million units. Microsoft launched their second console, the Xbox 360, in 2005 ‚Äì which was more successful than the original. By 2017 the Xbox 360 had sold 84 million units but failed to outsell its main rival the PlayStation 3 which sold 87 million units when discontinued.. The console was also outsold by the Wii which introduced gesture control and opened up a new market for video games. Microsoft later used their popular controller-free Kinect peripheral to increase the popularity of the Xbox. This was very successful. Kinect was the fastest selling consumer electronics product in history. It sold 8 million units from November 4, 2010, to January 3, 2011, (its first 60 days). It averaged 133,333 units per day, outselling the iPhone and iPad over equivalent post-launch periods. In 2002, Microsoft launched the .NET initiative, along with new versions of some of its development products, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. The initiative has been an entirely new development API for Windows programming, and included a new programming language, C#. Windows Server 2003 was launched, featuring enhanced administration abilities, such as new user interfaces to server tools. In 2004, the company released Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, a version of Windows XP designed for multimedia abilities, and Windows XP Starter Edition, a version of Windows XP with a smaller feature set designed for entry-level consumers. However, Microsoft encountered more turmoil in March 2004 when antitrust legal action would be brought against it by the European Union for allegedly abusing its market dominance (see Microsoft Corp v Commission). Eventually Microsoft was fined ‚Ç¨497 million (US$613 million), ordered to divulge certain protocols to competitors, and to produce a new version of its Windows XP platform‚Äîcalled Windows XP Home Edition N‚Äîthat did not include its Windows Media Player. (from the official EU website) Microsoft was also ordered to produce separate packages of Windows after South Korea also landed a settlement against the company in 2005. It had to pay out US$32 million and produce more than one version of Windows for the country in the same vein as the European Union-one with Windows Media Player and Windows Messenger and one without the two programs. In guise of competing with other Internet Companies such as the search service Google, in 2005 Microsoft announced a new version of its MSN search service. Later, in 2006, the company launched Microsoft adCenter, a service that offers pay per click advertisements, in an effort to further develop their search marketing revenue. Soon afterward, Microsoft created the CodePlex collaborative development site for hosting open source projects. Activity grew quickly as developers from around the world began to participate, and by early 2007 commercial open source companies, such as Aras Corp. began to offer enterprise open source software exclusively on the Microsoft platform. On June 15, 2006, Bill Gates announced his plans for a two-year transition period out of a day-to-day role with Microsoft until July 31, 2008. After that date, Gates will continue in his role as the company's chairman, head of the board of directors and act as an adviser on key projects. His role as Chief Software Architect will be filled immediately by Ray Ozzie, the Chief Technical Officer of the company as of June 15, 2006. Bill Gates stated \\"My announcement is not a retirement ‚Äì it's a reordering of my priorities.\\" 2007‚Äì2011: Microsoft Azure, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Microsoft Stores Formerly codenamed \\"Longhorn\\" in the early development stages, Windows Vista was released to consumers on January 30, 2007. Microsoft also released a new version of its Office suite, called Microsoft Office 2007, alongside Windows Vista. Windows Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008, the next versions of the company's server operating system and development suite, respectively, were released on February 27, 2008. Windows Vista was criticized for being heavy and needing large amounts of power to run the desktop widgets and the Aero theme. Many people continued to use Windows XP for many years after, due to its stability and low processing needs. On December 19, 2007, Microsoft signed a five-year, $500 million contract with Viacom that included content sharing and advertisements. The deal allowed Microsoft to license many shows from Viacom owned cable television and film studios for use on Xbox Live and MSN. The deal also made Viacom a preferred publisher partner for casual game development and distribution through MSN and Windows. On the advertisement side of the deal, Microsoft's Atlas ad-serving division became the exclusive provider of previously unsold advertising inventory on Viacom owned web sites. Microsoft also purchased a large amount of advertising on Viacom owned broadcasts and online networks, and collaborated on promotions and sponsorships for MTV and BET award shows, two Viacom owned cable networks. In 2008, Microsoft wanted to purchase Yahoo (first completely, later partially) in order to strengthen its position on the search engine market vis-√†-vis Google. The company rejected the offer, saying that it undervalued the company. In response, Microsoft withdrew its offer. In 2009, the opening show of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was hosted by Steve Ballmer for the first time. In past years, it has been hosted by Bill Gates. During the show, Ballmer announced the first public Beta Test of Windows 7 for partners and developers on January 8, but also for the general public two days later. On June 26, 2009, Microsoft started taking pre-orders at a discounted price for Windows 7 which was launched on October 22, 2009. Windows 7 has several editions, which acknowledge the rise of netbook computers with reduced processing power. On April 12, 2010, Microsoft launched their Kin phone line, a result of their acquisition of Danger Incorporated in 2008. The phones became available May 14, 2010, but were discontinued within two months because of poor sales. On May 10, 2011, the company acquired Skype Technologies for US$8.5 billion. 2011‚Äì2014: Windows 8, Xbox One, Outlook.com, and Surface devices Following the release of Windows Phone, Microsoft underwent a gradual rebranding of its product range throughout 2011 and 2012‚Äîthe corporation's logos, products, services and websites adopted the principles and concepts of the Metro design language. Microsoft previewed Windows 8, an operating system designed to power both personal computers and tablet computers, in Taipei in June 2011. A developer preview was released on September 13, and was replaced by a consumer preview on February 29, 2012. On May 31, 2012, the preview version was released. On June 18, 2012, Microsoft unveiled the Surface, the first computer in the company's history to have its hardware made by Microsoft. On June 25, Microsoft paid US$1.2 billion to buy the social network Yammer. On July 31, 2012, Microsoft launched the Outlook.com webmail service to compete with Gmail.

On October 1, Microsoft announced its intention to launch a news operation, part of a new-look MSN, at the time of the Windows 8 launch that was later in the month. On October 26, 2012, Microsoft launched Windows 8 and the Microsoft Surface.Eichenwald, Kurt, \\"Microsoft's Lost Decade: How Microsoft Lost Its Mojo\\" , Vanity Fair, August 2012 Three days later, Windows Phone 8 was launched. To cope with the potential for an increase in demand for products and services, Microsoft opened a number of \\"holiday stores\\" across the U.S. to complement the increasing number of \\"bricks-and-mortar\\" Microsoft Stores that opened in 2012. On March 29, 2013, Microsoft launched a Patent Tracker. The Kinect, a motion-sensing input device made by Microsoft and designed as a video game controller, was first introduced in November 2010, and was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One video game console. Kinect's capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra- wide 1080p camera, which can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor. It employs higher-end processing power and new software, can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. Microsoft filed a patent application in 2011 that suggests that the corporation may use the Kinect camera system to monitor the behavior of television viewers as part of a plan to make the viewing experience more interactive. On July 19, 2013, Microsoft stocks suffered its biggest one-day percentage sell-off since the year 2000 after its fourth-quarter report raised concerns among the investors on the poor showings of both Windows 8 and the Surface tablet; with more than 11 percentage points declining Microsoft suffered a loss of more than US$32 billion. For the 2010 fiscal year, Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division and Entertainment and Devices Division. On September 3, 2013, Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's mobile unit for $7 billion. Also in 2013, Amy Hood became the CFO of Microsoft. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Microsoft was part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also included Facebook, Intel and Google. Led by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. In line with the maturing PC business, in July 2013, Microsoft announced that it would reorganize the business into four new business divisions by function: Operating System, Apps, Cloud, and Devices. All previous divisions were diluted into new divisions without any workforce cuts. 2014‚Äìpresent: Windows 10, Windows 10 Mobile, Microsoft Edge and HoloLens On February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer stepped down as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who previously led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division. On the same day, John W. Thompson took on the role of chairman, with Bill Gates stepping down from the position, while continuing to participate as a technology advisor.

On July 29, 2015, Microsoft released the next version of the Windows operating system, Windows 10. The successor to Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 10 Mobile, was released November 20, 2015. In Q1 2015, Microsoft was the third largest maker of mobile phones selling 33 million units (7.2% of all), while a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) were made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft). Microsoft's share of the U.S. smartphone market in January 2016 was 2.7%. On March 1, 2016, Microsoft announced the merge of its PC and Xbox divisions, with Phil Spencer announcing that Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps would be the focus for Microsoft's gaming in the future.

On June 8, 2017, Microsoft acquired Hexadite, an Israeli security firm, for $100 million. In August 2018, Toyota Tsusho began a partnership with Microsoft to create fish farming tools using the Microsoft Azure application suite for IoT technologies related to water management. Developed in part by researchers from Kindai University, the water pump mechanisms use artificial intelligence to count the number of fish on a conveyor belt, analyze the number of fish, and deduce the effectiveness of water flow from the data the fish provide. The specific computer programs used in the process fall under the Azure Machine Learning and the Azure IoT Hub platforms. On October 8, 2017, Joe Belfiore announced that work on Windows 10 Mobile was drawing to a close due to lack of market penetration and resultant lack of interest from app developers. On October 10, 2018, Microsoft joined the Open Invention Network community despite holding more than 60,000 patents. On October 15, 2018, Paul Allen the co-founder of Microsoft died after complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In November 2018, Microsoft agreed to supply 100,000 HoloLens headsets to the United States military in order to \\"increase lethality by enhancing the ability to detect, decide and engage before the enemy.\\" In December 2018, Microsoft announced Project Mu, an open source release of the UEFI core used in Microsoft Surface and Hyper-V products. The project promotes the idea of Firmware as a Service. In the same month, Microsoft announced the open source implementation of Windows Forms and the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) which will allow for further movement of the company toward the transparent release of key frameworks used in developing Windows desktop applications and software.

The Willamette River forms its eastern boundary, separating it from the Lloyd District and the Kerns and Buckman neighborhoods. It includes the Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District and the Portland New Chinatown/Japantown Historic District, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has been referred to as the \\"skid row\\" of Portland. In the Northwest section, NW Broadway forms the western boundary, separating it from the Pearl District, and W Burnside Street forms the southern boundary, separating it from Downtown Portland. In the Southwest section, the neighborhood extends from SW 3rd Avenue east to the river and from SW Stark Street north to W Burnside Street (with the exception of areas south of SW Pine Street and west of SW 2nd Avenue, and south of SW Oak Street and west of SW 1st Avenue, which are part of Downtown). Despite the name, most Chinese-Americans and Chinese immigrants had already moved out by the time the city officially reworked the area as an official Chinatown in the 1980s; the increase in property values following the renovations drove out many of the remaining Chinese immigrants, with 82nd Ave in East Portland becoming the new unofficial Chinatown.Asian American community in east Portland's New Chinatown ponders the futurePortland's Old Chinatown is Fading‚ÄîWe Visited Every Chinese Restaurant That's Still There Old Town is well known as the primary homeless district of Portland. The Oregonian reports homelessness, open drug use and crime and the associated image problem of dirtiness and danger perception of danger and dirtiness that accompanies them were deterring factors to development. One prominent developer told the newspaper ‚Äútransient activity‚Äù is \\"perhaps the foremost deterrent\\" to developing in this neighborhood. Transportation The neighborhood is well-served by various modes of transportation. Amtrak's Union Station and the Greyhound bus station are located in the northwestern portion of the neighborhood. The Broadway Bridge marks the northern tip, and the ends of the Steel and Burnside bridges are along the area's eastern border. The MAX Light Rail line turns south into the neighborhood from the Steel Bridge and stops at Old Town/Chinatown, Skidmore Fountain, and Oak Street/Southwest 1st Avenue; the system connects the neighborhood to Northeast and North Portland across the Willamette, and to Downtown Portland to the south and west. The Portland Mall begins at the Greyhound station, providing local bus and light rail service along 5th and 6th Avenues south into downtown. Old Town Old Town was the original urban core of Portland. It straddles West Burnside Street and includes an area under the Burnside Bridge. The Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District, created in 1975 and roughly bounded by Naito Parkway, Everett Street, 3rd Avenue, and Oak Street, is an important part of Old Town Portland. Attractions include the Saturday Market; the Shanghai tunnels; and Ankeny Square, site of Portland's oldest public art work, the Skidmore Fountain (dedicated September 22, 1888). The fountain, designed by Olin L. Warner of New York, is named after pioneer druggist Stephen G. Skidmore. Naito Parkway (ex-Front Avenue) is named after the late Bill Naito, a longtime Old Town-based businessman and developer, who with his brother Sam Naito in the 1960s helped to halt the decline of the area‚Äîthen known as Portland's \\"Skid Road\\"‚Äîby opening a retail store, buying and restoring old buildings in the area, and convincing others to invest in the district over the next several years. Bill Naito died in 1996. Businesses located in Old Town include Dan and Louis Oyster Bar (in the same location since 1907) and Voodoo Doughnut. The area is the site of the 24 Hour Church of Elvis and formerly of attractions such as the Satyricon nightclub and the X-Ray Cafe. The Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1977, its national significance based on its historic importance as a major 19th-century west coast port, and also for its collection of cast-iron commercial architecture. and In 2016, Portland Mercury described the Old Town as a neighborhood \\"well known as Portland's primary homeless district.\\" Chinatown The Chinatown portion of Old Town extends north from West Burnside St. to Union Station. The entrance is marked by a China gate (built in 1986), complete with a pair of lions, at the corner of NW 4th Ave. and W Burnside St. The core of the area, from W Burnside St. to NW Glisan St. and from NW 5th Ave. to NW 3rd Ave., was designated in 1989 the New Chinatown/Japantown Historic District. When compared to the more well- known West Coast Chinatowns of Oakland and San Francisco in California and Vancouver, British Columbia, Portland's Chinatown is smaller and less active. It has more than two dozen Chinese-owned businesses, including restaurants such as the Republic Cafe, which opened in 1922 and is Portland's oldest Chinese restaurant and Good Taste, which serves Cantonese noodle soups and barbecued meats, gift and import shops, club houses, an herbal medicine store and an Asian food market. Other major organizations based in Chinatown include the Port of Portland, Oregon Department of Transportation's Portland offices and NW Natural Gas. There is also a parking structure with a helipad on top. In a step towards revitalization of the area, the Lan Su Chinese Garden opened September 14, 2000. The $12.8 million park covers an entire city block and was built by 65 artisans from Suzhou, China of imported materials (though all plants were grown locally). More recently, NW 3rd and 4th Avenues received streetscape improvements, including plaques describing historical features. Two block-long \\"festival streets\\" that can easily be used for street festivals were also created between these streets. In 2008, Uwajimaya anchored a redevelopment proposal, similar to the Uwajimaya Village in Seattle's Chinatown-International District. It would host the store, an underground parking garage, mixed-income apartments, and other small retailers. It was hoped to revitalize the area and bring in more tourists. In August 2011, Uwajimaya decided not to put a store in Chinatown because its stores in downtown Seattle and Renton, Washington are not meeting their potentials. Japantown history Prior to World War II, the area that is today called Chinatown was Portland's Japantown. Beginning in the 1890s, many Japanese immigrants were processed through Portland, creating a demand for hotels, bathhouses, and other services. Businesses that formed in the city's Japantown thrived in the low-rent areas near the river. Before World War II, the Japantown in the Northwest District was home to more than 100 businesses, and was Oregon's largest Japantown. Today the Japanese American Historical Plaza and the Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center in what is today Portland's Chinatown serve as reminders of what was once Portland's Japantown.  Translation of street names  The street signs in Chinatown are both English and Chinese. The Chinese on the signs is written in traditional characters, and its pronunciation is Cantonese. * W Burnside Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Couch Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Davis Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Everett Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Fifth Avenue ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Flanders Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Fourth Avenue ‚Äî ‚Äî (pictured) * NW Glisan Street ‚Äî ‚Äî * NW Third Avenue ‚Äî ‚Äî See also * List of National Historic Landmarks in Oregon * List of Oregon's Most Endangered Places * National Register of Historic Places listings in Multnomah County, Oregon * Pensole References External links * Old Town/Chinatown information from Old Town Chinatown Neighborhood Association * Self-Guided Walking Tour of Portland's Chinatown from Travel Portland * National Historic Landmark Nomination for Skidmore/Old Town Historic District * Portland's Chinatown History and Resources from Friends of Portland Chinatown *Old Town-Chinatown Street Tree Inventory Report Category:1975 establishments in Oregon Portland, Oregon Category:National Historic Landmarks in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Oregon Category:Neighborhoods in Portland, Oregon Category:Northwest Portland, Oregon Category:Oregon's Most Endangered Places Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon Category:Tourist attractions in Portland, Oregon ","title":"Old Town Chinatown"},{"id":"4240100","title":"Ohio's 18th congressional district"},{"id":"4240122","text":"A charter issued by Gisulf II of Salerno in 1054. Vatican City, Archivio Segreto Vaticano, Archivio Boncompagni, Prot. 270, 2a Gisulf II (also spelled Gisulph, Latin Gisulphus or Gisulfus, and Italian Gisulfo or Gisolfo) was the last Lombard prince of Salerno (1052‚Äì1077). Gisulf was the eldest son and successor of Guaimar IV and Gemma, daughter of the Capuan count Laidulf. He appears as a villain and a pirate in the chronicle of Amatus of Montecassino, Ystoire de li Normant. Historian John Julius Norwich (The Normans in the South pg. 201n) speaks \\"of one unfortunate victim [an Amalfitan] whom Gisulf kept in an icy dungeon, removing first his right eye and then every day one more of his fingers and toes. He [Amatus] adds that the Empress Agnes--who was spending much of her time in South Italy--personally offered a hundred pounds of gold and one of her own fingers in ransom, but her prayers went unheard.\\" He was made co-prince with his father in 1042 while very young and, only a decade later, his father was assassinated in the harbour of his capital by four brothers, sons of Pandulf V of Capua and inlaws of Guaimar, who had been goaded into the act by the Byzantine partisans of Amalfi. Young Gisulf was taken captive by the assassins, but soon his uncle, Guy, the duke of Sorrento, had garnered a Norman army and was besieging Salerno. Guy took captive the assassins' families and negotiated the freedom of Gisulf. Soon the city had surrendered and Guy and the Normans paid homage to Gisulf, who confirmed their titles and lands. The rocky start to his reign was merely an indication of its character, for Gisulf held a grudge against the Amalfitans who initiated the slaying of his father. He also, for reasons unknown, came to hate the Normans as barbarians and spent his whole reign in opposition to them. His enmity with the Normans soon cost him. Robert Guiscard sallied forth from his Calabrian castle at San Marco and captured the Salernitan town of Cosenza and several of its neighbours. Gisulf soon raised the ire of Count Richard I of Aversa and, only by alliance with the despised Almafitans, could he retain his throne. The predations of William, Count of the Principate, a brother of Guiscard, forced him to marry his sister Sichelgaita to Guiscard in return for protection, and eventually his sister Gaitelgrima to Jordan, the son of Richard, recently prince of Capua. In 1071, he and Richard of Capua threw their support behind a rebellion of Abelard of Hauteville and Herman of Hauteville, nephews of Robert Guiscard, and several other minor lords against Guiscard's authority in his duchy of Apulia. The rising accomplished little but to further irritate his powerful brother-in-law. In his later years, his fleets turned to piracy, especially against Amalfi and even Pisa. The latter's merchants, when called on to serve Pope Gregory VII on behalf of the Marchioness Matilda of Tuscany, caused such a stir with Gisulf that the latter was sent to Rome by the pope and the army--assembled to march on Robert Guiscard's domain--dispersed. Having alienated his papal ally, he was more isolated than ever when, in the summer of 1076, his city was besieged by Richard of Capua and Robert Guiscard. Though he had wisely ordered his citizens to store up two years worth of food, he confiscated enough of it to continue his life of luxury that the citizenry was soon starving. On 13 December, the city submitted and the prince and his men retreated to the citadel, which fell in May of the next year. Gisulf's lands and relics were taken, and he went, free, to Capua, where he tried to incite Richard to war with Robert, but to no effect. He went on to Rome to notify the pope of his and Salerno's misfortunes and there he slowly faded out of view. Pope Gregory gave him military command of the Campania and sent him to France, but he was recalled on the pope's death in 1085. He allied with Jordan I of Capua in support of Desiderius of Benevento, who was duly elected as Pope Victor III. He was briefly made duke of Amalfi (March 1088 - 20 April 1089) by the citizens of that city to protect them from the invasions of Robert Guiscard, but he was dead by 1090. He left no children by his wife Gemma, whom he apparently repudiated. References *Chalandon, Ferdinand. Histoire de la domination normande en Italie et en Sicilie.
